the deep range arthur c clarke a signet book published by the new american library for mike who led me to the sea contents part one the apprentice part two the warden part three the bureaucrat authors note in this novel i have made certain assumptions about the maximum size of various marine animals which may be challenged by some biologists i do not think however that they will meet much criticism from underwater explorers who have often encountered fish several times the size of the largest recorded specimens for an account of heron island as it is today seventyfive years before the opening of this story i refer the reader to the coast of coral and i hope that the university of queensland will appreciate my slight extrapolation of its existing facilities all the characters in this story are fictitious except the giant grouper in chapter three part one the apprentice one there was a killer loose on the range the south pacific air patrol had seen the great corpse staining the sea crimson as it wallowed in the waves within seconds the intricate warning system had been alerted from san francisco to brisbane men were moving counters and drawing range circles on the charts and don burley still rubbing the sleep from his eyes was hunched over the control board of scoutsub as it dropped down to the twentyfathom line he was glad that the alert was in his area it was the first real excitement for months even as he watched the instruments on which his life depended his mind was ranging far ahead what could have happened the brief message had given no details it had merely reported a freshly killed right whale lying on the surface about ten miles behind the main herd which was still proceeding north in panicstricken flight the obvious assumption was that somehow a pack of killer whales had managed to penetrate the barriers protecting the range if that was so don and all his fellow wardens were in for a busy time the pattern of green lights on the telltale board was a glowing symbol of security as long as that pattern was unchanged as long as none of those emerald stars winked to red all was well with don and his tiny craft airfuelpowerthis was the triumvirate that ruled his life if any one of these failed he would be sinking in a steel coffin down toward the pelagic ooze as johnnie tyndall had done the season before last but there was no reason why they should fail and the accidents one foresaw don told himself reassuringly were never those that happened he leaned across the tiny control board and spoke into the mike sub was still close enough to the mother ship for radio to work but before long hed have to switch to the ultrasonics setting course speed knots depth fathoms full sonar coverage estimated time to target area minutes will report at tenminute intervals until contact is made that is all out the acknowledgment from the rorqual was barely audible and don switched off the set it was time to look around he dimmed the cabin lights so that he could see the scanner screen more clearly pulled the polaroid glasses down over his eyes and peered into the depths it took a few seconds for the two images to fuse together in his mind then the d display sprang into stereoscopic life this was the moment when don felt like a god able to hold within his hands a circle of the pacific twenty miles across and to see clear down to the still largely unexplored depths two thousand fathoms below the slowly rotating beam of inaudible sound was searching the world in which he floated seeking out friend and foe in the eternal darkness where light could never penetrate the pattern of soundless shrieks too shrill even for the hearing of the bats who had invented sonar millions of years before man pulsed out into the watery night the faint echoes came tingling back were captured and amplified and became floating bluegreen flecks on the screen through long practice don could read their message with effortless ease five hundred feet below stretching out to the limits of his submerged horizon was the scattering layer the blanket of life that covered half the world the sunken meadow of the sea it rose and fell with the passage of the sun hovering always at the edge of darkness during the night it had floated nearly to the surface but the dawn was now driving it back into the depths it was no obstacle to his sonar don could see clear through its tenuous substance to the ooze of the pacific floor over which he was driving high as a cloud above the land but the ultimate depths were no concern of his the flocks he guarded and the enemies who ravaged them belonged to the upper levels of the sea don flicked the switch of the depth selector and his sonar beam concentrated itself into the horizontal plane the glimmering echoes from the abyss vanished and he could see more clearly what lay around him here in the oceans stratospheric heights that glowing cloud two miles ahead was an unusually large school of fish he wondered if base knew about it and made an entry in his log there were some larger blips at the edge of the schoolthe carnivores pursuing the cattle ensuring that the endlessly turning wheel of life and death would never lose momentum but this conflict was no affair of dons he was after bigger game sub drove on toward the west a steel needle swifter and more deadly than any other creature that roamed the seas the tiny cabin now lit only by the flicker of lights from the instrument board pulsed with power as the spinning turbines thrust the water aside don glanced at the chart and noted that he was already halfway to the target area he wondered if he should surface to have a look at the dead whale from its injuries he might be able to learn something about its assailants but that would mean further delay and in a case like this time was vital the longrange receiver bleeped plaintively and don switched over to transcribe he had never learned to read code by ear as some people could do but the ribbon of paper emerging from the message slot saved him the trouble air patrol reports school whales heading degrees grid ref x y stop moving at speed after change of course stop no sign of orcas but presume they are in vicinity stop rorqual don considered this last piece of deduction highly unlikely if the orcasthe dreaded killer whaleshad indeed been responsible they would surely have been spotted by now as they surfaced to breathe moreover they would never have let the patrolling plane scare them away from their victim but would have remained feasting on it until they had gorged themselves one thing was in his favor the frightened herd was now heading almost directly toward him don started to set the coordinates on the plotting grid then saw that it was no longer necessary at the extreme edge of his screen a flotilla of faint stars had appeared he altered course slightly and drove head on to the approaching school part of the message was certainly correct the whales were moving at unusually high speed at the rate they were traveling he would be among them in five minutes he cut the motors and felt the backward tug of the water bringing him swiftly to rest don burley a knight in armor sat in his tiny dimlit room a hundred feet below the bright pacific waves testing his weapons for the conflict that lay ahead in these moments of poised suspense before action began he often pictured himself thus though he would have admitted it to no one in the world he felt too a kinship with all shepherds who had guarded their flocks back to the dawn of time not only was he sir lancelot he was also david among ancient palestinian hills alert for the mountain lions that would prey upon his fathers sheep yet far nearer in time and far closer in spirit were the men who had marshaled the great herds of cattle on the american plains scarcely three lifetimes ago they would have understood his work though his implements would have been magic to them the pattern was the same only the scale of things had altered it made no fundamental difference that the beasts don herded weighed a hundred tons and browsed on the endless savannas of the sea the school was now less than two miles away and don checked his scanners steady circling to concentrate on the sector ahead the picture on the screen altered to a fanshaped wedge as the sonar beam started to flick from side to side now he could count every whale in the school and could even make a good estimate of its size with a practiced eye he began to look for stragglers don could never have explained what drew him at once toward those four echoes at the southern fringe of the school it was true that they were a little apart from the rest but others had fallen as far behind there is some sixth sense that a man acquires when he has stared long enough into a sonar screensome hunch which enables him to extract more from the moving flecks than he has any right to do without conscious thought don reached for the controls and started the turbines whirling once more the main body of the whale pack was now sweeping past him to the east he had no fear of a collision the great animals even in their panic could sense his presence as easily as he could detect them and by similar means he wondered if he should switch on his beacon they might recognize its sound pattern and it would reassure them but the still unknown enemy might recognize it too and would be warned the four echoes that had attracted his attention were almost at the center of the screen he closed for an interception and hunched low over the sonar display as if to drag from it by sheer will power every scrap of information the scanner could give there were two large echoes some distance apart and one was accompanied by a pair of smaller satellites don wondered if he was already too late in his minds eye he could picture the death struggle taking place in the water less than a mile ahead those two fainter blips would be the enemy worrying a whale while its mate stood by in helpless terror with no weapons of defense except its mighty flukes now he was almost close enough for vision the tv camera in sub s prow strained through the gloom but at first could show nothing but the fog of plankton then a vast shadowy shape appeared in the center of the screen with two smaller companions below it don was seeing with the greater precision but hopelessly limited range of light what the sonar scanners had already told him almost at once he saw his incredible mistake the two satellites were calves it was the first time he had ever met a whale with twins although multiple births were not uncommon in normal circumstances the sight would have fascinated him but now it meant that he had jumped to the wrong conclusion and had lost precious minutes he must begin the search again as a routine check he swung the camera toward the fourth blip on the sonar screenthe echo he had assumed from its size to be another adult whale it is strange how a preconceived idea can affect a mans understanding of what he sees seconds passed before don could interpret the picture before his eyesbefore he knew that after all he had come to the right place jesus he said softly i didnt know they grew that big it was a shark the largest he had ever seen its details were still obscured but there was only one genus it could belong to the whale shark and the basking shark might be of comparable size but they were harmless herbivores this was the king of all selachianscarcharodonthe great white shark don tried to recall the figures for the largest known specimen in or thereabouts a fiftyfooter had been killed off new zealand but this one was half as big again these thoughts flashed through his mind in an instant and in that same moment he saw that the great beast was already maneuvering for the kill it was heading for one of the calves and ignoring the frantic mother whether this was cowardice or common sense there was no way of telling perhaps such distinctions were meaningless to the sharks tiny and utterly alien mind there was only one thing to do it might spoil his chance of a quick kill but the calfs life was more important he punched the button of the siren and a brief mechanical scream erupted into the water around him shark and whales were equally terrified by the deafening shriek the shark jerked round in an impossibly tight curve and don was nearly jolted out of his seat as the autopilot snapped the sub onto a new course twisting and turning with an agility equal to that of any other sea creature of its size sub began to close in upon the shark its electronic brain automatically following the sonar echo and thus leaving don free to concentrate on his armament he needed that freedom the next operation was going to be difficult unless he could hold a steady course for at least fifteen seconds at a pinch he could use his tiny rocket torps to make a kill had he been alone and faced with a pack of orcas he would certainly have done so but that was messy and brutal and there was a neater way he had always preferred the technique of the rapier to that of the hand grenade now he was only fifty feet away and closing rapidly there might never be a better chance he punched the launching stud from beneath the belly of the sub something that looked like a sting ray hurtled forward don had checked the speed of his own craft there was no need to come any closer now the tiny arrowshaped hydrofoil only a couple of feet across could move far faster than his vessel and would close the gap in seconds as it raced forward it spun out the thin line of the control wire like some underwater spider laying its thread along that wire passed the energy that powered the sting and the signals that steered the missile to its goal it responded so instantly to his orders that don felt he was controlling some sensitive highspirited steed the shark saw the danger less than a second before impact the resemblance of the sting to an ordinary ray confused it as the designers had intended before the tiny brain could realize that no ray behaved like this the missile had struck the steel hypodermic rammed forward by an exploding cartridge drove through the sharks horny skin and the great fish erupted in a frenzy of terror don backed rapidly away for a blow from that tail would rattle him around like a pea in a can and might even damage the sub there was nothing more for him to do except to wait while the poison did its work the doomed killer was trying to arch its body so that it could snap at the poisoned dart don had now reeled the sting back into its slot amidships pleased that he had been able to retrieve the missile undamaged he watched with awe and a dispassionate pity as the great beast succumbed to its paralysis its struggles were weakening it was now swimming aimlessly back and forth and once don had to sidestep smartly to avoid a collision as it lost control of buoyancy the dying shark drifted up to the surface don did not bother to follow that could wait until he had attended to more important business he found the cow and her two calves less than a mile away and inspected them carefully they were uninjured so there was no need to call the vet in his highly specialized twoman sub which could handle any cetological crisis from a stomachache to a caesarean the whales were no longer in the least alarmed and a check on the sonar had shown that the entire school had ceased its panicky flight he wondered if they already knew what had happened much had been learned about their methods of communication but much more was still a mystery i hope you appreciate what ive done for you old lady he muttered then reflecting that fifty tons of mother love was a slightly aweinspiring sight he blew his tanks and surfaced it was calm so he opened the hatch and popped his head out of the tiny conning tower the water was only inches below his chin and from time to time a wave made a determined effort to swamp him there was little danger of this happening for he fitted the hatch so closely that he was quite an effective plug fifty feet away a long gray mound like an overturned boat was rolling on the surface don looked at it thoughtfully wondering how much compressed air hed better squirt into the corpse to prevent it sinking before one of the tenders could reach the spot in a few minutes he would radio his report but for the moment it was pleasant to drink the fresh pacific breeze to feel the open sky above his head and to watch the sun begin its long climb toward noon don burley was the happy warrior resting after the one battle that man would always have to fight he was holding at bay the specter of famine which had confronted all earlier ages but which would never threaten the world again while the great plankton farms harvested their millions of tons of protein and the whale herds obeyed their new masters man had come back to the sea his ancient home after aeons of exile until the oceans froze he would never be hungry again yet that don knew was the least of his satisfactions even if what he was doing had been of no practical value he would still have wished to do it nothing else that life could offer matched the contentment and the calm sense of power that filled him when he set out on a mission such as this power yes that was the right word but it was not a power that would ever be abused he felt too great a kinship with all the creatures who shared the seas with himeven those it was his duty to destroy to all appearances don was completely relaxed yet had any one of the many dials and lights filling his field of view called for attention he would have been instantly alert his mind was already back on the rorqual and he found it increasingly hard to keep his thoughts away from his overdue breakfast in order to make the time pass more swiftly he started mentally composing his report quite a few people he knew were going to be surprised by it the engineers who maintained the invisible fences of sound and electricity which now divided the mighty pacific into manageable portions would have to start looking for the break the marine biologists who were so confident that sharks never attacked whales would have to think up excuses both enterprises don was quite sure would be successfully carried out and then everything would be under control again until the sea contrived its next crisis but the crisis to which don was now unwittingly returning was a manmade one organized without any malice toward him at the highest official levels it had begun with a suggestion in the space department duly referred up to the world secretariat it had risen still higher until it reached the world assembly itself where it had come to the approving ears of the senators directly interested thus converted from a suggestion to an order it had filtered down through the secretariat to the world food organization thence to the marine division and finally to the bureau of whales the whole process had taken the incredibly short time of four weeks don of course knew nothing of this as far as he was concerned the complicated workings of global bureaucracy resolved themselves into the greeting his skipper gave him when he walked into the rorquals mess for his belated breakfast morning don headquarters wants you to run over to brisbanetheyve got some job for you hope it doesnt take too long you know how shorthanded we are what kind of a job asked don suspiciously he remembered an unfortunate occasion when he had acted as a guide to a permanent undersecretary who had seemed to be a bit of a fool and whom he had treated accordingly it had later turned out that the puas might have been guessed from his positionwas a very shrewd character indeed and knew exactly what don was doing they didnt tell me said the skipper im not quite sure they know themselves give my love to queensland and keep away from the casinos on the gold coast much choice i have on my pay snorted don last time i went to surfers paradise i was lucky to get away with my shirt but you brought back a couple of thousand on your first visit beginners luckit never happened again ive lost it all since then so ill stop while i still break even no more gambling for me is that a bet would you put five bucks on it sure then pay overyouve already lost by accepting a spoonful of processed plankton hovered momentarily in midair while don sought for a way out of the trap just try and get me to pay he retorted youve got no witnesses and im no gentleman he hastily swallowed the last of his coffee then pushed aside his chair and rose to go better start packing i suppose so long skippersee you later the captain of the rorqual watched his first warden sweep out of the room like a small hurricane for a moment the sound of dons passage echoed back along the ships corridors then comparative silence descended again the skipper started to head back to the bridge look out brisbane he muttered to himself then he began to rearrange the watches and to compose a masterly memorandum to hq asking how he was expected to run a ship when thirty percent of her crew were permanently absent on leave or special duty by the time he reached the bridge the only thing that had stopped him from resigning was the fact that try as he might he couldnt think of a better job two though he had been kept waiting only a few minutes walter franklin was already prowling impatiently around the reception room swiftly he examined and dismissed the deepsea photographs hanging on the walls then he sat for a moment on the edge of the table leafing through the pile of magazines reviews and reports which always accumulated in such places the popular magazines he had already seenfor the last few weeks he had had little else to do but readand few of the others looked interesting somebody he supposed had to go through these lavishly electro printed foodproduction reports as part of their job he wondered how they avoided being hypnotized by the endless columns of statistics neptune the house organ of the marine division seemed a little more promising but as most of the personalities discussed in its columns were unknown to him he soon became bored with it even its fairly lowbrow articles were largely over his head assuming a knowledge of technical terms he did not possess the receptionist was watching himcertainly noticing his impatience perhaps analyzing the nervousness and insecurity that lay behind it with a distinct effort franklin forced himself to sit down and to concentrate on yesterdays issue of the brisbane courier he had almost become interested in an editorial requiem on australian cricket inspired by the recent test results when the young lady who guarded the directors office smiled sweetly at him and said would you please go in now mr franklin he had expected to find the director alone or perhaps accompanied by a secretary the husky young man sitting in the other visitors chair seemed out of place in this orderly office and was staring at him with more curiosity than friendliness franklin stiffened at once they had been discussing him he knew and automatically he went on the defensive director gary who knew almost as much about human beings as he did about marine mammals sensed the strain immediately and did his best to dispel it ah there you are franklin he said with slightly excessive heartiness i hope youve been enjoying your stay here have my people been taking care of you franklin was spared the trouble of answering this question for the director gave him no time to reply i want you to meet don burley he continued dons first warden on the rorqual and one of the best weve got hes been assigned to look after you don meet walter franklin they shook hands warily weighing each other then dons face broke into a reluctant smile it was the smile of a man who had been given a job he didnt care for but who had decided to make the best of it pleased to meet you franklin he said welcome to the mermaid patrol franklin tried to smile at the hoary joke but his effort was not very successful he knew that he should be friendly and that these people were doing their best to help him yet the knowledge was that of the mind not the heart he could not relax and let himself meet them halfway the fear of being pitied and the nagging suspicion that they had been talking about him behind his back despite all the assurances he had been given paralyzed his will for friendliness don burley sensed nothing of this he only knew that the directors office was not the right place to get acquainted with a new colleague and before franklin was fully aware of what had happened he was out of the building buffeting his way through the shirtsleeved crowds in george street and being steered into a minute bar opposite the new post office the noise of the city subsided though through the tinted glass walls franklin could see the shadowy shapes of the pedestrians moving to and fro it was pleasantly cool here after the torrid streets whether or not brisbane should be airconditionedand if so who should have the resulting multimilliondollar contractwas still being argued by the local politicians and meanwhile the citizens sweltered every summer don burley waited until franklin had drunk his first beer and called for replacements there was a mystery about his new pupil and as soon as possible he intended to solve it someone very high up in the divisionperhaps even in the world secretariat itselfmust have organized this a first warden was not called away from his duties to wetnurse someone who was obviously too old to go through the normal training channels at a guess he would say that franklin was the wrong side of thirty he had never heard of anyone that age getting this sort of special treatment before one thing was obvious about franklin at once and that only added to the mystery he was a spaceman you could tell them a mile away that should make a good opening gambit then he remembered that the director had warned him dont ask franklin too many questions i dont know what his background is but weve been specifically told not to talk about it with him that might make sense mused don perhaps he was a space pilot who had been grounded after some inexcusable lapse such as absentmindedly arriving at venus when he should have gone to mars is this the first time don began cautiously that youve been to australia it was not a very fortunate opening and the conversation might have died there and then when franklin replied i was born here don however was not the sort of person who was easily abashed he merely laughed and said halfapologetically nobody ever tells me anything so i usually find out the hard way i was born on the other side of the worldover in irelandbut since ive been attached to the pacific branch of the bureau ive more or less adopted australia as a second home not that i spend much time ashore on this job youre at sea eighty per cent of the time a lot of people dont like that you know it would suit me said franklin but left the remark hanging in the air burley began to feel exasperatedit was such hard work getting anything out of this fellow the prospect of working with him for the next few weeks began to look very uninviting and don wondered what he had done to deserve such a fate however he struggled on manfully the superintendent tells me that youve a good scientific and engineering background so i can assume that youll know most of the things that our people spend the first year learning have they filled you in on the administrative background theyve given me a lot of facts and figures under hypnosis so i could lecture you for a couple of hours on the marine divisionits history organization and current projects with particular reference to the bureau of whales but it doesnt mean anything to me at present now we seem to be getting somewhere don told himself the fellow can talk after all a couple more beers and he might even be human thats the trouble with hypnotic training agreed don they can pump the information into you until it comes out of your ears but youre never quite sure how much you really know and they cant teach you manual skills or train you to have the right reactions in emergencies theres only one way of learning anything properlyand thats by actually doing the job he paused momentarily distracted by a shapely silhouette parading on the other side of the translucent wall franklin noticed the direction of his gaze and his features relaxed into a slight smile for the first time the tension lifted and don began to feel that there was some hope of establishing contact with the enigma who was now his responsibility with a beery forefinger don started to trace maps on the plastic table top this is the setup he began our main training center for shallowwater operations is here in the capricorn group about four hundred miles north of brisbane and forty miles out from the coast the south pacific fence starts here and runs on east to new caledonia and fiji when the whales migrate north from the polar feeding grounds to have their calves in the tropics theyre compelled to pass through the gaps weve left here the most important of these gates from our point of view is the one right here off the queensland coast at the southern entrance to the great barrier reef the reef provides a kind of natural channel averaging about fifty miles wide almost up to the equator once weve herded the whales into it we can keep them pretty well under control it didnt take much doing many of them used to come this way long before we appeared on the scene by now the rest have been so well conditioned that even if we switched off the fence it would probably make no difference to their migratory pattern by the way interjected franklin is the fence purely electrical oh no electric fields control fish pretty well but dont work satisfactorily on mammals like whales the fence is largely ultrasonica curtain of sound from a chain of generators half a mile below the surface we can get fine control at the gates by broadcasting specific orders you can set a whole herd stampeding in any direction you wish by playing back a recording of a whale in distress but its not very often we have to do anything drastic like that as i said nowadays theyre too well trained i can appreciate that said franklin in fact i heard somewhere that the fence was more for keeping other animals out than for keeping the whales in thats partly true though wed still need some kind of control for rounding up our herds at census or slaughtering even so the fence isnt perfect there are weak spots where generator fields overlap and sometimes we have to switch off sections to allow normal fish migration then the really big sharks or the killer whales can get through and play hell the killers are our worst problem they attack the whales when they are feeding in the antarctic and often the herds suffer ten per cent losses no one will be happy until the killers are wiped out but no one can think of an economical way of doing it we cant patrol the entire ice pack with subs though when ive seen what a killer can do to a whale ive often wished we could there was real feelingalmost passionin burleys voice and franklin looked at the warden with surprise the whaleboys as they had been inevitably christened by a nostalgically minded public in search of heroes were not supposed to be much inclined either to thought or emotions though franklin knew perfectly well that the tough uncomplicated characters who stalked tight lipped through the pages of contemporary submarine sagas had very little connection with reality it was hard to escape from the popular clichйs don burley it was true was far from tight lipped but in most other respects he seemed to fit the standard specification very well franklin wondered how he was going to get on with his new mentorindeed with his new job he still felt no enthusiasm for it whether that would come only time would show it was obviously full of interesting and even fascinating problems and possibilities and if it would occupy his mind and give him scope for his talents that was as much as he could hope for the long nightmare of the last year had destroyed with so much else his zest for lifethe capacity he had once possessed for throwing himself heart and soul into some project it was difficult to believe that he could ever recapture the enthusiasm that had once taken him so far along paths he could never tread again as he glanced at don who was still talking with the fluent lucidity of a man who knows and loves his job franklin felt a sudden and disturbing sense of guilt was it fair to burley to take him away from his work and to turn him whether he knew it or not into a cross between a nursemaid and kindergarten teacher had franklin realized that very similar thoughts had already crossed burleys mind his sympathy would have been quenched at once time we caught the shuttle to the airport said don looking at his watch and hastily draining his beer the morning flight leaves in thirty minutes i hope all your stuffs already been sent on the hotel said theyd take care of it well we can check at the airport lets go half an hour later franklin had a chance to relax again it was typical of burley he soon discovered to take things easily until the last possible moment and then to explode in a burst of activity this burst carried them from the quiet bar to the even more efficiently silenced plane as they took their seats there was a brief incident that was to puzzle don a good deal in the weeks that lay ahead you take the window seat he said ive flown this way dozens of times he took franklins refusal as ordinary politeness and started to insist not until franklin had turned down the offer several times with increasing determination and even signs of annoyance did burley realize that his companions behavior had nothing to do with common courtesy it seemed incredible but don could have sworn that the other was scared stiff what sort of man he wondered blankly would be terrified of taking a window seat in an ordinary aircraft all his gloomy premonitions about his new assignment which had been partly dispelled during their earlier conversation came crowding back with renewed vigor the city and the sunburned coast dropped below as the lifting jets carried them effortlessly up into the sky franklin was reading the paper with a fierce concentration that did not deceive burley for a moment he decided to wait for a while and apply some more tests later in the flight the glasshouse mountainsthose strangely shaped fangs jutting from the eroded plainswept swiftly beneath then came the little coastal towns through which the wealth of the immense farm lands of the interior had once passed to the world in the days before agriculture went to sea and thenonly minutes it seemed after takeoffthe first islands of the great barrier reef appeared like deeper shadows in the blue horizon mists the sun was shining almost straight into his eyes but dons memory could fill in the details which were lost in the glare from the burning waters he could see the low green islands surrounded by their narrow borders of sand and their immensely greater fringes of barely submerged coral against each islands private reef the waves of the pacific would be marching forever so that for a thousand miles into the north snowy crescents of foam would break the surface of the sea a century agofifty years evenscarcely a dozen of these hundreds of islands had been inhabited now with the aid of universal air transport together with cheap power and waterpurification plants both the state and the private citizen had invaded the ancient solitude of the reef a few fortunate individuals by means that had never been made perfectly clear had managed to acquire some of the smaller islands as their personal property the entertainment and vacation industry had taken over others and had not always improved on natures handiwork but the greatest landowner in the reef was undoubtedly the world food organization with its complicated hierarchy of fisheries marine farms and research departments the full extent of which it was widely believed no merely human brain could ever comprehend were nearly there said burley thats lady musgrave island weve just passedmain generators for the western end of the fence capricorn groups under us nowmasthead one tree northwest wilsonand heron in the middle with all those buildings on it the big tower is administrationthe aquariums by that pooland look you can see a couple of subs tied up at that long jetty leading out to the edge of the reef as he spoke don watched franklin out of the corner of his eye the other had leaned toward the window as if following his companions running commentary yet burley could swear that he was not looking at the panorama of reefs and islands spread out below his face was tense and strained there was an indrawn hooded expression in his eyes as if he was forcing himself to see nothing with a mingling of pity and contempt don understood the symptoms if not their cause franklin was terrified of heights so much then for the theory that he was a spaceman then what was he whatever the answer he hardly seemed the sort of person with whom one would wish to share the cramped quarters of a twoman training sub the planes shock absorbers touched down on the rectangle of scorched and flattened coral that was the heron island landing platform as he stepped out into the sunlight blinking in the sudden glare franklin seemed to make an abrupt recovery don had seen seasick passengers undergo equally swift transformations on their return to dry land if franklin is no better as a sailor than an airman he thought this crazy assignment wont last more than a couple of days and ill be able to get back to work not that don was in a great rush to return immediately heron island was a pleasant place where you could enjoy yourself if you knew how to deal with the red tape that always entangled headquarters establishments a light truck whisked them and their belongings along a road beneath an avenue of pisonia trees whose heavily leafed branches blocked all direct sunlight the road was less than a quarter of a mile long but it spanned the little island from the jetties and maintenance plants on the west to the administration buildings on the east the two halves of the island were partly insulated from each other by a narrow belt of jungle which had been carefully preserved in its virgin state and which don remembered sentimentally was full of interesting tracks and secluded clearings administration was expecting mr franklin and had made all the necessary arrangements for him he had been placed in a kind of privileged limbo one stage below the permanent staff like burley but several stages above the ordinary trainees under instruction surprisingly he had a room of his ownsomething that even senior members of the bureau could not always expect when they visited the island this was a great relief to don who had been afraid he might have to share quarters with his mysterious charge quite apart from any other factors that would have interfered badly with certain romantic plans of his own he saw franklin to his small but attractive room on the second floor of the training wing looking out across the miles of coral which stretched eastward all the way to the horizon in the courtyard below a group of trainees relaxing between classes was chatting with a second warden instructor whom don recognized from earlier visits but could not name it was a pleasant feeling he mused going back to school when you already knew all the answers you should be comfortable here he said to franklin who was busy unpacking his baggage quite a view isnt it such poetic ecstasies were normally foreign to dons nature but he could not resist the temptation of seeing how franklin would react to the leagues of coraldappled ocean that lay before him rather to his disappointment the reaction was quite conventional presumably franklin was not worried by a mere thirty feet of height he looked out of the window taking his time and obviously admiring the vista of blues and greens which led the eye out into the endless waters of the pacific serve you right don told himselfits not fair to tease the poor devil whatever hes got it cant be fun to live with ill leave you to get settled in said don backing out through the door lunch will be coming up in half an hour over at the messthat building we passed on the way in see you there franklin nodded absently as he sorted through his belongings and piled shirts and underclothes on the bed he wanted to be left alone while he adjusted himself to the new life which with no particular enthusiasm he had now accepted as his own burley had been gone for less than ten minutes when there was a knock on the door and a quiet voice said can i come in whos there asked franklin as he tidied up the debris and made his room look presentable dr myers the name meant nothing to franklin but his face twisted into a wry smile as he thought how appropriate it was that his very first visitor should be a doctor what kind of a doctor he thought he could guess myers was a stocky pleasantly ugly man in his early forties with a disconcertingly direct gaze which seemed somewhat at variance with his friendly affable manner sorry to butt in on you when youve only just arrived he said apologetically i had to do it now because im flying out to new caledonia this afternoon and wont be back for a week professor stevens asked me to look you up and give you his best wishes if theres anything you want just ring my office and well try to fix it for you franklin admired the skillful way in which myers had avoided all the obvious dangers he did not saytrue though it undoubtedly wasive discussed your case with professor stevens nor did he offer direct help he managed to convey the assumption that franklin wouldnt need it and was now quite capable of looking after himself i appreciate that said franklin sincerely he felt he was going to like dr myers and made up his mind not to resent the surveillance he would undoubtedly be getting tell me he added just what do the people here know about me nothing at all except that you are to be helped to qualify as a warden as quickly as possible this isnt the first time this sort of thing has happened you knowthere have been highpressure conversion courses before still its inevitable that there will be a good deal of curiosity about you that may be your biggest problem burley is dying of curiosity already mind if i give you some advice of course notgo ahead youll be working with don continually its only fair to him as well as to yourself to confide in him when you feel you can do so im sure youll find him quite understanding or if you prefer ill do the explaining franklin shook his head not trusting himself to speak it was not a matter of logic for he knew that myers was talking sense sooner or later it would all have to come out and he might be making matters worse by postponing the inevitable yet his hold upon sanity and selfrespect was still so precarious that he could not face the prospect of working with men who knew his secret however sympathetic they might be very well the choice is yours and well respect it good luckand lets hope all our contacts will be purely social long after myers had gone franklin sat on the edge of the bed staring out across the sea which would be his new domain he would need the luck that the other had wished him yet he was beginning to feel a renewed interest in life it was not merely that people were anxious to help him he had received more than enough help in the last few months at last he was beginning to see how he could help himself and so discover a purpose for his existence presently he jolted himself out of his daydream and looked at his watch he was already ten minutes late for lunch and that was a bad start for his new life he thought of don burley waiting impatiently in the mess and wondering what had happened to him coming teacher he said as he put on his jacket and started out of the room it was the first time he had made a joke with himself for longer than he could remember three when franklin first saw indra langenburg she was covered with blood up to her elbows and was busily hacking away at the entrails of a tenfoot tiger shark she had just disemboweled the huge beast was lying its pale belly upturned to the sun on the sandy beach where franklin took his morning promenade a thick chain still led to the hook in its mouth it had obviously been caught during the night and then left behind by the falling tide franklin stood for a moment looking at the unusual combination of attractive girl and dead monster then said thoughtfully you know this is not the sort of thing i like to see before breakfast exactly what are you doing a brown oval face with very serious eyes looked up at him the footlong razorsharp knife that was creating such havoc continued to slice expertly through gristle and guts im writing a thesis said a voice as serious as the eyes on the vitamin content of shark liver it means catching a lot of sharks this is my third this week would you like some teeth ive got plenty and they make nice souvenirs she walked to the head of the beast and inserted her knife in its gaping jaws which had been propped apart by a block of wood a quick jerk of her wrist and an endless necklace of deadly ivory triangles like a band saw made of bone started to emerge from the sharks mouth no thanks said franklin hastily hoping she would not be offended please dont let me interrupt your work he guessed that she was barely twenty and was not surprised at meeting an unfamiliar girl on the little island because the scientists at the research station did not have much contact with the administrative and training staff youre new here arent you said the bloodstained biologist sloshing a huge lump of liver into a bucket with every sign of satisfaction i didnt see you at the last hq dance franklin felt quite cheered by the inquiry it was so pleasant to meet someone who knew nothing about him and had not been speculating about his presence here he felt he could talk freely and without restraint for the first time since landing on heron island yesive just come for a special training course how long have you been here he was making pointless conversation just for the pleasure of the company and doubtless she knew it oh about a month she said carelessly there was another slimy squelching noise from the bucket which was now nearly full im on leave here from the university of miami youre american then franklin asked the girl answered solemnly no my ancestors were dutch burmese and scottish in about equal proportions just to make things a little more complicated i was born in japan franklin wondered if she was making fun of him but there was no trace of guile in her expression she seemed a really nice kid he thought but he couldnt stay here talking all day he had only forty minutes for breakfast and his morning class in submarine navigation started at nine he thought no more of the encounter for he was continually meeting new faces as his circles of acquaintances steadily expanded the highpressure course he was taking gave him no time for much social life and for that he was grateful his mind was fully occupied once more it had taken up the load with a smoothness that both surprised and gratified him perhaps those who had sent him here knew what they were doing better than he sometimes supposed all the empirical knowledgethe statistics the factual data the ins and outs of administrationhad been more or less painlessly pumped into franklin while he was under mild hypnosis prolonged question periods where he was quizzed by a tape recorder that later filled in the right answers then confirmed that the information had really taken and had not as sometimes happened shot straight through the mind leaving no permanent impression don burley had nothing to do with this side of franklins training but rather to his disgust had no chance of relaxing when franklin was being looked after elsewhere the chief instructor had gleefully seized this opportunity of getting don back into his clutches and had suggested with great tact and charm that when his other duties permitted don might like to lecture to the three courses now under training on the island outranked and outmaneuvered don had no alternative but to acquiesce with as good grace as possible this assignment it seemed was not going to be the holiday he had hoped in one respect however his worst fears had not materialized franklin was not at all hard to get on with as long as one kept completely away from personalities he was very intelligent and had clearly had a technical training that in some ways was much better than dons own it was seldom necessary to explain anything to him more than once and long before they had reached the stage of trying him out on the synthetic trainers don could see that his pupil had the makings of a good pilot he was skillful with his hands reacted quickly and accurately and had that indefinable poise which distinguishes the firstrate pilot from the merely competent one yet don knew that knowledge and skill were not in themselves sufficient something else was also needed and there was no way yet of telling if franklin possessed it not until don had watched his reactions as he sank down into the depths of the sea would he know whether all this effort was to be of any use there was so much that franklin had to learn that it seemed impossible that anyone could absorb it all in two months as the program insisted don himself had taken the normal six months and he somewhat resented the assumption that anyone else could do it in a third of the time even with the special coaching he was giving why the mechanical side of the job alonethe layout and design of the various classes of substook at least two months to learn even with the best of instructional aids yet at the same time he had to teach franklin the principles of seamanship and underwater navigation basic oceanography submarine signaling and communication and a substantial amount of ichthyology marine psychology and of course cetology so far franklin had never even seen a whale dead or alive and that first encounter was something that don looked forward to witnessing at such a moment one could learn all that one needed to know about a mans fitness for this job they had done two weeks hard work together before don first took franklin under water by this time they had established a curious relationship which was at once friendly and remote though they had long since ceased to call each other by their surnames don and walt was as far as their intimacy went burley still knew absolutely nothing about franklins past though he had evolved a good many theories the one which he most favored was that his pupil was an extremely talented criminal being rehabilitated after total therapy he wondered if franklin was a murderer which was a stimulating thought and half hoped that this exciting hypothesis was true franklin no longer showed any of the obvious peculiarities he had revealed on their first meeting though he was undoubtedly more nervous and highly strung than the average since this was the case with many of the best wardens it did not worry don even his curiosity about franklins past had somewhat lessened for he was far too busy to bother about it he had learned to be patient when there was no alternative and he did not doubt that sooner or later he would discover the whole story once or twice he was almost certain franklin had been on the verge of some revelation but then had drawn back each time don had pretended that nothing had happened and they had resumed their old impersonal relationship it was a clear morning with only a slow swell moving across the face of the sea as they walked along the narrow jetty that stretched from the western end of the island out to the edge of the reef the tide was in but though the reef flat was completely submerged the great plateau of coral was nowhere more than five or six feet below the surface and its every detail was clearly visible through the crystal water neither franklin nor burley spared more than a few glances for the natural aquarium above which they were walking it was too familiar to them both and they knew that the real beauty and wonder of the reef lay in the deeper waters farther out to sea two hundred yards out from the island the coral landscape suddenly dropped off into the depths but the jetty continued upon taller stilts until it ended in a small group of sheds and offices a valiant and fairly successful attempt had been made to avoid the grime and chaos usually inseparable from dockyards and piers even the cranes had been designed so that they would not offend the eye one of the terms under which the queensland government had reluctantly leased the capricorn group to the world food organization was that the beauty of the islands would not be jeopardized on the whole this part of the agreement had been well kept ive ordered two torpedoes from the garage said burley as they walked down the flight of stairs at the end of the jetty and passed through the double doors of a large air lock franklins ears gave the disconcerting internal click as they adjusted themselves to the increased pressure he guessed that he was now about twenty feet below the water line around him was a brightly lighted chamber crammed with various types of underwater equipment from simple lungs to elaborate propulsion devices the two torpedoes that don had requisitioned were lying in their cradles on a sloping ramp leading down into the still water at the far end of the chamber they were painted the bright yellow reserved for training equipment and don looked at them with some distaste its a couple of years since i used one of these things he said to franklin youll probably be better at it than i am when i get myself wet i like to be under my own power they stripped to swim trunks and pullovers then fastened on the harness of their breathing equipment don picked up one of the small but surprisingly heavy plastic cylinders and handed it to franklin these are the highpressure jobs that i told you about he said theyre pumped to a thousand atmospheres so the air in them is denser than water hence these buoyancy tanks at either end to keep them in neutral the automatic adjustment is pretty good as you use up your air the tanks slowly flood so that the cylinder stays just about weightless otherwise youd come up to the surface like a cork whether you wanted to or not he looked at the pressure gauges on the tanks and gave a satisfied nod theyre nearly half charged he said thats far more than we need you can stay down for a day on one of these tanks when its really pumped up and we wont be gone more than an hour they adjusted the new fullface masks that had already been checked for leaks and comfortable fitting these would be as much their personal property as their toothbrushes while they were on the station for no two peoples faces were exactly the same shape and even the slightest leak could be disastrous when they had checked the air supply and the shortrange underwater radio sets they lay almost flat along the slim torpedoes heads down behind the low transparent shields past at speeds of up to thirty knots franklin settled his feet comfortably in the stirrups feeling for the throttle and jet reversal controls with his toes the little joy stick which allowed him to fly the torpedo like a plane was just in front of his face in the center of the instrument board apart from a few switches the compass and the meters giving speed depth and battery charge there were no other controls don gave franklin his final instructions ending with the words keep about twenty feet away on my right so that i can see you all the time if anything goes wrong and you do have to dump the torp for heavens sake remember to cut the motor we dont want it charging all over the reef all set yesim ready franklin answered into his little microphone righthere we go the torpedoes slid easily down the ramps and the water rose above their heads this was no new experience to franklin like most other people in the world he had occasionally tried his hand at underwater swimming and had sometimes used a lung just to see what it was like he felt nothing but a pleasant sense of anticipation as the little turbine started to whir beneath him and the walls of the submerged chamber slid slowly past the light strengthened around them as they emerged into the open and pulled away from the piles of the jetty visibility was not very goodthirty feet at the mostbut it would improve as they came to deeper water don swung his torpedo at right angles to the edge of the reef and headed out to sea at a leisurely five knots the biggest danger with these toys said dons voice from the tiny loudspeaker by franklins ear is going too fast and running into something it takes a lot of experience to judge underwater visibility see what i mean he banked steeply to avoid a towering mass of coral which had suddenly appeared ahead of them if the demonstration had been planned thought franklin don had timed it beautifully as the living mountain swept past not more than ten feet away he caught a glimpse of a myriad brilliantly colored fish staring at him with apparent unconcern by this time he assumed they must be so used to torpedoes and subs that they were quite unexcited by them and since this entire area was rigidly protected they had no reason to fear man a few minutes at cruising speed brought them out into the open water of the channel between the island and the adjacent reefs now they had room to maneuver and franklin followed his mentor in a series of rolls and loops and great submarine switchbacks that soon had him hopelessly lost sometimes they shot down to the sea bed a hundred feet below then broke surface like flying fish to check their position all the time don kept up a running commentary interspersed with questions designed to see how franklin was reacting to the ride it was one of the most exhilarating experiences he had ever known the water was much clearer out here in the channel and one could see for almost a hundred feet once they ran into a great school of bonitos which formed an inquisitive escort until don put on speed and left them behind they saw no sharks as franklin had half expected and he commented to don on their absence you wont see many while youre riding a torp the other replied the noise of the jet scares them if you want to meet the local sharks youll have to go swimming in the oldfashioned wayor cut your motor and wait until they come to look at you a dark mass was looming indistinctly from the sea bed and they reduced speed to a gentle drift as they approached a little range of coral hills twenty or thirty feet high an old friend of mine lives around here said don i wonder if hes home its been about four years since i saw him last but that wont seem much to him hes been around for a couple of centuries they were now skirting the edge of a huge greenclad mushroom of coral and franklin peered into the shadows beneath it there were a few large boulders there and a pair of elegant angelfish which almost disappeared when they turned edge on to him but he could see nothing else to justify burleys interest it was very unsettling when one of the boulders began to move fortunately not in his direction the biggest fish he had ever seenit was almost as long as the torpedo and very much fatterwas staring at him with great bulbous eyes suddenly it opened its mouth in a menacing yawn and franklin felt like jonah at the big moment of his career he had a glimpse of huge blubbery lips enclosing surprisingly tiny teeth then the great jaws snapped shut again and he could almost feel the rush of displaced water don seemed delighted at the encounter which had obviously brought back memories of his own days as a trainee here well its nice to see old slobberchops again isnt he a beauty seven hundred and fifty pounds if hes an ounce weve been able to identify him on photos taken as far back as eighty years ago and he wasnt much smaller then its a wonder he escaped the spear fishers before this area was made a reservation i should think said franklin that it was a wonder the spear fishers escaped him oh hes not really dangerous groupers only swallow things they can get down wholethose silly little teeth arent much good for biting and a fullsized man would be a trifle too much for him give him another century for that they left the giant grouper still patrolling the entrance to its cave and continued on along the edge of the reef for the next ten minutes they saw nothing of interest except a large ray which was lying on the bottom and took off with an agitated flapping of its wings as soon as they approached as it flew away into the distance it seemed an uncannily accurate replica of the big deltawinged aircraft which had ruled the air for a short while sixty or seventy years ago it was strange thought franklin how nature had anticipated so many of mans inventionsfor example the precise shape of the vehicle on which he was riding and even the jet principle by which it was propelled im going to circle right around the reef said don it will take us about forty minutes to get home are you feeling ok im fine no ear trouble my left ear bothered me a bit at first but it seems to have popped now rightlets go follow just above and behind me so i can see you in my rearview mirror i was always afraid of running into you when you were on my right in the new formation they sped on toward the east at a steady ten knots following the irregular line of the reef don was well satisfied with the trip franklin had seemed perfectly at home under waterthough one could never be sure of this until one had seen how he faced an emergency that would be part of the next lesson franklin did not know it yet but an emergency had been arranged four it was hard to distinguish one day from another on the island the weather had settled in for a period of prolonged calm and the sun rose and set in a cloudless sky but there was no danger of monotony for there was far too much to learn and do slowly as his mind absorbed new knowledge and skills franklin was escaping from whatever nightmare must have engulfed him in the past he was don sometimes thought like an overtightened spring that was now unwinding it was true that he still showed occasional signs of nervousness and impatience when there was no obvious cause for them and once or twice there had been flareups that had caused brief interruptions in the training program one of these had been partly dons fault and the memory of it still left him annoyed with himself he had not been too bright that morning owing to a late night with the boys who had just completed their course and were now fullfledged third wardens very proud of the silver dolphins on their tunics it would not be true to say that he had a hangover but all his mental processes were extremely sluggish and as bad luck would have it they were dealing with a subtle point in underwater acoustics even at the best of times don would have passed it by somewhat hastily with a lame ive never been into the math but it seems that if you take the compressibility and temperature curves this is what happens this worked on most pupils but it failed to work on franklin who had an annoying fondness for going into unnecessary details he began to draw curves and to differentiate equations while don anxious to conceal his ignorance fumed in the background it was soon obvious that franklin had bitten off more than he could chew and he appealed to his tutor for assistance don both stupid and stubborn that morning would not admit frankly that he didnt know with the result that he gave the impression of refusing to cooperate in no time at all franklin lost his temper and walked out in a huff leaving don to wander to the dispensary he was not pleased to find that the entire stock of morningafter pills had already been consumed by the departing class fortunately such incidents were rare for the two men had grown to respect each others abilities and to make those allowances that are essential in every partnership with the rest of the staff and with the trainees however franklin was not popular this was partly because he avoided close contacts which in the little world of the island gave him a reputation for being standoffish the trainees also resented his special privilegesparticularly the fact that he had a room of his own and the staff while grumbling mildly at the extra work he involved were also annoyed because they could discover so little about him don had several times found himself rather to his surprise defending franklin against the criticisms of his colleagues hes not a bad chap when you get to know him he had said if he doesnt want to talk about his past thats his affair the fact that a lot of people way up in the administration must be backing him is good enough for me besides when ive finished with him hell be a better warden than half the people in this room there were snorts of disbelief at this statement and someone asked have you tried any tricks on him yet no but im going too soon ive thought up a nice one will let you know how he makes out five to one he panics ill take that start saving up your money franklin knew nothing of his financial responsibilities when he and don left the garage on their second torpedo ride nor had he reason to suspect the entertainment that had been planned for him this time they headed south as soon as they had cleared the jetty cruising about thirty feet below the surface in a few minutes they had passed the narrow channel blasted through the reef so that small ships could get in to the research station and they circled once round the observation chamber from which the scientists could watch the inhabitants of the sea bed in comfort there was no one inside at the moment to look out at them through the thick plateglass windows quite unexpectedly franklin found himself wondering what the little shark fancier was doing today well head over to the wistari reef said don i want to give you some practice in navigation dons torpedo swung round to the west as he set a new course out into the deeper water visibility was not good todayless than thirty feetand it was difficult to keep him in sight presently he halted and began to orbit slowly as he gave franklin his instructions i want you to hold course for one minute at twenty knots then for the same time and speed ill meet you there got it franklin repeated the instructions and they checked the synchronization of their watches it was rather obvious what don was doing he had given his pupil two sides of an equilateral triangle to follow and would doubtless proceed slowly along the third to make the appointment carefully setting his course franklin pressed down the throttle and felt the surge of power as the torpedo leaped forward into the blue haze the steady rush of water against his partly exposed legs was almost the only sensation of speed without the shield he would have been swept away in a moment from time to time he caught a glimpse of the sea beddrab and featureless here in the channel between the great reefsand once he overtook a school of surprised batfish which scattered in dismay at his approach for the first time franklin suddenly realized he was alone beneath the sea totally surrounded by the element which would be his new domain it supported and protected him yet it would kill him in two or three minutes at the most if he made a mistake or if his equipment failed that knowledge did not disturb him it had little weight against the increasing confidence and sense of mastery he was acquiring day by day he now knew and understood the challenge of the sea and it was a challenge he wished to meet with a lifting of the heart he realized that he once more had a goal in life the first minute was up and he reduced speed to four knots with the reverse jet he had now covered a third of a mile and it was time to start on the second leg of the triangle to make his rendezvous with don the moment he swung the little joy stick to starboard he knew that something was wrong the torpedo was wallowing like a pig completely out of control he cut speed to zero and with all dynamic forces gone the vessel began to sink very slowly to the bottom franklin lay motionless along the back of his recalcitrant steed trying to analyze the situation he was not so much alarmed as annoyed that his navigational exercise had been spoiled it was no good calling don who would now be out of rangethese little radio sets could not establish contact through more than a couple of hundred yards of water what was the best thing to do swiftly his mind outlined alternative plans of action and dismissed most of them at once there was nothing he could do to repair the torp for all the controls were sealed and in any event he had no tools since both rudder and elevator were out of action the trouble was quite fundamental and franklin was unable to see how such a simultaneous breakdown could have happened he was now about fifty feet down and gaining speed as he dropped to the bottom the flat sandy sea bed was just coming into sight and for a moment franklin had to fight the automatic impulse to press the button which would blow the torpedos tanks and take him up to the surface that would be the worst thing to do natural though it was to seek air and sun when anything went wrong under water once on the bottom he could take his time to think matters out whereas if he surfaced the current might sweep him miles away it was true that the station would soon pick up his radio calls once he was above waterbut he wanted to extricate himself from this predicament without any outside help the torp grounded throwing up a cloud of sand which soon drifted away in the slight current a small grouper appeared from nowhere staring at the intruder with its characteristic popeyed expression franklin had no time to bother with spectators but climbed carefully off his vehicle and pulled himself to the stern without flippers he had little mobility under water but fortunately there were sufficient handholds for him to move along the torpedo without difficulty as franklin had fearedbut was still unable to explain the rudder and elevator were flopping around uselessly there was no resistance when he moved the little vanes by hand and he wondered if there was any way in which he could fix external control lines and steer the torpedo manually he had some nylon line and a knife in the pouch on his harness but there seemed no practical way in which he could fasten the line to the smooth streamlined vanes it looked as if he would have to walk home that should not be too difficulthe could set the motor running at low speed and let the torp pull him along the bottom while he aimed it in the right direction by brute force it would be clumsy but seemed possible in theory and he could think of nothing better he glanced at his watch it had been only a couple of minutes since he had tried to turn at the leg of the triangle so he was no more than a minute late at his destination don would not be anxious yet but before long he would start searching for his lost pupil perhaps the best thing to do would be to stay right here until don turned up as he would be bound to do sooner or later it was at this moment that suspicion dawned in franklins mind and almost instantly became a fullfledged conviction he recalled certain rumors he had heard and remembered that dons behavior before they set out had been well slightly skittish was the only expression for it as if he had been cherishing some secret joke so that was it the torpedo had been sabotaged probably at this very moment don was hovering out there at the limits of visibility waiting to see what he would do and ready to step in if he ran into real trouble franklin glanced quickly around his hemisphere of vision to see if the other torp was lurking in the mist but was not surprised that there was no sign of it burley would be too clever to be caught so easily this thought franklin changed the situation completely he not only had to extricate himself from his dilemma but if possible he had to get his own back on don as well he walked back to the control position and switched on the motor a slight pressure on the throttle and the torp began to stir restlessly while a flurry of sand was gouged out of the sea bed by the jet a little experimenting showed that it was possible to walk the machine though it required continual adjustments of trim to stop it from climbing up to the surface or burying itself in the sand it was thought franklin going to take him a long time to get home this way but he could do it if there was no alternative he had walked no more than a dozen paces and had acquired quite a retinue of astonished fish when another idea struck him it seemed too good to be true but it would do no harm to try climbing onto the torpedo and lying in the normal prone position he adjusted the trim as carefully as he could by moving his weight back and forth then he tilted the nose toward the surface pushed his hands out into the slip stream on either side and started the motor at quarter speed it was hard on his wrists and his responses had to be almost instantaneous to check the weaving and bucking of the torpedo but with a little experimenting he found he could use his hands for steering though it was as difficult as riding a bicycle with ones arms crossed at five knots the area of his flattened palms was just sufficient to give control over the vehicle he wondered if anyone had ever ridden a torp this way before and felt rather pleased with himself experimentally he pushed the speed up to eight knots but the pressure on his wrists and forearms was too great and he had to throttle back before he lost control there was no reason franklin told himself why he should not now make his original rendezvous just in case don was waiting there for him he would be about five minutes late but at least it would prove that he could carry out his assignment in the face of obstacles which he was not quite sure were entirely manmade don was nowhere in sight when he arrived and franklin guessed what had happened his unexpected mobility had taken burley by surprise and the warden had lost him in the submarine haze well he could keep on looking franklin made one radio call as a matter of principle but there was no reply from his tutor im going home he shouted to the watery world around him still there was silence don was probably a good quarter of a mile away conducting an increasingly more anxious search for his lost pupil there was no point in remaining below the surface and adding to the difficulties of navigation and control franklin took his vehicle up to the top and found that he was less than a thousand yards from the maintenance section jetty by keeping the torp tail heavy and nose up he was able to scorch along on the surface like a speedboat without the slightest trouble and he was home in five minutes as soon as the torpedo had come out of the anticorrosion sprays which were used on all equipment after saltwater dives franklin got to work on it when he pulled off the panel of the control compartment he discovered that his was a very special model indeed without a circuit diagram it was not possible to tell exactly what the radiooperated relay unit he had located could do but he did not doubt that it had an interesting repertory it could certainly cut off the motor blow or flood the buoyancy tanks and reverse the rudder and elevator controls franklin suspected that compass and depth gauge could also be sabotaged if required someone had obviously spent a great deal of loving care making this torpedo a suitable steed for overconfident pupils he replaced the panel and reported his safe return to the officer on duty visibilitys very poor he said truthfully enough don and i lost each other out there so i thought id better come in i guess hell be along later there was considerable surprise in the mess when franklin turned up without his instructor and settled quietly down in a corner to read a magazine forty minutes later a great slamming of doors announced dons arrival the wardens face was a study in relief and perplexity as he looked around the room and located his missing pupil who stared back at him with his most innocent expression and said what kept you burley turned to his colleagues and held out his hand pay up boys he ordered it had taken him long enough to make up his mind but he realized that he was beginning to like franklin five the two men leaning on the rails around the main pool of the aquarium did not thought indra as she walked up the road to the lab look like the usual run of visiting scientists it was not until she had come closer and was able to get a good look at them that she realized who they were the big fellow was first warden burley so the other must be the famous mystery man he was taking through a highpressure course she had heard his name but couldnt remember it not being particularly interested in the activities of the training school as a pure scientist she tended to look down on the highly practical work of the bureau of whales though had anyone accused her outright of such intellectual snobbery she would have denied it with indignation she had almost reached them before she realized that she had already met the smaller man for his part franklin was looking at her with a slightly baffled havent we seen each other before expression hello she said coming to a standstill beside them remember me im the girl who collects sharks franklin smiled and answered of course i remember it still turns my stomach sometimes i hope you found plenty of vitamins yet strangely enough the puzzled expressionso typical of a man straining after memories that will not comestill lingered in his eyes it made him look lost and more than a little worried and indra found herself reacting with a sympathy which was disconcerting she had already had several narrow escapes from emotional entanglements on the island and she reminded herself firmly of her resolution not until after ive got my masters degree so you know each other said don plaintively you might introduce me don indra decided was perfectly safe he would start to flirt with her at once like any warden worthy of his calling she did not mind that in the least though big leonine blonds were not precisely her type it was always flattering to feel that one was causing a stir and she knew that there was no risk of any serious attachment here with franklin however she felt much less sure of herself they chattered pleasantly enough with a few bantering undertones while they stood watching the big fish and porpoises circling slowly in the oval pool the labs main tank was really an artificial lagoon filled and emptied twice a day by the tides with a little assistance from a pumping plant wiremesh barriers divided it into various sections through which mutually incompatible exhibits stared hungrily at each other a small tiger shark with the inevitable sucker fish glued to its back kept patrolling its underwater cage unable to take its eyes off the succulent pompano parading just outside in some enclosures however surprising partnerships had developed brilliantly colored crayfish looking like overgrown shrimps that had been sprayed with paint guns crawled a few inches away from the incessantly gaping jaws of a huge and hideous moray eel a school of fingerlings like sardines that had escaped from their tin cruised past the nose of a quarterton grouper that could have swallowed them all at one gulp it was a peaceful little world so different from the battlefield of the reef but if the lab staff ever failed to make the normal feeding arrangements this harmony would quickly vanish and in a few hours the population of the pool would start a catastrophic decline don did most of the talking he appeared to have quite forgotten that he had brought franklin here to see some of the whalerecognition films in the labs extensive library he was clearly trying to impress indra and quite unaware of the fact that she saw through him completely franklin on the other hand obviously saw both sides of the game and was mildly entertained by it once indra caught his eye when don was holding forth about the life and hard times of the average warden and they exchanged the smiles of two people who share the same amusing secret and at that moment indra decided that after all her degree might not be the most important thing in the world she was still determined not to get herself involvedbut she had to learn more about franklin what was his first name walter it was not one of her favorites but it would do in his calm confidence that he was laying waste another susceptible female heart don was completely unaware of the undercurrents of emotion that were sweeping around him yet leaving him utterly untouched when he suddenly realized that they were twenty minutes late for their appointment in the projection room he pretended to blame franklin who accepted the reproof in a goodnatured but slightly absentminded manner for the rest of the morning indeed franklin was rather far away from his studies but don noticed nothing at all the first part of the course was now virtually completed franklin had learned the basic mechanics of the wardens profession and now needed the experience that only time would give in almost every respect he had exceeded burleys hopes partly because of his original scientific training partly because of his innate intelligence yet there was more to it even than this franklin had a drive and determination that was sometimes frightening it was as if success in this course was a matter of life and death to him true he had been slow in starting for the first few days he had been listless and seemingly almost uninterested in his new career then he had come to life as he awoke to the wonder and challengethe endless opportunityof the element he was attempting to master though don was not much given to such fancies it seemed to him that franklin was like a man awakening from a long and troubled sleep the real test had been when they had first gone under water with the torpedoes franklin might never use a torp againexcept for amusementduring his entire career they were purely shallowwater units designed for very shortrange work and as a warden franklin would spend all his operational time snug and dry behind the protective walls of a sub but unless a man was at ease and confidentthough not overconfidentwhen he was actually immersed in water the service had no use for him however qualified he might be in other respects franklin had also passed with a satisfactory safety margin the decompression co and nitrogen narcosis tests burley had put him in the stations torture chamber where the doctors slowly increased the air pressure and took him down on a simulated dive he had been perfectly normal down to feet thereafter his mental reactions became sluggish and failed to do simple sums correctly when they were given to him over the intercom at feet he appeared to be mildly drunk and started cracking jokes which reduced him to tears of helpless laughter but which were quite unfunny to those outsideand embarrassingly so to franklin himself when they played them back to him later three hundred and fifty feet down he still appeared to be conscious but refused to react to dons voice even when it started shouting outrageous insults and at feet he passed out completely and they brought him slowly back to normal though he would never have occasion to use them he was also tested with the special breathing mixtures which enable a man to remain conscious and active at far greater depths when he did any deep dives he would not be wearing underwater breathing gear but would be sitting comfortably inside a sub breathing normal air at normal pressure but a warden had to be a jack of all underwater trades and never knew what equipment he might have to use in an emergency burley was no longer scaredas he had once beenat the thought of sharing a twoman training sub with franklin despite the others underlying reticence and the mystery which still surrounded him they were partners now and knew how to work together they had not yet become friends but had reached a state which might be defined as one of tolerant respect on their first sub run they kept to the shallow waters between the great barrier reef and the mainland while franklin familiarized himself with the control and above all with the navigational instruments if you could run a sub here said don in this labyrinth of reefs and islands you could run it anywhere apart from trying to charge masthead island at sixty knots franklin performed quite creditably his fingers began to move over the complex control board with a careful precision which don knew would soon develop into automatic skill his scanning of the many meters and display screens would soon be unconscious so that he would not even be aware that he saw themuntil something called for his attention don gave franklin increasingly more complicated tasks to perform such as tracing out improbable courses by dead reckoning and then checking his position on the sonar grid to see where he had actually arrived it was not until he was quite sure that franklin was proficient in handling a sub that they finally went out into deep water over the edge of the continental shelf navigating a scoutsub was merely the beginning one had to learn to see and feel with its senses to interpret all the patterns of information displayed on the control board by the many instruments which were continually probing the underwater world the sonic senses were perhaps the most important in utter darkness or in completely turbid water they could detect all obstacles out to a range of ten miles with great accuracy and in considerable detail they could show the contours of the ocean bed or with equal ease could detect any fish more than two or three feet long that came within half a mile whales and the larger marine animals they could spot right out to the extreme limit of range fixing them with pinpoint accuracy visible light had a more limited role sometimes in deep ocean waters far from the eternal rain of silt which sloughs down from the edges of the continents it was possible to see as much as two hundred feetbut that was rare in shallow coastal waters the television eye could seldom peer more than fifty feet but within its range it gave a definition unmatched by the subs other senses yet the subs had not only to see and feel they also had to act franklin must learn to use a whole armory of tools and weapons borers to collect specimens of the sea bed meters to check the efficiency of the fences sampling devices branders for painlessly marking uncooperative whales electric probes to discourage marine beasts that became too inquisitiveand most seldom used of all the tiny torpedoes and poisoned darts that could slay in seconds the mightiest creatures of the seas in daily cruises far out into the pacific franklin learned to use these tools of his new trade sometimes they went through the fence and it seemed to franklin that he could feel its eternal highpitched shrieking in his very bones halfway around the world it now extended its narrow fans of radiation reaching up to the surface from the deeply submerged generators what wondered franklin would earlier ages have thought of this in some ways it seemed the greatest and most daring of all mans presumptions the sea which had worked its will with man since the beginning of time had been humbled at last not even the conquest of space had been a greater victory than this and yetit was a victory that could never be final the sea would always be waiting and every year it would claim its victims there was a roll of honor that franklin had glimpsed briefly during his visit to the head office already it bore many names and there was room for many more slowly franklin was coming to terms with the sea as must all men who have dealings with it though he had had little time for nonessential reading he had dipped into moby dick which had been halfjokingly halfseriously called the bible of the bureau of whales much of it had seemed to him tedious and so far removed from the world in which he was living that it had no relevance yet occasionally melvilles archaic sonorous prose touched some chord in his own mind and gave him a closer understanding of the ocean which he too must learn to hate and love don burley however had no use at all for moby dick and frequently made fun of those who were always quoting it we could show melville a thing or two he had once remarked to franklin in a very condescending tone of course we could franklin had answered but would you have the guts to stick a spear into a sperm whale from an open boat don did not reply he was honest enough to admit that he did not know the answer yet there was one question he was now close to answering as he watched franklin learn his new skills with a swiftness which could undoubtedly make him a first warden in no more than four or five years he knew with complete certainty what his pupils last profession had been if he chose to keep it a secret that was his own affair don felt a little aggrieved by such lack of trust but sooner or later he told himself franklin would confide in him yet it was not don who was the first to learn the truth by the sheerest of accidents it was indra six they now met at least once a day in the mess though franklin had not yet made the irrevocable almost unprecedented step of moving from his table to the one at which the research staff dined that would be a flamboyant declaration which would set every tongue on the island wagging happily and in any case it would not be justified by the circumstances as far as indra and franklin were concerned the muchabused phrase were just friends was still perfectly true yet it was also true that they had grown very fond of each other and that almost everyone except don was aware of it several of indras colleagues had said to her approvingly youre thawing out the iceberg and the compliment had flattered her the few people who knew franklin well enough to banter with him had made warning references to don pointing out that first wardens had reputations to maintain franklins reaction had been a somewhat forced grin concealing feelings which he could not fully analyze himself loneliness the need to escape from memories a safety valve to guard him against the pressure under which he was workingthese factors were at least as important as the normal feelings of any man for a girl as attractive as indra whether this companionship would develop into anything more serious he did not know he was not even sure if he wished it to do so nor for her part was indra though her old resolve was weakening sometimes she indulged in reveries wherein her career took very much of a second place one day of course she was going to marry and the man she would choose would be very much like franklin but that it might be franklin was a thought from which she still shied away one of the problems of romance on heron island was that there were far too many people in too small a space even the fragment that was left of the original forest did not provide enough seclusion at night if one wandered through its paths and byways carrying a flashlight to avoid the lowhanging branches one had to be very tactful with the beam one was liable to find that favorite spots had already been requisitioned which would be extremely frustrating if there was nowhere else to go the fortunate scientists at the research station however had an invaluable escape route all the large surface craft and all the underwater vessels belonged to administration though they were made available to the lab for official business but by some historical accident the lab had a tiny private fleet consisting of one launch and two catamarans no one was quite sure who owned the latter and it was noticeable that they were always at sea when the auditors arrived for the annual inventory the little cats did a great deal of work for the lab since they drew only six inches of water and could operate safely over the reef except at low tide with a stiff wind behind them they could do twenty knots with ease and races between the two craft were frequently arranged when they were not being used for other business the scientists would sail them to the neighboring reefs and islands to impress their friends usually of the opposite sexwith their prowess as seamen it was a little surprising that ships and occupants had always come back safely from these expeditions the only casualties had been to morale one first warden of many years seniority had had to be carried off the boat after a pleasure trip and had sworn that nothing would ever induce him to travel on the surface of the sea again when indra suggested to franklin that he might like to sail to masthead island he accepted at once then he said cautiously wholl run the boat indra looked hurt i will of course she answered ive done it dozens of times she seemed to be halfexpecting him to doubt her competence but franklin knew better than to do so indra he had already discovered was a very levelheaded girlperhaps too levelheaded if she said she could do a job that was that there was still however one other point to be settled the cats could take four people who would the other two be neither indra nor franklin actually voiced the final decision it hovered in the air while they discussed various possible companions starting with don and working down the list of indras friends at the lab presently the conversation died out into one of those portentous pauses which can sometimes occur even in a roomful of chattering people in the sudden silence each realized that the other was thinking the same thought and that a new phase had begun in their relationship they would take no one with them to masthead for the first time they would have the solitude that had never been possible here that this could lead only to one logical conclusion they refused to admit even to themselves the human mind having a remarkable capacity for selfdeceit it was well into the afternoon before they were able to make all their arrangements and escape franklin felt very guilty about don and wondered what his reactions would be when he found out what had happened he would probably be mortified but he was not the sort to hold a grudge and he would take it like a man indra had thought of everything food drinks sunburn lotion towelsshe had overlooked nothing that such an expedition might need franklin was impressed by her thoroughness and was amused to find himself thinking that so competent a woman would be very useful to have around the house then he reminded himself hastily that women who were too efficient were seldom happy unless they ran their husbands lives as well as their own there was a steady wind blowing from the mainland and the cat bounded across the waves like a living creature franklin had never before been in a sailing boat and he found the experience an exhilarating one he lay back on the worn but comfortable padding of the open cockpit while heron island receded into the distance at an astonishing speed it was restful to watch the twin creamy wakes trace their passage across the sea and to caress with the eye the straining powerfilled curves of the sails with a mild and fleeting regret franklin wished that all mans machines could be as simple and efficient as this one what a contrast there was between this vessel and the crowded complexities of the subs he was now learning to handle the thought passed swiftly there were some tasks which could not be achieved by simple means and one must accept the fact without complaint on their left they were now skirting the long line of rounded coral boulders which centuries of storms had cast up upon the edge of the wistari reef the waves were breaking against the submerged ramparts with a relentless and persistent fury which had never impressed franklin so much as now he had seen them often enough beforebut never from so close at hand in so frail a craft the boiling margin of the reef fell astern now they had merely to wait while the winds brought them to their goal even if the wind failedwhich was most unlikelythey could still make the trip on the little auxiliary hydrojet engine though that would only be used as a last resort it was a matter of principle to return with a full fuel tank although they were now together and alone for almost the first time since they had met neither franklin nor indra felt any need to talk there seemed a silent communion between them which they did not wish to break with words being content to share the peace and wonder of the open sea and the open sky they were enclosed between two hemispheres of flawless blue clamped together at the misty rim of the horizon and nothing else of the world remained even time seemed to have faltered to a stop franklin felt he could lie here forever relaxing in the gentle motion of the boat as it skimmed effortlessly over the waves presently a low dark cloud began to solidify then to reveal itself as a treeclad island with its narrow sandy shore and inevitable fringing reef indra bestirred herself and began to take an active interest in navigation once more while franklin looked rather anxiously at the breakers which seemed to surround the island in one continuous band how are we going to get in he asked round the lee side it wont be rough there and the tide should be high enough for us to go in across the reef if it isnt we can always anchor and wade ashore franklin was not altogether happy about so casual an approach to what seemed a serious problem and he could only hope that indra really did know what she was doing if she made a mistake they might have an uncomfortable though not particularly dangerous swim ahead followed after a long wait by an ignominious rescue when someone came from the lab to look for them either it was easier than it appeared to an anxious novice or else indras seamanship was of a high order they circled halfway around the island until they came to a spot where the breakers subsided into a few choppy waves then indra turned the prow of the cat toward the land and headed straight for shore there were no sounds of grinding coral or splintering plastic like a bird the catamaran flew in across the narrow edge of the reef now clearly visible just below the broken and unsettled water it skimmed past this danger zone and then was over the peaceful surface of the lagoon seeming to gain speed as it approached the beach seconds before impact indra furled the mainsail with a soft thud the vessel hit the sand and coasted up the gentle slope coming to rest with more than half its length above the water line here we are said indra one uninhabited coral island in full working order she seemed more relaxed and lighthearted than franklin had ever before seen her he realized that she too had been working under pressure and was glad to escape from the daily routine for a few hours or was it the stimulating effect of his company that was turning her from a serious student into a vivacious girl whatever the explanation he liked the change they climbed out of the boat and carried their gear up the beach into the shade of the coconut palms which had been imported into these islands only during the last century to challenge the predominance of the pisonia and the stiltrooted pandanus it seemed that someone else had also been here recently for curious tracks apparently made by narrowgauge caterpillar treads marched up out of the water and vanished inland they would have been quite baffling to anyone who did not know that the big turtles had been coming ashore to lay their eggs as soon as the cat had been made secure franklin and indra began a tour of exploration it was true that one coral island was almost exactly the same as another the same pattern was repeated endlessly over and over again with few variations yet even when one was aware of that and had landed on dozens of islands every new one presented a fresh challenge which had to be accepted they began the circumnavigation of their little world walking along the narrow belt of sand between the forest and the sea sometimes when they came to a clearing they made short forays inland deliberately trying to lose themselves in the tangle of trees so that they could pretend that they were in the heart of africa and not at the very most a hundred yards from the sea once they stopped to dig with their hands at the spot where one of the turtle tracks terminated on a flatended sand dune they gave up when they were two feet down and there was still no sign of the leathery flexible eggs the mother turtle they solemnly decided must have been making false trails to deceive her enemies for the next ten minutes they elaborated this fantasy into a startling thesis on reptile intelligence which far from gaining indra new qualifications would undoubtedly have cost her the degree she already possessed inevitably the time came when having helped each other over a patch of rough coral their hands failed to separate even though the path was smooth once more neither speaking yet each more conscious of the others presence than they had ever been before they walked on in the silence of shared contentment at a leisurely stroll pausing whenever they felt like it to examine some curiosity of the plant or animal world it took them almost two hours to circumnavigate the little island by the time they had reached the cat they were very hungry and franklin began to unpack the food hamper with unconcealed eagerness while indra started working on the stove now im going to brew you a billy of genuine australian tea she said franklin gave her that twisted whimsical smile which she found so attractive it will hardly be a novelty to me he said after all i was born here she stared at him in astonishment which gradually turned to exasperation well you might have told me she said in fact i really think then she stopped as if by a deliberate effort of will leaving the uncompleted sentence hanging in midair franklin had no difficulty in finishing it she had intended to say its high time you told me something about yourself and abandoned all this silly reticence the truth of the unspoken accusation made him flush and for a moment some of his carefree happinessthe first he had known for so many monthsdrained away then a thought struck him which he had never faced before since to do so might have jeopardized his friendship with indra she was a scientist and a woman and therefore doubly inquisitive why was it that she had never asked him any questions about his past life there could be only one explanation dr myers who was unobtrusively watching over him despite the jovial pretense that he was doing nothing of the sort must have spoken to her a little more of his contentment ebbed as he realized that indra must feel sorry for him and must wonder like everyone else exactly what had happened to him he would not he told himself bitterly accept a love that was founded on pity indra seemed unaware of his sudden brooding silence and the conflict that now disturbed his mind she was busy filling the little stove by a somewhat primitive method that involved siphoning fuel out of the hydrojets tank and franklin was so amused by her repeated failures that he forgot his momentary annoyance when at last she had managed to light the stove they lay back under the palms munching sandwiches and waiting for the water to boil the sun was already far down the sky and franklin realized that they would probably not get back to heron island until well after nightfall however it would not be dark for the moon was nearing full so even without the aid of the local beacons the homeward journey would present no difficulties the billybrewed tea was excellent though doubtless far too anemic for any oldtime swagman it washed down the remainder of their food very efficiently and as they relaxed with sighs of satisfaction their hands once again found each other now thought franklin i should be perfectly content but he knew that he was not something that he could not define was worrying him his unease had grown steadily stronger during the last few minutes but he had tried to ignore it and force it down into his mind he knew that it was utterly ridiculous and irrational to expect any danger here on this empty and peaceful island yet little warning bells were ringing far down in the labyrinths of his brain and he could not understand their signals indras casual question came as a welcome distraction she was staring intently up into the western sky obviously searching for something is it really true walter she asked that if you know where to look for her you can see venus in the daytime she was so bright after sunset last night that i could almost believe it its perfectly true franklin answered in fact it isnt even difficult the big problem is to locate her in the first place once youve done that shes quite easy to see he propped himself up against a palm trunk shaded his eyes from the glare of the descending sun and began to search the western sky with little hope of discovering the elusive silver speck he knew to be shining there he had noticed venus dominating the evening sky during the last few weeks but it was hard to judge how far she was from the sun when both were above the horizon at the same time suddenlyunexpectedlyhis eyes caught and held a solitary silver star hanging against the milky blue of the sky ive found her he exclaimed raising his arm as a pointer indra squinted along it but at first could see nothing youve got spots before the eyes she taunted noim not imagining things just keep on looking franklin answered his eyes still focused on the dimensionless star which he knew he would lose if he turned away from it even for a second but venus cant be there protested indra thats much too far north in a single sickening instant franklin knew that she was right if he had any doubt he could see now that the star he was watching was moving swiftly across the sky rising out of the west and so defying the laws which controlled all other heavenly bodies he was staring at the space station the largest of all the satellites now circling earth as it raced along its thousandmilehigh orbit he tried to turn his eyes away to break the hypnotic spell of that manmade unscintillating star it was as if he was teetering on the edge of an abyss the terror of those endless trackless wastes between the worlds began to invade and dominate his mind to threaten the very foundations of his sanity he would have won the struggle no more than a little shaken had it not been for a second accident of fate with the explosive suddenness with which memory sometimes yields to persistent questioning he knew what it was that had been worrying him for the last few minutes it was the smell of the fuel that indra had siphoned from the hydrojet the unmistakable slightly aromatic tang of synthene and crowding hard upon that recognition was the memory of where he had last met that alltoofamiliar odor synthenefirst developed as a rocket propellantnow obsolete like all other chemical fuels except for lowpowered applications like the propulsion of space suits space suits it was too much the double assault defeated him both sight and smell had turned traitor in the same instant within seconds the patiently built dikes which now protected his mind went down before the rising tide of terror he could feel the earth beneath him spinning dizzily through space it seemed to be whirling faster and faster on its axis trying to hurl him off like a stone from a sling by the sheer speed of its rotation with a choking cry he rolled over on his stomach buried his face in the sand and clung desperately to the rough trunk of the palm it gave him no security the endless fall began again chief engineer franklin second in command of the arcturus was in space once more at the beginning of the nightmare he had hoped and prayed he need never retrace seven in the first shock of stunned surprise indra sat staring foolishly at franklin as he groveled in the sand and wept like a heartbroken child then compassion and common sense told her what to do she moved swiftly to his side and threw her arms around his heaving shoulders walter she cried youre all righttheres nothing to be afraid of the words seemed flat and foolish even as she uttered them but they were the best she had to offer franklin did not seem to hear he was still trembling uncontrollably still clinging to the tree with desperate determination it was pitiful to see a man reduced to such a state of abject fear so robbed of all dignity and pride as indra crouched over him she realized that between his sobs he was calling a name and even at such a moment as this she could not depress a stab of jealousy for it was the name of a woman over and over again in a voice so low as to be barely audible franklin would whisper irene and then be convulsed by a fresh paroxysm of weeping there was something here beyond indras slight knowledge of medicine she hesitated for a moment then hurried to the catamaran and broke open its little firstaid kit it contained a vial of potent painkilling capsules prominently labeled only one to be taken at any time and with some difficulty she managed to force one of these into franklins mouth then she held him in her arms while his tremors slowly subsided and the violence of the attack ebbed away it is hard to draw any line between compassion and love if such a division exists indra crossed it during this silent vigil franklins loss of manhood had not disgusted her she knew that something terrible indeed must have happened in his past to bring him to this state whatever it was her own future would not be complete unless she could help him fight it presently franklin was quiet though apparently still conscious he did not resist when she rolled him over so that his face was no longer halfburied in the sand and he relaxed his frenzied grip upon the tree but his eyes were empty and his mouth still moved silently though no words came from it were going home whispered indra as if soothing a frightened child come alongits all right now she helped him to his feet and he rose unresistingly he even assisted her in a mechanical way to pack their equipment and to push the catamaran off the beach he seemed nearly normal again except that he would not speak and there was a sadness in his eyes that tore at indras heart they left the island under both sail and power for indra was determined to waste no time even now it had not occurred to her that she might be in any personal danger so many miles from any help with a man who might be mad her only concern was to get franklin back to medical care as quickly as she could the light was failing fast the sun had already touched the horizon and darkness was massing in the east beacons on the mainland and the surrounding islands began one by one to spring to life and more brilliant than any of them there in the west was venus which had somehow caused all this trouble presently franklin spoke his words forced but perfectly rational im very sorry about this indra he said im afraid i spoiled your trip dont be silly she answered it wasnt your fault just take it easydont talk unless you want to he relapsed into silence and spoke no more for the rest of the voyage when indra reached out to hold his hand again he stiffened defensively in a way which said without actually rejecting her that he would prefer no such contact she felt hurt but obeyed his unspoken request in any event she was busy enough picking out the beacons as she made the tricky passage between the reefs she had not intended to be out as late as this even though the rising moon was now flooding the sea with light the wind had freshened and all too close at hand the breakers along the wistari reef were appearing and vanishing in deadly lines of luminous ghostly white she kept one eye on them and the other on the winking beacon that marked the end of the heron jetty not until she could see the jetty itself and make out the details of the island was she able to relax and give her attention once more to franklin he appeared almost normal again when they had berthed the catamaran and walked back to the lab indra could not see his expression for there were no lights here on this part of the beach and the palms shaded them from the moon as far as she could tell his voice was under full control when he bade her good night thank you for everything indra no one could have done more let me take you to dr myers right away youve got to see him notheres nothing he can do im quite all right now it wont happen again i still think you should see him ill take you to your room and then go and call him franklin shook his head violently thats one thing i dont want you to do promise me you wont call him sorely troubled indra debated with her conscience the wisest thing to do she was sure was to make the promise and then to break it yet if she did so franklin might never forgive her in the end she compromised will you go and see him yourself if you wont let me take you franklin hesitated before answering it seemed a shame that his parting words with this girl whom he might have loved should be a lie but in the drugged calm that had come upon him now he knew what he must do ill call him in the morningand thanks again then he broke away with a fierce finality before indra could question him further she watched him disappear into the darkness along the path that led to the training and administration section happiness and anxiety were contending for her soulhappiness because she had found love anxiety because it was threatened by forces she did not understand the anxiety resolved itself into a single nagging fear should she have insisted even against his will that franklin see dr myers at once she would have had no doubt of the answer could she have watched franklin double back through the moonlit forest and make his way like a man in a waking dream to the dock from which had begun all his journeys down into the sea the rational part of his mind was now merely the passive tool of his emotions and they were set upon a single goal he had been hurt too badly for reason to control him now like an injured animal he could think of nothing but the abating of his pain he was seeking the only place where for a little while he had found peace and contentment the jetty was deserted as he made the long lonely walk out to the edge of the reef down in the submarine hangar twenty feet below the water line he made his final preparations with as much care as he had ever done on his many earlier trips he felt a fleeting sense of guilt at robbing the bureau of some fairly valuable equipment and still more valuable training time but it was not his fault that he had no other choice very quietly the torp slipped out beneath the submerged archway and set course for the open sea it was the first time that franklin had ever been out at night only the fully enclosed subs operated after darkness for night navigation involved dangers which it was foolhardy for unprotected men to face that was the least of franklins worries as he set the course he remembered so well and headed out into the channel that would lead him to the sea part of the pain but none of the determination lifted from his mind this was where he belonged this was where he had found happiness this was where he would find oblivion he was in a world of midnight blue which the pale rays of the moon could do little to illumine around him strange shapes moved like phosphorescent ghosts as the creatures of the reef were attracted or scattered by the sound of his passing below him no more than shadows in a deeper darkness he could see the coral hills and valleys he had grown to know so well with a resignation beyond sadness he bade them all adieu there was no point in lingering now that his destiny was clear before him he pushed the throttle full down and the torpedo leaped forward like a horse that had been given the spur the islands of the great barrier reef were falling swiftly behind him and he was heading out into the pacific at a speed which no other creature of the sea could match only once did he glance up at the world he had abandoned the water was fantastically clear and a hundred feet above his head he could see the silver track of the moon upon the sea as few men could ever have witnessed it before he could even see the hazy dancing patch of light that was the moon itself refracted through the water surface yet occasionally freezing when the moving waves brought a moment of stability into a perfect flawless image and once a very large sharkthe largest he had ever seentried to pursue him the great streamlined shadow leaving its phosphorescent wake appeared suddenly almost dead ahead of him and he made no effort to avoid it as it swept past he caught a glimpse of the inhuman staring eye the slatted gills and the inevitable retinue of pilot fish and remora when he glanced back the shark was following him whether motivated by curiosity sex or hunger he neither knew nor cared it remained in sight for almost a minute before his superior speed left it behind he had never met a shark that had reacted in this way before usually they were terrified of the turbines warning scream but the laws that ruled the reef during the day were not those that prevailed in the hours of darkness he raced on through the luminous night that covered half the world crouching behind his curved shield for protection against the turbulent waters he was sundering in his haste to reach the open sea even now he was navigating with all his old skill and precision he knew exactly where he was exactly when he would reach his objectiveand exactly how deep were the waters he was now entering in a few minutes the sea bed would start slanting sharply down and he must say his last farewell to the reef he tilted the nose of the torp imperceptibly toward the depths and at the same time cut his speed to a quarter the mad roaring rush of waters ceased he was sliding gently down a long invisible slope whose end he would never see slowly the pale and filtered moonlight began to fade as the water thickened above him deliberately he avoided looking at the illuminated depth gauge avoided all thought of the fathoms that now lay overhead he could feel the pressure on his body increasing minute by minute but it was not in the least unpleasant indeed he welcomed it he gave himself a willing sacrifice gladly into the grasp of the great mother of life the darkness was now complete he was alone driving through a night stranger and more palpable than any to be found upon the land from time to time he could see at an unguessable distance below him tiny explosions of light as the unknown creatures of the open sea went about their mysterious business sometimes an entire ephemeral galaxy would thrust forth and within seconds die perhaps that other galaxy he told himself was of no longer duration of no greater importance when seen against the background of eternity the dreamy sleep of nitrogen narcosis was now almost upon him no other human being using a compressedair lung alone could ever have been so deep and returned to tell the tale he was breathing air at more than ten times normal pressure and still the torpedo was boring down into the lightless depths all responsibility all regrets all fears had been washed away from his mind by the blissful euphoria that had invaded every level of consciousness and yet at the very end there was one regret he felt a mild and wistful sadness that indra must now begin again her search for the happiness he might have given her thereafter there was only the sea and a mindless machine creeping ever more slowly down to the hundredfathom line and the far pacific wastes eight there were four people in the room and not one of them was talking now the chief instructor was biting his lip nervously don burley sat looking stunned and indra was trying not to cry only dr myers seemed fairly well under control and was silently cursing the fantastic the still inexplicable bad luck that had brought this situation upon them he would have sworn that franklin was well on the road to recovery well past any serious crisis and now this theres only one thing to do said the chief instructor suddenly and thats to send out all our underwater craft on a general search don burley stirred himself slowly and as if carrying a great weight upon his shoulders its twelve hours now in that time he could have covered five hundred miles and there are only six qualified pilots on the station i knowit would be like looking for a needle in a haystack but its the only thing we can do sometimes a few minutes of thought can save a good many hours of random searching said myers after half a day a little extra time will make no difference with your permission id like to have a private talk with miss langenburg of courseif she agrees indra nodded dumbly she was still blaming herself bitterly for what had happenedfor not going to the doctor immediately when they had returned to the island her intuition had failed her then now it told her that there was no possibility of any hope and she could only pray that it was wrong again now indra said myers kindly when the others had left the room if we want to help franklin weve got to keep our heads and try to guess what hes done so stop blaming yourselfthis isnt your fault im not sure if its anyones fault it might be mine he added grimly to himself but who could have guessed we understand so little about astrophobia even nowand heaven knows its not in my line indra managed a brave smile until yesterday she had thought she was very grownup and able to take care of herself in any situation but yesterday was a very very long time ago please tell me she said what is the matter with walter i think it would help me to understand it was a sensible and reasonable request even before indra had made it myers had come to the same conclusion very wellbut remember this is confidential for walters own sake im only telling it to you because this is an emergency and you may be able to help him if you know the facts until a year ago walter was a highly qualified spaceman in fact he was chief engineer of a liner on the martian run which as you know is a very responsible position indeed and that was certainly merely the beginning of his career well there was some kind of emergency in midorbit and the ion drive had to be shut off walter went outside in a space suit to fix itnothing unusual about that of course before he had finished the job however his suit failed no i dont mean it leaked what happened was that the propulsion system jammed on and he couldnt shut off the rockets that allowed him to move around in space so there he was millions of miles from anywhere building up speed away from his ship to make matters worse hed crashed against some part of the liner when he started and that had snapped off his radio antenna so he couldnt talk or receive messagescouldnt call for help or find out what his friends were doing for him he was completely alone and in a few minutes he couldnt even see the liner now no one who has not been in a situation like that can possibly imagine what its like we can try but we cant really picture being absolutely isolated with stars all around us not knowing if well ever be rescued no vertigo that can ever be experienced on earth can match itnot even seasickness at its worst and thats bad enough it was four hours before walter was rescued he was actually quite safe and probably knew itbut that didnt make any difference the ships radar had tracked him but until the drive was repaired it couldnt go after him when they did get him aboard he waswell lets say he was in a pretty bad way it took the best psychologists on earth almost a year to straighten him out and as weve seen the job wasnt finished properly and there was one factor that the psychologists could do nothing about myers paused wondering how indra was taking all this how it would affect her feelings toward franklin she seemed to have got over her initial shock she was not thank god the hysterical type it was so difficult to do anything with you see walter was married he had a wife and family on mars and was very fond of them his wife was a secondgeneration colonist the children of course thirdgeneration ones they had spent all their lives under martian gravity had been conceived and born in it and so they could never come to earth where they would be crushed under three times their normal weight at the same time walter could never go back into space we could patch up his mind so that he could function efficiently here on earth but that was the best we could do he could never again face free fall the knowledge that there was space all around him all the way out to the stars and so he was an exile on his own world unable ever to see his family again we did our best for him and i still think it was a good best this work here could use his skills but there were also profound psychological reasons why we thought it might suit him and would enable him to rebuild his life i think you probably know those reasons as well as i do indraif not better you are a marine biologist and know the links we have with the sea we have no such links with space and so we shall never feel at home thereat least as long as we are men i studied franklin while he was here he knew i was doing it and didnt mind all the while he was improving getting to love the work don was very pleased with his progresshe was the best pupil hed ever met and when i hearddont ask me howthat he was going around with you i was delighted for he has to rebuild his life all along the line you know i hope you dont mind me putting it this way but when i found he was spending his spare time with you and even making time to do it i knew he had stopped looking back and nowthis breakdown i dont mind admitting that im completely in the dark you say that you were looking up at the space station but that doesnt seem enough cause walter had a rather bad fear of heights when he came here but hed largely got over that besides he must have seen the station dozens of times in the morning or evening there must have been some other factor we dont know dr myers stopped his rapid delivery then said gently as if the thought had only just struck him tell me indra had you been making love no she said without hesitation or embarrassment there was nothing like that it was a little hard to believe but he knew it was the truth he could detectso clear and unmistakablethe note of regret in her voice i was wondering if he had any guilt feelings about his wife whether he knows it or not you probably remind him of her which is why he was attracted to you in the first place anyway that line of reasoning isnt enough to explain what happened so lets forget it all we know is that there was an attack and a very bad one giving him that sedative was the best thing you could have done in the circumstances youre quite sure that he never gave any indication of what he intended to do when you got him back to heron quite sure all he said was dont tell dr myers he said there was nothing you could do that thought myers grimly might well be true and he did not like the sound of it there was only one reason why a man might hide from the only person who could help him that was because he had decided he was now beyond help but he promised indra continued to see you in the morning myers did not reply by this time they both knew that that promise had been nothing more than a ruse indra still clung desperately to one last hope surely she said her voice quavering as if she did not really believe her own words if hed intended to dosomething drastiched have left a message for somebody myers looked at her sadly his mind now completely made up his parents are dead he replied he said goodby to his wife long ago what message was there for him to leave indra knew with a sickening certainty that he spoke the truth she might well be the only person on earth for whom franklin felt any affection and he had made his farewell with her reluctantly myers rose to his feet theres nothing we can do he said except to start a general search there may be a chance that hes just blowing off steam at full throttle and will creep in shamefaced some time this morning its happened before he patted indras bowed shoulders then helped her out of the chair dont be too upset my dear everyone will do his best but in his heart he knew it was too late it had been too late hours before and they were going through the motions of search and rescue because there were times when no one expected logic to be obeyed they walked together to the assistant chief instructors office where the ci and burley were waiting for them dr myers threw open the doorand stood paralyzed on the threshold for a moment he thought that he had two more patientsor that he had gone insane himself don and the chief instructor all distinctions of rank forgotten had their arms around each others shoulders and were shaking with hysterical laughter there was no doubt of the hysteria it was that of relief and there was equally no doubt about the laughter dr myers stared at this improbable scene for perhaps five seconds then glanced swiftly around the room at once he saw the message form lying on the floor where one of his temporarily disordered colleagues had dropped it without asking their permission he rushed forward and picked it up he had to read it several times before it made any sense then he too began to laugh as he had not done for years nine captain bert darryl was looking forward to a quiet trip if there was any justice in this world he was certainly due for one last time there had been that awkward affair with the cops at mackay the time before there had been that uncharted rock off lizard island and before that by crikey thered been that triggerhappy young fool who had used a nondetachable harpoon on a fifteenfoot tiger and had been towed all over the sea bed as far as one could tell by appearances his customers seemed a reasonable lot this time of course the sports agency always guaranteed their reliability as well as their creditbut all the same it was surprising what he sometimes got saddled with still a man had to earn a living and it cost a lot to keep this old bucket waterproof by an odd coincidence his customers always had the same namesmr jones mr robinson mr brown mr smith captain bert thought it was a crazy idea but that was just another of the agencys little ways it certainly made life interesting trying to figure out who they really were some of them were so cautious that they wore rubber face masks the whole tripyes even under their diving masks they would be the important boys who were scared of being recognized think of the scandal for instance if a supreme court judge or chief secretary of the space department was found poaching on a world food reservation captain bert thought of it and chuckled the little fiveberth sports cruiser was still forty miles off the outer edge of the reef feeling her way in from the pacific of course it was risky operating so near the capricorns right in enemy territory as it were but the biggest fish were here just because they were the best protected you had to take a chance if you wanted to keep your clients satisfied captain bert had worked out his tactics carefully as he always did there were never any patrols out at night and even if there were his longrange sonar would spot them and he could run for it so it would be perfectly safe creeping up during darkness getting into position just before dawn and pushing his eager beavers out of the air lock as soon as the sun came up he would lie doggo on the bottom keeping in touch through the radios if they got out of range theyd still have his lowpowered sonar beacon to home on and if they got too far away to pick up that serve em jolly well right he patted his jacket where the four blood chits reposed safely absolving him of all responsibility if anything happened to messrs smith jones robinson or brown there were times when he wondered if it was really any use considering these werent their real names but the agency told him not to worry captain bert was not the worrying type or he would have given up this job long ago at the moment messrs s j r and b were lying on their respective couches putting the final touches to the equipment they would not need until morning smith and jones had brandnew guns that had obviously never been fired before and their webbing was fitted with every conceivable underwater gadget captain bert looked at them sardonically they represented a type he knew very well they were the boys who were so keen on their equipment that they never did any shooting either with the guns or their cameras they would wander happily around the reef making such a noise that every fish within miles would know exactly what they were up to their beautiful guns which could drill a thousandpound shark at fifty feet would probably never be fired but they wouldnt really mind they would enjoy themselves now robinson was a very different matter his gun was slightly dented and about five years old it had seen service and he obviously knew how to handle it he was not one of those catalogueobsessed sportsmen who had to buy the current years model as soon as it came out like a woman who couldnt bear to be behind the fashion mr robinson captain bert decided would be the one who would bring back the biggest catch as for brownrobinsons partnerhe was the only one that captain bert hadnt been able to classify a wellbuilt strongfeatured man in the forties he was the oldest of the hunters and his face was vaguely familiar he was probably some official in the upper echelons of the state who had felt the need to sow a few wild oats captain bert who was constitutionally unable to work for the world state or any other employer could understand just how he felt there were more than a thousand feet of water below them and the reef was still miles ahead but one never took anything for granted in this business and captain berts eyes were seldom far from the dials and screens of the control board even while he watched his little crew preparing for their mornings fun the clear and tiny echo had barely appeared on the sonar scanner before he had fastened on to it big shark coming boys he announced jovially there was a general rush to the screen how do you know its a shark someone asked pretty sure to be couldnt be a whalethey cant leave the channel inside the reef sure its not a sub said one anxious voice naow look at the size of it a sub would be ten times as bright on the screen dont be a nervous nelly the questioner subsided duly abashed no one said anything for the next five minutes as the distant echo closed in toward the center of the screen itll pass within a quarter of a mile of us said mr smith what about changing course and seeing if we can make contact not a hope hell run for it as soon as he picks up our motors if we stopped still he might come and sniff us over anyway what would be the use you couldnt get at him its night and hes well below the depth where you could operate their attention was momentarily distracted by a large school of fishprobably tuna the captain saidwhich appeared on the southern sector of the screen when that had gone past the distinguishedlooking mr brown said thoughtfully surely a shark would have changed course by now captain bert thought so too and was beginning to be puzzled think well have a look at it he said wont do any harm he altered course imperceptibly the strange echo continued on its unvarying way it was moving quite slowly and there would be no difficulty in getting within visual distance without risk of collision at the point of nearest approach captain bert switched on the camera and the uv searchlightand gulped were rumbled boys its a cop there were four simultaneous gasps of dismay then a chorus of but you told us which the captain silenced with a few wellchosen words while he continued to study the screen something funny here he said i was right first time thats no subits only a torp so it cant detect us anyway they dont carry that kind of gear but what the hells it doing out here at night lets run for it pleaded several anxious voices shurrup shouted captain bert let me think he glanced at the depth indicator crikey he muttered this time in a much more subdued voice were a hundred fathoms down unless that lads breathing some fancy mixture hes had it he peered closely at the image on the tv screen it was hard to be certain but the figure strapped to the slowly moving torp seemed abnormally still yesthere was no doubt of it he could tell from the attitude of the head the pilot was certainly unconscious probably dead this is a bloody nuisance announced the skipper but theres nothing else to do weve got to fetch that guy in someone started to protest then thought better of it captain bert was right of course the later consequences would have to be dealt with as they arose but how are you going to do it asked smith we cant go outside at this depth it wont be easy admitted the captain its lucky hes moving so slowly i think i can flip him over he nosed in toward the torp making infinitely delicate adjustments with the controls suddenly there was a clang that made everybody jump except the skipper who knew when it was coming and exactly how loud it would be he backed away and breathed a sigh of relief made it first time he said smugly the torp had rolled over on its back with the helpless figure of its rider now dangling beneath it in his harness but instead of heading down into the depths it was now climbing toward the distant surface they followed it up to the twohundredfoot mark while captain bert gave his detailed instructions there was still a chance he told his passengers that the pilot might be alive but if he reached the surface hed certainly be deadcompression sickness would get him as he dropped from ten atmospheres to one so weve got to haul him in around the hundredandfiftyfoot levelno higherand then start staging him in the air lock well whos going to do it i cant leave the controls no one doubted that the captain was giving the single and sufficient reason and that he would have gone outside without hesitation had there been anyone else aboard who could operate the sub after a short pause smith said ive been three hundred feet down on normal air so have i interjected jones not at night of course he added thoughtfully they werent exactly volunteering but it would do they listened to the skippers instructions like men about to go over the top then put on their equipment and went reluctantly into the air lock fortunately they were in good training and he was able to bring them up to the full pressure in a couple of minutes ok boys he said im opening the doorhere you go it would have helped them could they have seen his searchlight but it had been carefully filtered to remove all visible light their hand torches were feeble glowworms by comparison as he watched them moving across to the stillascending torp jones went first while smith played out the line from the air lock both vessels were moving faster than a man could swim and it was necessary to play jones like a fish on a line so that as he trailed behind the sub he could work his way across to the torpedo he was probably not enjoying it thought the skipper but he managed to reach the torp on the second try after that the rest was straightforward jones cut out the torps motor and when the two vessels had come to a halt smith went to help him they unstrapped the pilot and carried him back to the sub his face mask was unflooded so there was still hope for him it was not easy to manhandle his helpless body into the tiny air lock and smith had to stay outside feeling horribly lonely while his partner went ahead and thus it was that thirty minutes later walter franklin woke in a surprising but not totally unfamiliar environment he was lying in a bunk aboard a small cruiserclass sub and five men were standing around him oddest of all four of the men had handkerchiefs tied over their faces so that he could only see their eyes he looked at the fifth manat his scarred and grizzled countenance and his rakish goatee the dirty nautical cap was really quite superfluous no one would have doubted that this was the skipper a raging headache made it hard for franklin to think straight he had to make several attempts before he could get out the words where am i never you mind mate replied the bearded character what we want to know is what the hell were you doing at a hundred fathoms with a standard compressedair set crikey hes fainted again the second time franklin revived he felt a good deal better and sufficiently interested in life to want to know what was going on around him he supposed he should be grateful to these people whoever they were but at the moment he felt neither relief nor disappointment at having been rescued whats all this for he said pointing to the conspiratorial handkerchiefs the skipper who was now sitting at the controls turned his head and answered laconically havent you worked out where you are yet no mean ter say you dont know who i am sorryi dont there was a grunt that might have signified disbelief or disappointment guess you must be one of the new boys im bert darryl and youre on board the sea lion those two gentlemen behind you risked their necks getting you in franklin turned in the direction indicated and looked at the blank triangles of linen thanks he said and then stopped unable to think of any further comment now he knew where he was and could guess what had happened so this was the famousor notorious depending on the point of viewcaptain darryl whose advertisements you saw in all the sporting and marine journals captain darryl the organizer of thrilling underwater safaris the intrepid and skillful hunterand the equally intrepid and skillful poacher whose immunity from prosecution had long been a source of cynical comment among the wardens captain darrylone of the few genuine adventurers of this regimented age according to some captain darryl the big phony according to others franklin now understood why the rest of the crew was masked this was one of the captains less legitimate enterprises and franklin had heard that on these occasions his customers were often from the very highest ranks of society no one else could afford to pay his fees it must cost a lot to run the sea lion even though captain darryl was reputed never to pay cash for anything and to owe money at every port between sydney and darwin franklin glanced at the anonymous figures around him wondering who they might be and whether he knew any of them only a halfhearted effort had been made to hide the powerful biggame guns piled on the other bunk just where was the captain taking his customers and what were they after in the circumstances he had better keep his eyes shut and learn as little as possible captain darryl had already come to the same conclusion you realize mate he said over his shoulder as he carefully blocked franklins view of the course settings that your presence aboard is just a little bit embarrassing still we couldnt let you drown even though you deserved it for a silly stunt like that the point iswhat are we going to do with you now you could put me ashore on heron we cant be very far away franklin smiled as he spoke to show how seriously he intended the suggestion to be taken it was strange how cheerful and lighthearted he now felt perhaps it was a merely physical reactionand perhaps he was really glad at having been given a second chance a new lease on life what a hope snorted the captain these gentlemen have paid for their days sport and they dont want you boy scouts spoiling it they can take off those handkerchiefs anyway they dont look very comfortableand if i recognize someone i wont give him away rather reluctantly the disguises were removed as he had expectedand hopedthere was no one here whom he knew either from photographs or direct contact only one thing for it said the captain well have to dump you somewhere before we go into action he scratched his head as he reviewed his marvelously detailed mental image of the capricorn group then came to a decision anyway were stuck with you for tonight and i guess well have to sleep in shifts if youd like to make yourself useful you can get to work in the galley aye aye sir said franklin the dawn was just breaking when he hit the sandy beach staggered to his feet and removed his flippers out there beyond the reef the sea lion was departing on her dubious business and the hunters were getting ready for their sortie though it was against his principles and his duties franklin could not help wishing them luck captain bert had promised to radio brisbane in four hours time and the message would be passed on to heron island immediately presumably that four hours would give the captain and his clients the time they needed to make their assault and to get clear of wfo waters franklin walked up the beach stripped off his wet equipment and clothes and lay down to watch the sunrise he had never dreamed he would see he had four hours to wait to wrestle with his thoughts and to face life once more but he did not need the time for he had made the decision hours ago his life was no longer his to throw away if he chose not when it had been given back to him at the risk of their own by men he had never met before and would never see again ten you realize of course said myers that im only the station doctor not a highpowered psychiatrist so ill have to send you back to professor stevens and his merry men is that really necessary asked franklin i dont think it is but i cant accept the responsibility if i was a gambler like don id take very long odds that youll never play this trick again but doctors cant afford to gamble and anyway i think it would be a good idea to get you off heron for a few days ill finish the course in a couple of weeks cant it wait until then dont argue with doctors waltyou cant win and if my arithmetic is correct a month and a half is not a couple of weeks the course can wait for a few days i dont think prof stevens will keep you very long hell probably give you a good dressingdown and will send you straight back meanwhile if youre interested in my views id like to get em off my chest go ahead first of all we know why you had that attack when you did smell is the most evocative of all the senses and now that youve told me that a spaceship air lock always smells of synthene the whole business makes sense it was hard luck that you got a whiff of the stuff just when you were looking at the space station the damn things nearly hypnotized me sometimes when ive watched it scuttling across the sky like some mad meteor but that isnt the whole explanation walter you had to be lets say emotionally sensitized to make you susceptible tell mehave you got a photograph of your wife here franklin seemed more puzzled than disturbed by the unexpected indeed apparently incongruous question yes he said why do you ask never mind may i have a look at it after a good deal of searching which myers was quite sure was unnecessary franklin produced a leather wallet and handed it over he did not look at myers as the doctor studied the woman who was now parted from her husband by laws more inviolable than any that man could make she was small and dark with lustrous brown eyes a single glance told myers all that he wanted to know yet he continued to gaze at the photograph with an unanalyzable mixture of compassion and curiosity how he wondered was franklins wife meeting her problem was she too rebuilding her life on that far world to which she was forever bound by genetics and gravity no forever was not quite accurate she could safely journey to the moon which had only the gravity of her native world but there would be no purpose in doing so for franklin could never face even the trifling voyage from earth to moon with a sigh dr myers closed the wallet even in the most perfect of social systems the most peaceful and contented of worlds there would still be heartbreak and tragedy and as man extended his powers over the universe he would inevitably create new evils and new problems to plague him yet apart from its details there was nothing really novel about this case all down the ages men had been separated often foreverfrom those they loved by the accident of geography or the malice of their fellows listen walt said myers as he handed back the wallet i know a few things about you that even prof stevens doesnt so heres my contribution whether you realize it consciously or not indra is like your wife that of course is why you were attracted to her in the first place at the same time that attraction has set up a conflict in your mind you dont want to be unfaithful even to someoneplease excuse me for speaking so bluntly who might as well be dead as far as you are concerned well do you agree with my analysis franklin took a long time to answer then he said at last i think there may be something in that but what am i to do this may sound cynical but there is an old saying which applies in this case cooperate with the inevitable once you admit that certain aspects of your life are fixed and have to be accepted you will stop fighting against them it wont be a surrender it will give you the energy you need for the battles that still have to be won what does indra really think about me the silly girls in love with you if thats what you want to know so the least you can do is to make it up to her for all the trouble youve caused then do you think i should marry again the fact that you can ask that question is a good sign but i cant answer it with a simple yes or no weve done our best to rebuild your professional life we cant give you so much help with your emotional one obviously its highly desirable for you to establish a firm and stable relationship to replace the one you have lost as for indrawell shes a charming and intelligent girl but no one can say how much of her present feelings are due to sympathy so dont rush matters let them take their time you cant afford to make any mistakes well that finishes the sermonexcept for one item part of the trouble with you walter franklin is that youve always been too independent and selfreliant you refused to admit that you had limitations that you needed help from anyone else so when you came up against something that was too big for you you really went to pieces and youve been hating yourself for it ever since now thats all over and done with even if the old walt franklin was a bit of a stinker we can make a better job of the mark ii dont you agree franklin gave a wry smile he felt emotionally exhausted yet at the same time most of the remaining shadows had lifted from his mind hard though it had been for him to accept help he had surrendered at last and he felt better for it thanks for the treatment doc he said i dont believe the specialists could do any better and im quite sure now that this trip back to prof stevens isnt necessary so am ibut youre going just the same now clear out and let me get on with my proper work of putting sticking plaster on coral cuts franklin was halfway through the door when he paused with a sudden anxious query i almost forgotdon particularly wants to take me out tomorrow in the sub will that be ok oh suredons big enough to look after you just get back in time for the noon plane thats all i ask as franklin walked away from the office and two rooms grandly called medical center he felt no resentment at having been ordered off the island he had received far more tolerance and consideration than he had expected perhaps more than he deserved all the mild hostility that had been focused upon him by the lessprivileged trainees had vanished at a stroke but it would be best for him to escape for a few days from an atmosphere that had become embarrassingly sympathetic in particular he found it hard to talk without a sense of strain with don and indra he thought again of dr myers advice and remembered the jolting leap his heart had given at the words the silly girls in love with you yet it would be unfair he knew to take advantage of the present emotional situation they could only know what they meant to each other when they had both had time for careful and mature thought put that way it seemed a little coldblooded and calculating if one was really in love did one stop to weigh the pros and cons he knew the answer to that as myers had said he could not afford any more mistakes it was far better to take his time and be certain than to risk the happiness of two lives the sun had barely lifted above the miles of reef extending to the east when don burley hauled franklin out of bed dons attitude toward him had undergone a change which it was not easy to define he had been shocked and distressed by what had occurred and had tried in his somewhat boisterous manner to express sympathy and understanding at the same time his amourpropre had been hurt he could not quite believe even now that indra had never been seriously interested in him but only in franklin whom he had never thought of as a rival it was not that he was jealous of franklin jealousy was an emotion beyond him he was worriedas most men are occasionally throughout their livesby his discovery that he did not understand women as well as he had believed franklin had already packed and his room looked bleak and bare even though he might be gone for only a few days the accommodation was needed too badly for it to be left vacant just to suit his convenience it served him right he told himself philosophically don was in a hurry which was not unusual but there was also a conspiratorial air about him as if he had planned some big surprise for franklin and was almost childishly anxious that everything should come off as intended in any other circumstances franklin would have suspected some practical joke but that could hardly be the explanation now by this time the little training sub had become practically an extension of his own body and he followed the courses don gave him until he knew by mental dead reckoning that they were somewhere out in the thirtymilewide channel between wistari reef and the mainland for some reason of his own which he refused to explain don had switched off the pilots main sonar screen so that franklin was navigating blind don himself could see everything that was in the vicinity by looking at the repeater set at the rear of the cabin and though franklin was occasionally tempted to glance back at it he managed to resist the impulse this was after all a legitimate part of his training one day he might have to navigate a sub that had been blinded by a breakdown of its underwater senses you can surface now said don at last he was trying to be casual but the undercurrent of excitement in his voice could not be concealed franklin blew the tanks and even without looking at the depth gauge knew when he broke surface by the unmistakable rolling of the sub it was not a comfortable sensation and he hoped that they would not stay here for long don gave one more glance at his private sonar screen then gestured to the hatch overhead open up he said lets have a look at the scenery we may ship some water protested franklin it feels pretty rough with the two of us in that hatch not much is going to leak past hereput on this cape thatll keep the spray out of the works it seemed a crazy idea but don must have a good reason overhead a tiny elliptical patch of sky appeared as the outer seal of the conning tower opened don scrambled up the ladder first then franklin followed blinking his eyes against the windswept spray yes don had known what he was doing there was little wonder that he had been so anxious to make this trip before franklin left the island in his own way don was a good psychologist and franklin felt an inexpressible gratitude toward him for this was one of the great moments of his life he could think of only one other to match it the moment when he had first seen earth in all its heartstopping beauty floating against the infinitely distant background of the stars this scene also filled his soul with the same awe the same sense of being in the presence of cosmic forces the whales were moving north and he was among them during the night the leaders must have passed through the queensland gate on the way to the warm seas in which their young could be safely born a living armada was all around him plowing steadfastly through the waves with effortless power the great dark bodies emerged streaming from the water then sank with scarcely a ripple back into the sea as franklin watched too fascinated to feel any sense of danger one of the enormous beasts surfaced less than forty feet away there was a roaring whistle of air as it emptied its lungs and he caught a mercifully weakened breath of the fetid air a ridiculously tiny eye stared at himan eye that seemed lost in the monstrous misshapen head for a moment the two mammalsthe biped who had abandoned the sea the quadruped who had returned to itregarded each other across the evolutionary gulf that separated them what did a man look like to a whale franklin asked himself and wondered if there was any way of finding the answer then the titanic bulk tilted down into the sea the great flukes lifted themselves into the air and the waters flowed back to fill the sudden void a distant clap of thunder made him look toward the mainland half a mile away the giants were playing as he watched a shape so strange that it was hard to relate it to any of the films and pictures he had seen emerged from the waves with breathtaking slowness and hung poised for a moment completely out of the water as a ballet dancer seems at the climax of his leap to defy gravity so for an instant the whale appeared to hang upon the horizon then with that same unhurried grace it tumbled back into the sea and seconds later the crash of the impact came echoing over the waves the sheer slowness of that huge leap gave it a dreamlike quality as if the sense of time had been distorted nothing else conveyed so clearly to franklin the immense size of the beasts that now surrounded him like moving islands rather belatedly he wondered what would happen if one of the whales surfaced beneath the sub or decided to take too close an interest in it no need to worry don reassured him they know who we are sometimes theyll come and rub against us to remove parasites and then it gets a bit uncomfortable as for bumping into us accidentallythey can see where theyre going a good deal better than we can as if to refute this statement a streamlined mountain emerged dripping from the sea and showered water down upon them the sub rocked crazily and for a moment franklin feared it was going to overturn then it righted itself and he realized that he could quite literally reach out and touch the barnacleencrusted head now lying on the waves the weirdly shaped mouth opened in a prodigious yawn the hundreds of strips of whalebone fluttering like a venetian blind in a breeze had he been alone franklin would have been scared stiff but don seemed the complete master of the situation he leaned out of the hatch and yelled in the direction of the whales invisible ear move over momma were not your baby the great mouth with its hanging draperies of bone snapped shut the beady little eyestrangely like a cows and seemingly not much largerlooked at them with what might have been a hurt expression then the sub rocked once more and the whale was gone its quite safe you see don explained theyre peaceful goodnatured beasts except when they have their calves with them just like any other cattle but would you get this close to any of the toothed whales the sperm whale for instance that depends if it was an old rogue malea real moby dicki wouldnt care to try it same with killer whales they might think i was good eating though i could scare them off easily enough by turning on the hooter i once got into a harem of about a dozen sperm whales and the ladies didnt seem to mind even though some of them had calves with them nor did the old man oddly enough i suppose he knew i wasnt a rival he paused thoughtfully then continued that was the only time ive actually seen whales mating it was pretty aweinspiringgave me such an inferiority complex it put me off my stroke for a week how many would you say there are in this school asked franklin oh about a hundred the recorders at the gate will give the exact figure so you can say there are at least five thousand tons of the best meal and oil swimming around usa couple of million dollars if its worth a penny doesnt all that cash make you feel good no said franklin and im damn sure it doesnt make any difference to you now i know why you like this job and theres no need to put on an act about it don made no attempt to answer they stood together in the cramped hatchway not feeling the spray upon their faces sharing the same thoughts and emotions as the mightiest animals the world had ever seen drove purposefully past them to the north it was then that franklin knew with a final certainty that his life was firmly set upon its new course though much had been taken from him which he would never cease to regret he had passed the stage of futile grief and solitary brooding he had lost the freedom of space but he had won the freedom of the seas that was enough for any man eleven confidential to be kept in sealed envelope attached is the medical report on walter franklin who has now successfully completed his training and has qualified as third warden with the highest rating ever recorded in view of certain complaints from senior members of establishment and personnel branch that earlier reports were too technical for comprehension i am giving this summary in language understandable even to administrative officers despite a number of personality defects wfs capability rating places him in that small group from which future heads of technical departments must be drawna group so desperately small that as i have frequently pointed out the very existence of the state is threatened unless we can enlarge it the accident which eliminated wf from the space service in which he would have undoubtedly had a distinguished career left him in full possession of all his talents and presented us with an opportunity which it would have been criminal to waste not only did it give us a chance of studying what has since become the classic textbook case of astrophobia but it offered us a striking challenge in rehabilitation the analogies between sea and space have often been pointed out and a man used to one can readily adapt to the other in this case however the differences between the two media were equally important at the simplest level the fact that the sea is a continuous and sustaining fluid in which vision is always limited to no more than a few yards gave wf the sense of security he had lost in space the fact that toward the end of his training he attempted suicide may at first appear to argue against the correctness of our treatment this is not the case the attempt was due to a combination of quite unforeseeable factors and its outcome as often happens was an improvement in the stability of the subject the method chosen for the attempt is also highly significant in itself and proves that we had made a correct choice of wfs new vocation the seriousness of the attempt may also be questioned had wf been really determined to kill himself he would have chosen a simpler and less fallible method of doing so now that the subject has reestablishedapparently successfullyhis emotional life and has shown only trivial symptoms of disturbance i am confident that we need expect no more trouble above all it is important that we interfere with him as little as possible his independence and originality of mind though no longer as exaggerated as they were are a fundamental part of his personality and will largely determine his future progress only time will show whether all the skill and effort lavished on this case will be repaid in cents and dollars even if it is not those engaged upon it have already received their reward in the rebuilding of a life which will certainly be useful and may be invaluable ian k stevens director division of applied psychiatry world health organization part two the warden twelve second warden walter franklin was having his monthly shave when the emergency call came through it had always seemed a little surprising to him that after so many years of research the biochemists had not yet found an inhibitor that would put ones bristles permanently out of action still one should not be ungrateful only a couple of generations ago incredible though it seemed men had been forced to shave themselves every day using a variety of complicated expensive and sometimes lethal instruments franklin did not stop to wipe the layer of cream from his face when he heard the shrill whining of the communicator alarm he was out of the bathroom through the kitchen and into the hall before the sound had died away and the instrument had been able to get its second breath as he punched the receive button the screen lighted up and he was looking into the familiar but now harassed face of the headquarters operator youre to report for duty at once mr franklin she said breathlessly whats the trouble its farms sir the fence is down somewhere and one of the herds has broken through its eating the spring crop and weve got to get it out as quickly as we can oh is that all said franklin ill be over at the dock in ten minutes it was an emergency all right but not one about which he could feel very excited of course farms would be yelling its head off as its production quota was being whittled down by thousands of halfton nibbles but he was secretly on the side of the whales if theyd managed to break into the great plankton prairies then good luck to them whats all the fuss about said indra as she came out of the bedroom her long dark hair looking attractive even at this time of the morning as it hung in lustrous tresses over her shoulders when franklin told her she appeared worried its a bigger emergency than you seem to think she said unless you act quickly you may have some very sick whales on your hands the spring overturn was only two weeks ago and its the biggest one weve ever had so your greedy pets will be gorging themselves silly franklin realized that she was perfectly right the plankton farms were no affair of his and formed a completely independent section of the marine division but he knew a great deal about them since they were an alternative and to some extent rival method of getting food from the sea the plankton enthusiasts claimed with a good deal of justice that crop growing was more efficient than herding since the whales themselves fed on the plankton and were therefore farther down the food chain why waste ten pounds of plankton they argued to produce one pound of whale when you could harvest it directly the debate had been in progress for at least twenty years and so far neither side could claim to have won sometimes the argument had been quite acrimonious and had echoed on an infinitely larger and more sophisticated scale the rivalry between homesteaders and cattle barons in the days when the american midwest was being settled but unfortunately for latterday mythmakers competing departments of the marine division of the world food organization fought each other purely with official minutes and the efficient but unspectacular weapons of bureaucracy there were no gun fighters prowling the range and if the fence had gone down it would be due to purely technical troubles not midnight sabotage in the sea as on the land all life depends upon vegetation and the amount of vegetation in turn depends upon the mineral content of the medium in which it growsthe nitrates phosphates and scores of other basic chemicals in the ocean there is always a tendency for these vital substances to accumulate in the depths far below the regions where light penetrates and therefore plants can exist and grow the upper few hundred feet of the sea is the primary source of its life everything below that level preys at second or third hand on the food formed above every spring as the warmth of the new year seeps down into the ocean the waters far below respond to the invisible sun they expand and rise rifting to the surface in untold billions of tons the salts and minerals they bear thus fertilized by food from below and sun from above the floating plants multiply with explosive violence and the creatures which browse upon them flourish accordingly and so spring comes to the meadows of the sea this was the cycle that had repeated itself at least a billion times before man appeared on the scene and now he had changed it not content with the upwelling of minerals produced by nature he had sunk his atomic generators at strategic spots far down into the sea where the raw heat they produced would start immense submerged fountains lifting their chemical treasure toward the fruitful sun this artificial enhancement of the natural overturn had been one of the most unexpected as well as the most rewarding of all the many applications of nuclear energy by this means alone the output of food from the sea had been increased by almost ten per cent and now the whales were busily doing their best to restore the balance the roundup would have to be a combined sea and air operation there were too few of the subs and they were far too slow to do the job unassisted three of themincluding franklins oneman scoutwere being flown to the scene of the breakthrough by a cargo plane which would drop them and then cooperate by spotting the movements of the whales from the air if they had scattered over too large an area for the subs sonar to pick them up two other planes would also try to scare the whales by dropping noise generators near them but this technique had never worked well in the past and no one really expected much success from it now within twenty minutes of the alarm franklin was watching the enormous foodprocessing plants of pearl harbor falling below as the jets of the freighter hauled him up into the sky even now he was still not fond of flying and tried to avoid it when he could but it no longer worried him and he could look down on the world beneath without qualms a hundred miles east of hawaii the sea turned suddenly from blue to gold the moving fields rich with the years first crop covered the pacific clear out to the horizon and showed no sign of ending as the plane raced on toward the rising sun here and there the milelong skimmers of the floating harvesters lay upon the surface like the enigmatic toys of some giant children while beside them smaller and more compact were the pontoons and rafts of the concentration equipment it was an impressive sight even in these days of mammoth engineering achievements but it did not move franklin he could not become excited over a billion tons of assorted diatoms and shrimpsnot even though he knew that they fed a quarter of the human race just passing over the hawaiian corridor said the pilots voice from the speaker we should see the break in a minute i can see it now said one of the other wardens leaning past franklin and pointing out to sea there they arehaving the time of their lives it was a spectacle which must be making the poor farmers tear their hair franklin suddenly remembered an old nursery rhyme he had not thought of for at least thirty years little boy blue come blow your horn the sheeps in the meadow the cows in the corn there was no doubt that the cows were in the corn and little boy blue was going to have a busy time getting them out far below myriads of narrow swathes were being carved in the endless yellow sea as the ravenous slowly moving mountains ate their way into the rich plankton meadows a blue line of exposed water marked the track of each whale as it meandered through what must be a cetacean heavena heaven from which it was franklins job to expel it as promptly as possible the three wardens after a final radio briefing left the cabin and went down to the hold where the little subs were already hanging from the davits which would lower them into the sea there would be no difficulty about this operation what might not be so easy would be getting them back again and if the sea became rough they might have to go home under their own power it seemed strange to be inside a submarine inside an airplane but franklin had little time for such thoughts as he went through the routine cockpit drill then the speaker on his control panel remarked hovering at thirty feet now opening cargo hatches stand by number one sub franklin was number two the great cargo craft was poised so steadily and the hoists moved down so smoothly that he never felt any impact as the sub dropped into its natural element then the three scouts were fanning out along the tracks that had been assigned to them like mechanized sheep dogs rounding up a flock almost at once franklin realized that this operation was not going to be as simple as it looked the sub was driving through a thick soup that completely eliminated vision and even interfered seriously with sonar what was still more serious the hydrojet motors were laboring unhappily as their impellers chewed through the mush he could not afford to get his propulsion system clogged the best thing to do would be to dive below the plankton layer and not to surface until it was absolutely necessary three hundred feet down the water was merely murky and though vision was still impossible he could make good speed he wondered if the greedily feasting whales above his head knew of his approach and realized that their idyll was coming to an end on the sonar screen he could see their luminous echoes moving slowly across the ghostly mirror of the airwater surface which his sound beams could not penetrate it was odd how similar the surface of the sea looked from below both to the naked eye and to the acoustical senses of the sonar the characteristically compact little echoes of the two other subs were moving out to the flanks of the scattered herd franklin glanced at the chronometer in less than a minute the drive was due to begin he switched on the external microphones and listened to the voices of the sea how could anyone have ever thought that the sea was silent even mans limited hearing could detect many of its soundsthe clashing of chitinous claws the moan of great boulders made restive by the ocean swell the highpitched squeak of porpoises the unmistakable flick of a sharks tail as it suddenly accelerates on a new course but these were merely the sounds in the audible spectrum to listen to the full music of the sea one must go both below and above the range of human hearing this was a simple enough task for the subs frequency converters if he wished franklin could tune in to any sounds from almost a million cycles a second down to vibrations as sluggish as the slow opening of an ancient rusty door he set the receiver to the broadest band and at once his mind began to interpret the multitudinous messages that came pouring into the little cabin from the watery world outside the manmade noises he dismissed at once the sounds of his own sub and the more distant whines of his companion vessels were largely eliminated by the special filters designed for that purpose but he could just detect the distinctive whistles of the three sonar setshis own almost blanketing the others and beyond those the faint and faroff beepbeepbeep of the hawaiian corridor the double fence which was supposed to channel the whales safely through the rich sea farm sent out of its pulses at fivesecond intervals and though the nearest portion of the fence was out of action the more distant parts of the sonic barrier could be clearly heard the pulses were curiously distorted and drawnout into a faint continuous echo as each new burst of sound was followed at once by the delayed waves from more and more remote regions of the fence franklin could hear each pulse running away into the distance as sometimes a clap of thunder may be heard racing across the sky against this background the sounds of the natural world stood out sharp and clear from all directions with never a moments silence came the shrill shrieks and squealings of the whales as they talked to one another or merely gave vent to their high spirits and enjoyment franklin could distinguish between the voices of the males and the females but he was not one of those experts who could identify individuals and even interpret what they were trying to express there is no more eerie sound in all the world than the screaming of a herd of whales when one moves among it in the depths of the sea franklin had only to close his eyes and he could imagine that he was lost in some demonhaunted forest while ghosts and goblins closed in upon him could hector berlioz have heard this banshee chorus he would have known that nature had already anticipated his dream of the witches sabbath but weirdness lies only in unfamiliarity and this sound was now part of franklins life it no longer gave him nightmares as it had sometimes done in his early days indeed the main emotion that it now inspired in him was an affectionate amusement together with a slight surprise that such enormous animals produced such falsetto screams yet there was a memory that the sound of the sea sometimes evoked it no longer had power to hurt him though it could still fill his heart with a wistful sadness he remembered all the times he had spent in the signals rooms of space ships or space stations listening to the radio waves coming in as the monitors combed the spectrum in their automatic search sometimes there had been like these same ghostly voices calling in the night the sound of distant ships or beacons or the torrents of highspeed code as the colonies talked with mother earth and always one could hear a perpetual murmuring background to mans feeble transmitters the endless susurration of the stars and galaxies themselves as they drenched the whole universe with radiation the chronometer hand came around to zero it had not scythed away the first second before the sea erupted in a hellish cacophony of sounda rising and falling ululation that made franklin reach swiftly for the volume control the sonic mines had been dropped and he felt sorry for any whales who were unlucky enough to be near them almost at once the pattern of echoes on the screen began to change as the terrified beasts started to flee in panic toward the west franklin watched closely preparing to head off any part of the herd that looked like it would miss the gap in the fence and turn back into the farms the noise generators must have been improved he decided since the last time this trick had been triedor else these whales were more amenable only a few stragglers tried to break away and it was no more than ten minutes work to round them up on the right path and scare them back with the subs own sirens half an hour after the mines had been dropped the entire herd had been funneled back through the invisible gap in the fence and was milling around inside the narrow corridor there was nothing for the subs to do but to stand by until the engineers had carried out their repairs and the curtain of sound was once more complete no one could claim that it was a famous victory it was just another days work a minor battle in an endless campaign already the excitement of the chase had died away and franklin was wondering how long it would be before the freighter could hoist them out of the ocean and fly them back to hawaii this was after all supposed to be his day off and he had promised to take peter down to waikiki and start teaching him how to swim even when he is merely standing by a good warden never lets his attention stray for long from his sonar screen every three minutes without any conscious thought franklin switched to the longrange scan and tilted the transmitter down toward the sea bed just to keep track of what was going on around him he did not doubt that his colleagues were doing exactly the same between wondering how long it would be before they were relieved at the very limit of his range ten miles away and almost two miles down a faint echo had crawled onto the edge of the screen franklin looked at it with mild interest then his brows knit in perplexity it must be an unusually large object to be visible at such a distancesomething quite as large as a whale but no whale could be swimming at such a depth though sperm whales had been encountered almost a mile down this was beyond the limits at which they could operate fabulous divers though they were a deepsea shark possibly thought franklin it would do no harm to have a closer look at it he locked the scanner onto the distant echo and expanded the image as far as the screen magnification would allow it was too far away to make out any detail but he could see now that he was looking at a long thin objectand that it was moving quite rapidly he stared at it for a moment then called his colleagues unnecessary chatter was discouraged on operations but here was a minor mystery that intrigued him sub two calling he said ive a large echo bearing degrees range miles depth miles looks like another sub you know if anyone else is operating around here sub one calling sub two came the first reply thats outside my range could be a research department sub down there how big would you say your echo is about a hundred feet long maybe more its doing over ten knots sub three calling theres no research vessel around here the nautilus iv is laid up for repairs and the cousteaus in the atlantic must be a fish youve got hold of there arent any fish this size have i permission to go after it i think we ought to check up permission granted answered sub one well hold the gap here keep in touch franklin swung the sub around to the south and brought the little vessel up to maximum speed with a smooth rush of power the echo he was chasing was already too deep for him to reach but there was always the chance that it might come back to the surface even if it did not he would be able to get a much clearer image when he had shortened his range he had traveled only two miles when he saw that the chase was hopeless there could be no doubt his quarry had detected either the vibrations of his motor or his sonar and was plunging at full speed straight down to the bottom he managed to get within four miles and then the signal was lost in the confused maze of echoes from the ocean bed his last glimpse of it confirmed his earlier impression of great length and relative thinness but he was still unable to make out any details of its structure so it got away from you said sub one i thought it would then you know what it was nonor does anyone else and if youll take my advice you wont talk to any reporters about it if you do youll never live it down momentarily frozen with astonishment franklin stared at the little loudspeaker from which the words had just come so they had not been pulling his leg as he had always assumed he remembered some of the tales he had heard in the bar at heron island and wherever wardens gathered together after duty he had laughed at them then but now he knew that the tales were true that nervous echo skittering hastily out of range had been nothing less than the great sea serpent indra who was still doing parttime work at the hawaii aquarium when her household duties permitted was not as impressed as her husband had expected in fact her first comment was somewhat deflating yes but which sea serpent you know there are at least three totally different types i certainly didnt well first of all theres a giant eel which has been seen on three or four occasions but never properly identified though its larvae were caught back in the s its known to grow up to sixty feet long and thats enough of a sea serpent for most people but the really spectacular one is the oarfishregalecus glesne thats got a face like a horse a crest of brilliant red quills like an indian braves headdress and a snakelike body which may be seventy feet long since we know that these things exist how do you expect us to be surprised at anything the sea can produce what about the third type you mentioned thats the one we havent identified or even described we just call it x because people still laugh when you talk about sea serpents the only thing that we know about it is that it undoubtedly exists that its extremely sly and that it lives in deep water one day well catch it but when we do it will probably be through pure luck franklin was very thoughtful for the rest of the evening he did not like to admit that despite all the instruments that man now used to probe the sea despite his own continual patrolling of the depths the ocean still held many secrets and would retain them for ages yet to come and he knew that though he might never see it again he would be haunted all his life by the memory of that distant tantalizing echo as it descended swiftly into the abyss that was its home thirteen there are many misconceptions about the glamour of a wardens life franklin had never shared them so he was neither surprised nor disappointed that so much of his time was spent on long uneventful patrols far out at sea indeed he welcomed them they gave him time to think yet not time to broodand it was on these lonely missions in the living heart of the sea that his last fears were shed and his mental scars finally healed the wardens year was dominated by the pattern of whale migration but that pattern was itself continually changing as new areas of the sea were fenced and fertilized he might spend summer moving cautiously through the polar ice and winter beating back and forth across the equator sometimes he would operate from shore stations sometimes from mobile bases like the rorqual the pequod or the cachelot one season he might be wholly concerned with the great whalebone or baleen whales who literally strained their food from the sea as they swam mouth open through the rich plankton soup and another season he would have to deal with their very different cousins the fierce toothed cetaceans of whom the sperm whales were the most important representatives these were no gentle herbivores but pursued and fought their monstrous prey in the lightless deep half a mile from the last rays of the sun there would be weeks or even months when a warden would never see a whale the bureau had many calls on its equipment and personnel and whales were not its only business everyone who had dealings with the sea appeared to come sooner or later to the bureau of whales with an appeal for help sometimes the requests were tragic several times a year subs were sent on usually fruitless searches for drowned sportsmen or explorers at the other extreme there was a standing joke that a senator had once asked the sydney office to locate his false teeth lost when the bondi surf worked its will upon him it was said that he had received with great promptness the footwide jaws of a tiger shark with an apologetic note saying that these were the only unwanted teeth that an extensive search had been able to find off bondi beach some tasks that came the wardens way had a certain glamour and were eagerly sought after when they arose a very small and understaffed section of the bureau of fisheries was concerned with pearls and during the slack season wardens were sometimes detached from their normal work and allowed to assist on the pearl beds franklin had one such tour of duty in the persian gulf it was straightforward work not unlike gardening and since it involved diving to depths never greater than two hundred feet simple compressedair equipment was used and the diver employed a torpedo for moving around the best areas for pearl cultivation had been carefully populated with selected stock and the main problem was protecting the oysters from their natural enemiesparticularly starfish and rays when they had time to mature they were collected and carried back to the surface for inspectionone of the few jobs that no one had ever been able to mechanize any pearls discovered belonged of course to the bureau of fisheries but it was noticeable that the wives of all the wardens posted to this duty very soon afterward sported pearl necklaces or earringsand indra was no exception to this rule she had received her necklace the day she gave birth to peter and with the arrival of his son it seemed to franklin that the old chapter of his life had finally closed it was not true of course he could never forgetnor did he wish to that irene had given him roy and rupert on a world which was now as remote to him as a planet of the farthest star but the ache of that irrevocable parting had subsided at last for no grief can endure forever he was gladthough he had once bitterly resented it that it was impossible to talk to anyone on mars or indeed anywhere in space beyond the orbit of the moon the sixminute time lag for the round trip even when the planet was at its nearest made conversation out of the question so he could never torture himself by feeling in the presence of irene and the boys by calling them up on the visiphone every christmas they exchanged recordings and talked over the events of the year apart from occasional letters that was the only personal contact they now had and the only one that franklin needed there was no way of telling how well irene had adjusted to her virtual widowhood the boys must have helped but there were times when franklin wished that she had married again for their sakes as well as hers yet somehow he had never been able to suggest it and she had never raised the subject even when he had made this step himself did she resent indra that again was hard to tell perhaps some jealousy was inevitable indra herself during the occasional quarrels that punctuated their marriage made it clear that she sometimes disliked the thought of being only the second woman in franklins life such quarrels were rare and after the birth of peter they were rarer a married couple forms a dynamically unstable system until the arrival of the first child converts it from a double to a triple group franklin was as happy now as he had ever hoped to be his family gave him the emotional security he needed his work provided the interest and adventure which he had sought in space only to lose again there was more life and wonder in the sea than in all the endless empty leagues between the planets and it was seldom now that his heart ached for the blue beauty of the crescent earth the swirling silver mist of the milky way or the tense excitement of landfall on the moons of mars at the end of a long voyage the sea had begun to shape his life and thought as it must that of all men who try to master it and learn its secrets he felt a kinship with all the creatures that moved throughout its length and depth even when they were enemies which it was his duty to destroy but above all he felt a sympathy and an almost mystical reverence of which he was half ashamed toward the great beasts whose destinies he ruled he believed that most wardens knew that feeling though they were careful to avoid admitting it in their shoptalk the nearest they came to it was when they accused each other of being whale happy a somewhat indefinable term which might be summed up as acting more like a whale than a man in a given situation it was a form of identification without which no warden could be really good at his job but there were times when it could become too extreme the classic casewhich everyone swore was perfectly truewas that of the senior warden who felt he was suffocating unless he brought his sub up to blow every ten minutes being regardedand regarding themselvesas the elite of the worlds army of underwater experts the wardens were always called upon when there was some unusual job that no one else cared to perform sometimes these jobs were so suicidal that it was necessary to explain to the wouldbe client that he must find another way out of his difficulties but occasionally there was no other way and risks had to be taken the bureau still remembered how chief warden kircher back in had gone up the giant intake pipes through which the cooling water flowed into the fusion power plant supplying half the south american continent one of the filter grilles had started to come loose and could be fixed only by a man on the spot with strong ropes tied around his body to prevent him from being sucked through the wire meshing kircher had descended into the roaring darkness he had done the job and returned safely but that was the last time he ever went under water so far all franklins missions had been fairly conventional ones he had had to face nothing as hairraising as kirchers exploit and was not sure how he would react if such an occasion arose of course he could always turn down any assignment that involved abnormal risks his contract was quite specific on that point but the suicide clause as it was sardonically called was very much a dead letter any warden who invoked it except under the most extreme circumstances would incur no displeasure from his superiors but he would thereafter find it very hard to live with his colleagues franklins first operation beyond the call of duty did not come his way for almost five yearsfive busy crowded yet in retrospect curiously uneventful years but when it came it more than made up for the delay fourteen the chief accountant dropped his tables and charts on the desk and peered triumphantly at his little audience over the rims of his antiquated spectacles so you see gentlemen he said theres no doubt about it in this area herehe stabbed at the map againsperm whale casualties have been abnormally high its no longer a question of the usual random variations in the census numbers during the migrations of the last five years no less than nine plus or minus two whales have disappeared in this rather small area now as you are all aware the sperm whale has no natural enemies except for the orcas that occasionally attack small females with calves but we are quite sure that no killer packs have broken into this area for several years and at least three adult males have disappeared in our opinion that left only one possibility the sea bed here is slightly less than four thousand feet down which means that a sperm whale can just reach it with a few minutes time for hunting on the bottom before it has to return for air now ever since it was discovered that physeter feeds almost exclusively on squids naturalists have wondered whether a squid can ever win when a whale attacks it the general opinion was that it couldnt because the whale is much larger and more powerful but we must remember that even today no one knows now big the giant squid does grow the biology section tells me that tentacles of bathyteutis maximus have been found up to eighty feet long moreover a squid would only have to keep a whale held down for a matter of a few minutes at this depth and the animal would drown before it could get back to the surface so a couple of years ago we formulated the theory that in this area there lives at least one abnormally large squid weahemchristened him percy until last week percy was only a theory then as you know whale s was found dead on the surface badly mauled and with its body covered with the typical scars caused by squid claws and suckers i would like you to look at this photograph he pulled a set of large glossy prints out of his brief case and passed them around each showed a small portion of a whales body which was mottled with white streaks and perfectly circular rings a foot ruler lay incongruously in the middle of the picture to give an idea of the scale those gentlemen are sucker marks they go up to six inches in diameter i think we can say that percy is no longer a theory the question is what do we do about him he is costing us at least twenty thousand dollars a year i should welcome any suggestions there was a brief silence while the little group of officials looked thoughtfully at the photographs then the director said ive asked mr franklin to come along and give his opinion what do you say walter can you deal with percy if i can find him yes but the bottoms pretty rugged down there and it might be a long search i couldnt use a normal sub of coursethered be no safety margin at that depth especially if percy started putting on the squeeze incidentally what size do you think he is the chief accountant usually so glib with figures hesitated for an appreciable instant before replying this isnt my estimate he said apologetically but the biologists say he may be a hundred and fifty feet long there were some subdued whistles but the director seemed unimpressed long ago he had learned the truth of the old clichй that there were bigger fish in the sea than ever came out of it he knew also that in a medium where gravity set no limit to size a creature could continue to grow almost indefinitely as long as it could avoid death and of all the inhabitants of the sea the giant squid was perhaps the safest from attack even its one enemy the sperm whale could not reach it if it remained below the fourthousandfoot level there are dozens of ways we can kill percy if we can locate him put in the chief biologist explosives poison electrocutionany of them would do but unless theres no alternative i think we should avoid killing he must be one of the biggest animals alive on this planet and it would be a crime to murder him please dr roberts protested the director may i remind you that this bureau is only concerned with food productionnot with research or the conservation of any animals except whales and i do think that murder is rather a strong term to apply to an overgrown mollusk dr roberts seemed quite unabashed by the mild reprimand i agree sir he said cheerfully that production is our main job and that we must always keep economic factors in mind at the same time were continually cooperating with the department of scientific research and this seems another case where we can work together to our mutual advantage in fact we might even make a profit in the long run go on said the director a slight twinkle in his eye he wondered what ingenious plan the scientists who were supposed to be working for him had cooked up with their opposite numbers in research no giant squid has ever been captured alive simply because weve never had the tools for the job it would be an expensive operation but if we are going to chase percy anyway the additional cost should not be very great so i suggest that we try to bring him back alive no one bothered to ask how if dr roberts said it could be done that meant he had already worked out a plan of campaign the director as usual bypassed the minor technical details involved in hauling up several tons of fighting squid from a depth of a mile and went straight to the important point will research pay for any of this and what will you do with percy when youve caught him unofficially research will provide the additional equipment if we make the subs and pilots available well also need that floating dock we borrowed from maintenance last year its big enough to hold two whales so it can certainly hold one squid therell be some additional expenditure here extra aeration plant for the water electrified mesh to stop percy climbing out and so on in fact i suggest that we use the dock as a lab while were studying him and after that why we sell him the demand for hundredandfiftyfoot squids as household pets would seem to be rather small like an actor throwing away his best line dr roberts casually produced his trump card if we can deliver percy alive and in good condition marineland will pay fifty thousand dollars for him that was professor miltons first informal offer when i spoke to him this morning ive no doubt that we can get more than that ive even been wondering if we could arrange things on a royalty basis after all a giant squid would be the biggest attraction marineland ever had research was bad enough grumbled the director now it looks as if youre trying to get us involved in the entertainment business still as far as im concerned it sounds fairly plausible if accounts can convince me that the project is not too expensive and if no other snags turn up well go ahead with it that is of course if mr franklin and his colleagues think it can be done theyre the people wholl have to do the work if dr roberts has any practical plan ill be glad to discuss it with him its certainly a very interesting project that thought franklin was the understatement of the year but he was not the sort of man who ever waxed too enthusiastic over any enterprise having long ago decided that this always resulted in eventual disappointment if operation percy came off it would be the most exciting job he had ever had in his five years as a warden but it was too good to be true something would turn up to cancel the whole project it did not less than a month later he was dropping down to the sea bed in a specially modified deepwater scout two hundred feet behind him don burley was following in a second machine it was the first time they had worked together since those faroff days on heron island but when franklin had been asked to choose his partner he had automatically thought of don this was the chance of a lifetime and don would never forgive him if he selected anyone else franklin sometimes wondered if don resented his own rapid rise in the service five years ago don had been a first warden franklin a completely inexperienced trainee now they were both first wardens and before long franklin would probably be promoted again he did not altogether welcome this for though he was ambitious enough he knew that the higher he rose in the bureau the less time he would spend at sea perhaps don knew what he was doing it was very hard to picture him settling down in an office better try your lights said dons voice from the speaker doc roberts wants me to get a photograph of you right franklin replied here goes myyou do look pretty if i was another squid im sure id find you irresistible swing broadside a minute thanks talk about a christmas tree its the first time ive ever seen one making ten knots at six hundred fathoms franklin grinned and switched off the illuminations this idea of dr roberts was simple enough but it remained to be seen if it would work in the lightless abyss many creatures carry constellations of luminous organs which they can switch on or off at will and the giant squid with its enormous eyes is particularly sensitive to such lights it uses them not only to lure its prey into its clutches but also to attract its mates if squids were as intelligent as they were supposed to be thought franklin percy would soon see through his disguise it would be ironic however if a deepdiving sperm whale was deceived and he had an unwanted fight on his hands the rocky bottom was now only five hundred feet below every detail of it clearly traced on the shortrange sonar scanner it looked like an unpromising place for a search there might be countless caves here in which percy could hide beyond all hope of detection on the other hand the whales had detected himto their cost and anything that physeter can do franklin told himself my sub can do just as well were in luck said don the waters as clear as ive ever seen it down here as long as we dont stir up any mud well be able to see a couple of hundred feet that was important franklins luminous lures would be useless if the water was too turbid for them to be visible he switched on the external tv camera and quickly located the faint glow of dons starboard light two hundred feet away yes this was extremely good luck it should simplify their task enormously franklin tuned in to the nearest beacon and fixed his position with the utmost accuracy to make doubly sure he got don to do the same and they split the difference between them then cruising slowly on parallel courses they began their careful search of the sea bed it was unusual to find bare rock at such a depth for the ocean bed is normally covered with a layer of mud and sediment hundreds or even thousands of feet thick there must franklin decided be powerful currents scouring this area clearbut there was certainly no current now as his drift meter assured him it was probably seasonal and associated with the tenthousandfootdeeper cleft of the miller canyon only five miles away every few seconds franklin switched on his pattern of colored lights then watched the screen eagerly to see if there was any response before long he had half a dozen fantastic deepsea fish following himnightmare creatures two or three feet long with enormous jaws and ridiculously attenuated feelers and tendrils trailing from their bodies the lure of his lights apparently overcame their fear of his engine vibration which was an encouraging sign though his speed quickly left them behind they were continually replaced by new monsters no two of which appeared to be exactly the same franklin paid relatively little attention to the tv screen the longerrange senses of the sonar warning him of what lay in the thousand feet ahead of him were more important not only had he to keep a lookout for his quarry but he had to avoid rocks and hillocks which might suddenly rear up in the track of the sub he was doing only ten knots which was slow enough but it required all his concentration sometimes he felt as if he was flying at treetop height over hilly country in a thick fog they traveled five uneventful miles then made a hairpin turn and came back on a parallel course if they were doing nothing else thought franklin at least they were producing a survey of this area in more detail than it had ever been mapped before both he and don were operating with their recorders on so that the profile of the sea bed beneath them was being automatically mapped whoever said this was an exciting life said don when they made their fourth turn ive not even seen a baby octopus maybe were scaring the squids away roberts said theyre not very sensitive to vibrations so i dont think thats likely and somehow i feel that percy isnt the sort whos easily scared if he exists said don skeptically dont forget those sixinch sucker marks what do you think made themmice hey said don have a look at that echo on bearing range feet looks like a rock but i thought it moved then another false alarm franklin told himself nothe echo did seem a bit fuzzy by god it was moving cut speed to half a knot he ordered drop back behind meill creep up slowly and switch on my lights its a weirdlooking echo keeps changing size all the time that sounds like our boy here we go the sub was now moving across an endless slightly tilted plain still accompanied by its inquisitive retinue of finned dragons on the tv screen all objects were lost in the haze at a distance of about a hundred and fifty feet the full power of the ultraviolet projectors could probe the water no farther than this franklin switched off his headlights and all external illumination and continued his cautious approach using the sonar screen alone at five hundred feet the echo began to show its unmistakable structure at four hundred feet there was no longer any doubt at three hundred feet franklins escort of fish suddenly fled at high speed as if aware that this was no healthy spot at two hundred feet he turned on his visual lures but he waited a few seconds before switching on the searchlights and tv a forest was walking across the sea beda forest of writhing serpentine trunks the great squid froze for a moment as if impaled by the searchlights probably it could see them though they were invisible to human eyes then it gathered up its tentacles with incredible swiftness folding itself into a compact streamlined massand shot straight toward the sub under the full power of its own jet propulsion it swerved at the last minute and franklin caught a glimpse of a huge and lidless eye that must have been at least a foot in diameter a second later there was a violent blow on the hull followed by a scraping sound as of great claws being dragged across metal franklin remembered the scars he had so often seen on the blubbery hides of sperm whales and was glad of the thickness of steel that protected him he could hear the wiring of his external illumination being ripped away no matterit had served its purpose it was impossible to tell what the squid was doing from time to time the sub rocked violently but franklin made no effort to escape unless things got a little too rough he proposed to stay here and take it can you see what hes doing he asked don rather plaintively yeshes got his eight arms wrapped around you and the two big tentacles are waving hopefully at me and hes going through the most beautiful color changes you can imaginei cant begin to describe them i wish i knew whether hes really trying to eat youor whether hes just being affectionate whichever it is its not very comfortable hurry up and take your photos so that i can get out of here rightgive me another couple of minutes so i can get a movie sequence as well then ill try to plant my harpoon it seemed a long two minutes but at last don had finished percy still showed none of the shyness which dr roberts had rather confidently predicted though by this time he could hardly have imagined that franklins sub was another squid don planted his dart with neatness and precision in the thickest part of percys mantle where it would lodge securely but would do no damage at the sudden sting the great mollusk abruptly released its grip and franklin took the opportunity for going full speed ahead he felt the horny palps grating over the stern of the sub then he was free and rising swiftly up toward the distant sky he felt rather pleased that he had managed to escape without using any of the battery of weapons that had been provided for this very purpose don followed him at once and they circled five hundred feet above the sea bedfar beyond visual range on the sonar screen the rocky bottom was a sharply defined plane but now at its center pulsed a tiny brilliant star the little beacon less than six inches long and barely an inch widethat had been anchored in percy was already doing its job it would continue to operate for more than a week before its batteries failed weve tagged him cried don gleefully now he cant hide as long as he doesnt get rid of that dart said franklin cautiously if he works it out well have to start looking for him all over again i aimed it pointed out don severely bet you ten to one it stays put if ive learned one thing in this game said franklin its not to accept your bets he brought the drive up to maximum cruising power and pointed the subs nose to the surface still more than half a mile away lets not keep doc roberts waitingthe poor man will be crazy with impatience besides i want to see those pictures myself its the first time ive ever played a starring role with a giant squid and this he reminded himself was only the curtain raiser the main feature had still to begin fifteen how nice it is said franklin as he relaxed lazily in the contourform chair on the porch to have a wife whos not scared stiff of the job im doing there are times when i am admitted indra i dont like these deepwater operations if anything goes wrong down there you dont have a chance you can drown just as easily in ten feet of water as ten thousand thats silly and you know it besides no warden has ever been killed by drowning as far as ive ever heard the things that happen to them are never as nice and simple as that im sorry i started this conversation said franklin ruefully glancing around to see if peter was safely out of earshot anyway youre not worried about operation percy are you no i dont think so im as anxious as everybody else to see you catch himand im still more interested to see if dr roberts can keep him alive she rose to her feet and walked over to the bookshelf recessed into the wall plowing through the usual pile of papers and magazines that had accumulated there she finally unearthed the volume for which she was looking listen to this she continued and remember that it was written almost two hundred years ago she began to read in her best lectureroom voice while franklin listened at first with mild reluctance and then with complete absorption in the distance a great white mass lazily rose and rising higher and higher and disentangling itself from the azure at last gleamed before our prow like a snowslide new slid from the hills thus glistening for a moment as slowly it subsided and sank then once more arose and slightly gleamed it seemed not a whale and yet is this moby dick thought daggoo again the phantom went down but on reappearing once more like a stilettolike cry that startled every man from his nod the negro yelled outthere there again there she breaches right ahead the white whale the white whale the four boats were soon on the water ahabs in advance and all swiftly pulling towards their prey soon it went down and while with oars suspended we were awaiting its appearance lo in the same spot where it sank once more it slowly rose almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of moby dick we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind a vast pulpy mass furlongs in length and breadth of a glancing creamcolour lay floating on the water innumerable long arms radiating from its centre and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas as if blindly to catch at any hapless object within reach no perceptible face or front did it have no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct but undulated there on the billows an unearthly formless chancelike apparition of life as with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk with a wild voice exclaimedalmost rather had i seen moby dick and fought him then to have seen thee thou white ghost what was it sir said flask the great live squid which they say few whaleships ever beheld and returned to their ports to tell of it but ahab said nothing turning his boat he sailed back to the vessel the rest as silently following indra paused closed the book and waited for her husbands response franklin stirred himself in the toocomfortable couch and said thoughtfully id forgotten that bitif i ever read as far it rings true to life but what was a squid doing on the surface it was probably dying they sometimes surface at night but never in the daytime and melville says this was on one transparent blue morning anyway whats a furlong id like to know if melvilles squid was as big as percy the photos make him a hundred and thirty feet from his flukes to the tips of his feelers so he beats the largest blue whale ever recorded yes by a couple of feet but of course he doesnt weigh a tenth as much franklin heaved himself from his couch and went in search of a dictionary presently indra heard indignant noises coming from the living room and called out whats the matter it says here that a furlong is an obsolete measure of length equal to an eighth of a mile melville was talking through his hat hes usually very accurate at least as far as whales are concerned but furlong is obviously ridiculousim surprised no ones spotted it before he must have meant fathoms or else the printer got it wrong slightly mollified franklin put down the dictionary and came back to the porch he was just in time to see don burley arrive sweep indra off her feet plant a large but brotherly kiss on her forehead and dump her back in her chair come along walt he said got your things packed ill give you a lift to the airport wheres peter hiding said franklin peter come and say goodbydaddys off to work a fouryearold bundle of uncontrollable energy came flying into the room almost capsizing his father as he jumped into his arms daddys going to bring me back a quid he asked heyhow did you know about all this it was on the news this morning while you were still asleep explained indra they showed a few seconds of dons film too i was afraid of that now well have to work with a crowd of cameramen and reporters looking over our shoulders that means that somethings sure to go wrong they cant follow us down to the bottom anyway said burley i hope youre rightbut dont forget were not the only people with deepsea subs i dont know how you put up with him don protested to indra does he always look on the black side of things not always smiled indra as she unraveled peter from his father hes cheerful at least twice a week her smile faded as she watched the sleek sportster go whispering down the hill she was very fond of don who was practically a member of the family and there were times when she worried about him it seemed a pity that he had never married and settled down the nomadic promiscuous life he led could hardly be very satisfying since they had known him he had spent almost all his time on or under the sea apart from hectic leaves when he had used their home as a baseat their invitation but often to their embarrassment when there were unexpected lady guests to entertain at breakfast their own life by many standards had been nomadic enough but at least they had always had a place they could call home that apartment in brisbane where her brief but happy career as a lecturer at the university of queensland had ended with the birth of peter that bungalow in fiji with the roof that had a mobile leak which the builders could never find the married quarters at the south georgia whaling station and finally this house looking out across the sea to the other islands of hawaii four homes in five years might seem excessive to many people but for a wardens wife indra knew she had done well she had few regrets for the career that had been temporarily interrupted when peter was old enough she told herself she would go back to her research even now she read all the literature and kept in touch with current work only a few months ago the journal of selachians had published her letter on the possible evolution of the goblin shark and she had since been involved in an enjoyable controversy with all five of the scientists qualified to discuss the subject even if nothing came of these dreams it was pleasant to have them and to know you might make the best of both worlds so indra franklin housewife and ichthyologist told herself as she went back into the kitchen to prepare lunch for her everhungry son the floating dock had been modified in many ways that would have baffled its original designers a thick steel mesh supported on sturdy insulators extended its entire length and above this mesh was a canvas awning to cut out the sunlight which would injure percys sensitive eyes and skin the only illumination inside the dock came from a battery of ambertinted bulbs at the moment however the great doors at either end of the huge concrete box were open letting in both sunlight and water the two subs barely awash lay tied up beside the crowded catwalk as dr roberts gave his final instructions ill try not to bother you too much when youre down there he said but for heavens sake tell me whats going on well be too busy to give a running commentary answered don with a grin but well do our best and if any thing goes wrong trust us to yell right away all set walt ok said franklin climbing down into the hatch see you in five hours with percyi hope they wasted no time in diving to the sea bed less than ten minutes later there was four thousand feet of water overhead and the familiar rocky terrain was imaged on tv and sonar screen but there was no sign of the pulsing star that should have indicated the presence of percy hope the beacon hasnt packed up said franklin as he reported this news to the hopefully waiting scientists if it has it may take us days to locate him again do you suppose hes left the area i wouldnt blame him added don dr roberts voice still confident and assured came down to them from the distant world of sun and light almost a mile above hes probably hiding in a cleft or shielded by rock i suggest you rise five hundred feet so that youre well clear of all the seabed irregularities and start a highspeed search that beacon has a range of more than a mile so youll pick him up pretty quickly an hour later even the doctor sounded less confident and from the comments that leaked down to them over the sonar communicator it appeared that the reporters and tv networks were getting impatient theres only one place he can be said roberts at last if hes there at all and the beacons still working he must have gone down into the miller canyon thats fifteen thousand feet deep protested don these subs are only cleared for twelve i knowi know but he wont have gone to the bottom hes probably hunting somewhere down the slope youll see him easily if hes there right replied franklin not very optimistically well go and have a look but if hes more than twelve thousand feet down hell have to stay there on the sonar screen the canyon was clearly visible as a sudden gap in the luminous image of the sea bed it came rapidly closer as the two subs raced toward it at forty knots the fastest creatures franklin mused anywhere beneath the surface of the sea he had once flown low toward the grand canyon and seen the land below suddenly whipped away as the enormous cavity gaped beneath him and now though he must rely for vision solely on the pattern of echoes brought back by his probing sound waves he felt exactly that same sensation as he swept across the edge of this still mightier chasm in the ocean floor he had scarcely finished the thought when dons voice highpitched with excitement came yelling from the speaker there he is a thousand feet down no need to break my eardrums grumbled franklin i can see him the precipitous slope of the canyon wall was etched like an almost vertical line down the center of the sonar screen creeping along the face of that wall was the tiny twinkling star for which they had been searching the patient beacon had betrayed percy to his hunters they reported the situation to dr roberts franklin could picture the jubilation and excitement up above some hints of which trickled down through the open microphone presently dr roberts a little breathless asked do you think you can still carry out our plan ill try he answered it wont be easy with this cliff face right beside us and i hope there arent any caves percy can crawl into you ready don all set to follow you down i think i can reach him without using the motors here we go franklin flooded the nose tanks and went down in a long steep glidea silent glide he hoped by this time percy would have learned caution and would probably run for it as soon as he knew that they were around the squid was cruising along the face of the canyon and franklin marveled that it could find any food in such a forbidding and apparently lifeless spot every time it expelled a jet of water from the tube of its siphon it moved forward in a distinct jerk it seemed unaware that it was no longer alone since it had not changed course since franklin had first observed it two hundred feetim going to switch on my lights again he told don he wont see youvisibilitys only about eighty today yes but im still closing inhes spotted me here he comes franklin had not really expected that the trick would work a second time on an animal as intelligent as percy but almost at once he felt the sudden thud followed by the rasping of horny claws as the great tentacles closed around the sub though he knew that he was perfectly safe and that no animal could harm walls that had been built to withstand pressures of a thousand tons on every square foot that grating slithering sound was one calculated to give him nightmares then quite suddenly there was silence he heard don exclaim christ that stuff acts quickly hes out cold almost at once dr roberts interjected anxiously dont give him too much and keep him moving so that hell still breathe don was too busy to answer having carried out his role as decoy franklin could do nothing but watch as his partner maneuvered dexterously around the great mollusk the anesthetic bomb had paralyzed it completely it was slowly sinking its tentacles stretched limply upward pieces of fish some of them over a foot across were floating away from the cruel beak as the monster disgorged its last meal can you get underneath don asked hurriedly hes sinking too fast for me franklin threw on the drive and went around in a tight curve there was a soft thump as of a snowdrift falling from a roof and he knew that five or ten tons of gelatinous body was now draped over the sub finehold him thereim getting into position franklin was now blind but the occasional clanks and whirs coming from the water outside told him what was happening presently don said triumphantly all set were ready to go the weight lifted from the sub and franklin could see again percy had been neatly gaffed a band of thick elastic webbing had been fastened around his body at the narrowest part just behind the flukes from this harness a cable extended to dons sub invisible in the haze a hundred feet away percy was being towed through the water in his normal direction of motionbackward had he been conscious and actively resisting he could have escaped easily enough but in his present state the collar he was wearing enabled don to handle him without difficulty the fun would begin when he started to revive franklin gave a brief eyewitness description of the scene for the benefit of his patiently waiting colleagues a mile above it was probably being broadcast and he hoped that indra and peter were listening then he settled down to keep an eye on percy as the long haul back to the surface began they could not move at more than two knots lest the collar lose its nonetoosecure grip on the great mass of jelly it was towing in any event the trip back to the surface had to take at least three hours to give percy a fair chance of adjusting to the pressure difference since an airbreathingand therefore more vulnerableanimal like a sperm whale could endure almost the same pressure change in ten or twenty minutes this caution was probably excessive but dr roberts was taking no chances with his unprecedented catch they had been climbing slowly for nearly an hour and had reached the threethousandfoot level when percy showed signs of life the two long arms terminating in their great suckercovered palps began to writhe purposefully the monstrous eyes into which franklin had been staring half hypnotized from a distance of no more than five feet began to light once more with intelligence quite unaware that he was speaking in a breathless whisper he swiftly reported these symptoms to dr roberts the doctors first reaction was a hearty sigh of relief good he said i was afraid we might have killed him can you see if hes breathing properly is the siphon contracting franklin dropped a few feet so that he could get a better view of the fleshy tube projecting from the squids mantle it was opening and closing in an unsteady rhythm which seemed to be getting stronger and more regular at every beat splendid said dr roberts hes in fine shape as soon as he starts to wriggle too hard give him one of the small bombs but leave it until the last possible moment franklin wondered how that moment was to be decided percy was now beginning to glow a beautiful blue even with the searchlights switched off he was clearly visible blue he remembered dr roberts saying was a sign of excitement in squids in that case it was high time he did something better let go that bomb i think hes getting lively he told don righthere it is a glass bubble floated across franklins screen and swiftly vanished from sight the damn thing never broke he cried let go another one okheres number two i hope this works ive only got five left but once again the narcotic bomb failed this time franklin never saw the sphere he only knew that instead of relaxing into slumber once more percy was becoming more active second by second the eight short tentaclesshort that is compared with the almost hundredfoot reach of the pair carrying the grasping palpswere now beginning to twine briskly together he recalled melvilles phrase like a nest of anacondas no somehow that did not seem to fit it was more like a misera submarine shylocktwisting his fingers together as he gloated over his wealth in any event it was a disconcerting sight when those fingers were a foot in diameter and were operating only two yards youll just have to keep on trying he told don unless we stop him soon hell get away an instant later he breathed a sigh of relief as he saw broken shards of glass drifting by they would have been quite invisible surrounded as they were by water had they not been fluorescing brilliantly under the light of his ultraviolet searchlight but for the moment he was too relieved to wonder why he had been able to see something as proverbially elusive as a piece of broken glass in water he only knew that percy had suddenly relaxed again and no longer appeared to be working himself into a rage what happened said dr roberts plaintively from above these confounded knockout drops of yours two of them didnt work that leaves me with just fourand at the present rate of failure ill be lucky if even one goes off i dont understand it the mechanism worked perfectly every time we tested it in the lab did you test it at a hundred atmospheres pressure erno it didnt seem necessary dons huh seemed to say all that was needful about biologists who tried to dabble with engineering and there was silence on all channels for the next few minutes of slow ascent then dr roberts sounding a little diffident came back to the subject since we cant rely on the bombs he said youd better come up more quickly hell revive again in about thirty minutes rightill double speed i only hope this collar doesnt slip off the next twenty minutes were perfectly uneventful then everything started to happen at once hes coming around again said franklin i think the higher speed has waked him up i was afraid of that dr roberts answered hold on as long as you can and then let go a bomb we can only pray that one of them will work a new voice suddenly cut into the circuit captain here lookout has just spotted some sperm whales about two miles away they seem to be heading toward us i suggest you have a look at themweve got no horizontal search sonar on this ship franklin switched quickly over to the longrange scanner and picked up the echoes at once nothing to worry about he said if they come too close we can scare them away he glanced back at the tv screen let go your bomb he told don and keep your fingers crossed im not betting on this don answered anything happen no another dud try again that leaves three here goes sorryi can see that one it isnt cracked two left now theres only one thats a dud too what had we better do doc risk the last one im afraid percy will slip off in a minute theres nothing else we can do replied dr roberts his voice now clearly showing the strain go ahead don almost at once franklin gave a cry of satisfaction weve made it he shouted hes knocked cold again how long do you think it will keep him under this time we cant rely on more than twenty minutes so plan your ascent accordingly were right above youand remember what i said about taking at least ten minutes over that last two hundred feet i dont want any pressure damage after all the trouble weve been to just a minute put in don ive been looking at those whales theyve put on speed and theyre coming straight toward us i think theyve detected percyor the beacon we put in him so what said franklin we can frighten them with oh yesi thought youd forgotten that these arent patrol subs walt no sirens on them and you cant scare sperm whales just by revving your engines that was true enough though it would not have been fifty years ago when the great beasts had been hunted almost to extinction but a dozen generations had lived and died since then now they recognized the subs as harmless and certainly no obstacle to the meal they were anticipating there was a real danger that the helpless percy might be eaten before he could be safely caged i think well make it said franklin as he anxiously calculated the speed of the approaching whales this was a hazard that no one could have anticipated it was typical of the way in which underwater operations developed unexpected snags and complications im going straight up to the twohundredfoot level don told him well wait there just as long as its safe and then run for the ship what do you think of that doc its the only thing to do but remember that those whales can make fifteen knots if they have to yes but they cant keep it up for long even if they see their dinner slipping away here we go the subs increased their rate of ascent while the water brightened around them and the enormous pressure slowly relaxed at last they were back in the narrow zone where an unprotected man could safely dive the mother ship was less than a hundred yards away but this final stage in the climb back to the surface was the most critical of all in this last two hundred feet the pressure would drop swiftly from eight atmospheres to only oneas great a change in ratio as had occurred in the previous quarter of a mile there were no enclosed air spaces in percy which might cause him to explode if the ascent was too swift but no one could be certain what other internal damage might occur whales only half a mile away reported franklin who said they couldnt keep up that speed theyll be here in two minutes youll have to hold them off somehow said dr roberts a note of desperation in his voice any suggestions asked franklin a little sarcastically suppose you pretend to attack that might make them break off this franklin told himself was not his idea of fun but there seemed no alternative with a last glance at percy who was now beginning to stir again he started off at halfspeed to meet the advancing whales there were three echoes dead ahead of himnot very large ones but he did not let that encourage him even if those were the relatively diminutive females each one was as big as ten elephants and they were coming toward him at a combined speed of forty miles an hour he was making all the noise he could but so far it seemed to be having no effect then he heard don shouting percys waking up fast i can feel him starting to move come straight in ordered dr roberts weve got the doors open and get ready to close the back door as soon as ive slipped the cable im going straight throughi dont want to share your swimming pool with percy when he finds whats happened to him franklin heard all this chattering with only half an ear those three approaching echoes were ominously close were they going to call his bluff sperm whales were among the most pugnacious animals in the sea as different from their vegetarian cousins as wild buffaloes from a herd of prize guernseys it was a sperm whale that had rammed and sunk the essex and thus inspired the closing chapter of moby dick he had no desire to figure in a submarine sequel yet he held stubbornly to his course though now the racing echoes were less than fifteen seconds away then he saw that they were beginning to separate even if they were not scared the whales had become confused probably the noise of his motors had made them lose contact with their target he cut his speed to zero and the three whales began to circle him inquisitively at a range of about a hundred feet sometimes he caught a shadowy glimpse of them on the tv screen as he had thought they were young females and he felt a little sorry to have robbed them of what should have been their rightful food he had broken the momentum of their charge now it was up to don to finish his side of the mission from the brief and occasionally lurid comments from the loudspeaker it was obvious that this was no easy task percy was not yet fully conscious but he knew that something was wrong and he was beginning to object the men on the floating dock had the best view of the final stages don surfaced about fifty yards awayand the sea behind him became covered with an undulating mass of jelly twisting and rolling on the waves at the greatest speed he dared to risk don headed for the open end of the dock one of percys tentacles made a halfhearted grab at the entrance as if in a somnambulistic effort to avoid captivity but the speed at which he was being hurried through the water broke his grip as soon as he was safely inside the massive steel gates began to close like horizontally operating jaws and don jettisoned the towrope fastened around the squids flukes he wasted no time in leaving from the other exit and the second set of lock gates started to close even before he was through the caging of percy had taken less than a quarter of a minute when franklin surfaced in company with three disappointed but not hostile sperm whales it was some time before he could attract any attention the entire personnel of the dock were busy staring with awe triumph scientific curiosity and even downright disbelief at the monstrous captive now swiftly reviving in his great concrete tank the water was being thoroughly aerated by the streams of bubbles from a score of pipes and the last traces of the drugs that had paralyzed him were being flushed out of percys system beneath the dim amber light that was now the sole illumination inside the dock the giant squid began to investigate its prison first it swam slowly from end to end of the rectangular concrete box exploring the sides with its tentacles then the two immense palps started to climb into the air waving toward the breathless watchers gathered round the edge of the dock they touched the electrified nettingand flicked away with a speed that almost eluded the eye twice again percy repeated the experiment before he had convinced himself that there was no way out in this direction all the while staring up at the puny spectators with a gaze that seemed to betoken an intelligence every wit as great as theirs by the time don and franklin came aboard the squid appeared to have settled down in captivity and was showing a mild interest in a number of fish that had been dropped into its tank as the two wardens joined dr roberts behind the wire meshing they had their first clear and complete view of the monster they had hauled up from the ocean depths their eyes ran along the hundred and more feet of flexible sinewy strength the countless clawringed suckers the slowly pulsing jet and the huge staring eyes of the most superbly equipped beast of prey the world had ever seen then don summed up the thoughts that they were both feeling hes all yours doc i hope you know how to handle him dr roberts smiled confidently enough he was a very happy man though a small worry was beginning to invade his mind he had no doubt at all that he could handle percy and he was perfectly right but he was not so sure that he could handle the director when the bills came in for the research equipment he was going to orderand for the mountains of fish that percy was going to eat sixteen the secretary of the department of scientific research had listened to him attentively enoughand not merely with attention franklin told himself but with a flattering interest when he had finished the sales talk which had taken such long and careful preparation he felt a sudden and unexpected emotional letdown he knew that he had done his best what happened now was largely out of his hands there are a few points i would like to clear up said the secretary the first is a rather obvious one why didnt you go to the marine divisions own research department instead of coming all the way up to world secretariat level and contacting dsr it was franklin admitted a rather obvious pointand a somewhat delicate one but he knew that it would be raised and he had come prepared naturally mr parian he answered i did my best to get support in the division there was a good deal of interest especially after wed captured that squid but operation percy turned out to be much more expensive than anyone had calculated and there were a lot of awkward questions about it the whole affair ended with several of our scientists transferring to other divisions i know interjected the secretary with a smile weve got some of them so any research that isnt of direct practical importance is now frowned on in the division which is one reason why i came to you and frankly it hasnt the authority to do the sort of thing i propose the cost of running even two deepsea subs is considerable and would have to be approved at higher than divisional level but if it was approved you are confident that the staff could be made available yes at the right time of the year now that the fence is practically one hundred per cent reliabletheres been no major breakdown for three yearswe wardens have a fairly slack time except at the annual roundups and slaughterings thats why it seemed a good idea to utilize the wasted talents of the wardens well thats putting it a little bluntly i dont want to give the idea that there is any inefficiency in the bureau i wouldnt dream of suggesting such a thing smiled the secretary the other point is a more personal one why are you so keen on this project you have obviously spent a lot of time and trouble on itand if i may say so risked the disapproval of your superiors by coming directly to me that question was not so easy to answer even to someone you knew well still less to a stranger would this man who had risen so high in the service of the state understand the fascination of a mysterious echo on a sonar screen glimpsed only once and that years ago yes he would for he was at least partly a scientist as a chief warden explained franklin i probably wont be on sea duty much longer im thirtyeight and getting old for this kind of work and ive an inquisitive type of mind perhaps i should have been a scientist myself this is a problem id like to see settled though i know the odds against it are pretty high i can appreciate that this chart of confirmed sightings covers about half the worlds oceans yes i know it looks hopeless but with the new sonar sets we can scan a volume three times as great as we used to and an echo that size is easy to pick up its only a matter of time before somebody detects it and you want to be that somebody well thats reasonable enough when i got your original letter i had a talk with my marine biology people and got about three different opinionsnone of them very encouraging some of those who admit that these echoes have been seen say that they are probably ghosts due to faults in the sonar sets or returns from discontinuities of some kind in the water franklin snorted anyone whos seen them would know better than that after all were familiar with all the ordinary sonar ghosts and false returns we have to be yes thats what i feel some more of my people think that thelet us sayconventional sea serpents have already been accounted for by squids oarfish and eels and that what your patrols have been seeing is either one of these or else a large deepsea shark franklin shook his head i know what all those echoes look like this is quite different the third objection is a theoretical one there simply isnt enough food in the extreme ocean depths to support any very large and active forms of life no one can be sure of that only in the last century scientists were saying that there could be no life at all on the ocean bed we know what nonsense that turned out to be well youve made a good case ill see what can be done thank you very much mr parian perhaps it would be best if no one in the bureau knew that id come to see you we wont tell them but theyll guess the secretary rose to his feet and franklin assumed that the interview was over he was wrong before you go mr franklin said the secretary you might be able to clear up one little matter thats been worrying me for a good many years whats that sir ive never understood what a presumably welltrained warden would be doing in the middle of the night off the great barrier reef breathing compressed air five hundred feet down there was a long silence while the two men their relationship suddenly altered stared at each other across the room franklin searched his memory but the others face evoked no echoes that was so long ago and he had met so many people during the intervening years were you one of the men who pulled me in he asked if so ive a lot to thank you for he paused for a moment then added you see that wasnt an accident i rather thought so that explains everything but before we change the subject just what happened to bert darryl ive never been able to find the true story oh eventually he ran out of credit he could never make the sea lion pay its way the last time i ever saw him was in melbourne he was heartbroken because customs duties had been abolished and there was no way an honest smuggler could make a living finally he tried to collect the insurance on the sea lion he had a convincing fire and had to abandon ship off cairns she went to the bottom but the appraisers went after her and started asking some very awkward questions when they found that all the valuable fittings had been removed before the fire i dont know how the captain got out of that mess that was about the end of the old rascal he took to the bottle in earnest and one night up in darwin he decided to go for a swim off the jetty but hed forgotten that it was low tideand in darwin the tide drops thirty feet so he broke his neck and a lot of people besides his creditors were genuinely sorry poor old bert the world will be a dull place when there arent any more people like him that was rather a heretical remark thought franklin coming from the lips of so senior a member of the world secretariat but it pleased him greatly and not merely because he agreed with it he knew now that he had unexpectedly acquired an influential friend and that the chances of his project going forward had been immeasurably improved he did not expect anything to happen in a hurry so was not disappointed as the weeks passed in silence in any event he was kept busy the slack season was still three months away and meanwhile a whole series of minor but annoying crises crowded upon him and there was one that was neither minor nor annoying if indeed it could be called a crisis at all anne franklin arrived wideeyed and widemouthed into the world and indra began to have her first serious doubts of continuing her academic career franklin to his great disappointment was not home when his daughter was born he had been in charge of a small task force of six subs carrying out an offensive sweep off the pribilof islands in an attempt to cut down the number of killer whales it was not the first mission of its kind but it was the most successful thanks to the use of improved techniques the characteristic calls of seals and the smaller whales had been recorded and played back into the sea while the subs had waited silently for the killers to appear they had done so in hundreds and the slaughter had been immense by the time the little fleet returned to base more than a thousand orcas had been killed it had been hard and sometimes dangerous work and despite its importance franklin had found this scientific butchery extremely depressing he could not help admiring the beauty speed and ferocity of the hunters he was himself hunting and toward the end of the mission he was almost glad when the rate of kill began to fall off it seemed that the orcas were learning by bitter experience and the bureaus statisticians would have to decide whether or not it would be economically worthwhile repeating the operation next season franklin had barely had time to thaw out from this mission and to fondle anne gingerly without extracting any signs of recognition from her when he was shot off to south georgia his problem there was to discover why the whales who had previously swum into the slaughtering pens without any qualms had suddenly become suspicious and shown a great reluctance to enter the electrified sluices as it turned out he did nothing at all to solve the mystery while he was still looking for psychological factors a bright young plant inspector discovered that some of the bloody waste from the processing plants was accidentally leaking back into the sea it was not surprising that the whales though their sense of smell was not as strongly developed as in other marine animals had become alarmed as the moving barriers tried to guide them to the place where so many of their relatives had met their doom as a chief warden already being groomed for higher things franklin was now a kind of mobile trouble shooter who might be sent anywhere in the world on the bureaus business apart from the effect on his home life he welcomed this state of affairs once a man had learned the mechanics of a wardens trade straightforward patrolling and herding had little future in it people like don burley got all the excitement and pleasure they needed from it but then don was neither ambitious nor much of an intellectual heavyweight franklin told himself this without any sense of superiority it was a simple statement of fact which don would be the first to admit he was in england giving evidence as an expert witness before the whaling commissionthe bureaus stateappointed watchdogwhen he received a plaintive call from dr lundquist who had taken over when dr roberts had left the bureau of whales to accept a much more lucrative appointment at the marineland aquarium ive just had three crates of gear delivered from the department of scientific research its nothing we ever ordered but your name is on it whats it all about franklin thought quickly it would arrive when he was away and if the director came across it before he could prepare the ground there would be fireworks its too long a story to give now franklin answered ive got to go before the committee in ten minutes just push it out of the way somewhere until i get backill explain everything then i hope its all rightits most unusual nothing to worry aboutsee you the day after tomorrow if don burley comes to base let him have a look at the stuff but ill fix all the paper work when i get back that he told himself would be the worst part of the whole job getting equipment that had never been officially requisitioned onto the bureaus inventory without too many questions was going to be at least as difficult as locating the great sea serpent he need not have worried his new and influential ally the secretary of the department of scientific research had already anticipated most of his problems the equipment was to be on loan to the bureau and was to be returned as soon as it had done its job what was more the director had been given the impression that the whole thing was a dsr project he might have his doubts but franklin was officially covered since you seem to know all about it walter he said in the lab when the gear was finally unpacked youd better explain what its supposed to do its an automatic recorder much more sophisticated than the ones we have at the gates for counting the whales as they go through essentially its a longrange sonar scanner that explores a volume of space fifteen miles in radius clear down to the bottom of the sea it rejects all fixed echoes and will only record moving objects and it can also be set to ignore all objects of less than any desired size in other words we can use it to count the number of whales more than say fifty feet long and take no notice of the others it does this once every six minutestwo hundred and forty times a day so it will give a virtually continuous census of any desired region quite ingenious i suppose dsr wants us to moor the thing somewhere and service it yesand to collect the recordings every week they should be very useful to us as well erthere are three of the things by the way trust dsr to do it in style i wish we had as much money to throw around let me know how the things work if they do it was as simple as that and there had been no mention at all of sea serpents nor was there any sign of them for more than two months every week whatever patrol sub happened to be in the neighborhood would bring back the records from the three instruments moored half a mile below sea level at the spots franklin had chosen after a careful study of all the known sightings with an eagerness which slowly subsided to a stubborn determination he examined the hundreds of feet of oldfashioned sixteenmillimeter filmstill unsurpassed in its own field as a recording medium he looked at thousands of echoes as he projected the film condensing into minutes the comings and goings of giant sea creatures through many days and nights usually the pictures were blank for he had set the discriminator to reject all echoes from objects less than seventy feet in length that he calculated should eliminate all but the very largest whalesand the quarry he was seeking when the herds were on the move however the film would be dotted with echoes which would jump across the screen at fantastically exaggerated speeds as he projected the images he was watching the life of the sea accelerated almost ten thousand times after two months of fruitless watching he began to wonder if he had chosen the wrong places for all three recorders and was making plans to move them when the next rolls of film came back he told himself he would do just that and he had already decided on the new locations but this time he found what he had been looking for it was on the edge of the screen and had been caught by only four sweeps of the scanner two days ago that unforgotten curiously linear echo had appeared on the recorder now he had evidence but he still lacked proof he moved the other two recorders into the area arranging the three instruments in a great triangle fifteen miles on a side so that their fields overlapped then it was a question of waiting with what patience he could until another week had passed the wait was worth it at the end of that time he had all the ammunition he needed for his campaign the proof was there clear and undeniable a very large animal too long and thin to be any of the known creatures of the sea lived at the astonishing depth of twenty thousand feet and came halfway to the surface twice a day presumably to feed from its intermittent appearance on the screens of the recorders franklin was able to get a fairly good idea of its habits and movements unless it suddenly left the area and he lost track of it there should be no great difficulty in repeating the success of operation percy he should have remembered that in the sea nothing is ever twice the same seventeen you know dear said indra im rather glad this is going to be one of your last missions if you think im getting too old oh its not only that when youre on headquarters duty well be able to start leading a normal social life ill be able to invite people to dinner without having to apologize because youve suddenly been called out to round up a sick whale and it will be better for the children i wont have to keep explaining to them who the strange man is they sometimes meet around the house well its not that bad is it pete laughed franklin tousling his sons dark unruly hair when are you going to take me down in a sub daddy asked peter for approximately the hundredth time one of these days when youre big enough not to get in the way but if you wait until i am big i will get in the way theres logic for you said indra i told you my child was a genius he may have got his hair from you said franklin but it doesnt follow that youre responsible for what lies beneath it he turned to don who was making ridiculous noises for annes benefit she seemed unable to decide whether to laugh or to burst into tears but was obviously giving the problem her urgent attention when are you going to settle down to the joys of domesticity you cant be an honorary uncle all your life for once don looked a little embarrassed as a matter of fact he said slowly i am thinking about it ive met someone at last who looks as if she might be willing congratulations i thought you and marie were seeing a lot of each other don looked still more embarrassed wellahit isnt marie i was just trying to say goodby to her oh said franklin considerably deflated who is it i dont think you know her shes named junejune curtis she isnt in the bureau at all which is an advantage in some ways ive not quite made up my mind yet but ill probably ask her next week theres only one thing to do said indra firmly as soon as you come back from this hunt bring her around to dinner and ill tell you what we think of her and ill tell her what we think of you put in franklin we cant be fairer than that can we he remembered indras wordsthis is going to be one of your last missionsas the little depth ship slanted swiftly down into the eternal night it was not strictly true of course even though he had now been promoted to a permanent shore position he would still occasionally go to sea but the opportunities would become fewer and fewer this was his swan song as a warden and he did not know whether to be sorry or glad for seven years he had roamed the oceansone year of his life to each of the seasand in that time he had grown to know the creatures of the deep as no man could ever have done in any earlier age he had watched the sea in all its moods he had coasted over mirrorflat waters and had felt the surge of mighty waves lifting his vessel when it was a hundred feet below the stormtossed surface he had looked upon beauty and horror and birth and death in all their multitudinous forms as he moved through a liquid world so teeming with life that by comparison the land was an empty desert no man could ever exhaust the wonder of the sea but franklin knew that the time had come for him to take up new tasks he looked at the sonar screen for the accompanying cigar of light which was dons ship and thought affectionately of their common characteristics and of the differences which now must take them further and further apart who would have imagined he told himself that they would become such good friends that faroff day when they had met warily as instructor and pupil that had been only seven years ago but already it was hard for him to remember the sort of person he had been in those days he felt an abiding gratitude for the psychologists who had not only rebuilt his mind but had found him the work that could rebuild his life his thoughts completed the next inevitable step memory tried to recreate irene and the boysgood heavens rupert would be twelve years old nowaround whom his whole existence had once revolved but who now were strangers drifting further and further apart year by year the last photograph he had of them was already more than a year old the last letter from irene had been posted on mars six months ago and he reminded himself guiltily that he had not yet answered it all the grief had gone long ago he felt no pain at being an exile in his own world no ache to see once more the faces of friends he had known in the days when he counted all space his empire there was only a wistful sadness not even wholly unpleasant and a mild regret for the inconstancy of sorrow dons voice broke into his reverie which had never taken his attention away from his crowded instrument panel were just passing my record walt ten thousands the deepest ive ever been and were only halfway there still what difference does it make if youve got the right ship it just takes a bit longer to go down and a bit longer to come up these tubs would still have a safety factor of five at the bottom of the philippine trench thats true enough but you cant convince me theres no psychological difference dont you feel two miles of water on your shoulders it was most unlike don to be so imaginative usually it was franklin who made such remarks and was promptly laughed at if don was getting moody it would be best to give him some of his own medicine tell me when youve got to start bailing said franklin if the water gets up to your chin well turn back he had to admit that the feeble joke helped his own morale the knowledge that the pressure around him was rising steadily to five tons per square inch did have a definite effect on his mindan effect he had never experienced in shallowwater operations where disaster could be just as instantaneous just as total he had complete confidence in his equipment and knew that the sub would do all that he asked it to but he still felt that curious feeling of depression which seemed to have taken most of the zest out of the project into which he had put so much effort five thousand feet lower down that zest returned with all its old vigor they both saw the echo simultaneously and for a moment were shouting at cross purposes until they remembered their signals discipline when silence had been restored franklin gave his orders cut your motor to quarter speed he said we know the beasts very sensitive and we dont want to scare it until the last minute cant we flood the bow tanks and glide down take too longhes still three thousand feet below and cut your sonar to minimum power i dont want him picking up our pulses the animal was moving in a curiously erratic path at a constant depth sometimes making little darts to right or left as if in search of food it was following the slopes of an unusually steep submarine mountain which rose abruptly some four thousand feet from the sea bed not for the first time franklin thought what a pity it was that the worlds most stupendous scenery was all sunk beyond sight in the ocean depths nothing on the land could compare with the hundredmilewide canyons of the north atlantic or the monstrous potholes that gave the pacific the deepest soundings on earth they sank slowly below the summit of the submerged mountaina mountain whose topmost peak was three miles below sea level only a little way beneath them now that mysteriously elongated echo seemed to be undulating through the water with a sinuous motion which reminded franklin irresistibly of a snake it would he thought be ironic if the great sea serpent turned out to be exactly that but that was impossible for there were no waterbreathing snakes neither man spoke during the slow and cautious approach to their goal they both realized that this was one of the great moments of their lives and wished to savor it to the full until now don had been mildly skeptical believing that whatever they found would be no more than some alreadyknown species of animal but as the echo on the screen expanded so its strangeness grew this was something wholly new the mountain was now looming above them they were skirting the foot of a cliff more than two thousand feet high and their quarry was less than half a mile ahead franklin felt his hand itching to throw on the ultraviolet searchlights which in an instant might solve the oldest mystery of the sea and bring him enduring fame how important to him was that he asked himself as the seconds ticked slowly by that it was important he did not attempt to hide from himself in all his career he might never have another opportunity like this suddenly without the slightest warning the sub trembled as if struck by a hammer at the same moment don cried out my godwhat was that some damn fool is letting off explosives franklin replied rage and frustration completely banishing fear wasnt everyone notified of our dive thats no explosion ive felt it beforeits an earthquake no other word could so swiftly have conjured up once more all that terror of the ultimate depths which franklin had felt brushing briefly against his mind during their descent at once the immeasurable weight of the waters crushed down upon him like a physical burden his sturdy craft seemed the frailest of cockleshells already doomed by forces which all mans science could no longer hold at bay he knew that earthquakes were common in the deep pacific where the weights of rock and water were forever poised in precarious equilibrium once or twice on patrols he had felt distant shocksbut this time he felt certain he was near the epicenter make full speed for the surface he ordered that may be just the beginning but we only need another five minutes don protested lets chance it walt franklin was sorely tempted that single shock might be the only one the strain on the tortured strata miles below might have been relieved he glanced at the echo they had been chasing it was moving much faster now as if it too had been frightened by this display of natures slumbering power well risk it franklin decided but if theres another one well go straight up fair enough answered don ill bet you ten to one he never completed the sentence this time the hammer blow was no more violent but it was sustained the entire ocean seemed to be in travail as the shock waves traveling at almost a mile a second were reflected back and forth between surface and sea bed franklin shouted the one word up and tilted the sub as steeply as he dared toward the distant sky but the sky was gone the sharply defined plane which marked the waterair interface on the sonar screen had vanished replaced by a meaningless jumble of hazy echoes for a moment franklin assumed that the set had been put out of action by the shocks then his mind interpreted the incredible the terrifying picture that was taking shape upon the screen don he yelled run for the open seathe mountains falling the billions of tons of rock that had been towering above them were sliding down into the deep the whole face of the mountain had split away and was descending in a waterfall of stone moving with a deceptive slowness and an utterly irresistible power it was an avalanche in slow motion but franklin knew that within seconds the waters through which his sub was driving would be torn with falling debris he was moving at full speed yet he seemed motionless even without the amplifiers he could hear through the hull the rumble and roar of grinding rock more than half the sonar image was now obliterated either by solid fragments or by the immense clouds of mud and silt that were now beginning to fill the sea he was becoming blind there was nothing he could do but hold his course and pray with a muffled thud something crashed against the hull and the sub groaned from end to end for a moment franklin thought he had lost control then he managed to fight the vessel back to an even keel no sooner had he done this than he realized he was in the grip of a powerful current presumably due to water displaced by the collapsing mountain he welcomed it for it was sweeping him to the safety of the open sea and for the first time he dared to hope where was don it was impossible to see his echo in the shifting chaos of the sonar screen franklin switched his communication set to high power and started calling through the moving darkness there was no reply probably don was too busy to answer even if he had received the signal the pounding shock waves had ceased with them had gone the worst of franklins fears there was no danger now of the hull being cracked by pressure and by this time surely he was clear of the slowly toppling mountain the current that had been aiding his engines had now lost its strength proving that he was far away from its source on the sonar screen the luminous haze that had blocked all vision was fading minute by minute as the silt and debris subsided slowly the wrecked face of the mountain emerged from the mist of conflicting echoes the pattern on the screen began to stabilize itself and presently franklin could see the great scar left by the avalanche the sea bed itself was still hidden in a vast fog of mud it might be hours before it would be visible again and the damage wrought by natures paroxysm could be ascertained franklin watched and waited as the screen cleared with each sweep of the scanner the sparkle of interference faded the water was still turbid but no longer full of suspended matter he could see for a milethen twothen three and in all that space there was no sign of the sharp and brilliant echo that would mark dons ship hope faded as his radius of vision grew and the screen remained empty again and again he called into the lonely silence while grief and helplessness strove for the mastery of his soul he exploded the signal grenades that would alert all the hydrophones in the pacific and send help racing to him by sea and air but even as he began his slowly descending spiral search he knew that it was in vain don burley had lost his last bet part three the bureaucrat eighteen the great mercator chart that covered the whole of one wall was a most unusual one all the land areas were completely blank as far as this map maker was concerned the continents had never been explored but the sea was crammed with detail and scattered over its face were countless spots of colored light projected by some mechanism inside the wall those spots moved slowly from hour to hour recording as they did so for skilled eyes to read the migration of all the main schools of whales that roamed the seas franklin had seen the master chart scores of times during the last fourteen yearsbut never from this vantage point for he was looking at it now from the directors chair theres no need for me to warn you walter said his exchief that you are taking over the bureau at a very tricky time sometime in the next five years were going to have a showdown with the farms unless we can improve our efficiency planktonderived proteins will soon be substantially cheaper than any we can deliver and thats only one of our problems the staff position is getting more difficult every yearand this sort of thing isnt going to help he pushed a folder across to franklin who smiled wryly when he saw what it contained the advertisement was familiar enough it had appeared in all the major magazines during the past week and must have cost the space department a small fortune an underwater scene of improbable clarity and color was spread across two pages vast scaly monsters more huge and hideous than any that had lived on earth since the jurassic period were battling each other in the crystalline depths franklin knew from the photographs he had seen that they were very accurately painted and he did not grudge the illustrator his artistic license in the matter of underwater clarity the text was dignified and avoided sensationalism the painting was sensational enough and needed no embellishment the space department he read urgently needed young men as wardens and food production experts for the exploitation of the seas of venus the work it was added was probably the most exciting and rewarding to be found anywhere in the solar system pay was good and the qualifications were not as high as those needed for space pilot or astrogator after the short list of physical and educational requirements the advertisement ended with the words which the venus commission had been plugging for the last six months and which franklin had grown heartily tired of seeing help to build a second earth meanwhile said the exdirector our problem is to keep the first one going when the bright youngsters who might be joining us are running away to venus and between you and me i shouldnt be surprised if the space department has been after some of our men they wouldnt do a thing like that wouldnt they now anyway theres a transfer application in from first warden mcrae if you cant talk him out of it try to find what made him want to leave life was certainly going to be difficult franklin thought joe mcrae was an old friend could he impose on that friendship now that he was joes boss another of your little problems is going to be keeping the scientists under control lundquist is worse than roberts ever was hes got about six crazy schemes going and at least roberts only had one brainstorm at a time he spends half his time over on heron island it might be a good idea to fly over and have a look at him that was something i never had a chance to get around to franklin was still listening politely as his predecessor continued with obvious relish to point out the many disadvantages of his new post most of them he already knew and his mind was now far away he was thinking how pleasant it would be to begin his directorate with an official visit to heron island which he had not seen for nearly five years and which had so many memories of his first days in the bureau dr lundquist was flattered by the new directors visit being innocent enough to hope that it might lead to increased support for his activities he would not have been so enthusiastic had he guessed that the opposite was more likely to be the case no one could have been more sympathetic than franklin to scientific research but now that he had to approve the bills himself he found that his point of view was subtly altered whatever lundquist was doing would have to be of direct value to the bureau otherwise it was outunless the department of scientific research could be talked into taking it over lundquist was a small intense little man whose rapid and somewhat jerky movements reminded franklin of a sparrow he was an enthusiast of a type seldom met these days and he combined a sound scientific background with an unfettered imagination how unfettered franklin was soon to discover yet at first sight it seemed that most of the work going on at the lab was of a fairly routine nature franklin spent a dull halfhour while two young scientists explained the methods they were developing to keep whales free of the many parasites that plagued them and then escaped by the skin of his teeth from a lecture on cetacean obstetrics he listened with more interest to the latest work on artificial insemination having in the past helped with some of the early and often hilariously unsuccessfulexperiments along this line he sniffed cautiously at some synthetic ambergris and agreed that it seemed just like the real thing and he listened to the recorded heartbeat of a whale before and after the cardiac operation that had saved its life and pretended that he could hear the difference everything here was perfectly in order and just as he had expected then lundquist steered him out of the lab and down to the big pool saying as he did so i think youll find this more interesting its only in the experimental stage of course but it has possibilities the scientist looked at his watch and muttered to himself two minutes to go shes usually in sight by now he glanced out beyond the reef then said with satisfaction ah there she is a long black mound was moving in toward the island and a moment later franklin saw the typical stubby spout of vapor which identified the humpback whale almost at once he saw a second much smaller spout and realized that he was watching a female and her calf without hesitation both animals came in through the narrow channel that had been blasted through the coral years ago so that small boats could come up to the lab they turned left into a large tidal pool that had not been here on franklins last visit and remained there waiting patiently like welltrained dogs two lab technicians wearing oilskins were trundling something that looked like a fire extinguisher to the edge of the pool lundquist and franklin hurried to join them and it was soon obvious why the oilskins were necessary on this bright and cloudless day every time the whales spouted there was a miniature rainstorm and franklin was glad to borrow protection from the descending and nauseous spray even a warden seldom saw a live whale at such close quarters and under such ideal conditions the mother was about fifty feet long and like all humpbacks very massively built she was no beauty franklin decided and the large irregular warts along the leading edges of her flippers did nothing to add to her appearance the little calf was about twenty feet in length and did not appear to be too happy in its confined quarters for it was anxiously circling its stolid mother one of the scientists gave a curious highpitched shout and at once the whale rolled over on her side bringing half of her pleated belly out of the water she did not seem to mind when a large rubber cup was placed over the nowexposed teat indeed she was obviously cooperating for the meter on the collecting tank was recording an astonishing rate of flow you know of course explained lundquist that the cows eject their milk under pressure so that the calves can feed when the teats are submerged without getting water in their mouths but when the calves are very young the mother rolls over like this so that the baby can feed above water it makes things a lot simpler for us the obedient whale without any instructions that franklin could detect had now circled round in her pen and was rolling over on the other side so that her second teat could be milked he looked at the meter it now registered just under fifty gallons and was still rising the calf was obviously getting worried or perhaps it had become excited by the milk that had accidentally spilled into the water it made several attempts to bunt its mechanical rival out of the way and had to be discouraged by a few sharp smacks franklin was impressed but not surprised he knew that this was not the first time that whales had been milked though he did not know that it could now be done with such neatness and dispatch but where was it leading knowing dr lundquist he could guess now said the scientist obviously hoping that the demonstration had made its desired impact we can get at least five hundred pounds of milk a day from a cow without interfering with the calfs growth and if we start breeding for milk as the farmers have done on land we should be able to get a ton a day without any trouble you think thats a lot i regard it as quite a modest target after all prize cattle have given over a hundred pounds of milk a dayand a whale weighs a good deal more than twenty times as much as a cow franklin did his best to interrupt the statistics thats all very well he said i dont doubt your figures and equally i dont doubt that you can process the milk to remove that oily tasteyes ive tried it thanks but how the devil are you going to round up all the cows in a herdespecially a herd that migrates ten thousand miles a year oh weve worked all that out its partly a matter of training and weve learned a lot getting susan here to obey our underwater recordings have you ever been to a dairy farm and watched how the cows walk into the autolactor at milking time and walk out againwithout a human being coming within miles of the place and believe me whales are a lot smarter and more easily trained than cows ive sketched out the rough designs for a milk tanker that can deal with four whales at once and could follow the herd as it migrates in any case now that we can control the plankton yield we can stop migration if we want to and keep the whales in the tropics without them getting hungry the whole things quite practical i assure you despite himself franklin was fascinated by the idea it had been suggested in some form or other for many years but dr lundquist seemed to have been the first to do anything about it the mother whale and her still somewhat indignant calf had now set out to sea and were soon spouting and diving noisily beyond the edge of the reef as franklin watched them go he wondered if in a few years time he would see hundreds of the great beasts lined up obediently as they swam to the mobile milking plants each delivering a ton of what was known to be one of the richest foods on earth but it might remain only a dream there would be countless practical problems to be faced and what had been achieved on the laboratory scale with a single animal might prove out of the question in the sea what id like you to do he said to lundquist is to let me have a report showing what anerwhale dairy would require in terms of equipment and personnel try to give costs wherever you can and then estimate how much milk it could deliver and what the processing plants would pay for that then well have something definite to work on at the moment its an interesting experiment but no one can say if it has any practical application lundquist seemed slightly disappointed at franklins lack of enthusiasm but rapidly warmed up again as they walked away from the pool if franklin had thought that a little project like setting up a whale dairy had exhausted lundquists powers of extrapolation he was going to learn better the next proposal i want to talk about began the scientist is still entirely in the planning stage i know that one of our most serious problems is staff shortage and ive been trying to think of ways in which we can improve efficiency by releasing men from routine jobs surely that process has gone about as far as it can short of making everything completely automatic anyway its less than a year since the last team of efficiency experts went over us my approach to the problem explained lundquist is a little unconventional and as an exwarden yourself i think youll be particularly interested in it as you know it normally takes two or even three subs to round up a large school of whales if a single sub tries it theyll scatter in all directions now this has often seemed to me a shocking waste of man power and equipment since all the thinking could be done by a single warden he only needs his partners to make the right noises in the right placessomething a machine could do just as well if youre thinking of automatic slave subs said franklin its been triedand it didnt work a warden cant handle two ships at once let alone three i know all about that experiment answered lundquist it could have been a success if theyd tackled it properly but my idea is much more revolutionary tell medoes the name sheep dog mean anything to you franklin wrinkled his brow i think so he replied werent they dogs that the oldtime shepherds used to protect their flocks a few hundred years ago it happened until less than a hundred years ago and protect is an understatement with a vengeance ive been looking at film records of sheep dogs in action and no one who hadnt seen them would believe some of the things they could do those dogs were so intelligent and so welltrained that they could make a flock of sheep do anything the shepherd wanted merely at a word of command from him they could split a flock into sections single out one solitary sheep from its fellows or keep a flock motionless in one spot as long as their master ordered do you see what i am driving at weve been training dogs for centuries so such a performance doesnt seem miraculous to us what i am suggesting is that we repeat the pattern in the sea we know that a good many marine mammalsseals and porpoises for instanceare at least as intelligent as dogs but except in circuses and places like marineland theres been no attempt to train them youve seen the tricks our porpoises here can do and you know how affectionate and friendly they are when youve watched these old films of sheepdog trials youll agree that anything a dog could do a hundred years ago we can teach a porpoise to do today just a minute said franklin a little overwhelmed let me get this straight are you proposing that every warden should have a couple oferhounds working with him when he rounds up a school of whales for certain operations yes of course the technique would have limitations no marine animal has the speed and range of a sub and the hounds as youve called them couldnt always get to the places where they were needed but ive done some studies and i think it would be possible to double the effectiveness of our wardens in this way by eliminating the times when they had to work in pairs or trios but protested franklin what notice would whales take of porpoises theyd ignore them completely oh i wasnt suggesting that we should use porpoises that was merely an example youre quite rightthe whales wouldnt even notice them well have to use an animal thats fairly large at least as intelligent as the porpoise and which whales will pay a great deal of attention to indeed theres only one animal that fills the bill and id like your authority to catch one and train it go on said franklin with such a note of resignation in his voice that even lundquist who had little sense of humor was forced to smile what i want to do he continued is to catch a couple of killer whales and train them to work with one of our wardens franklin thought of the thirtyfoot torpedoes of ravening power he had so often chased and slaughtered in the frozen polar seas it was hard to picture one of these ferocious beasts tamed to mans bidding then he remembered the chasm between the sheep dog and the wolf and how that had long ago been bridged yes it could be done againif it was worthwhile when in doubt ask for a report one of his superiors had once told him well he was going to bring back at least two from heron island and they would both make very thoughtprovoking reading but lundquists schemes exciting though they were belonged to the future franklin had to run the bureau as it was here and now he would prefer to avoid drastic changes for a few years until he had learned his way about besides even if lundquists ideas could be proved practical it would be a long stiff battle selling them to the people who approved the funds i want to buy fifty milking machines for whales please yes franklin could picture the reaction in certain conservative quarters and as for training killer whaleswhy they would think he had gone completely crazy he watched the island fall away as the plane lifted him toward home it was almost fifteen years since he had first made this journey with poor old don how glad don would have been could he have seen this final fruit of his careful training and professor stevens toofranklin had always been a little scared of him but now he could have looked him in the face had he still been alive with a twinge of remorse he realized that he had never properly thanked the psychologist for all that he had done fifteen years from a neurotic trainee to director of the bureau that wasnt bad going and what now walter franklin asked himself he felt no need of any further achievement perhaps his ambition was now satisfied he would be quite content to guide the bureau into a placid and uneventful future it was lucky for his peace of mind that he had no idea how futile that hope was going to be nineteen the photographer had finished but the young man who had been franklins shadow for the last two days still seemed to have an unlimited supply of notebooks and questions was it worth all this trouble to have your undistinguished featuresprobably superimposed on a montage of whalesdisplayed upon every bookstand in the world franklin doubted it but he had no choice in the matter he remembered the saying public servants have no private lives like all aphorisms it was only half true no one had ever heard of the last director of the bureau and he might have led an equally inconspicuous existence if the marine divisions public relations department had not decreed otherwise quite a number of your people mr franklin said the young man from earth magazine have told me about your interest in the socalled great sea serpent and the mission in which first warden burley was killed have there been any further developments in this field franklin sighed he had been afraid that this would come up sooner or later and he hoped that it wouldnt be overplayed in the resulting article he walked over to his private file cabinet and pulled out a thick folder of notes and photographs here are all the sightings bob he said you might like to have a glance through themive kept the record up to date one day i hope well have the answer you can say its still a hobby of mine but its one ive had no chance of doing anything about for the last eight years its up to the department of scientific research nownot the bureau of whales weve other jobs to do he could have added a good deal more but decided against it if secretary parian had not been transferred from dsr soon after the tragic failure of their mission they might have had a second chance but in the inquiries and recriminations that had followed the disaster the opportunity had been lost possibly for years perhaps in every mans life there must be some cherished failure some unfinished business which outweighed many successes then theres only one other question i want to ask continued the reporter what about the future of the bureau have you any interesting longterm plans youd care to talk about this was another tricky one franklin had learned long ago that men in his position must cooperate with the press and in the last two days his busy interrogator had practically become one of the family but there were some things that sounded a little too farfetched and he had contrived to keep dr lundquist out of the way when bob had flown over to heron island true he had seen the prototype milking machine and been duly impressed by it but he had been told nothing about the two young killer whales being maintained at great trouble and expense in the enclosure off the eastern edge of the reef well bob he began slowly by this time you probably know the statistics better than i do we hope to increase the size of our herds by ten per cent over the next five years if this milking scheme comes offand its still purely experimentalwell start cutting back on the sperm whales and will build up the humpbacks at the moment we are providing twelve and a half per cent of the total food requirements of the human race and thats quite a responsibility i hope to see it fifteen per cent while im still in office so that everyone in the world will have whale steak at least once a week eh put it that way if you like but people are eating whale all day without knowing itevery time they use cooking fat or spread margarine on a piece of bread we could double our output and wed get no credit for it since our products are almost always disguised in something else the art department is going to put that right when the story appears well have a picture of the average households groceries for a week with a clock face on each item showing what percentage of it comes from whales thatll be fine erby the wayhave you decided what youre going to call me the reporter grinned thats up to my editor he answered but ill tell him to avoid the word whaleboy like the plague its too hackneyed anyway well ill believe you when we see the article every journalist promises he wont call us that but it seems they can never resist the temptation incidentally when do you expect the story to appear unless some news story crowds it off in about four weeks youll get the proofs of course before thatprobably by the end of next week franklin saw him off through the outer office half sorry to lose an entertaining companion who even if he asked awkward questions more than made up for it by the stories he could tell about most of the famous men on the planet now he supposed he belonged to that group himself for at least a hundred million people would read the current men of earth series the story appeared as promised four weeks later it was accurate wellwritten and contained one mistake so trivial that franklin himself had failed to notice it when he checked the proofs the photographic coverage was excellent and contained an astonishing study of a baby whale suckling its mothera shot obviously obtained at enormous risk and after months of patient stalking the fact that it was actually taken in the pool at heron island without the photographer even getting his feet wet was an irrelevance not allowed to distract the reader apart from the shocking pun beneath the cover picture franklin was delighted with it so was everyone else in the bureau the marine division and even the world food organization itself no one could have guessed that within a few weeks it was to involve the bureau of whales in the greatest crisis of its entire history it was not lack of foresight sometimes the future can be charted in advance and plans made to meet it but there are also times in human affairs when events that seem to have no possible connectionto be as remote as if they occurred on different planetsmay react upon each other with shattering violence the bureau of whales was an organization which had taken half a century to build up and which now employed twenty thousand men and possessed equipment valued at over two billion dollars it was a typical unit of the scientific world state with all the power and prestige which that implied and now it was to be shaken to its foundations by the gentle words of a man who had lived half a thousand years before the birth of christ franklin was in london when the first hint of trouble came it was not unusual for officers of the world food organization to bypass his immediate superiors in the marine division and to contact him directly what was unusual however was for the secretary of the wfo himself to interfere with the everyday working of the bureau causing franklin to cancel all his engagements and to find himself still a little dazed flying halfway around the world to a small town in ceylon of which he had never heard before and whose name he could not even pronounce fortunately it had been a hot summer in london and the extra ten degrees at colombo was not unduly oppressive franklin was met at the airport by the local wfo representative looking very cool and comfortable in the sarong which had now been adopted by even the most conservative of westerners he shook hands with the usual array of minor officials was relieved to see that there were no reporters around who might tell him more about this mission than he knew himself and swiftly transferred to the crosscountry plane which would take him on the last hundred miles of his journey now he said when he had recovered his breath and the miles of neatly laidout automatic tea plantations were flashing past beneath him youd better start briefing me why is it so important to rush me to annawhatever you call the place anuradhapura hasnt the secretary told you we had just five minutes at london airport so you might as well start from scratch well this is something that has been building up for several years weve warned headquarters but theyve never taken us seriously now your interview in earth has brought matters to a head the mahanayake thero of anuradhapura hes the most influential man in the east and youre going to hear a lot more about himread it and promptly asked us to grant him facilities for a tour of the bureau we cant refuse of course but we know perfectly well what he intends to do hell take a team of cameramen with him and will collect enough material to launch an allout propaganda campaign against the bureau then when its had time to sink in hell demand a referendum and if that goes against us we will be in trouble the pieces of the jigsaw fell into place the pattern was at last clear for a moment franklin felt annoyed that he had been diverted across the world to deal with so absurd a challenge then he realized that the men who had sent him here did not consider it absurd they must know better than he did the strength of the forces that were being marshaled it was never wise to underestimate the power of religion even a religion as pacific and tolerant as buddhism the position was one which even a hundred years ago would have seemed unthinkable but the catastrophic political and social changes of the last century had all combined to give it a certain inevitability with the failure or weakening of its three great rivals buddhism was now the only religion that still possessed any real power over the minds of men christianity which had never fully recovered from the shattering blow given it by darwin and freud had finally had unexpectedly succumbed before the archaeological discoveries of the late twentieth century the hindu religion with its fantastic pantheon of gods and goddesses had failed to survive in an age of scientific rationalism and the mohammedan faith weakened by the same forces had suffered additional loss of prestige when the rising star of david had outshone the pale crescent of the prophet these beliefs still survived and would linger on for generations yet but all their power was gone only the teachings of the buddha had maintained and even increased their influence as they filled the vacuum left by the other faiths being a philosophy and not a religion and relying on no revelations vulnerable to the archaeologists hammer buddhism had been largely unaffected by the shocks that had destroyed the other giants it had been purged and purified by internal reformations but its basic structure was unchanged one of the fundamentals of buddhism as franklin knew well enough was respect for all other living creatures it was a law that few buddhists had ever obeyed to the letter excusing themselves with the sophistry that it was quite in order to eat the flesh of an animal that someone else had killed in recent years however attempts had been made to enforce this rule more rigorously and there had been endless debates between vegetarians and meat eaters covering the whole spectrum of crankiness that these arguments could have any practical effect on the work of the world food organization was something that franklin had never seriously considered tell me he asked as the fertile hills rolled swiftly past beneath him what sort of man is this thero youre taking me to see thero is his title you can translate it by archbishop if you like his real name is alexander boyce and he was born in scotland sixty years ago scotland yeshe was the first westerner ever to reach the top of the buddhist hierarchy and he had to overcome a lot of opposition to do it a bhikkuer monkfriend of mine once complained that the maha thero was a typical elder of the kirk born a few hundred years too lateso hed reformed buddhism instead of the church of scotland how did he get to ceylon in the first place believe it or not he came out as a junior technician in a film company he was about twenty then the story is that he went to film the statue of the dying buddha at the cave temple of dambulla and became converted after that it took him twenty years to rise to the top and hes been responsible for most of the reforms that have taken place since then religions get corrupt after a couple of thousand years and need a springcleaning the maha thero did that job for buddhism in ceylon by getting rid of the hindu gods that had crept into the temples and now hes looking around for fresh worlds to conquer it rather seems like it he pretends to have nothing to do with politics but hes thrown out a couple of governments just by raising his finger and hes got a huge following in the east his voice of buddha programs are listened to by several hundred million people and its estimated that at least a billion are sympathetic toward him even if they wont go all the way with his views so youll understand why we are taking this seriously now that he had penetrated the disguise of an unfamiliar name franklin remembered that the venerable alexander boyce had been the subject of a cover story in earth magazine two or three years ago so they had something in common he wished now that he had read that article but at the time it had been of no interest to him and he could not even recall the theros appearance hes a deceptively quiet little man very easy to get on with was the reply to his question youll find him reasonable and friendly but once hes made up his mind he grinds through all opposition like a glacier hes not a fanatic if thats what you are thinking if you can prove to him that any course of action is essential he wont stand in the way even though he may not like what youre doing hes not happy about our local drive for increased meat production but he realizes that everybody cant be a vegetarian we compromised with him by not building our new slaughterhouse in either of the sacred cities as wed intended to do originally then why should he suddenly have taken an interest in the bureau of whales hes probably decided to make a stand somewhere and besidesdont you think whales are in a different class from other animals the remark was made half apologetically as if in the expectation of denial or even ridicule franklin did not answer it was a question he had been trying to decide for twenty years and the scene now passing below absolved him from the necessity he was flying over what had once been the greatest city in the worlda city against which rome and athens in their prime had been no more than villagesa city unchallenged in size or population until the heydays of london and new york two thousand years later a ring of huge artificial lakes some of them miles across surrounded the ancient home of the singhalese kings even from the air the modern town of anuradhapura showed startling contrasts of old and new dotted here and there among the colorful gossamer buildings of the twentyfirst century were the immense bellshaped domes of the great dagobas the mightiest of allthe abhayagiri dagobawas pointed out to franklin as the plane flew low over it the brickwork of the dome had long ago been overgrown with grass and even small trees so that the great temple now appeared no more than a curiously symmetrical hill surmounted by a broken spire it was a hill exceeded in size by one only of the pyramids that the pharaohs had built beside the nile by the time that franklin had reached the local food production office conferred with the superintendent donated a few platitudes to a reporter who had somehow discovered his presence and eaten a leisurely meal he felt that he knew how to handle the situation it was after all merely another publicrelations problem there had been a very similar one about three weeks ago when a sensational and quite inaccurate newspaper story about methods of whale slaughtering had brought a dozen societies for the prevention of cruelty down upon his head a factfinding commission had disposed of the charges very quickly and no permanent damage had been done to anybody except the reporter concerned he did not feel quite so confident a few hours later as he stood looking up at the soaring gilded spire of the ruanveliseya dagoba the immense white dome had been so skillfully restored that it seemed inconceivable that almost twentytwo centuries had passed since its foundations were laid completely surrounding the paved courtyard of the temple was a line of lifesized elephants forming a wall more than a quarter of a mile long art and faith had united here to produce one of the worlds masterpieces of architecture and the sense of antiquity was overwhelming how many of the creations of modern man wondered franklin would be so perfectly preserved in the year the great flagstones in the courtyard were burning hot and he was glad that he had retained his stockings when he left his shoes at the gate at the base of the dome which rose like a shining mountain toward the cloudless blue sky was a singlestoried modern building whose clean lines and white plastic walls harmonized well with the work of architects who had died a hundred years before the beginning of the christian era a saffronrobed bhikku led franklin into the theros neat and comfortably airconditioned office it might have been that of any busy administrator anywhere in the world and the sense of strangeness which had made him ill at ease ever since he had entered the courtyard of the temple began to fade the maha thero rose to greet him he was a small man his head barely reaching the level of franklins shoulders his gleaming shaven scalp somehow depersonalized him making it hard to judge what he was thinking and harder still to fit him into any familiar categories at first sight franklin was not impressed then he remembered how many small men had been movers and shakers of the world even after forty years the mahanayake thero had not lost the accent of his birth at first it seemed incongruous if not slightly comic in these surroundings but within a few minutes franklin was completely unaware of it its very good of you to come all this way to see me mr franklin said the thero affably as he shook hands i must admit that i hardly expected my request to be dealt with quite so promptly it hasnt inconvenienced you i trust no replied franklin manfully in fact he added with rather more truth this visit is a novel experience and im grateful for the opportunity of making it excellent said the thero apparently with genuine pleasure i feel just the same way about my trip down to your south georgia base though i dont suppose ill enjoy the weather there franklin remembered his instructionshead him off if you possibly can but dont try to put any fast ones across on him well he had been given an opening here thats one point i wanted to raise with you your reverence he answered hoping he had chosen the correct honorific its midwinter in south georgia and the base is virtually closed down until the late spring it wont be operating again for about five months how foolish of mei should have remembered but ive never been to the antarctic and ive always wanted to i suppose i was trying to give myself an excuse wellit will have to be one of the northern bases which do you suggest greenland or iceland just tell me which is more convenient we dont want to cause any trouble it was that last phrase which defeated franklin before the battle had fairly begun he knew now that he was dealing with an adversary who could be neither fooled nor deflected from his course he would simply have to go along with the thero dragging his heels as hard as he could and hoping for the best twenty the wide bay was dotted with feathery plumes of mist as the great herd milled around in uncertain circles not alarmed by the voices that had called it to this spot between the mountains but merely undecided as to their meaning all their lives the whales had obeyed the orders that came sometimes in the form of waterborne vibrations sometimes in electric shocks from the small creatures whom they recognized as masters those orders they had come to learn had never harmed them often indeed they had led them to fertile pastures which they would never have found unaided for they were in regions of the sea which all their experience and the memories of a million years told them should be barren and sometimes the small masters had protected them from the killers turning aside the ravening packs before they could tear their living victims into fragments they had no enemies and no fears for generations now they had roamed the peaceful oceans of the world growing fatter and sleeker and more contented than all their ancestors back to the beginning of time in fifty years they had grown on an average ten per cent longer and thirty per cent heavier thanks to the careful stewardship of the masters even now the lord of all their race the hundredandfiftyonefoot blue whale b universally known as leviathan was sporting in the gulf stream with his mate and newborn calf leviathan could never have reached his present size in any earlier age though such matters were beyond proof he was probably the largest animal that had ever existed in the entire history of earth order was emerging out of chaos as the directing fields started to guide the herd along invisible channels presently the electric barriers gave way to concrete ones the whales were swimming along four parallel canals too narrow for more than one to pass at a time automatic senses weighed and measured them rejecting all those below a certain size and diverting them back into the seadoubtless a little puzzled and quite unaware how seriously their numbers had been depleted the whales that had passed the test swam on trustfully along the two remaining channels until presently they came to a large lagoon some tasks could not be left entirely to machines there were human inspectors here to see that no mistakes had been made to check the condition of the animals and to log the numbers of the doomed beasts as they left the lagoon on their last short swim into the killing pens b coming up said franklin to the thero as they stood together in the observation chamber seventyfoot female known to have had five calvespast the best age for breeding behind him he knew the cameras were silently recording the scene as their ivoryskulled saffronrobed operators handled them with a professional skill which had surprised him until he learned that they had all been trained in hollywood the whale never had any warning it probably never even felt the gentle touch of the flexible copper fingers as they brushed its body one moment it was swimming quietly along the pen a second later it was a lifeless hulk continuing to move forward under its own momentum the fiftythousandampere current passing through the heart like a stroke of lightning had not even allowed time for a final convulsion at the end of the killing pen the wide conveyer belt took the weight of the immense body and carried it up a short slope until it was completely clear of the water then it began to move slowly forward along an endless series of spinning rollers which seemed to stretch halfway to the horizon this is the longest conveyor of its kind in the world franklin explained with justifiable pride it may have as many as ten whalessay a thousand tonson it at one time although it involves us in considerable expense and greatly restricts our choice of site we always have the processing plant at least half a mile from the pens so there is no danger of the whales being frightened by the smell of blood i think youll agree that not only is the slaughtering instantaneous but the animals show no alarm whatsoever right up to the end perfectly true said the thero it all seems very humane still if the whales did get frightened it would be very difficult to handle them wouldnt it i wonder if you would go to all this trouble merely to spare their feelings it was a shrewd question and like a good many he had been asked in the last few days franklin was not quite sure how to answer it i suppose he said slowly that would depend on whether we could get the money it would be up to the world assembly in the final analysis the finance committees would have to decide how kind we could afford to be its a theoretical question anyway of coursebut other questions arent so theoretical answered the venerable boyce looking thoughtfully at the eighty tons of flesh and bone moving away into the distance shall we get back to the car i want to see what happens at the other end and i thought franklin grimly will be very interested to see how you and your colleagues take it most visitors who went through the processing yards emerged rather pale and shaken and quite a few had been known to faint it was a standard joke in the bureau that this lesson in food production removed the appetites of all who watched it for several hours after the experience the stench hit them while they were still a hundred yards away out of the corner of his eye franklin could see that the young bhikku carrying the sound recorder was already showing signs of distress but the maha thero seemed completely unaffected he was still calm and dispassionate five minutes later as he stared down into the reeking inferno where the great carcasses were torn asunder into mountains of meat and bone and guts just think of it said franklin for almost two hundred years this job was done by men often working on board a pitching deck in filthy weather its not pretty to watch even now but can you imagine being down there hacking away with a knife nearly as big as yourself i think i could answered the thero but id prefer not to he turned to his cameramen and gave some brief instructions then watched intently as the next whale arrived on the conveyer belt the great body had already been scanned by photoelectric eyes and its dimensions fed into the computer controlling the operations even when one knew how it was done it was uncanny to watch the precision with which the knives and saws moved out on their extensible arms made their care fully planned pattern of cuts and then retreated again huge grabs seized the footthick blanket of blubber and stripped it off as a man peels a banana leaving the naked bleeding carcass to move on along the conveyer to the first stage of its dismemberment the whale traveled as fast as a man could comfortably walk and disintegrated before the eyes of the watchers as they kept pace with it slabs of meat as large as elephants were torn away and went sliding down side chutes circular saws whirred through the scaffolding of ribs in a cloud of bone dust the interlinked plastic bags of the intestines stuffed with perhaps a ton of shrimps and plankton from the whales last meal were dragged away in noisome heaps it had taken less than two minutes to reduce a lord of the sea to a bloody shambles which no one but an expert could have recognized not even the bones were wasted at the end of the conveyer belt the disarticulated skeleton fell into a pit where it would be ground into fertilizer this is the end of the line said franklin but as far as the processing side is concerned its only the beginning the oil has to be extracted from the blubber you saw peeled off in stage one the meat has to be cut down into more manageable portions and sterilizedwe use a highintensity neutron source for thatand about ten other basic products have to be sorted out and packed for shipment ill be glad to show you around any part of the factory youd like to see it wont be quite so gruesome as the operations weve just been watching the thero stood for a moment in thoughtful silence studying the notes he had been making in his incredibly tiny handwriting then he looked back along the bloodstained quartermile of moving belt toward the next whale arriving from the killing pen theres one sequence im not sure we managed to film properly he said coming to a sudden decision if you dont mind id like to go back to the beginning and start again franklin caught the recorder as the young monk dropped it never mind son he said reassuringly the first time is always the worst when youve been here a few days youll be quite puzzled when newcomers complain of the stink that was hard to believe but the permanent staff had assured him that it was perfectly true he only hoped that the venerable boyce was not so thoroughgoing that he would have a chance of putting it to the proof and now your reverence said franklin as the plane lifted above the snowcovered mountains and began the homeward flight to london and ceylon do you mind if i ask how you intend to use all the material youve gathered during the two days they had been together priest and administrator had established a degree of friendship and mutual respect that franklin for his part still found as surprising as it was pleasant he consideredas who does notthat he was good at summing men up but there were depths in the mahanayake thero beyond his powers of analysis it did not matter he now knew instinctively that he was in the presence not only of power but also ofthere was no escaping from that trite and jejune wordgoodness he had even begun to wonder with a mounting awe that at any moment might deepen into certainty if the man who was now his companion would go down into history as a saint i have nothing to hide said the thero gently and as you know deceit is contrary to the teachings of the buddha our position is quite simple we believe that all creatures have a right to life and it therefore follows that what you are doing is wrong accordingly we would like to see it stopped that was what franklin had expected but it was the first time he had obtained a definite statement he felt a slight sense of disappointment surely someone as intelligent as the thero must realize that such a move was totally impracticable since it would involve cutting off one eighth of the total food supply of the world and for that matter why stop at whales what about cows sheep pigsall the animals that man kept in luxury and then slaughtered at his convenience i know what you are thinking said the thero before he could voice his objections we are fully aware of the problems involved and realize that it will be necessary to move slowly but a start must be made somewhere and the bureau of whales gives us the most dramatic presentation of our case thank you answered franklin dryly but is that altogether fair what youve seen here happens in every slaughterhouse on the planet the fact that the scale of operations is different hardly alters the case i quite agree but we are practical men not fanatics we know perfectly well that alternative food sources will have to be found before the worlds meat supplies can be cut off franklin shook his head in vigorous disagreement im sorry he said but even if you could solve the supply problem youre not going to turn the entire population of the planet into vegetariansunless you are anxious to encourage emigration to mars and venus id shoot myself if i thought i could never eat a lamb chop or a welldone steak again so your plans are bound to fail on two counts human psychology and the sheer facts of food production the maha thero looked a little hurt my dear director he said surely you dont think we would overlook something as obvious as that but let me finish putting our point of view before i explain how we propose to implement it ill be interested in studying your reactions because you represent the maximumahconsumer resistance we are likely to meet very well smiled franklin see if you can convert me out of my job since the beginning of history said the there man has assumed that the other animals exist only for his benefit he has wiped out whole species sometimes through sheer greed sometimes because they destroyed his crops or interfered with his other activities i wont deny that he often had justification and frequently no alternative but down the ages man has blackened his soul with his crimes against the animal kingdomsome of the very worst incidentally being in your particular profession only sixty or seventy years ago ive read of cases where harpooned whales died after hours of such frightful torment that not a scrap of their meat could be usedit was poisoned with the toxins produced by the animals death agonies very exceptional interjected franklin and anyway weve put a stop to that true but its all part of the debt we have to discharge svend foyn wouldnt have agreed with you when he invented the explosive harpoon back in the s he made an entry in his diary thanking god for having done all the work an interesting point of view answered the thero dryly i wish id had a chance of arguing it with him you know there is a simple test which divides the human race into two classes if a man is walking along the street and sees a beetle crawling just where he is going to place his footwell he can break his stride and miss it or he can crush it into pulp which would you do mr franklin it would depend on the beetle if i knew it was poisonous or a pest id kill it otherwise id let it go that surely is what any reasonable man would do then we are not reasonable we believe that killing is only justified to save the life of a higher creatureand it is surprising how seldom that situation arises but let me get back to my argument we seem to have lost our way about a hundred years ago an irish poet named lord dunsany wrote a play called the use of man which youll be seeing on one of our tv programs before long in it a man dreams that hes magically transported out of the solar system to appear before a tribunal of animalsand if he cannot find two to speak on his behalf the human race is doomed only the dog will come forward to fawn over his master all the others remember their old grievances and maintain that they would have been better off if man had never existed the sentence of annihilation is about to be pronounced when another sponsor arrives in the nick of time and humanity is saved the only other creature who has any use for man is the mosquito now you may think that this is merely an amusing jest so i am sure did dunsanywho happened to be a keen hunter but poets often speak hidden truths of which they themselves are unaware and i believe that this almost forgotten play contains an allegory of profound importance to the human race within a century or so franklin we will literally be going outside the solar system sooner or later we will meet types of intelligent life much higher than our own yet in forms completely alien and when that time comes the treatment man receives from his superiors may well depend upon the way he has behaved toward the other creatures of his own world the words were spoken so quietly yet with such conviction that they struck a sudden chill into franklins soul for the first time he felt that there might be something in the others point of viewsomething that is besides mere humanitarianism he had never liked the final climax of his work for he had long ago developed a great affection for his monstrous charges but he had always regarded it as a regrettable necessity i grant that your points are well made he admitted but whether we like them or not we have to accept the realities of life i dont know who coined the phrase nature red in tooth and claw but thats the way she is and if the work has to choose between food and ethics i know which will win the thero gave that secret gentle smile which consciously or otherwise seemed to echo the benign gaze that so many generations of artists had made the hallmark of the buddha but that is just the point my dear franklin he answered there is no longer any need for a choice ours is the first generation in the worlds history that can break the ancient cycle and eat what it pleases without spilling the blood of innocent creatures i am sincerely grateful to you for helping to show me how me exploded franklin exactly said the thero the extent of his smile now far exceeding the canons of buddhist art and now if you will excuse me i think ill go to sleep twentyone so this grumbled franklin is my reward for twenty years of devoted public serviceto be regarded even by my own family as a bloodstained butcher but all that was true wasnt it said anne pointing to the tv screen which a few seconds ago had been dripping with gore of course it was but it was also very cleverly edited propaganda i could make out just as good a case for our side are you sure of that asked indra the division will certainly want you to but it may not be easy franklin snorted indignantly why those statistics are all nonsense the very idea of switching our entire herds to milking instead of slaughtering is just crazy if we converted all our resources to whalemilk production we couldnt make up a quarter of the loss of fats and protein involved in closing down the processing plants now walter said indra placidly theres no need to break a blood vessel trying to keep calm whats really upset you is the suggestion that the plankton farms should be extended to make up the deficit well youre the biologist is it practical to turn that pea soup into prime ribs of beef or tbone steaks its obviously possible it was a very clever move having the chef of the waldorf tasting both the genuine and the synthetic product and being unable to tell the difference theres no doubt youre going to have a lovely fight on your handsthe farm people will jump right in on the theros side of the fence and the whole marine division will be split wide open he probably planned that said franklin with reluctant admiration hes diabolically wellinformed i wish now i hadnt said so much about the possibilities of milk production during that interviewand they did overplay it a bit in the final article im sure thats what started the whole business thats another thing i was going to mention where did he get the figures on which he based his statistics as far as i know they have never been published anywhere outside the bureau youre right conceded franklin i should have thought of that before first thing tomorrow morning im going out to heron island to have a little talk with dr lundquist will you take me daddy pleaded anne not this time young lady i wouldnt like an innocent daughter of mine to hear some of the things i may have to say dr lundquist is out in the lagoon sir said the chief lab assistant theres no way of contacting him until he decides to come up oh isnt there i could go down and tap him on the shoulder i dont think that would be at all wise sir attila and genghis khan arent very fond of strangers good godis he swimming with them oh yestheyre quite fond of him and theyve got very friendly with the wardens who work with them but anyone else might be eaten rather quickly quite a lot seemed to be going on thought franklin that he knew very little about he decided to walk to the lagoon unless it was extremely hot or one had something to carry it was never worthwhile to take a car for such short distances he had changed his mind by the time he reached the new eastern jetty either heron island was getting bigger or he was beginning to feel his years he sat down on the keel of an upturned dinghy and looked out to sea the tide was in but the sharp dividing line marking the edge of the reef was clearly visible and in the fencedoff enclosure the spouts of the two killer whales appeared as intermittent plumes of mist there was a small boat out there with somebody in it but it was too far away for him to tell whether it was dr lundquist or one of his assistants he waited for a few minutes then telephoned for a boat to carry him out to the reef in slightly more time than it would have taken him to swim there he arrived at the enclosure and had his first good look at attila and genghis khan the two killer whales were a little under thirty feet long and as his boat approached them they simultaneously reared out of the water and stared at him with their huge intelligent eyes the unusual attitude and the pure white of the bodies now presented to him gave franklin the uncanny impression that he was face to face not with animals but with beings who might be higher in the order of creation than himself he knew that the truth was far otherwise and reminded himself that he was looking at the most ruthless killer in the sea no that was not quite correct the second most ruthless killer in the sea the whales dropped back into the water apparently satisfied with their scrutiny it was then that franklin made out lundquist working about thirty feet down with a small torpedo loaded with instruments probably the commotion had disturbed him because he came quickly to the surface and lay treading water with his face mask pushed back as he recognized his visitor good morning mr franklin i wasnt expecting you today what do you think of my pupils very impressive how well are they learning their lessons theres no doubt about ittheyre brilliant even cleverer than porpoises and surprisingly affectionate when they get to know you i can teach them to do anything now if i wanted to commit the perfect murder i could tell them that you were a seal on an ice floe and theyd have the boat over in two seconds in that case id prefer to continue our conversation back on land have you finished whatever youre doing its never finished but that doesnt matter ill ride the torp backno need to lift all this gear into the boat the scientist swung his tiny metal fish around toward the island and promptly set off at a speed which the dinghy could not hope to match at once the two killers streaked after him their huge dorsal fins leaving a creamy wake in the water it seemed a dangerous game of tag to play but before franklin could discover what would happen when the killers caught the torpedo lundquist had crossed the shallow but clearly marked mesh around the enclosure and the two whales broke their rush in a flurry of spray franklin was very thoughtful on the way back to land he had known lundquist for years but now he felt that this was the first time he had ever really seen him there had never been any doubt concerning his originalityindeed his brilliancebut he also appeared to possess unsuspected courage and initiative none of which franklin determined grimly would help him unless he had a satisfactory answer to certain questions dressed in his everyday clothes and back in the familiar laboratory surroundings lundquist was the man franklin had always known now john he began i suppose youve seen this television propaganda against the bureau of course but is it against us its certainly against our main activity but we wont argue that point what i want to know is this have you been in touch with the maha thero oh yes he contacted me immediately after that article appeared in earth magazine and you passed on confidential information to him lundquist looked sincerely hurt i resent that mr franklin the only information i gave him was an advance proof of my paper on whalemilk production which comes out in the cetological review next month you approved it for publication yourself the accusations that franklin was going to make collapsed around his ears and he felt suddenly rather ashamed of himself im sorry john he said i take that back all this has made me a bit jumpy and i just want to sort out the facts before hq starts chasing me but dont you think you should have told me about this inquiry frankly i dont see why we get all sorts of queries every day and i saw no reason to suppose that this was not just another routine one of course i was pleased that somebody was taking a particular interest in my special project and i gave them all the help i could very well said franklin resignedly lets forget the postmortem but answer for me this question as a scientist do you really believe that we can afford to stop whale slaughtering and switch over to milk and synthetics given ten years we can do it if we have to theres no technical objection that i can see of course i cant guarantee the figures on the planktonfarming side but you can bet your life that the thero had accurate sources of information there as well but you realize what this will mean if it starts with whales sooner or later it will go right down the line through all the domestic animals and why not the prospect rather appeals to me if science and religion can combine to take some of the cruelty out of nature isnt that a good thing you sound like a cryptobuddhistand im tired of pointing out that theres no cruelty in what we are doing meanwhile if the thero asks any more questions kindly refer him to me very good mr franklin lundquist replied rather stiffly there was an awkward pause providentially broken by the arrival of a messenger headquarters wants to speak to you mr franklin its urgent i bet it is muttered franklin then he caught sight of lundquists still somewhat hostile expression and could not suppress a smile if you can train orcas to be wardens john he said youd better start looking around for a suitable mammal preferably amphibiousto be the next director on a planet of instantaneous and universal communications ideas spread from pole to pole more rapidly than they could once have done by word of mouth in a single village the skillfully edited and presented program which had spoiled the appetites of a mere twenty million people on its first appearance had a far larger audience on its second soon there were few other topics of conversation one of the disadvantages of life in a peaceful and wellorganized world state was that with the disappearance of wars and crises very little was left of what was once called news indeed the complaint had often been made that since the ending of national sovereignty history had also been abolished so the argument raged in club and kitchen in world assembly and lonely space freighter with no competition from any other quarter the world food organization maintained a dignified silence but behind the scenes there was furious activity matters were not helped by the brisk lobbying of the farm group which it had taken no great foresight on indras part to predict franklin was particularly annoyed by the efforts of the rival department to profit from his difficulties and made several protests to the director of plankton farms when the infighting became a little too rough damn it all ted he had snarled over the viewphone on one occasion youre just as big a butcher as i am every ton of raw plankton you process contains half a billion shrimps with as much right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness as my whales so dont try to stand in a white sheet sooner or later the thero will work down to youthis is only the thin edge of the wedge maybe youre right walter the culprit had admitted cheerfully enough but i think the farms will last out my time its not easy to make people sentimental over shrimps they dont have cute little tenton babies to nurse that was perfectly true it was very hard to draw the line between maudlin sentimentality and rational humanitarianism franklin remembered a recent cartoon showing the thero raising his arms in protest while a shrieking cabbage was brutally dragged from the ground the artist had taken no sides he had merely summed up the viewpoint of those who considered that a great deal of fuss was being made about nothing perhaps this whole affair would blow over in a few weeks when people became bored and started arguing about something elsebut he doubted it that first television program had shown that the thero was an expert in molding public opinion he could be relied upon not to let his campaign lose momentum it took less than a month for the thero to obtain the ten per cent vote needed under the constitution to set up a commission of inquiry the fact that one tenth of the human race was sufficiently interested in the matter to request that all the facts be laid before it did not mean that they agreed with the thero mere curiosity and the pleasure of seeing a department of the state fighting a defensive rearguard action was quite enough to account for the vote in itself a commission of inquiry meant very little what would matter would be the final referendum on the commissions report and it would be months before that could be arranged one of the unexpected results of the twentieth centurys electronic revolution was that for the first time in history it was possible to have a truly democratic governmentin the sense that every citizen could express his views on matters of policy what the athenians with indifferent success had tried to do with a few thousand score of free men could now be achieved in a global society of five billions automatic sampling devices originally devised for the rating of television programs had turned out to have a far wider significance by making it a relatively simple and inexpensive matter to discover exactly what the public really thought on any subject naturally there had to be safeguards and such a system would have been disastrous before the days of universal educationbefore in fact the beginning of the twentyfirst century even now it was possible for some emotionally laden issue to force a vote that was really against the best interests of the community and no government could function unless it held the final right to decide matters of policy during its term of office even if the world demanded some course of action by a ninetynine per cent vote the state could ignore the expressed will of the peoplebut it would have to account for its behavior at the next election franklin did not relish the privilege of being a key witness at the commissions hearings but he knew that there was no way in which he could escape this ordeal much of his time was now spent in collecting data to refute the arguments of those who wished to put an end to whale slaughtering and it proved to be a more difficult task than he had imagined one could not present a neat clearcut case by saying that processed whale meat cost so much per pound by the time it reached the consumers table whereas synthetic meats derived from plankton or algae would cost more nobody knew there were far too many variables the biggest unknown of all was the cost of running the proposed sea dairies if it was decided to breed whales purely for milk and not for slaughter the data were insufficient it would be honest to say so but there was pressure on him to state outright that the suspension of whale slaughtering would never be a practical or economic possibility his own loyalty to the bureau not to mention the security of his present position prompted him in the same direction but it was not merely a matter of economics there were emotional factors which disturbed franklins judgment and made it impossible for him to make up his mind the days he had spent with the maha thero and his brief glimpse of a civilization and a way of thought far older than his own had affected him more deeply than he had realized like most men of his highly materialistic era he was intoxicated with the scientific and sociological triumphs which had irradiated the opening decades of the twentyfirst century he prided himself on his skeptical rationalism and his total freedom from superstition the fundamental questions of philosophy had never bothered him greatly he knew that they existed but they had seemed the concern of other people and now whether he liked it or not he had been challenged from a quarter so unexpected that he was almost defenseless he had always considered himself a humane man but now he had been reminded that humanity might not be enough as he struggled with his thoughts he became progressively more and more irritable with the world around him and matters finally became so bad that indra had to take action walter she said firmly when anne had gone tearfully to bed after a row in which there was a good deal of blame on both sides it will save a lot of trouble if you face the facts and stop trying to fool yourself what the devil do you mean youve been angry with everybody this last weekwith just one exception youve lost your temper with lundquistthough that was partly my faultwith the press with just about every other bureau in the division with the children and any moment youre going to lose it with me but theres one person youre not angry withand thats the maha thero whos the cause of all the trouble why should i be hes crazy of course but hes a saintor as near it as i ever care to meet im not arguing about that im merely saying that you really agree with him but you wont admit it franklin started to explode thats utterly ridiculous he began then his indignation petered out it was ridiculous but it was also perfectly true he felt a great calm come upon him he was no longer angry with the world and with himself his childish resentment of the fact that he should be the man involved in a dilemma not of his making suddenly evaporated there was no reason why he should be ashamed of the fact that he had grown to love the great beasts he guarded if their slaughter could be avoided he should welcome it whatever the consequences to the bureau the parting smile of the thero suddenly floated up into his memory had that extraordinary man foreseen that he would win him around to his point of view if his gentle persuasivenesswhich he had not hesitated to combine with the shock tactics of that bloodstained television programcould work with franklin himself then the battle was already half over twentytwo life was a good deal simpler in the old days thought indra with a sigh it was true that peter and anne were both at school or college most of the time but somehow that had given her none of the additional leisure she had expected there was so much entertaining and visiting to do now that walter had moved into the upper echelons of the state though perhaps that was exaggerating a little the director of the bureau of whales was still a long wayat least six stepsdown from the rarefied heights in which the president and his advisers dwelt but there were some things that cut right across official rank no one could deny that there was a glamour about walts job and an interest in his activities that had made him known to a far wider circle than the other directors of the marine division even before the earth magazine article or the present controversy over whale slaughtering how many people could name the director of plankton farms or of freshwater food production not one to every hundred that had heard of walter it was a fact that made her proud even though at the same time it exposed walter to a good deal of interdepartmental jealousy now however it seemed likely to expose him to worse than that so far no one in the bureau still less any of the higher officials of the marine division or the world food organization imagined for one moment that walter had any private doubts or that he was not wholeheartedly in support of the status quo her attempts to read the current nature were interrupted by the privateline viewphone it had been installed despite her bitter protests the day that walter had become director the public service it seemed was not good enough now the office could get hold of walter whenever it liked unless he took precautions to frustrate it oh good morning mrs franklin said the operator who was now practically a friend of the family is the director in im afraid not said indra with satisfaction he hasnt had a day off for about a month and hes out sailing in the bay with peter if you want to catch him youll have to send a plane out js radio has broken down again both sets thats odd still its not urgent when he comes in will you give him this memo there was a barely audible click and a sheet of paper drifted down into the extra largesized memorandum basket indra read it gave the operator an absentminded farewell and at once called franklin on his perfectly serviceable radio the creak of the rigging the soft rush of water past the smooth hulleven the occasional cry of a sea birdthese sounds came clearly from the speaker and transported her at once out into moreton bay i thought youd like to know walter she said the policy board is having its special meeting next wednesday here in brisbane that gives you three days to decide what youre going to tell them there was a slight pause during which she could hear her husband moving about the boat then franklin answered thanks dear i know what ive got to sayi just dont know how to say it but theres something ive thought of that you can do to help you know all the wardens wivessuppose you call up as many as you can and try to find what their husbands feel about this business can you do that without making it look too obvious its not so easy for me nowadays to find what the men in the field are thinking theyre too liable to tell me what they imagine i want to know there was a wistful note in franklins voice which indra had been hearing more and more frequently these days though she knew her husband well enough to be quite sure that he had no real regrets for having taken on his present responsibilities thats a good idea she said there are at least a dozen people i should have called up weeks ago and this will give me an excuse it probably means that well have to have another party though i dont mind that as long as im still director and can afford to pay for it but if i revert to a wardens pay in a month or so well have to cut out the entertaining you dont really think oh it wont be as bad as that but they may shift me to some nice safe job though i cant imagine what use i am now outside the bureau get out of the way you blasted foolcant you see where youre going sorry deartoo many weekend sailors around well be back in ninety minutes unless some idiot rams us pete says he wants honey for tea bye now indra looked thoughtfully at the radio as the sounds of the distant boat ceased abruptly she half wished that she had accompanied walter and pete on their cruise out into the bay but she had faced the fact that her son now needed his fathers company rather than hers there were times when she grudged this realizing that in a few months they would both lose the boy whose mind and body they had formed but who was now slipping from their grasp it was inevitable of course the ties that bound father and son together must now drive them apart she doubted if peter realized why he was so determined to get into space after all it was a common enough ambition among boys of his age but he was one of the youngest ever to obtain a triplanetary scholarship and it was easy to understand why he was determined to conquer the element that had defeated his father but enough of this daydreaming she told herself she got out her file of visiphone numbers and began to tick off the names of all the wardens wives who would be at home the policy board normally met twice a year and very seldom had much policy to discuss since most of the bureaus work was satisfactorily taken care of by the committees dealing with finance production staff and technical development franklin served on all of these though only as an ordinary member since the chairman was always someone from the marine division or the world secretariat he sometimes came back from the meetings depressed and discouraged what was very unusual was for him to come back in a bad temper as well indra knew that something had gone wrong the moment he entered the house let me know the worst she said resignedly as her exhausted husband flopped into the most comfortable chair in sight do you have to find a new job she was only half joking and franklin managed a wan smile its not as bad as that he answered but theres more in this business than i thought old burrows had got it all worked out before he took the chair someone in the secretariat had briefed him pretty thoroughly what it comes to is this unless it can be proved that food production from whale milk and synthetics will be drastically cheaper than the present method whale slaughtering will continue even a ten per cent saving isnt regarded as good enough to justify a switchover as burrows put it were concerned with cost accounting not abstruse philosophical principles like justice to animals thats reasonable enough i suppose and certainly i wouldnt try to fight it the trouble started during the break for coffee when burrows got me into a corner and asked me what the wardens thought about the whole business so i told him that eighty per cent of them would like to see slaughtering stopped even if it meant a rise in food costs i dont know why he asked me this particular question unless news of our little survey has leaked out anyway it upset him a bit and i could see him trying to get around to something then he put it bluntly that id be a key witness when the inquiry started and that the marine division wouldnt like me to plead the theros case in open court with a few million people watching suppose im asked for my personal opinion i said no ones worked harder than me to increase whalemeat and oil production but as soon as its possible id like to see the bureau become a purely conservation service he asked if this was my considered viewpoint and i told him that it was then things got a bit personal though still in a friendly sort of way and we agreed that there was a distinct cleavage of opinion between the people who handled whales as whales and those who saw them only as statistics on foodproduction charts after that burrows went off and made some phone calls and kept us all waiting around for half an hour while he talked to a few people up in the secretariat he finally came back with what were virtually my orders though he was careful not to put it that way it comes to this ive got to be an obedient little ventriloquists dummy at the inquiry but suppose the other side asks you outright for your personal views our counsel will try to head them off and if he fails im not supposed to have any personal views and whats the point of all this thats what i asked burrows and i finally managed to get it out of him there are political issues involved the secretariat is afraid that the maha thero will get too powerful if he wins this case so its going to be fought whatever its merits now i understand said indra slowly do you think that the thero is after political power for its own sakeno but he may be trying to gain influence to put across his religious ideas and thats what the secretariats afraid of and what are you going to do about it i dont know franklin answered i really dont know he was still undecided when the hearings began and the maha thero made his first personal appearance before a worldwide audience he was not franklin could not help thinking as he looked at the small yellowrobed figure with its gleaming skull very impressive at first sight indeed there was something almost comic about himuntil he began to speak and one knew without any doubt that one was in the presence both of power and conviction i would like to make one thing perfectly clear said the maha thero addressing not only the chairman of the commission but also the unseen millions who were watching this first hearing it is not true that we are trying to enforce vegetarianism on the world as some of our opponents have tried to maintain the buddha himself did not abstain from eating meat when it was given to him nor do we for a guest should accept gratefully whatever his host offers our attitude is based on something deeper and more fundamental than food prejudices which are usually only a matter of conditioning what is more we believe that most reasonable men whether their religious beliefs are the same as ours or not will eventually accept our point of view it can be summed up very simply though it is the result of twentysix centuries of thought we consider that it is wrong to inflict injury or death on any living creature but we are not so foolish as to imagine that it can be avoided altogether thus we recognize for example the need to kill microbes and insect pests much though we may regret the necessity but as soon as such killing is no longer essential it should cease we believe that this point has now arrived as far as many of the higher animals are concerned the production of all types of synthetic protein from purely vegetable sources is now an economic possibilityor it will be if the effort is made to achieve it within a generation we can shed the burden of guilt which however lightly or heavily it has weighed on individual consciences must at some time or other have haunted all thinking men as they look at the world of life which shares their planet yet this is not an attitude which we seek to enforce on anyone against his will good actions lose any merit if they are imposed by force we will be content to let the facts we will present speak for themselves so that the world may make its own choice it was thought franklin a simple straightforward speech quite devoid of any of the fanaticism which would have fatally prejudiced the case in this rational age and yet the whole matter was one that went beyond reason in a purely logical world this controversy could never have arisen for no one would have doubted mans right to use the animal kingdom as he felt fit logic however could be easily discredited here it could be used too readily to make out a convincing case for cannibalism the thero had not mentioned anywhere in his argument one point which had made a considerable impact on franklin he had not raised the possibility that man might someday come into contact with alien life forms that might judge him by his conduct toward the rest of the animal kingdom did he think that this was so farfetched an idea that the general public would be unable to take it seriously and would thus grow to regard his whole campaign as a joke or had he realized that it was an argument that might particularly appeal to an exastronaut there was no way of guessing in either event it proved that the thero was a shrewd judge both of private and public reactions franklin switched off the receiver the scenes it was showing now were quite familiar to him since he had helped the thero to film them the marine division he thought wryly would now be regretting the facilities it had offered his reverence but there was nothing else it could have done in the circumstances in two days he would be appearing to give his evidence already he felt more like a criminal on trial than a witness and in truth he was on trialor to be more accurate his conscience was it was strange to think that having once tried to kill himself he now objected to killing other creatures there was some connection here but it was too complicated for him to unraveland even if he did it would not help him to solve his dilemma yet the solution was on the way and from a totally unexpected direction twentythree franklin was boarding the plane that would take him to the hearings when the subsmash signal came through he stood in the doorway reading the scarlettabbed message that had been rushed out to him and at that moment all his other problems ceased to exist the sos was from the bureau of mines the largest of all the sections of the marine division its title was a slightly misleading one for it did not run a single mine in the strict sense of the word twenty or thirty years ago there had indeed been mines on the ocean beds but now the sea itself was an inexhaustible treasure chest almost every one of the natural elements could be extracted directly and economically from the millions of tons of dissolved matter in each cubic mile of sea water with the perfection of selective ionexchange filters the nightmare of metal shortages had been banished forever the bureau of mines was also responsible for the hundreds of oil wells that now dotted the sea beds pumping up the precious fluid that was the basic material for half the chemical plants on earthand which earlier generations with criminal shortsightedness had actually burned for fuel there were plenty of accidents that could befall the bureaus worldwide empire only last year franklin had lent it a whaling sub in an unsuccessful attempt to salvage a tank of gold concentrate but this was far more serious as he discovered after he had put through a few priority calls thirty minutes later he was airborne though not in the direction he had expected to be going and it was almost an hour after he had taken off before all the orders had been given and he at last had a chance of calling indra she was surprised at the unexpected call but her surprise quickly turned to alarm listen dear franklin began im not going to berne after all mines has had a serious accident and has appealed for our help one of their big subs is trapped on the bottomit was drilling a well and hit a highpressure gas pocket the derrick was blown over and toppled on the sub so that it cant get away theres a load of vips aboard including a senator and the director of mines i dont know how were going to pull them out but well do our best ill call you again when ive got time will you have to go down yourself asked indra anxiously probably now dont look so upset ive been doing it for years im not upset retorted indra and franklin knew better than to contradict her goodby darling he continued give my love to anne and dont worry indra watched the image fade it had already vanished when she realized that walter had not looked so happy for weeks perhaps that was not the right word to use when mens lives were at stake it would be truer to say that he looked full of life and enthusiasm she smiled knowing full well the reason why now walter could get away from the problems of his office and could lose himself again if only for a while in the clearcut and elemental simplicities of the sea there she is said the pilot of the sub pointing to the image forming at the edge of the sonar screen on hard rock eleven hundred feet down in a couple of minutes well be able to make out the details hows the water claritycan we use tv i doubt it that gas geyser is still spoutingthere it is that fuzzy echo its stirred up all the mud for miles around franklin stared at the screen comparing the image forming there with the plans and sketches on the desk the smooth ovoid of the big shallowwater sub was partly obscured by the wreckage of the drills and derricka thousand or more tons of steel pinning it to the ocean bed it was not surprising that though it had blown its buoyancy tanks and turned its jets on to full power the vessel had been unable to move more than a foot or two its a nice mess said franklin thoughtfully how long will it take for the big tugs to get here at least four days hercules can lift five thousand tons but shes down at singapore and shes too big to be flown here shell have to come under her own steam youre the only people with subs small enough to be airlifted that was true enough thought franklin but it also meant that they were not big enough to do any heavy work the only hope was that they could operate cutting torches and carve up the derrick until the trapped sub was able to escape another of the bureaus scouts was already at work someone franklin told himself had earned a citation for the speed with which the torches had been fitted to a vessel not designed to carry them he doubted if even the space department for all its fabled efficiency could have acted any more swiftly than this captain jacobsen calling said the loudspeaker glad to have you with us mr franklin your boys are doing a good job but it looks as if it will take time how are things inside not so bad the only thing that worries me is the hull between bulkheads three and four it took the impact there and theres some distortion can you close off the section if a leak develops not very well said jacobsen dryly it happens to be the middle of the control room if we have to evacuate that well be completely helpless what about your passengers ertheyre fine replied the captain in a tone suggesting that he was giving some of them the benefit of a good deal of doubt senator chamberlain would like a word with you hello franklin began the senator didnt expect to meet you again under these circumstances how long do you think it will take to get us out the senator had a good memory or else he had been well briefed franklin had met him on not more than three occasionsthe last time in canberra at a session of the committee for the conservation of natural resources as a witness franklin had been before the ccnr for about ten minutes and he would not have expected its busy chairman to remember the fact i cant make any promises senator he answered cautiously it may take some time to clear away all this rubbish but well manage all rightno need to worry about that as the sub drew closer he was not so sure the derrick was over two hundred feet long and it would be a slow business nibbling it away in sections that the little scoutsubs could handle for the next ten minutes there was a threecornered conference between franklin captain jacobsen and chief warden barlow skipper of the second scoutsub at the end of that time they had agreed that the best plan was to continue to cut away the derrick even taking the most pessimistic view they should be able to finish the job at least two days before the hercules could arrive unless of course there were any unexpected snags the only possible danger seemed to be the one that captain jacobsen had mentioned like all large undersea vessels his ship carried an airpurifying plant which would keep the atmosphere breathable for weeks but if the hull failed in the region of the control room all the subs essential services would be disrupted the occupants might retreat behind the pressure bulkheads but that would give them only a temporary reprieve because the air would start to become foul immediately moreover with part of the sub flooded it would be extremely difficult even for the hercules to lift her before he joined barlow in the attack on the derrick franklin called base on the longrange transmitter and ordered all the additional equipment that might conceivably be needed he asked for two more subs to be flown out at once and started the workshops mass producing buoyancy tanks by the simple process of screwing air couplings onto old oil drums if enough of these could be hitched to the derrick it might be lifted without any help from the submarine salvage vessel there was one other piece of equipment which he hesitated for some time before ordering then he muttered to himself better get too much than too little and sent off the requisition even though he knew that the stores department would probably think him crazy the work of cutting through the girders of the smashed derrick was tedious but not difficult the two subs worked together one burning through the steel while the other pulled away the detached section as soon as it came loose soon franklin became completely unconscious of time all that existed was the short length of metal which he was dealing with at that particular moment messages and instructions continually came and went but another part of his mind dealt with them hands and brain were functioning as two separate entities the water which had been completely turbid when they arrived was now clearing rapidly the roaring geyser of gas that was bursting from the sea bed barely a hundred yards away must have sucked in fresh water to sweep away the mud it had originally disturbed whatever the explanation it made the task of salvage very much simpler since the subs external eyes could function again franklin was almost taken aback when the reinforcements arrived it seemed impossible that he had been here for more than six hours he felt neither tired nor hungry the two subs brought with them like a long procession of tin cans the first batch of the buoyancy tanks he had ordered now the plan of campaign was altered one by one the oil drums were clipped to the derrick air hoses were coupled to them and the water inside them was blown out until they strained upward like captive balloons each had a lifting power of two or three tons by the time a hundred had been attached franklin calculated the trapped sub might be able to escape without any further help the remote handling equipment on the outside of the scoutsub so seldom used in normal operations now seemed an extension of his own arms it had been at least four years since he had manipulated the ingenious metal fingers that enabled a man to work in places where his unprotected body could never goand he remembered from ten years earlier still the first time he had attempted to tie a knot and the hopeless tangle he had made of it that was one of the skills he had hardly ever used who would have imagined that it would be vital now that he had left the sea and was no longer a warden they were starting to pump out the second batch of oil drums when captain jacobsen called im afraid ive got bad news franklin he said his voice heavy with apprehension theres water coming in and the leaks increasing at the present rate well have to abandon the control room in a couple of hours this was the news that franklin had feared it transformed a straightforward salvage job into a race against timea race hopelessly handicapped since it would take at least a day to cut away the rest of the derrick whats your internal air pressure he asked captain jacobsen ive already pushed it up to five atmospheres its not safe to put it up any farther take it up to eight if you can even if half of you pass out that wont matter as long as someone remains in control and it may help to keep the leak from spreading which is the important thing ill do thatbut if most of us are unconscious it wont be easy to evacuate the control room there were too many people listening for franklin to make the obvious replythat if the control room had to be abandoned it wouldnt matter anyway captain jacobsen knew that as well as he did but some of his passengers might not realize that such a move would end any chance of rescue the decision he had hoped he would not have to make was now upon him this slow whittling away of the wreckage was not good enough they would have to use explosives cutting the fallen derrick at the center so that the lower unsupported portion would drop back to the sea bed and its weight would no longer pin down the sub it had been the obvious thing to do even from the beginning but there were two objections one was the risk of using explosives so near the subs already weakened hull the other was the problem of placing the charges in the correct spot of the derricks four main girders the two upper ones were easily accessible but the lower pair could not be reached by the remote handling mechanisms of the scoutsubs it was the sort of job that only an unencumbered diver could do and in shallow water it would not have taken more than a few minutes unfortunately this was not shallow water they were eleven hundred feet downand at a pressure of over thirty atmospheres twentyfour its too great a risk franklin i wont allow it it was not often thought franklin that one had a chance of arguing with a senator and if necessary he would not merely argue he would defy i know theres a danger sir he admitted but theres no alternative its a calculated riskone life against twentythree but i thought it was suicide for an unprotected man to dive below a few hundred feet it is if hes breathing compressed air the nitrogen knocks him out first and then oxygen poisoning gets him but with the right mixture its quite possible with the gear im using men have been down fifteen hundred feet i dont want to contradict you mr franklin said captain jacobsen quietly but i believe that only one man has reached fifteen hundredand then under carefully controlled conditions and he wasnt attempting to do any work nor am i i just have to place those two charges but the pressure pressure never makes any difference senator as long as its balanced there may be a hundred tons squeezing on my lungsbut ill have a hundred tons inside and wont feel it forgive me mentioning thisbut wouldnt it be better to send a younger man i wont delegate this job and age makes no difference to diving ability im in good health and thats all that matters franklin turned to his pilot and cut the microphone switch take her up he said theyll argue all day if we stay here i want to get into that rig before i change my mind he was wrestling with his thoughts all the way to the surface was he being a fool taking risks which a man in his position with a wife and family ought never to face or was he still after all these years trying to prove that he was no coward by deliberately meeting a danger from which he had once been rescued by a miracle presently he was aware of other and perhaps less flattering motives in a sense he was trying to escape from responsibility whether his mission failed or succeeded he would be a heroand as such it would not be quite so easy for the secretariat to push him around it was an interesting problem could one make up for lack of moral courage by proving physical bravery when the sub broke surface he had not so much resolved these questions as dismissed them there might be truth in every one of the charges he was making against himself it did not matter he knew in his heart that what he was doing was the right thing the only thing there was no other way in which the men almost a quarter of a mile below him could be saved and against that fact all other considerations were meaningless the escaping oil from the well had made the sea so flat that the pilot of the cargo plane had made a landing though his machine was not intended for amphibious operations one of the scoutsubs was floating on the surface while her crew wrestled with the next batch of buoyancy tanks to be sunk men from the plane were helping them working in collapsible boats that had been tossed into the water and automatically inflated commander henson the marine divisions master diver was waiting in the plane with the equipment there was another brief argument before the commander capitulated with good grace and franklin thought a certain amount of relief if anyone else was to attempt this mission there was no doubt that henson with his unparalleled experience was the obvious choice franklin even hesitated for a moment wondering if by stubbornly insisting on going himself he might not be reducing the chances of success but he had been on the bottom and knew exactly what conditions were down there it would waste precious time if henson went down in the sub to make a reconnaissance franklin swallowed his ph pills took his injections and climbed into the flexible rubber suit which would protect him from the nearzero temperature on the sea bed he hated suits they interfered with movement and upset ones buoyancy but this was a case where he had no choice the complex breathing unit with its three cylindersone the ominous red of compressed hydrogenwas strapped to his back and he was lowered into the sea commander henson swam around him for five minutes while all the fittings were checked the weight belt was adjusted and the sonar transmitter tested he was breathing easily enough on normal air and would not switch over to the oxyhydrogen mixture until he had reached a depth of three hundred feet the changeover was automatic and the demand regulator also adjusted the oxygen flow so that the mixture ratio was correct at any depth as correct as it could be that is for a region in which man was never intended to live at last everything was ready the explosive charges were securely attached to his belt and he gripped the handrail around the tiny conning tower of the sub take her down he said to the pilot fifty feet a minute and keep your forward speed below two knots fifty feet a minute it is if we pick up speed ill kill it with the reverse jets almost at once daylight faded to a gloomy and depressing green the water here on the surface was almost opaque owing to the debris thrown up by the oil well franklin could not even see the width of the conning tower less than two feet from his eyes the metal rail blurred and faded into nothingness he was not worried if necessary he could work by touch alone but he knew that the water was much clearer on the bottom only thirty feet down he had to stop the descent for almost a minute while he cleared his ears he blew and swallowed frantically before the comforting click inside his head told him that all was well how humiliating it would have been he thought had he been forced back to the surface because of a blocked eustachian tube no one would have blamed him of course even a mild cold could completely incapacitate the best diverbut the anticlimax would have been hard to live down the light was fading swiftly as the suns rays lost their battle with the turbid water a hundred feet down he seemed to be in a world of misty moonlight a world completely lacking color or warmth his ears were giving him no trouble now and he was breathing without effort but he felt a subtle depression creeping over him it was he was sure only an effect of the failing lightnot a premonition of the thousand feet of descent that still lay ahead of him to occupy his mind he called the pilot and asked for a progress report fifty drums had now been attached to the derrick giving a total lift of well over a hundred tons six of the passengers in the trapped sub had become unconscious but appeared to be in no danger the remaining seventeen were uncomfortable but had adapted themselves to the increased pressure the leak was getting no worse but there were now three inches of water in the control room and before long there would be danger of short circuits three hundred feet down said commander hensons voice check your hydrogenflow meteryou should be starting the switchover now franklin glanced down at the compact little instrument panel yes the automatic changeover was taking place he could detect no difference in the air he was breathing but in the next few hundred feet of descent most of the dangerous nitrogen would be flushed out it seemed strange to replace it with hydrogen a far more reactiveand even explosive gas but hydrogen produced no narcotic effects and was not trapped in the body tissues as readily as nitrogen it seemed to have grown no darker in the last hundred feet his eyes had accustomed themselves to the low level of illumination and the water was slightly clearer he could now see for two or three yards along the smooth hull he was riding down into the depths where only a handful of unprotected men had ever venturedand fewer still returned to tell the story commander henson called him again you should be on fifty per cent hydrogen now can you taste it yesa metallic sort of flavor not unpleasant though talk as slowly as you can said the commander its hard to understand youyour voice sounds so highpitched now are you feeling quite ok yes replied franklin glancing at his depth gauge will you increase my rate of descent to a hundred feet a minute weve no time to waste at once he felt the vessel sinking more swiftly beneath him as the ballast tanks were flooded and for the first time he began to feel the pressure around him as something palpable he was going down so quickly that there was a slight lag as the insulating layer of air in his suit adjusted to the pressure change his arms and legs seemed to be gripped as if by a huge and gentle vice which slowed his movements without actually restricting them the light had now nearly gone and as if in anticipation of his order the pilot of the sub switched on his twin searchlights there was nothing for them to illumine here in this empty void midway between sea bed and sky but it was reassuring to see the double nimbus of scattered radiance floating in the water ahead of him the violet filters had been removed for his benefit and now that his eyes had something distant to focus upon he no longer felt so oppressively shut in and confined eight hundred feet downmore than three quarters of the way to the bottom better level off here for three minutes advised commander henson id like to keep you here for half an hour but well have to make it up on the way back franklin submitted to the delay with what grace he could it seemed incredibly long perhaps his time sense had been distorted so that what was really a minute appeared like ten he was going to ask commander henson if his watch had stopped when he suddenly remembered that he had a perfectly good one of his own the fact that he had forgotten something so obvious was he realized rather a bad sign it suggested that he was becoming stupid however if he was intelligent enough to know that he was becoming stupid things could not be too bad luckily the descent started again before he could get too involved in this line of argument and now he could hear growing louder and louder each minute the incessant roar of the great geyser of gas belching from the shaft which inquisitive and interfering man had drilled in the ocean bed it shook the sea around him already making it hard to hear the advice and comments of his helpers there was a danger here as great as that of pressure itself if the gas jet caught him he might be tossed hundreds of feet upward in a matter of seconds and would explode like a deepsea fish dragged suddenly to the surface were nearly there said the pilot after they had been sinking for what seemed an age you should be able to see the derrick in a minute ill switch on the lower lights franklin swung himself over the edge of the now slowly moving sub and peered down the misty columns of light at first he could see nothing then at an indeterminate distance he made out mysterious rectangles and circles they baffled him for a moment before he realized that he was seeing the airfilled drums which were now straining to lift the shattered derrick almost at once he was able to make out the framework of twisted girders below them and presently a brilliant starfantastically out of place in this dreary underworldburst into life just outside the cone of his searchlights he was watching one of the cutting torches at work manipulated by the mechanical hands of a sub just beyond visual range with great care his own vessel positioned him beside the derrick and for the first time he realized how hopeless his task would have been had he been compelled to rely on touch to find his way around he could see the two girders to which he had to attach his charge they were hemmed in by a maze of smaller rods beams and cables through which he must somehow make his way franklin released his hold of the sub which had towed him so effortlessly into the depths and with slow easy strokes swam toward the derrick as he approached he saw for the first time the looming mass of the trapped sub and his heart sank as he thought of all the problems that must still be solved before it could be extricated on a sudden impulse he swam toward the helpless vessel and banged sharply on the hull with the pair of wire cutters from his little tool kit the men inside knew that he was here of course but the signal would have an altogether disproportionate effect on their morale then he started work trying to ignore the throbbing vibration which filled all the water around him and made it difficult to think he began a careful survey of the metal maze into which he must swim it would not be difficult to reach the nearest girder and place the charge there was an open space between three i beams blocked only by a loop of cable which could be easily pushed out of the way then the girder would be dead ahead of him what was more there was room to turn around so that he could avoid the unpleasant necessity of creeping out backward he checked again and could see no snags to make doubly sure he talked it over with commander henson who could see the situation almost as well on the tv screen of the sub then he swam slowly into the derrick working his way along the metal framework with his gloved hands he was quite surprised to find that even at this depth there was no shortage of the barnacles and other marine growths which always make it dangerous to touch any object which had been underwater for more than a few months the steel structure was vibrating like a giant tuning fork he could feel the roaring power of the uncapped well both through the sea surrounding him and through the metal beneath his hands he seemed to be imprisoned in an enormous throbbing cage the sheer noise as well as the awful pressure was beginning to make him dull and lethargic it now needed a positive effort of will to take any action he had to keep reminding himself that many lives besides his own depended upon what he was doing he reached the girder and slowly taped the flat package against the metal it took a long time to do it to his satisfaction but at last the explosive was in place and he felt sure that the vibration would not dislodge it then he looked around for his second objectivethe girder forming the other edge of the derrick he had stirred up a good deal of dirt and could no longer see so clearly but it seemed to franklin that there was nothing to stop him crossing the interior of the derrick and completing the job the alternative was to go back the way he had come and then swim right around to the other side of the wreckage in normal circumstances that would have been easy enoughbut now every movement had to be considered with care every expenditure of effort made grudgingly only after its need had been established beyond all doubt with infinite caution he began to move through the throbbing mist the glare of the searchlights pouring down upon him was so dazzling that it pained his eyes it never occurred to him that he had only to speak into his microphone and the illumination would be reduced instantly to whatever level he wished instead he tried to keep in whatever shadow he could find among the confused pile of wreckage through which he was moving he reached the girder and crouched over it for a long time while he tried to remember what he was supposed to be doing here it took commander hensons voice shouting in his ears like some faroff echo to call him back to reality very carefully and slowly he taped the precious slab into position then he floated beside it admiring his meaningless handiwork while the annoying voice in his ear grew ever more insistent he could stop it he realized by throwing away his face mask and the irritating little speaker it contained for a moment he toyed with this idea but discovered that he was not strong enough to undo the straps holding the mask in place it was too bad perhaps the voice would shut up if he did what it told him to unfortunately he had no idea which was the right way out of the maze in which he was now comfortably ensconced the light and noise were very confusing when he moved in any direction he sooner or later banged into something and had to turn back this annoyed but did not alarm him for he was quite happy where he was but the voice would not give him any peace it was no longer at all friendly and helpful he dimly realized that it was being downright rude and was ordering him about in a manner in whichthough he could not remember why people did not usually speak to him he was being given careful and detailed instructions which were repeated over and over again with increasing emphasis until he sluggishly obeyed them he was too tired to answer back but he wept a little at the indignity to which he was being subjected he had never been called such things in his life and it was very seldom indeed that he had heard such shocking language as was now coming through his speaker who on earth would yell at him this way not that way you goddammed fool sir to the leftleft thats finenow forward a bit more dont stop there christ hes gone to sleep again wake upsnap out of it or ill knock your bloody block off thats a good boyyoure nearly therejust another couple of feet and so on endlessly and some of it with very much worse language than that then quite to his surprise there was no longer twisted metal around him he was swimming slowly in the open but he was not swimming for long metal fingers closed upon him none too gently and he was lifted into the roaring night from far away he heard four short muffled explosions and something deep down in his mind told him that for two of these he was responsible but he saw nothing of the swift drama a hundred feet below as the radio fuses detonated and the great derrick snapped in two the section lying across the trapped submarine was still too heavy to be lifted clear by the buoyancy tanks but now that it was free to move it teetered for a moment like a giant seesaw then slipped aside and crashed onto the sea bed the big sub all restraint removed began to move upward with increasing speed franklin felt the wash of its close passage but was too bemused to realize what it meant he was still struggling back into hazy consciousness around eight hundred feet quite abruptly he started to react to hensons bullying ministrations and to the commanders vast relief began to answer him back in kind he cursed wildly for about a hundred feet then became fully aware of his surroundings and ground to an embarrassed halt only then did he realize that his mission had been successful and that the men he had set out to rescue were already far above him on their way back to the surface franklin could make no such speed a decompression chamber was waiting for him at the threehundredfoot level and in its cramped confines he was to fly back to brisbane and spend eighteen tedious hours before all the absorbed gas had escaped from his body and by the time the doctors let him out of their clutches it was far too late to suppress the tape recording that had circulated throughout the entire bureau he was a hero to the whole world but if he ever grew conceited he need only remind himself that all his staff had listened gleefully to every word of commander hensons fluently profane cajoling of their director twentyfive peter never looked back as he walked up the gangplank into the projectile from which in little more than half an hour he would have his first view of the receding earth franklin could understand why his son kept his head averted young men of eighteen do not cry in public nor for that matter he told himself fiercely do middleaged directors of important bureaus anne had no such inhibitions she was weeping steadily despite all that indra could do to comfort her not until the doors of the spaceship had finally sealed and the thirtyminute warning siren had drowned all other noises did she subside into an intermittent sniffling the tide of spectators of friends and relatives of cameramen and space department officials began to retreat before the moving barriers clasping hands with his wife and daughter franklin let himself be swept along with the flood of humanity what hopes and fears sorrows and joys surrounded him now he tried to remember his emotions at his first takeoff it must have been one of the great moments of his lifeyet all recollection of it had gone obliterated by thirty years of later experience and now peter was setting out on the road his father had traveled half a lifetime before may you have better luck among the stars than i did franklin prayed he wished he could be there at port lowell when irene greeted the boy who might have been her son and wondered how roy and rupert would receive their halfbrother he was sure that they would be glad to meet him peter would not be as lonely on mars as ensign walter franklin had once been they waited in silence while the long minutes wore away by this time peter would be so interested in the strange and exciting world that was to be his home for the next week that he would already have forgotten the pain of parting he could not be blamed if his eyes were fixed on the new life which lay before him in all its unknown promise and what of his own life franklin asked himself now that he had launched his son into the future could he say that he had been a success it was a question he found very hard to answer honestly so many things that he had attempted had ended in failure or even in disaster he knew now that he was unlikely to rise any farther in the service of the state he might be a hero but he had upset too many people when he became the surprised and somewhat reluctant ally of the maha thero certainly he had no hope of promotionnor did he desire itduring the five or ten years which would be needed to complete the reorganization of the bureau of whales he had been told in as many words that since he was partly responsible for the situation the mess it was generally calledhe could sort it out himself one thing he would never know if fate had not brought him public admiration and the even more valuablebecause less ficklefriendship of senator chamberlain would he have had the courage of his newfound convictions it had been easy as the latest hero that the world had taken to its heart but would forget tomorrow to stand up in the witness box and state his beliefs his superiors could fume and fret but there was nothing they could do but accept his defection with the best grace they could muster there were times when he almost wished that the accident of fame had not come to his rescue and had his evidence after all been decisive he suspected that it had the result of the referendum had been close and the maha thero might not have carried the day without his help the three sharp blasts of the siren broke into his reverie in that aweinspiring silence which still seemed so uncanny to those who remembered the age of rockets the great ship sloughed away its hundred thousand tons of weight and began the climb back to its natural element half a mile above the plain its own gravity field took over completely so that it was no longer concerned with terrestrial ideas of up or down it lifted its prow toward the zenith and hung poised for a moment like a metal obelisk miraculously supported among the clouds then in that same awful silence it blurred itself into a lineand the sky was empty the tension broke there was a few stifled sobs but many more laughs and jokes perhaps a little too highpitched to be altogether convincing franklin put his arms around anne and indra and began to shepherd them toward the exit to his son he willingly bequeathed the shoreless seas of space for himself the oceans of this world were sufficient therein dwelt all his subjects from the moving mountain of leviathan to the newborn dolphin that had not yet learned to suckle under water he would guard them to the best of his knowledge and ability already he could see clearly the future role of the bureau when its wardens would be in truth the protectors of all the creatures moving in the sea all nothat of course was absurd nothing could change or even greatly alleviate the incessant cruelty and slaughter that raged through all the oceans of the world but with the great mammals who were his kindred man could make a start imposing his truce upon the battlefield of nature what might come of that in the ages ahead no one could guess even lundquists daring and still unproved plan for taming the killer whales might no more than hint of what the next few decades would bring they might even bring the answer to the mystery which haunted him still and which he had so nearly solved when that submarine earthquake robbed him of his best friend a chapterperhaps the best chapterof his life was closing the future would have many problems but he did not believe that ever again would he have to face such challenges as he had met in the past in a sense his work was done even though the details were merely beginning he looked once more at the empty sky and the words that the mahanayake thero had spoken to him as they flew back from the greenland station rose up out of memory like a ground swell on the sea he would never forget that chilling thought when that time comes the treatment man receives from his superiors may well depend upon the way he has behaved toward the other creatures of his own world perhaps he was a fool to let such phantasms of a remote and unknowable future have any influence upon his thoughts and acts but he had no regrets for what he had done as he stared into the blue infinity that had swallowed his son the stars seemed suddenly very close give us another hundred years he whispered and well face you with clean hands and heartswhatever shape you be come along dear said indra her voice still a little unsteady you havent much time the office asked me to remind youthe committee on interdepartmental standardization meets in half an hour i know said franklin blowing his nose firmly and finally i wouldnt dream of keeping it waiting
