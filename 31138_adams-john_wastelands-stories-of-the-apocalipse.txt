wastelands stories of the apocalypse edited by john joseph adams introduction by john joseph adams famine death war pestilence these are said to be the harbingers of the biblical apocalypse armageddon the end of the world in science fiction the end of the world is usually triggered by more specific means nuclear warfare biological disaster or warfare ecologicalgeological disaster or cosmological disaster but in the wake of any great cataclysm there are survivors and postapocalyptic science fiction speculates what life would be like for them the first significant postapocalyptic work is the last man by the mother of science fiction frankenstein author mary shelley so the subgenre is in essence as old as science fiction itself although its origins are firmly rooted in science fiction postapocalyptic fiction has always been able to escape traditional genre boundaries several classic novels of the genre such as alas babylon by pat frank on the beach by nevil shute and earth abides by george r stewart were published as mainstream novels that trend is seeing a resurgence with authors like cormac mccarthy venturing into postapocalyptic territory with his bleak new novel the roadwhich was not only a bestselling book and an oprah book club pick but a winner of the pulitzer prize as well but sf has produced its share of novellength classics as well including the undisputed king of the subgenre walter millers a canticle for leibowitz not to mention leigh bracketts the long tomorrow john christophers no blade of grass or wilson tuckers criminally underappreciated the long loud silence i could go on and on and i do in the for further reading appendix youll find at the end of this book postapocalyptic sf first rose to prominence in the aftermath world war ii no doubt due in large part to the world having witnessed the devastating destructive power of the atomic bomb and reached the height of its popularity during cold war when the threat of worldwide nuclear annihilation seemed a very real possibility but when the berlin wall fell so did the popularity of postapocalyptic fiction if you examine the copyright page of this anthology youll note that just two of the stories in this volume were written in the s on the other hand more than half of these stories were originally published since the turn of the millennium so why the resurgence is it because the political climate now is reminiscent of the climate during the cold war during times of war and global unease is it that much easier to imagine a depopulated world a world destroyed by humanitys own hand is that all there is to it or is there something more what is it that draws us to those bleak landscapesthe wastelands of postapocalyptic literature to me the appeal is obvious it fulfills our taste for adventure the thrill of discovery the desire for a new frontier it also allows us to start over from scratch to wipe the slate clean and see what the world may have been like if we had known then what we know now perhaps the appeal of the subgenre is best described by this quote from the manhattan phone book abridged by john varley we all love afterthebomb stories if we didnt why would there be so many of them theres something attractive about all those people being gone about wandering in a depopulated world scrounging cans of campbells pork and beans defending ones family from marauders sure its horrible sure we weep for all those dead people but some secret part of us thinks it would be good to survive to start over secretly we know well survive all those other folks will die thats what afterthebomb stories are all about or is that just the beginning of the conversation read the stories and you decide the stories in this volume go beyond the wandering scrounging and defending that varley describes above what you will find here are tales of survival and of life in the aftermath that explore what scientific psychological sociological and physiological changes will take place in the wake of the apocalypse what you will not find here are tales depicting the aftermath of aliens conquering the earth or the terror induced by a zombie uprising both scenarios are suitably apocalyptic but are subjects for another time or other anthologies as it were in the stories that follow you will find different science fictional apocalyptic scenarios some of them are farfetched and unlikely while others are plausible and alltooeasy to imagine some of the stories flirt with the fantastic many venture into horrific territory all of them explore one question what would life be like after the end of the world as we know it the end of the whole mess by stephen king stephen king needs no introduction he is the awardwinning bestselling author of novels such as carrie and the postapocalyptic masterpiece the stand although he is most wellknown for his novels and the movies theyve inspired he is a prolific author of short fiction as well having written enough of it to warrant several collections including everythings eventual night shift skeleton crew and nightmares dreamscapes the end of the whole mess appeared in the latter volume but was originally published in omni magazine in it was nominated for the world fantasy award and was recently adapted into a onehour movie as part of a tnt nightmares dreamscapes miniseries there are several factors that go into deciding which story to lead off an anthology with you might pick a story thats by a highprofile contributor one thats uncommonly good and packs a strong emotional punch or one that will set the tone for the rest of the book this story is all three i want to tell you about the end of war the degeneration of mankind and the death of the messiahan epic story deserving thousands of pages and a whole shelf of volumes but you if there are any you later on to read this will have to settle for the freezedried version the direct injection works very fast i figure ive got somewhere between fortyfive minutes and two hours depending on my bloodtype i think its a which should give me a little more time but ill be goddamned if i can remember for sure if it turns out to be o you could be in for a lot of blank pages my hypothetical friend in any event i think maybe id better assume the worst and go as fast as i can im using the electric typewriterbobbys wordprocessor is faster but the gennys cycle is too irregular to be trusted even with the line suppressor ive only got one shot at this i cant risk getting most of the way home and then seeing the whole thing go to data heaven because of an ohm drop or a surge too great for the suppressor to cope with my name is howard fornoy i was a freelance writer my brother robert fornoy was the messiah i killed him by shooting him up with his own discovery four hours ago he called it the calmative a very serious mistake might have been a better name but whats done is done and cant be undone as the irish have been saying for centuries which proves what assholes they are shit i cant afford these digressions after bobby died i covered him with a quilt and sat at the cabins single living room window for some three hours looking out at the woods used to be you could see the orange glow of the hiintensity arcsodiums from north conway but no more now theres just the white mountains looking like dark triangles of crepe paper cut out by a child and the pointless stars i turned on the radio dialled through four bands found one crazy guy and shut it off i sat there thinking of ways to tell this story my mind kept sliding away toward all those miles of dark pinewoods all that nothing finally i realized i needed to get myself off the dime and shoot myself up shit i never could work without a deadline and ive suretogod got one now our parents had no reason to expect anything other than what they got bright children dad was a history major who had become a full professor at hofstra when he was thirty ten years later he was one of six viceadministrators of the national archives in washington dc and in line for the top spot he was a helluva good guy toohad every record chuck berry ever cut and played a pretty mean blues guitar himself my dad filed by day and rocked by night mom graduated magna cum laude from drew got a phi beta kappa key she sometimes wore on this funky fedora she had she became a successful cpa in dc met my dad married him and took in her shingle when she became pregnant with yours truly i came along in by she was doing taxes for some of my dads associatesshe called this her little hobby by the time bobby was born in she was handling taxes investment portfolios and estateplanning for a dozen powerful men i could name them but who gives a wad theyre either dead or drivelling idiots by now i think she probably made more out of her little hobby each year than my dad made at his job but that never matteredthey were happy with what they were to themselves and to each other i saw them squabble lots of times but i never saw them fight when i was growing up the only difference i saw between my mom and my playmates moms was that their moms used to read or iron or sew or talk on the phone while the soaps played on the tube and my mom used to run a pocket calculator and write down numbers on big green sheets of paper while the soaps played on the tube i was no disappointment to a couple of people with mensa gold cards in their wallets i maintained as and bs through my publicschool career the idea that either i or my brother might go to a private school was never even discussed so far as i know i also wrote well early with no effort at all i sold my first magazine piece when i was twentyit was on how the continental army wintered at valley forge i sold it to an airline magazine for four hundred fifty dollars my dad whom i loved deeply asked me if he could buy that check from me he gave me his own personal check and had the check from the airline magazine framed and hung it over his desk a romantic genius if you will a romantic blues playing genius if you will take it from me a kid could do a lot worse of course he and my mother both died raving and pissing in their pants late last year like almost everyone else on this big round world of ours but i never stopped loving either of them i was the sort of child they had every reason to expecta good boy with a bright mind a talented boy whose talent grew to early maturity in an atmosphere of love and confidence a faithful boy who loved and respected his mom and dad bobby was different nobody not even mensa types like our folks ever expects a kid like bobby not ever i pottytrained two full years earlier than bob and that was the only thing in which i ever beat him but i never felt jealous of him that would have been like a fairly good american legion league pitcher feeling jealous of nolan ryan or roger clemens after a certain point the comparisons that cause feelings of jealousy simply cease to exist ive been there and i can tell you after a certain point you just stand back and shield your eyes from the flash burns bobby read at two and began writing short essays our dog a trip to boston with mother at three his printing was the straggling struggling galvanic constructions of a sixyearold and that was startling enough in itself but there was more if transcribed so that his stilldeveloping motor control no longer became an evaluative factor you would have thought you were reading the work of a bright if extremely naive fifthgrader he progressed from simple sentences to compound sentences to complex ones with dizzying rapidity grasping clauses subclauses and modifying clauses with an intuitiveness that was eerie sometimes his syntax was garbled and his modifiers misplaced but he had such flawswhich plague most writers all their lives pretty well under control by the age of five he developed headaches my parents were afraid he had some sort of physical problema braintumour perhapsand took him to a doctor who examined him carefully listened to him even more carefully and then told my parents there was nothing wrong with bobby except stress he was in a state of extreme frustration because his writinghand would not work as well as his brain you got a kid trying to pass a mental kidney stone the doctor said i could prescribe something for his headaches but i think the drug he really needs is a typewriter so mom and dad gave bobby an ibm a year later they gave him a commodore with wordstar for christmas and bobbys headaches stopped before going on to other matters i only want to add that he believed for the next three years or so that it was santa claus who had left that wordcruncher under our tree now that i think of it that was another place where i beat bobby i santatrained earlier too theres so much i could tell you about those early days and i suppose ill have to tell you a little but ill have to go fast and make it brief the deadline ah the deadline i once read a very funny piece called the essential gone with the wind that went something like this a war laughed scarlett oh fiddlededee boom ashley went to war atlanta burned rhett walked in and then walked out fiddlededee said scarlett through her tears i will think about it tomorrow for tomorrow is another day i laughed heartily over that when i read it now that im faced with doing something similar it doesnt seem quite so funny but here goes a child with an iq immeasurable by any existing test smiled india fornoy to her devoted husband richard fiddlededee well provide an atmosphere where his intellectnot to mention that of his notexactlystupid older brothercan grow and well raise them as the normal allamerican boys they by gosh are boom the fornoy boys grew up howard went to the university of virginia graduated cum laude and settled down to a freelance writing career made a comfortable living stepped out with a lot of women and went to bed with quite a few of them managed to avoid social diseases both sexual and pharmacological bought a mitsubishi stereo system wrote home at least once a week published two novels that did pretty well fiddlededee said howard this is the life for me and so it was at least until the day bobby showed up unexpectedly in the best madscientist tradition with his two glass boxes a bees nest in one and a wasps nest in the other bobby wearing a mumford phys ed teeshirt insideout on the verge of destroying human intellect and just as happy as a clam at high tide guys like my brother bobby come along only once every two or three generations i thinkguys like leonardo da vinci newton einstein maybe edison they all seem to have one thing in common they are like huge compasses which swing aimlessly for a long time searching for some true north and then homing on it with fearful force before that happens such guys are apt to get up to some weird shit and bobby was no exception when he was eight and i was fifteen he came to me and said he had invented an airplane by then i knew bobby too well to just say bullshit and kick him out of my room i went out to the garage where there was this weird plywood contraption sitting on his american flyer red wagon it looked a little like a fighter plane but the wings were raked forward instead of back he had mounted the saddle from his rocking horse on the middle of it with bolts there was a lever on the side there was no motor he said it was a glider he wanted me to push him down carrigans hill which was the steepest grade in dcs grant parkthere was a cement path down the middle of it for old folks that bobby said would be his runway bobby i said you got this puppys wings on backward no he said this is the way theyre supposed to be i saw something on wild kingdom about hawks they dive down on their prey and then reverse their wings coming up theyre doublejointed see you get better lift this way then why isnt the air force building them this way i asked blissfully unaware that both the american and the russian air forces had plans for such forwardwing fighter planes on their drawing boards bobby just shrugged he didnt know and didnt care we went over to carrigans hill and he climbed into the rockinghorse saddle and gripped the lever push me hard he said his eyes were dancing with that crazed light i knew so wellchrist his eyes used to light up that way in his cradle sometimes but i swear to god i never would have pushed him down the cement path as hard as i did if i thought the thing would actually work but i didnt know and i gave him one hell of a shove he went freewheeling down the hill whooping like a cowboy just off a traildrive and headed into town for a few cold beers an old lady had to jump out of his way and he just missed an old geezer leaning over a walker halfway down he pulled the handle and i watched wideeyed and bullshit with fear and amazement as his splintery plywood plane separated from the wagon at first it only hovered inches above it and for a second it looked like it was going to settle back then there was a gust of wind and bobbys plane took off like someone had it on an invisible cable the american flyer wagon ran off the concrete path and into some bushes all of a sudden bobby was ten feet in the air then twenty then fifty he went gliding over grant park on a steepening upward plane whooping cheerily i went running after him screaming for him to come down visions of his body tumbling off that stupid rockinghorse saddle and impaling itself on a tree or one of the parks many statues standing out with hideous clarity in my head i did not just imagine my brothers funeral i tell you i attended it bobby i shrieked come down wheeeeeeee bobby screamed back his voice faint but clearly ecstatic startled chessplayers frisbeethrowers bookreaders lovers and joggers stopped whatever they were doing to watch bobby theres no seatbelt on that fucking thing i screamed it was the first time i ever used that particular word so far as i can remember iyyyyll beeee all riyyyyht he was screaming at the top of his lungs but i was appalled to realize i could barely hear him i went running down carrigans hill shrieking all the way i dont have the slightest memory of just what i was yelling but the next day i could not speak above a whisper i do remember passing a young fellow in a neat threepiece suit standing by the statue of eleanor roosevelt at the foot of the hill he looked at me and said conversationally tell you what my friend im having one hell of an acid flashback i remember that odd misshapen shadow gliding across the green floor of the park rising and rippling as it crossed park benches litter baskets and the upturned faces of the watching people i remember chasing it i remember how my mothers face crumpled and how she started to cry when i told her that bobbys plane which had no business flying in the first place turned upside down in a sudden eddy of wind and bobby finished his short but brilliant career splattered all over d street the way things turned out it might have been better for everyone if things had actually turned out that way but they didnt instead bobby banked back toward carrigans hill holding nonchalantly onto the tail of his own plane to keep from falling off the damned thing and brought it down toward the little pond at the centre of grant park he went airsliding five feet over it then four and then he was skiing his sneakers along the surface of the water sending back twin white wakes scaring the usually complacent and overfed ducks up in honking indignant flurries before him laughing his cheerful laugh he came down on the far side exactly between two park benches that snapped off the wings of his plane he flew out of the saddle thumped his head and started to bawl that was life with bobby not everything was that spectacularin fact i dont think anything was at least until the calmative but i told you the story because i think this time at least the extreme case best illustrates the norm life with bobby was a constant mindfuck by the age of nine he was attending quantum physics and advanced algebra classes at georgetown university there was the day he blanked out every radio and tv on our streetand the surrounding four blockswith his own voice he had found an old portable tv in the attic and turned it into a wideband radio broadcasting station one old blackandwhite zenith twelve feet of hifi flex a coat hanger mounted on the roof peak of our house and presto for about two hours four blocks of georgetown could receive only wbobwhich happened to be my brother reading some of my short stories telling moron jokes and explaining that the high sulphur content in baked beans was the reason our dad farted so much in church every sunday morning but he gets most of em off pretty quiet bobby told his listening audience of roughly three thousand or sometimes he holds the real bangers until its time for the hymns my dad who was less than happy about all this ended up paying a seventyfivedollar fcc fine and taking it out of bobbys allowance for the next year life with bobby oh yeahand look here im crying is it honest sentiment i wonder or the onset the former i thinkchrist knows how much i loved himbut i think i better try to hurry up a little just the same bobby had graduated high school for all practical purposes by the age of ten but he never got a ba or bs let alone any advanced degree it was that big powerful compass in his head swinging around and around looking for some true north to point at he went through a physics period and a shorter period when he was nutty for chemistry but in the end bobby was too impatient with mathematics for either of those fields to hold him he could do it but itand ultimately all socalled hard science bored him by the time he was fifteen it was archaeologyhe combed the white mountain foothills around our summer place in north conway building a history of the indians who had lived there from arrowheads flints even the charcoal patterns of longdead campfires in the mesolithic caves in the midnew hampshire regions but that passed too and he began to read history and anthropology when he was sixteen my father and my mother gave their reluctant approval when bobby requested that he be allowed to accompany a party of new england anthropologists on an expedition to south america he came back five months later with the first real tan of his life he was also an inch taller fifteen pounds lighter and much quieter he was still cheerful enough or could be but his littleboy exuberance sometimes infectious sometimes wearisome but always there was gone he had grown up and for the first time i remember him talking about the news how bad it was i mean that was the year a plo splinter group called the sons of the jihad a name that always sounded to me hideously like a catholic community service group somewhere in western pennsylvania set off a squirt bomb in london polluting sixty per cent of it and making the rest of it extremely unhealthy for people who ever planned to have children or to live past the age of fifty for that matter the year we tried to blockade the philippines after the cedeno administration accepted a small group of red chinese advisors fifteen thousand or so according to our spy satellites and only backed down when it became clear that a the chinese werent kidding about emptying the holes if we didnt pull back and b the american people werent all that crazy about committing mass suicide over the philippine islands that was also the year some other group of crazy motherfuckersalbanians i thinktried to airspray the aids virus over berlin this sort of stuff depressed everybody but it depressed the shit out of bobby why are people so goddam mean he asked me one day we were at the summer place in new hampshire it was late august and most of our stuff was already in boxes and suitcases the cabin had that sad deserted look it always got just before we all went our separate ways for me it meant back to new york and for bobby it meant waco texas of all placeshe had spent the summer reading sociology and geology textshows that for a crazy saladand said he wanted to run a couple of experiments down there he said it in a casual offhand way but i had seen my mother looking at him with a peculiar thoughtful scrutiny in the last couple of weeks we were all together neither dad nor i suspected but i think my mom knew that bobbys compass needle had finally stopped swinging and had started pointing why are they so mean i asked im supposed to answer that someone better he said pretty soon too the way things are going theyre going the way they always went i said and i guess theyre doing it because people were built to be mean if you want to lay blame blame god thats bullshit i dont believe it even that doublexchromosome stuff turned out to be bullshit in the end and dont tell me its just economic pressures the conflict between the haves and havenots because that doesnt explain all of it either original sin i said it works for meits got a good beat and you can dance to it well bobby said maybe it is original sin but whats the instrument big brother have you ever asked yourself that instrument what instrument im not following you i think its the water bobby said moodily say what the water something in the water he looked at me or something that isnt the next day bobby went off to waco i didnt see him again until he showed up at my apartment wearing the insideout mumford shirt and carrying the two glass boxes that was three years later howdy howie he said stepping in and giving me a nonchalant swat on the back as if it had been only three days bobby i yelled and threw both arms around him in a bearhug hard angles bit into my chest and i heard an angry hivehum im glad to see you too bobby said but you better go easy youre upsetting the natives i stepped back in a hurry bobby set down the big paper bag he was carrying and unslung his shoulderbag then he carefully brought the glass boxes out of the bag there was a beehive in one a wasps nest in the other the bees were already settling down and going back to whatever business bees have but the wasps were clearly unhappy about the whole thing okay bobby i said i looked at him and grinned i couldnt seem to stop grinning what are you up to this time he unzipped the totebag and brought out a mayonnaise jar which was halffilled with a clear liquid see this he said yeah looks like either water or white lightning its actually both if you can believe that it came from an artesian well in la plata a little town forty miles east of waco and before i turned it into this concentrated form there were five gallons of it ive got a regular little distillery running down there howie but i dont think the government will ever bust me for it he was grinning and now the grin broadened waters all it is but its still the goddamndist popskull the human race has ever seen i dont have the slightest idea what youre talking about i know you dont but you will you know what howie what if the idiotic human race can manage to hold itself together for another six months im betting itll hold itself together for all time he lifted the mayonnaise jar and one magnified bobbyeye stared at me through it with huge solemnity this is the big one he said the cure for the worst disease to which homo sapiens falls prey cancer nope bobby said war barroom brawls driveby shootings the whole mess wheres your bathroom howie my back teeth are floating when he came back he had not only turned the mumford teeshirt rightside out he had combed his hairnor had his method of doing this changed i saw bobby just held his head under the faucet for awhile then raked everything back with his fingers he looked at the two glass boxes and pronounced the bees and wasps back to normal not that a wasps nest ever approaches anything even closely resembling normal howie wasps are social insects like bees and ants but unlike bees which are almost always sane and ants which have occasional schizoid lapses wasps are total fullbore lunatics he smiled just like us good old homo saps he took the top off the glass box containing the beehive tell you what bobby i said i was smiling but the smile felt much too wide put the top back on and just tell me about it what do you say save the demonstration for later i mean my landlords a real pussycat but the supers this big bull dyke who smokes odie perode cigars and has thirty pounds on me she youll like this bobby said as if i hadnt spoken at alla habit as familiar to me as his ten fingers method of hair grooming he was never impolite but often totally absorbed and could i stop him aw shit no it was too good to have him back i mean i think i knew even then that something was going to go totally wrong but when i was with bobby for more than five minutes he just hypnotized me he was lucy holding the football and promising me this time for sure and i was charlie brown rushing down the field to kick it in fact youve probably seen it done beforethey show pictures of it in magazines from time to time or in tv wildlife documentaries its nothing very special but it looks like a big deal because people have got these totally irrational prejudices about bees and the weird thing was he was righti had seen it before he stuck his hand into the box between the hive and the glass in less than fifteen seconds his hand had acquired a living blackandyellow glove it brought back an instant of total recall sitting in front of the tv wearing footie pyjamas and clutching my paddington bear maybe half an hour before bedtime and surely years before bobby was born watching with mingled horror disgust and fascination as some beekeeper allowed bees to cover his entire face they had formed a sort of executioners hood at first and then he had brushed them into a grotesque living beard bobby winced suddenly sharply then grinned one of em stung me he said theyre still a little upset from the trip i hooked a ride with the local insurance lady from la plata to wacoshes got an old piper cuband flew some little commuter airline air asshole i think it was up to new orleans from there made about forty connections but i swear to god it was the cab ride from lagarbage that got em crazy second avenues still got more potholes than the bergenstrasse after the germans surrendered you know i think you really ought to get your hand out of there bobs i said i kept waiting for some of them to fly outi could imagine chasing them around with a rolledup magazine for hours bringing them down one by one as if they were escapees in some old prison movie but none of them had escaped at least so far relax howie you ever see a bee sting a flower or even hear of it for that matter you dont look like a flower he laughed shit you think bees know what a flower looks like unuh no way man they dont know what a flower looks like any more than you or i know what a cloud sounds like they know im sweet because i excrete sucrose dioxin in my sweat along with thirtyseven other dioxins and thosere just the ones we know about he paused thoughtfully although i must confess i was careful to uh sweeten myself up a little tonight ate a box of chocolatecovered cherries on the plane oh bobby jesus and had a couple of mallowcremes in the taxi coming here he reached in with his other hand and carefully began to brush the bees away i saw him wince once more just before he got the last of them off and then he eased my mind considerably by replacing the lid on the glass box i saw a red swelling on each of his hands one in the cup of the left palm another high up on the right near what the palmists call the bracelets of fortune hed been stung but i saw well enough what hed set out to show me what looked like at least four hundred bees had investigated him only two had stung he took a pair of tweezers out of his jeans watchpocket and went over to my desk he moved the pile of manuscript beside the wang micro i was using in those days and trained my tensor lamp on the place where the pages had beenfiddling with it until it formed a tiny hard spotlight on the cherry wood writin anything good bowwow he asked casually and i felt the hair stiffen on the back of my neck when was the last time hed called me bowwow when he was four six shit man i dont know he was working carefully on his left hand with the tweezers i saw him extract a tiny something that looked like a nostril hair and place it in my ashtray piece on art forgery for vanity fair i said bobby what in hell are you up to this time you want to pull the other one for me he asked offering me the tweezers his right hand and an apologetic smile i keep thinking if im so goddam smart i ought to be ambidextrous but my left hand has still got an iq of about six same old bobby i sat down beside him took the tweezers and pulled the bee stinger out of the red swelling near what in his case should have been the bracelets of doom and while i did it he told me about the differences between bees and wasps the difference between the water in la plata and the water in new york and how goddam everything was going to be all right with his water and a little help from me and oh shit i ended up running at the football while my laughing wildly intelligent brother held it one last time bees dont sting unless they have to because it kills them bobby said matteroffactly you remember that time in north conway when you said we kept killing each other because of original sin yes hold still well if there is such a thing if theres a god who could simultaneously love us enough to serve us his own son on a cross and send us all on a rocketsled to hell just because one stupid bitch bit a bad apple then the curse was just this he made us like wasps instead of bees shit howie what are you doing hold still i said and ill get it out if you want to make a lot of big gestures ill wait okay he said and after that he held relatively still while i extracted the stinger bees are natures kamikaze pilots bowwow look in that glass box youll see the two who stung me lying dead at the bottom their stingers are barbed like fishhooks they slide in easy when they pull out they disembowel themselves gross i said dropping the second stinger in the ashtray i couldnt see the barbs but i didnt have a microscope it makes them particular though he said i bet wasps on the other hand have smooth stingers they can shoot you up as many times as they like they use up the poison by the third or fourth shot but they can go right on making holes if they likeand usually they do especially wallwasps the kind ive got over there you gotta sedate em stuff called noxon it must give em a hell of a hangover because they wake up madder than ever he looked at me somberly and for the first time i saw the dark brown wheels of weariness under his eyes and realized my kid brother was more tired than i had ever seen him thats why people go on fighting bowwow on and on and on we got smooth stingers now watch this he got up went over to his totebag rummaged in it and came up with an eyedropper he opened the mayonnaise jar put the dropper in and drew up a tiny bubble of his distilled texas water when he took it over to the glass box with the wasps nest inside i saw the top on this one was differentthere was a tiny plastic slidepiece set into it i didnt need him to draw me a picture with the bees he was perfectly willing to remove the whole top with the wasps he was taking no chances he squeezed the black bulb two drops of water fell onto the nest making a momentary dark spot that disappeared almost at once give it about three minutes he said what no questions he said youll see three minutes in that period he read my piece on art forgeryalthough it was already twenty pages long okay he said putting the pages down thats pretty good man you ought to read up a little on how jay gould furnished the parlorcar of his private train with fake manets thoughthats a hoot he was removing the cover of the glass box containing the wasps nest as he spoke jesus bobby cut the comedy i yelled same old wimp bobby laughed and pulled the nest which was dull gray and about the size of a bowling ball out of the box he held it in his hands wasps flew out and lit on his arms his cheeks his forehead one flew across to me and landed on my forearm i slapped it and it fell dead to the carpet i was scaredi mean really scared my body was wired with adrenaline and i could feel my eyes trying to push their way out of their sockets dont kill em bobby said you might as well be killing babies for all the harm they can do you thats the whole point he tossed the nest from hand to hand as if it were an overgrown softball he lobbed it in the air i watched horrified as wasps cruised the living room of my apartment like fighter planes on patrol bobby lowered the nest carefully back into the box and sat down on my couch he patted the place next to him and i went over nearly hypnotized they were everywhere on the rug the ceiling the drapes half a dozen of them were crawling across the front of my bigscreen tv before i could sit down he brushed away a couple that were on the sofa cushion where my ass was aimed they flew away quickly they were all flying easily crawling easily moving fast there was nothing drugged about their behaviour as bobby talked they gradually found their way back to their spitpaper home crawled over it and eventually disappeared inside again through the hole in the top i wasnt the first one to get interested in waco he said it just happens to be the biggest town in the funny little nonviolent section of what is per capita the most violent state in the union texans love to shoot each other howiei mean its like a state hobby half the male population goes around armed saturday night in the fort worth bars is like a shooting gallery where you get to plonk away at drunks instead of clay ducks there are more nra cardcarriers than there are methodists not that texas is the only place where people shoot each other or carve each other up with straight razors or stick their kids in the oven if they cry too long you understand but they sure do like their firearms except in waco i said oh they look like em there too he said its just that they use em on each other a hell of a lot less often jesus i just looked up at the clock and saw the time it feels like ive been writing for fifteen minutes or so but its actually been over an hour that happens to me sometimes when im running at whitehot speed but i cant allow myself to be seduced into these specifics i feel as well as everno noticeable drying of the membranes in the back of the throat no groping for words and as i glance back over what ive done i see only the normal typos and strike overs but i cant kid myself ive got to hurry up fiddlededee said scarlett and all of that the nonviolent atmosphere of the waco area had been noticed and investigated before mostly by sociologists bobby said that when you fed enough statistical data on waco and similar areas into a computerpopulation density mean age mean economic level mean educational level and dozens of other factorswhat you got back was a whopper of an anomaly scholarly papers are rarely jocular but even so several of the better than fifty bobby had read on the subject suggested ironically that maybe it was something in the water i decided maybe it was time to take the joke seriously bobby said after all theres something in the water of a lot of places that prevents tooth decay its called fluoride he went to waco accompanied by a trio of research assistants two sociology gradstudents and a full professor of geology who happened to be on sabbatical and ready for adventure within six months bobby and the sociology guys had constructed a computer program which illustrated what my brother called the worlds only calm quake he had a slightly rumpled printout in his tote he gave it to me i was looking at a series of forty concentric rings waco was in the eighth ninth and tenth as you moved in toward the centre now look at this he said and put a transparent overlay on the printout more rings but in each one there was a number fortieth ring thirtyninth thirtyeighth and so on in a couple of places the numbers went up instead of down but only in a couple and only by a little what are they each number represents the incidence of violent crime in that particular circle bobby said murder rape assault and battery even acts of vandalism the computer assigns a number by a formula that takes population density into account he tapped the twentyseventh circle which held the number with his finger theres less than nine hundred people in this whole area for instance the number represents three or four cases of spouse abuse a couple of barroom brawls an act of animal crueltysome senile farmer got pissed at a pig and shot a load of rocksalt into it as i recalland one involuntary manslaughter i saw that the numbers in the central circles dropped off radically at the epicentre of bobbys calm quake was the town of la plata to call it a sleepy little town seems more than fair the numeric value assigned to la plata was zero so here it is bowwow bobby said leaning forward and rubbing his long hands together nervously my nominee for the garden of eden heres a community of fifteen thousand twentyfour per cent of which are people of mixed blood commonly called indios theres a moccasin factory a couple of little motor courts a couple of scrub farms thats it for work for play theres four bars a couple of dance halls where you can hear any kind of music you want as long as it sounds like george jones two driveins and a bowling alley he paused and added theres also a still i didnt know anybody made whiskey that good outside of tennessee in short and it is now too late to be anything else la plata should have been a fertile breeding ground for the sort of casual violence you can read about in the police blotter section of the local newspaper every day should have been but wasnt there had been only one murder in la plata during the five years previous to my brothers arrival two cases of assault no rapes no reported incidents of child abuse there had been four armed robberies but all four turned out to have been committed by transients as the murder and one of the assaults had been the local sheriff was a fat old republican who did a pretty fair rodney dangerfield imitation he had been known in fact to spend whole days in the local coffee shop tugging the knot in his tie and telling people to take his wife please my brother said he thought it was a little more than lame humour he was pretty sure the poor guy was suffering firststage alzheimers disease his only deputy was his nephew bobby told me the nephew looked quite a lot like junior samples on the old heehaw show put those two guys in a pennsylvania town similar to la plata in every way but the geographical bobby said and they would have been out on their asses fifteen years ago but in la plata theyre gonna go on until they die which theyll probably do in their sleep what did you do i asked how did you proceed well for the first week or so after we got our statistical shit together we just sort of sat around and stared at each other bobby said i mean we were prepared for something but nothing quite like this even waco doesnt prepare you for la plata bobby shifted restlessly and cracked his knuckles jesus i hate it when you do that i said he smiled sorry bowwow anyway we started geological tests then microscopic analysis of the water i didnt expect a hell of a lot everyone in the area has got a well usually a deep one and they get their water tested regularly to make sure theyre not drinking borax or something if there had been something obvious it would have turned up a long time ago so we went on to submicroscopy and that was when we started to turn up some pretty weird stuff what kind of weird stuff breaks in chains of atoms subdynamic electrical fluctuations and some sort of unidentified protein water aint really h you knownot when you add in the sulphides irons god knows what else happens to be in the aquifer of a given region and la plata wateryoud have to give it a string of letters like the ones after a professor emerituss name his eyes gleamed but the protein was the most interesting thing bowwow so far as we know its only found in one other place the human brain uhoh it just arrived between one swallow and the next the throatdryness not much as yet but enough for me to break away and get a glass of icewater ive got maybe forty minutes left and oh jesus theres so much i want to tell about the wasps nests they found with wasps that wouldnt sting about the fenderbender bobby and one of his assistants saw where the two drivers both male both drunk and both about twentyfour sociological bull moose in other words got out shook hands and exchanged insurance information amicably before going into the nearest bar for another drink bobby talked for hoursmore hours than i have but the upshot was simple the stuff in the mayonnaise jar weve got our own still in la plata now he said this is the stuff were brewing howie pacifist white lightning the aquifer under that area of texas is deep but amazingly large its like this incredible lake victoria driven into the porous sediment which overlays the moho the water is potent but weve been able to make the stuff i squirted on the wasps even more potent weve got damn near six thousand gallons now in these big steel tanks by the end of the year well have fourteen thousand by next june well have thirty thousand but its not enough we need more we need it faster and then we need to transport it transport it where i asked him borneo to start with i thought id either lost my mind or misheard him i really did look bowwow sorry howie he was scrumming through his totebag again he brought out a number of aerial photographs and handed them over to me you see he asked as i looked through them you see how fucking perfect it is its as if god himself suddenly busted through our businessasusual transmissions with something like and now we bring you a special bulletin this is your last chance assholes and now we return you to days of our lives i dont get you i said and i have no idea what im looking at of course i knew it was an islandnot borneo itself but an island lying to the west of borneo identified as gulandiowith a mountain in the middle and a lot of muddy little villages lying on its lower slopes it was hard to see the mountain because of the cloud cover what i meant was that i didnt know what i was looking for the mountain has the same name as the island he said gulandio in the local patois it means grace fate or destiny or take your pick but duke rogers says its really the biggest timebomb on earth and its wired to go off by october of next year probably earlier the crazy things this the storys only crazy if you try to tell it in a speedrap which is what im trying to do now bobby wanted me to help him raise somewhere between six hundred thousand and a million and a half dollars to do the following first to synthesize fifty to seventy thousand gallons of what he called the hightest second to airlift all of this water to borneo which had landing facilities you could land a hangglider on gulandio but that was about all third to ship it over to this island named fate or destiny or grace fourth to truck it up the slope of the volcano which had been dormant save for a few puffs in since and then to drop it down the muddy tube of the volcanos caldera duke rogers was actually john paul rogers the geology professor he claimed that gulandio was going to do more than just erupt he claimed that it was going to explode as krakatoa had done in the nineteenth century creating a bang that would make the squirt bomb that poisoned london look like a kids firecracker the debris from the krakatoa blowup bobby told me had literally encircled the globe the observed results had formed an important part of the sagan groups nuclear winter theory for three months afterward sunsets and sunrises half a world away had been grotesquely colourful as a result of the ash whirling around in both the jet stream and the van allen currents which lie forty miles below the van allen belt there had been global changes in climate which lasted five years and nipa palms which previously had grown only in eastern africa and micronesia suddenly showed up in both south and north america the north american nipas all died before bobby said but theyre alive and well below the equator krakatoa seeded them there howiethe way i want to seed la plata water all over the earth i want people to go out in la plata water when it rainsand its going to rain a lot after gulandio goes bang i want them to drink the la plata water that falls in their reservoirs i want them to wash their hair in it bathe in it soak their contact lenses in it i want whores to douche in it bobby i said knowing he was not youre crazy he gave me a crooked tired grin i aint crazy he said you want to see crazy turn on cnn bow howie youll see crazy in living colour but i didnt need to turn on cable news what a friend of mine had taken to calling the organgrinder of doom to know what bobby was talking about the indians and the pakistanis were poised on the brink the chinese and the afghans ditto half of africa was starving the other half on fire with aids there had been border skirmishes along the entire texmex border in the last five years since mexico went communist and people had started calling the tijuana crossing point in california little berlin because of the wall the sabrerattling had become a din on the last day of the old year the scientists for nuclear responsibility had set their black clock to fifteen seconds before midnight bobby lets suppose it could be done and everything went according to schedule i said it probably couldnt and wouldnt but lets suppose you dont have the slightest idea what the longterm effects might be he started to say something and i waved it away dont even suggest that you do because you dont youve had time to find this calm quake of yours and isolate the cause ill give you that but did you ever hear about thalidomide that nifty little acnestopper and sleeping pill that caused cancer and heart attacks in thirtyyearolds dont you remember the aids vaccine in howie that one stopped the disease except it turned the test subjects into incurable epileptics who all died within eighteen months howie then there was howie i stopped and looked at him the world bobby said and then stopped his throat worked i saw he was struggling with tears the world needs heroic measures man i dont know about longterm effects and theres no time to study them because theres no longterm prospect maybe we can cure the whole mess or maybe he shrugged tried to smile and looked at me with shining eyes from which two single tears slowly tracked or maybe were giving heroin to a patient with terminal cancer either way itll stop whats happening now itll end the worlds pain he spread out his hands palms up so i could see the stings on them help me bowwow please help me so i helped him and we fucked up in fact i think you could say we fucked up bigtime and do you want the truth i dont give a shit we killed all the plants but at least we saved the greenhouse something will grow here again someday i hope are you reading this my gears are starting to get a little sticky for the first time in years im having to think about what im doing the motormovements of writing should have hurried more at the start never mind too late to change things now we did it of course distilled the water flew it in transported it to gulandio built a primitive lifting systemhalf motorwinch and half cog railwayup the side of the volcano and dropped over twelve thousand fivegallon containers of la plata waterthe brainbuster versioninto the murky misty depths of the volcanos caldera we did all of this in just eight months it didnt cost six hundred thousand dollars or a million and a half it cost over four million still less than a sixteenth of one per cent of what america spent on defense that year you want to know how we razed it id tell you if i had more thyme but my heads falling apart so never mend i raised most of it myself if it matters to you some by hoof and some by croof tell you the truth i didnt know i could do it myself until i did but we did it and somehow the world held together and that volcanowhatever its name wuz i cant exactly remember now and there izzunt time to go back over the manuscriptit blue just when it was spo wait okay a little better digitalin bobby had it hearts beating like crazy but i can think again the volcanomount grace we called itblue just when dook rogers said it would everything when skihi and for awhile everyones attention turned away from whatever and toward the skys and bimmeldeedee said strapless it happened pretty fast like sex and checks and special effex and everybody got healthy again i mean wait jesus please let me finish this i mean that everybody stood down everybody started to get a little purstective on the situation the wurld started to get like the wasps in bobbys nest the one he showed me where they didnt stink too much there was three yerz like an indian sumer people getting together like in that old youngbloods song that went cmon everybody get together rite now like what all the hippeez wanted you no peets and luv and big blast feel like my heart is coming out thru my ears but if i concentrate every bit of my

mormon sea stories originally appeared in isaac asimovs science fiction magazine and was later included in folk of the fringe a collection of stories set in the postapocalyptic state of deseret there on the shores of a flooded great salt lake the remnants of a ruined civilization rely on their faithand each otherto carry on and rebuild the road began to climb steeply right from the ferry so the truck couldnt build up any speed deaver just kept shifting down wincing as he listened to the grinding of the gears sounded like the transmission was chewing itself to gravel hed been nursing it all the way across nevada and if the wendover ferry hadnt carried him these last miles over the mormon sea he would have had a nice long hike lucky it was a good sign things were going to go deavers way for a while the mechanic frowned at him when he rattled in to the loading dock you been ridin the clutch boy deaver got down from the cab clutch whats a clutch the mechanic didnt smile couldnt you hear the transmission was shot i had mechanics all the way across nevada askin to fix it for me but i told em i was savin it for you the mechanic looked at him like he was crazy there aint no mechanics in nevada if you wasnt dumb as your thumb thought deaver youd know i was joking these old mormons were so straight they couldnt sit down some of them but deaver didnt say anything just smiled this trucks gonna stay here a few days said the mechanic fine with me thought deaver i got plans how many days you figure take three for now ill sign you off my names deaver teague tell the foreman hell write it up the mechanic lifted the hood to begin the routine checks while the dock boys loaded off the old washing machines and refrigerators and other stuff deaver had picked up on this trip deaver took his mileage reading to the window and the foreman paid him off seven dollars for five days of driving and loading sleeping in the cab and eating whatever the farmers could spare it was better than a lot of people lived on but there wasnt any future in it salvage wouldnt go on forever someday hed pick up the last brokendown dishwasher left from the old days and then hed be out of a job well deaver teague wasnt going to wait around for that he knew where the gold was hed been planning how to get it for weeks and if lehi had got the diving equipment like he promised then tomorrow morning theyd do a little freelance salvage work if they were lucky theyd come home rich deavers legs were stiff but he loosened them up pretty quick and broke into an easy loping run down the corridors of the salvage centre he took a flight of stairs two or three steps at a time bounded down a hall and when he reached a sign that said small computer salvage he pushed off the doorframe and rebounded into the room hey lehi he said hey its quittin time lehi mckay paid no attention he was sitting in front of a tv screen jerking at a black box he held on his lap you do that and youll go blind said deaver shut up carpface lehi never took his eyes off the screen he jabbed at a button on the black box and twisted on the stick that jutted up from it a colored blob on the screen blew up and split into four smaller blobs i got three days off while they do the transmission on the truck said deaver so tomorrows the temple expedition lehi got the last blob off the screen more blobs appeared thats real fun said deaver like sweepin the street and then they bring along another troop of horses its an atari from the sixties or seventies or something eighties old cant do much with the pieces its only eightbit stuff all these years in somebodys attic in logan and the sucker still runs old guys probably didnt even know they had it probably deaver watched the game same thing over and over again how much a thing like this use to cost a lot maybe fifteen twenty bucks makes you want to barf and here sits lehi mckay toodling his noodle like the old guys use to all it ever got them was a sore noodle lehi and slag for brains drown it im trying to concentrate the game finally ended lehi set the black box up on the workbench turned off the machine and stood up you got everything ready to go underwater tomorrow asked deaver that was a good game having fun mustve took up a lot of their time in the old days mom says the kids used to not even be able to get jobs till they was sixteen it was the law don t you wish said deaver its true you dont know your tongue from dung lehi you dont know your heart from a fart you want to get us both kicked out of here talkin like that i dont have to follow school rules now i graduated sixth grade im nineteen years old i been on my own for five years he pulled his seven dollars out of his pocket waved them once stuffed them back in carelessly i do ok and i talk like i want to talk think im afraid of the bishop bishop dont scare me i dont even go to church except to make mom happy its a bunch of bunny turds lehi laughed but deaver could see that he was a little scared to talk like that sixteen years old thought deaver hes big and hes smart but hes such a little kid he dont understand how its like to be a man rains comin rains always comin what the hell do you think filled up the lake lehi smirked as he unplugged everything on the workbench i meant lorraine wilson i know what you meant shes got her boat and shes got a mean set of fenders deaver cupped his hands just need a little polishing why do you always talk dirty ever since you started driving salvage deaver you got a gutter mouth besides shes built like a sack shes near fifty what do you expect it occurred to deaver that lehi seemed to be stalling which probably meant he botched up again as usual can you get the diving stuff i already got it you thought id screw up lehi smirked again you screw up you can be trusted with anything deaver started for the door he could hear lehi behind him still shutting a few things off they got to use a lot of electricity in here of course they had to because they needed computers all the time and salvage was the only way to get them but when deaver saw all that electricity getting used up at once to him it looked like his own future all the machines he could ever want new ones and all the power they needed clothes that nobody else ever wore his own horse and wagon or even a car maybe hed be the guy who started making cars again he didnt need stupid blobsmashing games from the past that stuffs dead and gone duck lips dead and gone whatre you talking about asked lehi dead and gone all your computer things it was enough to set lehi off as it always did deaver grinned and felt wicked and strong as lehi babbled along behind him about how we use the computers more than they ever did in the old days the computers kept everything going on and on and on it was cute deaver liked him the boy was so intense like everything was the end of the world deaver knew better the world was dead it had already ended so none of it mattered you could sink all this stuff in the lake they came out of the centre and walked along the retaining wall far below them was the harbour a little circle of water in the bottom of a bowl with bingham city perched on the lip they used to have an openpit copper mine here but when the water rose they cut a channel to it and now they had a nice harbour on oquirrh island in the middle of the mormon sea where the factories could stink up the whole sky and no neighbours ever complained about it a lot of other people joined them on the steep dirt road that led down to the harbour nobody lived right in bingham city itself because it was just a working place day and night shifts in shifts out lehi was a shift boy lived with his family across the jordan strait on pointofthemountain which was as rotten a place to live as anybody ever devised rode the ferry in every day at five in the morning and rode it back every afternoon at four he was supposed to go to school after that for a couple of hours but deaver thought that was stupid he told lehi that all the time told him again now school is too much time and too little of everything a waste of time i gotta go to school said lehi tell me two plus two you havent got two plus two yet you finished didnt you nobody needs anything after fourth grade he shoved lehi a little usually lehi shoved back but this time no just try getting a real job without a sixthgrade diploma ok and im pretty close now they were at the ferry ship lehi got out his pass you with me tomorrow or not lehi made a face i dont know deaver you can get arrested for going around there its a dumb thing to do they say theres real weird things in the old skyscrapers we arent going in the skyscrapers even worse in there deaver i dont want to go there yeah the angel moronis probably waiting to jump out and say boogaboogabooga dont talk about it deaver deaver was tickling him lehi laughed and tried to shy away cut it out chiggerhead come on besides the moroni statue was moved to the salt lake monument up on the mountain and that has a guard all the time the statues just gold plate anyway im tellin you those old mormons hid tons of stuff down in the temple just waitin for somebody who isnt scared of the ghost of bigamy young to shut up snotsucker ok people can hear look around were not alone it was true of course some of the other people were glaring at them but then deaver noticed that older people liked to glare at younger ones it made the old farts feel better about kicking off it was like they were saying ok im dying but at least youre stupid so deaver looked right at a woman who was staring at him and murmured ok im stupid but at least i wont die deaver do you always have to say that where they can hear you its true in the first place deaver they arent dying and in the second place youre definitely stupid and in the third place the ferrys here lehi punched deaver lightly in the stomach deaver bent over in mock agony ay the laddies ungrateful he is i give him me last croost of bread and this be the thanks i gets nobody has an accent like that deaver shouted lehi the boat began to pull away tomorrow at fivethirty shouted deaver youll never get up at fourthirty dont give me that you never get up but the ferry and the noise of the factories and machine and trucks swallowed up the rest of his insults deaver knew them all anyway lehi might be only sixteen but he was ok someday deaverd get married but his wife would like lehi too and lehid even get married and his wife would like deaver shed better or shed have to swim home he took the trolley home to fort douglas and walked to the ancient barracks building where rain let him stay it was supposed to be a storage room but she kept the mops and soap stuff in her place so that thered be room for a cot not much else but it was on oquirrh island without being right there in the stink and the smoke and the noise he could sleep and that was enough since most of the time he was out on the truck truth was his room wasnt home anyway home was pretty much rains place a drafty room at the end of the barracks with a dumpy frowzy lady who served him good food and plenty of it thats where he went now walked right in and surprised her in the kitchen she yelled at him for surprising her yelled at him for being filthy and tracking all over her floor and let him get a slice of apple before she yelled at him for snitching before supper he went around and changed light bulbs in five rooms before supper the families there were all crammed into two rooms each at the most and most of them had to share kitchens and eat in shifts some of the rooms were nasty places family warfare held off only as long as it took him to change the light and sometimes even that truce wasnt observed others were doing fine the place was small but they liked each other deaver was pretty sure his family must have been one of the nice ones because if thered been any yelling he would have remembered rain and deaver ate and then turned off all the lights while she played the old record player deaver had wangled away from lehi they really werent supposed to have it but they figured as long as they didnt burn any lights it wasnt wasting electricity and theyd turn it in as soon as anybody asked for it in the meantime rain had some of the old records from when she was a girl the songs had strong rhythms and tonight like she sometimes did rain got up and moved to the music strange little dances that deaver didnt understand unless he imagined her as a lithe young girl pictured her body as it must have been then it wasnt hard to imagine it was there in her eyes and her smile all the time and her movements gave away secrets that years of starchy eating and lack of exercise had disguised then as always his thoughts went off to some of the girls he saw from his truck window driving by the fields where they bent over hard at work until they heard the truck and then they stood and waved everybody waved at the salvage truck sometimes it was the only thing with a motor that ever came by their only contact with the old machines all the tractors all the electricity were reserved for the new soil lands the old places were dying and they turned and waved at the last memories it made deaver sad and he hated to be sad all these people clinging to a past that never existed it never existed he said aloud yes it did rain whispered girls just wanna have fuun she murmured along with the record i hated this song when i was a girl or maybe it was my mama who hated it you live here then indiana she said one of the states way east were you a refugee too no we moved here when i was sixteen seventeen cant remember whenever things got scary in the world a lot of mormons moved home this was always home no matter what the record ended she turned it off turned on the lights got the boat all gassed up asked deaver you dont want to go there she said if theres gold down there i want it if there was gold there deaver they wouldve taken it out before the water covered it its not as if nobody got a warning you know the mormon sea wasnt a flash flood if it isnt down there whats all the hushhush about how come the lake patrol keeps people from going there i dont know deaver maybe because a lot of people feel like its a holy place deaver was used to this rain never went to church but she still talked like a mormon most people did though when you scratched them the wrong place deaver didnt like it when they got religious angels need police protection is that it it used to be real important to the mormons in the old days deaver she sat down on the floor leaning against the wall under the window well its nothin now they got their other temples dont they and theyre building the new one in zarahemla right i dont know deaver the one here it was always the real one the centre she bent sideways leaned on her hand looked down at the floor it still is deaver saw she was getting really somber now really sad it happened to a lot of people who remembered the old days like a disease that never got cured but deaver knew the cure for rain anyway is it true they used to kill people in there it worked she glared at him and the languor left her body is that what you truckers talk about all day deaver grinned theres stories cuttin people up if they told where the gold was hid you know mormons all over the place now deaver do you really think wed go cuttin people up for tellin secrets i dont know depends on the secrets dont it he was sitting on his hands kind of bouncing a little on the couch he could see that she was a little mad for real but didnt want to be so shed pretend to be mad for play she sat up reached for a pillow to throw at him no no he cried dont cut me up dont feed me to the carp the pillow hit him and he pretended elaborately to die just dont joke about things like that she said things like what you dont believe in the old stuff anymore nobody does maybe not jesus was supposed to come again right there was atom bombs dropped here and there and he was supposed to come prophet said we was too wicked he wouldnt come cause we loved the things of the world too much come on if he was comin he wouldve come right might still she said nobody believes that said deaver mormons are just the government thats all the bishop gets elected judge in every town right the president of the elders is always mayor its just the government just politics nobody believes it now zarahemlas the capital not the holy city he couldnt see her because he was lying flat on his back on the couch when she didnt answer he got up and looked for her she was over by the sink leaning on the counter he snuck up behind her to tickle her but something in her posture changed his mind when he got close he saw tears down her cheeks it was crazy all these people from the old days got crazy a lot i was just teasin he said she nodded its just part of the old days you know how i am about that maybe if i remembered itd be different sometimes i wish i remembered but it was a lie he never wished he remembered he didnt like remembering most stuff he couldnt remember even if he wanted to the earliest thing he could bring to mind was riding on the back of a horse behind some man who sweated a lot just riding and riding and riding and then it was all recent stuff going to school getting passed around in peoples homes finally getting busy one year and finishing school and getting a job he didnt get mistyeyed thinking about any of it any of those places just passing through thats all he was ever doing never belonged anywhere until maybe now he belonged here im sorry he said its fine she said you still gonna take me there i said i would didnt i she sounded just annoyed enough that he knew it was ok to tease her again you dont think theyll have the second coming while were there do you if you think so ill wear my tie she smiled then turned to face him and pushed him away deaver go to bed im gettin up at fourthirty rain and then youre one girl whos gonna have fan i dont think the song was about early morning boat trips she was doing the dishes when he left for his little room lehi was waiting at fivethirty right on schedule i cant believe it he said i thought youd be late good thing you were ready on time said deaver cause if you didnt come with us you wouldnt get a cut we arent going to find any gold deaver teague then whyre you comin with me dont give me that stuff lehi you know the futures with deaver teague and you dont want to be left behind wheres the diving stuff i didnt bring it home deaver you dont think my momd ask questions then shes always askin questions said deaver its her job said rain i dont want anybody askin about everything i do said deaver nobody has to ask said rain you always tell us whether we want to hear or not if you dont want to hear you dont have to said deaver dont get touchy said rain you guys are both gettin wetheaded on me all of a sudden does the temple make you crazy is that how it works i dont mind my mom askin me stuff its ok the ferries ran from point to bingham day and night so they had to go north a ways before cutting west to oquirrh island the smelter and the foundries put orangebellied smoke clouds into the night sky and the coal barges were getting offloaded just like in daytime the coaldust cloud that was so grimy and black in the day looked like white fog under the floodlights my dad died right there about this time of day said lehi he loaded coal yeah he used to be a car salesmen his job kind of disappeared on him you werent there were you i heard the crash i was asleep but it woke me up and then a lot of shouting and running we lived on the island back then always heard stuff from the harbor he got buried under a ton of coal that fell from fifty feet up deaver didnt know what to say about that you never talk about your folks said lehi i always remember my dad but you never talk about your folks deaver shrugged he doesnt remember em rain said quietly they found him out on the plains somewhere the mobbers got his family however many there was he mustve hid or something thats all they can figure well what was it asked lehi did you hide deaver didnt feel comfortable talking about it since he didnt remember anything except what people told him he knew that other people remembered their childhood and he didnt like how they always acted so surprised that he didnt but lehi was asking and deaver knew that you dont keep stuff back from friends i guess i did or maybe i looked too dumb to kill or somethin he laughed i mustve been a real dumb little kid i didnt even remember my own name they figure i was five or six years old most kids know their names but not me so the two guys that found me their names were teague and deaver you gotta remember somethin lehi i didnt even know how to talk they tell me i didnt even say a word till i was nine years old were talkin about a slow learner here wow lehi was silent for a while how come you didnt say anything doesnt matter said rain he makes up for it now deaver the talker champion talker they coasted the island till they got past magna lehi led them to a storage shed that underwater salvage had put up at the north end of oquirrh island it was unlocked and full of diving equipment lehis friends had filled some tanks with air they got two diving outfits and underwater flashlights rain wasnt going underwater so she didnt need anything they pulled away from the island out into the regular shipping lane from wendover in that direction at least people had sense enough not to travel at night so there wasnt much traffic after a little while they were out into open water that was when rain stopped the little outboard motor deaver had scrounged for her and lehi had fixed time to sweat and slave said rain deaver sat on the middle bench settled the oars into the locks and began to row not too fast rain said youll give yourself blisters a boat that might have been lake patrol went by once but otherwise nobody came near them as they crossed the open stretch then the skyscrapers rose up and blocked off large sections of the starry night they say theres people who was never rescued still livin in there lehi whispered rain was disdainful you think theres anything left in there to keep anybody alive and the waters still too salty to drink for long who says theyre alive whispered deaver in his most mysterious voice a couple of years ago he could have spooked lehi and made his eyes go wide now lehi just looked disgusted come on deaver im not a kid it was deaver who got spooked a little the big holes where pieces of glass and plastic had fallen off looked like mouths waiting to suck him in and carry him down under the water into the city of the drowned he sometimes dreamed about thousands and thousands of people living under water still driving their cars around going about their business shopping in stores going to movies in his dreams they never did anything bad just went about their business but he always woke up sweating and frightened no reason just spooked him i think they should blow up these things before they fall down and hurt somebody said deaver maybe its better to leave em standing said rain maybe theres a lot of folks like to remember how tall we once stood whats to remember they built tall buildings and then they let em take a bath whats to brag for deaver was trying to get her not to talk about the old days but lehi seemed to like wallowing in it you ever here before the water came rain nodded saw a parade go right down this street i cant remember if it was third south or fourth south third i guess i saw twentyfive horses all riding together i remember that i thought that was really something you didnt see many horses in those days i seen too many myself said lehi its the ones i dont see that i hate said deaver they ought to make em wear diapers they rounded a building and looked up a northsouth passage between towers rain was sitting in the stern and saw it first there it is you can see it just the tall spires now deaver rowed them up the passage there were six spires sticking up out of the water but the four short ones were under so far that only the pointed roofs were dry the two tall ones had windows in them not covered at all deaver was disappointed wide open like that meant that anybody might have come here it was all so much less dangerous than he had expected maybe rain was right and there was nothing there they tied the boat to the north side and waited for daylight if i knew itd be so easy said deaver i couldve slept another hour sleep now said rain maybe will said deaver he slid off his bench and sprawled in the bottom of the boat he didnt sleep though the open window of the steeple was only a few yards away a deep black surrounded by the starlit grey of the temple granite it was down there waiting for him the future a chance to get something better for himself and his two friends maybe a plot of ground in the south where it was warmer and the snow didnt pile up five feet deep every winter where it wasnt rain in the sky and lake everywhere else you looked a place where he could live for a very long time and look back and remember good times with his friends that was all waiting down under the water of course they hadnt told him about the gold it was on the road a little place in parowan where truckers knew they could stop in because the iron mine kept such crazy shifts that the diners never closed they even had some coffee there hot and bitter because there werent so many mormons there and the miners didnt let the bishop push them around in fact they even called him judge there instead of bishop the other drivers didnt talk to deaver of course they were talking to each other when the one fellow told the story about how the mormons back in the gold rush days hoarded up all the gold they could get and hid it in the upper rooms of the temple where nobody but the prophet and the twelve apostles could ever go at first deaver didnt believe him except that bill home nodded like he knew it was true and cal silber said youd never catch him messin with the mormon temple thats a good way to get yourself dead the way they were talking scared and quiet told deaver that they believed it that it was true and he knew something else too if anyone was going to get that gold it was him even if it was easy to get here that didnt mean anything he knew how mormons were about the temple hed asked around a little but nobodyd talk about it and nobody ever went there either he asked a lot of people if they ever sailed on out and looked at it and they all got quiet and shook their heads no or changed the subject why should the lake patrol guard it then if everybody was too scared to go everybody but deaver teague and his two friends real pretty said rain deaver woke up the sun was just topping the mountains it mustve been light for some time he looked where rain was looking it was the moroni tower on top of the mountain above the old capitol where theyd put the temple statue a few years back it was bright and shiny the old guy and his trumpet but when the mormons wanted that trumpet to blow it had just stayed silent and their faith got drowned now deaver knew they only hung on to it for old times sake well deaver lived for new times lehi showed him how to use the underwater gear and they practiced going over the side into the water a couple of times once without the weight belts and once with deaver and lehi swam like fish of courseswimming was the main recreation that everybody could do for free it was different with the mask and the air hose though hose tastes like a horses hoof deaver said between dives lehi made sure deavers weight belt was on tight youre the only guy on oquirrh island who knows then he tumbled forward off the boat deaver went down too straight and the air tank bumped the back of his head a little but it didnt hurt too much and he didnt drop his light either he swam along the outside of the temple shining his light on the stones lots of underwater plants were rising up the sides of the temple but it wasnt covered much yet there was a big metal plaque right in the front of the building about a third of the way down the house of the lord it said deaver pointed it out to lehi when they got up to the boat again deaver asked about it it looked kind of goldish he said used to be another sign there said rain it was a little different that one might have been gold this ones plastic they made it so the temple would still have a sign i guess you sure about that i remember when they did it finally deaver felt confident enough to go down into the temple they had to take off their flippers to climb into the steeple window rain tossed them up after in the sunlight there was nothing spooking about the window they sat there on the sill water lapping at their feet and put their fins and tanks on halfway through getting dressed lehi stopped just sat there i cant do it he said nothin to be scared of said deaver come on theres no ghosts or nothin down there i cant said lehi good for you called rain from the boat deaver turned to look at her whatre you talkin about i dont think you should then whyd you bring me here because you wanted to made no sense its holy ground deaver said rain lehi feels it too thats why he isnt going down deaver looked at lehi it just dont feel right said lehi its just stones said deaver lehi said nothing deaver put on his goggles took a light put the breather in his mouth and jumped turned out the floor was only a foot and a half down it took him completely by surprise so he fell over and sat on his butt in eighteen inches of water lehi was just as surprised as he was but then he started laughing and deaver laughed too deaver got to his feet and started flapping around looking for the stairway he could hardly take a step his flippers slowed him down so much walk backward said lehi then how am i supposed to see where im going stick your face under the water and look chiggerhead deaver stuck his face in the water without the reflection of daylight on the surface he could see fine there was the stairway he got up looked toward lehi lehi shook his head he still wasnt going suit yourself said deaver he backed through the water to the top step then he put in his breathing tube and went down it wasnt easy to get down the stairs theyre fine when you arent floating thought deaver but theyre a pain when you keep scraping your tanks on the ceiling finally he figured out he could grab the railing and pull himself down the stairs wound around and around when they ended a whole bunch of garbage had filled up the bottom of the stairwell partly blocking the doorway he swam above the garbage which looked like scrap metal and chips of wood and came out into a large room his light didnt shine very far through the murky water so he swam the walls around and around high and low down here the water was cold and he swam faster to keep warm there were rows of arched windows on both sides with rows of circular windows above them but they had been covered over with wood on the outside the only light was from deavers flashlight finally though after a couple of times around the room and across the ceiling he figured it was just one big room and except for the garbage all over the floor it was empty already he felt the deep pain of disappointment he forced himself to ignore it after all it wouldnt be right out here in a big room like this would it there had to be a secret treasury there were a couple of doors the small one in the middle of the wall at one end was wide open once there must have been stairs leading up to it deaver swam over there and shone his light in just another room smaller this time he found a couple more rooms but they had all been stripped right down to the stone nothing at all he tried examining some of the stones to look for secret doors but he gave up pretty soonhe couldnt see well enough from the flashlight to find a thin crack even if it was there now the disappointment was real as he swam along he began to wonder if maybe the truckers hadnt known he was listening maybe they made it all up just so someday hed do this some joke where they wouldnt even see him make a fool of himself but no no that couldnt be it they believed it all right but he knew now what they didnt know whatever the mormons did here in the old days there wasnt any gold in the upper rooms now so much for the future but what the hell he told himself i got here i saw it and ill find something else no reason not to be cheerful about it he didnt fool himself and there was nobody else down here to fool it was bitter hed spent a lot of years thinking about bars of gold or bags of it hed always pictured it hidden behind a curtain hed pull on the curtain and it would billow out in the water and here would be the bags of gold and hed just take them out and that would be it but there werent any curtains werent any hidey holes there was nothing at all and if he had a future hed have to find it somewhere else he swam back to the door leading to the stairway now he could see the pile of garbage better and it occurred to him to wonder how it got there every other room was completely empty the garbage couldnt have been carried in by the water because the only windows that were open were in the steeple and they were above the water line he swam close and picked up a piece it was metal they were all metal except a few stones and it occurred to him that this might be it after all if youre hiding a treasure you dont put it in bags or ingots you leave it around looking like garbage and people leave it alone he gathered up as many of the thin metal pieces as he could carry in one hand and swam carefully up the stairwell lehi would have to come down now and help him carry it up they could make bags out of their shirts to carry lots of it at a time he splashed out into the air and then walked backward up the last few steps and across the submerged floor lehi was still sitting on the sill and now rain was there beside him her bare feet dangling in the water when he got there he turned around and held out the metal in his hands he couldnt see their faces well because the outside of the facemask was blurry with water and kept catching sunlight you scraped your knee said rain deaver handed her his flashlight and now that his hand was free he could pull his mask off and look at them they were very serious he held out the metal pieces toward them look what i found down there lehi took a couple of metal pieces from him rain never took her eyes from deavers face its old cans deaver lehi said quietly no it isnt said deaver but he looked at his fistful of metal sheets and realized it was true they had been cut down the side and pressed flat but they were sure enough cans theres writing on it said lehi it says dear lord heal my girl jenny please i pray deaver set down his handful on the sill then he took one turned it over found the writing forgive my adultery i will sin no more lehi read another bring my boy safe from the plains o lord god each message was scratched with a nail or a piece of glass the letters crudely formed they used to say prayers all day in the temple and people would bring in names and theyd say the temple prayers for them said rain nobody prays here now but they still bring the names on metal so theyll last we shouldnt read these said lehi we should put them back there were hundreds maybe thousand of those metal prayers down there people must come here all the time deaver realized the mormons must have a regular traffic coming here and leaving these things behind but nobody told me did you know about this rain nodded you brought them here didnt you some of them over the years you knew what was down there she didnt answer she told you not to come said lehi you knew about this too i knew people came i didnt know what they did and suddenly the magnitude of it struck him lehi and rain had both known all the mormons knew then they all knew and he had asked again and again and no one had told him not even his friends whyd you let me come out here tried to stop you said rain why didnt you tell me this she looked him in the eye deaver you wouldve thought i was givin you the run around and you would have laughed at this if i told you i thought it was better if you saw it then maybe you wouldnt go tellin people how dumb the mormons are you think i would he held up another metal prayer and read it aloud come quickly lord jesus before i die he shook it at her you think id laugh at these people you laugh at everything deaver deaver looked at lehi this was something lehi had never said before deaver would never laugh at something that was really important and this was really important to them to them both this is yours deaver said all this stuff is yours i never left a prayer here said lehi but when he said yours he didnt mean just them just lehi and rain he meant all of them all the people of the mormon sea all the ones who had known about it but never told him even though he asked again and again all the people who belonged here i came to find something here for me and you knew all the time it was only your stuff down there lehi and rain looked at each other then back at deaver it isnt ours said rain i never been here before said lehi its your stuff he sat down in the water and began taking off the underwater gear dont be mad said lehi i didnt know you knew more than you told me all the time i thought we were friends but it wasnt true you two had this place in common with all the other people but not with me everybody but me lehi carefully took the metal sheets to the stairway and dropped them they sank once to drift down and take their place on the pile of supplications lehi rowed them through the skyscrapers to the east of the old city and then rain started the motor and they skimmed along the surface of the lake the lake patrol didnt see them but deaver knew now that it didnt matter much if they did the lake patrol was mostly mormons they undoubtedly knew about the traffic here and let it happen as long as it was discreet probably the only people they stopped were the people who werent in on it all the way back to magna to return the underwater gear deaver sat in the front of the boat not talking to the others where deaver sat the bow of the boat seemed to curve under him the faster they went the less the boat seemed to touch the water just skimming over the surface never really touching deep making a few waves but the water always smoothed out again those two people in the back of the boat he felt kind of sorry for them they still lived in the drowned city they belonged down there and the fact they couldnt go there broke their hearts but not deaver his city wasnt even built yet his city was tomorrow hed driven a salvage truck and lived in a closet long enough maybe hed go south into the new soil lands maybe qualify on a piece of land own something plant in the soil maybe hed come to belong there as for this place well he never had belonged here just like all the foster homes and schools along the way just one more stop for a year or two or three he knew that all along never did make any friends here but thats how he wanted it wouldnt be right to make friends cause hed just move on and disappoint them didnt see no good in doing that to people the people of sand and slag by paolo bacigalupi paolo bacigalupi is the author of

inside the perimeter well inside i stripped off my immersive response goggles as adrenaline surged through me the virtual cityscape id been about to raze disappeared replaced by our monitoring rooms many views of sescos mining operations on one screen the red phosphorescent tracery of an intruder skated across a terrain map a hot blip like blood spattering its way toward pit jaak was already out of the monitoring room i ran for my gear i caught up with jaak in the equipment room as he grabbed a ts and slashbangs and dragged his impact exoskeleton over his tattooed body he draped bandoleers of surgepacks over his massive shoulders and ran for the outer locks i strapped on my own exoskeleton pulled my from its rack checked its charge and followed lisa was already in the hev its turbofans screaming like banshees when the hatch dilated sentry centaurs leveled their s at me then relaxed as friendfoe data spilled into their headsup displays i bolted across the tarmac my skin pricking under blasts of icy montana wind and the jet wash of hentasa mark v engines overhead the clouds glowed orange with light from sescos mining bots come on chen move move move i dove into the hunter the ship leaped into the sky it banked throwing me against a bulkhead then the hentasas cycled wide and the hunter punched forward the hevs hatch slid shut the wind howl muted i struggled forward to the flight cocoon and peered over jaaks and lisas shoulders to the landscape beyond have a good game lisa asked i scowled i was about to win i made it to paris we cut through the mists over the catchment lakes skimming inches above the water and then we hit the far shore the hunter lurched as its anticollision software jerked us away from the roughening terrain lisa overrode the computers and forced the ship back down against the soil driving us so low i could have reached out and dragged my hands through the broken scree as we screamed over it alarms yowled jaak shut them off as lisa pushed the hunter lower ahead a tailings ridge loomed we ripped up its face and dropped sickeningly into the next valley the hentasas shuddered as lisa forced them to the edge of their design buffer we hurtled up and over another ridge ahead the ragged cutscape of mined mountains stretched to the horizon we dipped again into mist and skimmed low over another catchment lake leaving choppy wake in the thick golden waters jaak studied the hunters scanners ive got it he grinned its moving but slow contact in one minute lisa said he hasnt launched any countermeasures i watched the intruder on the tracking screens as they displayed realtime data fed to us from sescos satellites its not even a masked target we could have dropped a mini on it from base if wed known he wasnt going to play hideandseek could have finished your game lisa said we could still nuke him jaak suggested i shook my head no lets take a look vaporizing him wont leave us anything and bunbaum will want to know what we used the hunter for thirty seconds he wouldnt care if someone hadnt taken the hunter on a joyride to cancun lisa shrugged i wanted to swim it was either that or rip off your kneecaps the hunter lunged over another series of ridges jaak studied his monitor targets moving away hes still slow well get him fifteen seconds to drop lisa said she unstrapped and switched the hunter to software we all ran for the hatch as the hev yanked itself skyward its auto pilot desperate to tear away from the screaming hazard of the rocks beneath its belly we plunged out the hatch one two three falling like icarus we slammed into the ground at hundreds of kilometers per hour our exoskeletons shattered like glass flinging leaves into the sky the shards fluttered down around us black metallic petals absorbing our enemys radar and heat detection while we rolled to jarred vulnerable stops in muddy scree the hunter blew over the ridge hentasas shrieking a blazing target i dragged myself upright and ran for the ridge my feet churning through yellow tailings mud and rags of jaundiced snow behind me jaak was down with smashed arms the leaves of his exoskeleton marked his roll path a long trail of black shimmering metal lisa lay a hundred yards away her femur rammed through her thigh like a bright white exclamation mark i reached the top of the ridge and stared down into the valley nothing i dialed up the magnification of my helmet the monotonous slopes of more tailings rubble spread out below me boulders some as large as our hev some cracked and shattered by high explosives shared the slopes with the unstable yellow shale and fine grit of waste materials from sescos operations jaak slipped up beside me followed a moment later by lisa her flight suits leg torn and bloodied she wiped yellow mud off her face and ate it as she studied the valley below anything i shook my head nothing yet you okay clean break jaak pointed there down in the valley something was running flushed by the hunter it slipped along a shallow creek viscous with tailings acid the ship herded it toward us nothing no missile fire no slag just the running creature a mass of tangled hair quadrupedal splattered with mud some kind of biojob i wondered it doesnt have any hands lisa murmured no equipment either jaak muttered what kind of sick bastard makes a biojob without hands i searched the nearby ridgelines decoy maybe jaak checked his scanner data piped in from the hunters more aggressive instruments i dont think so can we put the hunter up higher i want to look around at lisas command the hunter rose allowing its sensors a fuller reach the howl of its turbofans became muted as it gained altitude jaak waited as more data spat into his headsup display nope nothing and no new alerts from any of the perimeter stations either were alone lisa shook her head we should have just dropped a mini on it from base down in the valley the biojobs headlong run slowed to a trot it seemed unaware of us closer now we could make out its shape a shaggy quadruped with a tail dreadlocked hair dangled from its shanks like ornaments tagged with tailings mud clods it was stained around its legs from the acids of the catchment ponds as though it had forded streams of urine thats one ugly biojob i said lisa shouldered her biomelt when im done with it wait jaak said dont slag it lisa glanced over at him irritated what now thats not a biojob at all jaak whispered thats a dog he stood suddenly and jumped over the hillside running headlong down the scree toward the animal wait lisa called but jaak was already fully exposed and blurring to his top speed the animal took one look at jaak whooping and hollering as he came roaring down the slope then turned and ran it was no match for jaak half a minute later he overtook the animal lisa and i exchanged glances well she said its awfully slow if its a biojob ive seen centaurs walk faster by the time we caught up with jaak and the animal jaak had it cornered in a dull gully the animal stood in the center of a trickling ditch of sludgy water shaking and growling and baring its teeth at us as we surrounded it it tried to break around us but jaak kept it corralled easily up close the animal seemed even more pathetic than from a distance a good thirty kilos of snarling mange its paws were slashed and bloody and patches of fur were torn away revealing festering chemical burns underneath ill be damned i breathed staring at the animal it really looks like a dog jaak grinned its like finding a goddamn dinosaur how could it live out here lisas arm swept the horizon theres nothing to live on its got to be modified she studied it closely then glanced at jaak are you sure nothings coming in on the perimeter this isnt some kind of decoy jaak shook his head nothing not even a peep i leaned in toward the creature it bared its teeth in a rictus of hatred its pretty beat up maybe its the real thing jaak said oh yeah its the real thing all right i saw a dog in a zoo once im telling you this is a dog lisa shook her head it cant be it would be dead if it were a real dog jaak just grinned and shook his head no way look at it he reached out to push the hair out of the animals face so that we could see its muzzle the animal lunged and its teeth sank into jaaks arm it shook his arm violently growling as jaak stared down at the creature latched onto his flesh it yanked its head back and forth trying to tear jaaks arm off blood spurted around its muzzle as its teeth found jaaks arteries jaak laughed his bleeding stopped damn check that out he lifted his arm until the animal dangled fully out of the stream dripping i got me a pet the dog swung from the thick bough of jaaks arm it tried to shake his arm once again but its movements were ineffectual now that it hung off the ground even lisa smiled must be a bummer to wake up and find out youre at the end of your evolutionary curve the dog growled determined to hang on jaak laughed and drew his monomol knife here you go doggy he sliced his arm off leaving it in the bewildered animals mouth lisa cocked her head you think we could make some kind of money on it jaak watched as the dog devoured his severed arm i read somewhere that they used to eat dogs i wonder what they taste like i checked the time in my headsup display wed already killed an hour on an exercise that wasnt giving any bonuses get your dog jaak and get it on the hunter we arent going to eat it before we call bunbaum hell probably call it company property jaak groused yeah thats the way it always goes but we still have to report might as well keep the evidence since we didnt nuke it we ate sand for dinner outside the security bunker the mining robots rumbled back and forth ripping deeper into the earth turning it into a mush of tailings and rock acid that they left in exposed ponds when they hit the water table or piled into thousandfoot mountainscapes of waste soil it was comforting to hear those machines cruising back and forth all day just you and the bots and the profits and if nothing got bombed while you were on duty there was always a nice bonus after dinner we sat around and sharpened lisas skin implanting blades along her limbs so that she was like a razor from all directions shed considered monomol blades but it was too easy to take a limb off accidentally and we lost enough body parts as it was without adding to the mayhem that kind of garbage was for people who didnt have to work aesthetes from new york city and california lisa had a dermdecora kit for the sharpening shed bought it last time wed gone on vacation and spent extra to get it instead of getting one of the cheap knockoffs that were cropping up we worked on cutting her skin down to the bone and setting the blades a friend of ours in la said that he just held dermdecora parties so everyone could do their modifications and help out with the hardtoreach places lisa had done my glowspine a sweet tracery of lime landing lights that ran from my tailbone to the base of my skull so i didnt mind helping her out but jaak who did all of his modification with an oldtime scar and tattoo shop in hawaii wasnt so pleased it was a little frustrating because her flesh kept trying to close before we had the blades set but eventually we got the hang of it and an hour later she started looking good once we finished with lisas front settings we sat around and fed her i had a bowl of tailings mud that i drizzled into her mouth to speed her integration process when we were werent feeding her we watched the dog jaak had shoved it into a makeshift cage in one corner of our common room it lay there like it was dead lisa said i ran its dna it really is a dog bunbaum believe you she gave me a dirty look what do you think i laughed at sesco tactical defense responders were expected to be fast flexible and deadly but the reality was our sop was always the same drop nukes on intruders slag the leftovers to melt so they couldnt regrow hit the beaches for vacation we were independent and trusted as far as tactical decisions went but there was no way sesco was going to believe its slag soldiers had found a dog in their tailings mountains lisa nodded he wanted to know how the hell a dog could live out here then he wanted to know why we didnt catch it sooner wanted to know what he pays us for she pushed her short blond hair off her face and eyed the animal i should have slagged it whats he want us to do its not in the manual hes calling back i studied the limp animal i want to know how it was surviving dogs are meat eaters right maybe some of the engineers were giving it meat like jaak did jaak shook his head i dont think so the sucker threw up my arm almost right after he ate it he wiggled his new stump where it was rapidly regrowing i dont think were compatible for it i asked but we could eat it right lisa laughed and took a spoonful of tailings we can eat anything were the top of the food chain weird how it cant eat us youve probably got more mercury and lead running through your blood than any preweeviltech animal ever could have had thats bad used to be poison weird jaak said i think i might have broken it when i put it in the cage he studied it seriously its not moving like it was before and i heard something snap when i stuffed it in so jaak shrugged i dont think its healing the dog did look kind of beat up it just lay there its sides going up and down like a bellows its eyes were halfopen but didnt seem to be focused on any of us when jaak made a sudden movement it twitched for a second but it didnt get up it didnt even growl jaak said i never thought an animal could be so fragile youre fragile too thats not such a big surprise yeah but i only broke a couple bones on it and now look at it it just lies there and pants lisa frowned thoughtfully it doesnt heal she climbed awkwardly to her feet and went to peer into the cage her voice was excited it really is a dog just like we used to be it could take weeks for it to heal one broken bone and its done for she reached a razored hand into the cage and sliced a thin wound into its shank blood oozed out and kept oozing it took minutes for it to begin clotting the dog lay still and panted clearly wasted she laughed its hard to believe we ever lived long enough to evolve out of that if you chop off its legs they wont regrow she cocked her head fascinated its as delicate as rock you break it and it never comes back together she reached out to stroke the matted fur of the animal its as easy to kill as the hunter the comm buzzed jaak went to answer lisa and i stared at the dog our own little window into prehistory jaak came back into the room bunbaums flying out a biologist to take a look at it you mean a bioengineer i corrected him nope biologist bunbaum said they study animals lisa sat down i checked her blades to see if shed knocked anything loose theres a deadend job i guess they grow them out of dna study what they do behavior shit like that who hires them jaak shrugged pau foundation has three of them on staff origin of life guys thats whos sending out this one mushisomething didnt get his name origin of life sure you know what makes us tick what makes us alive stuff like that i poured a handful of tailings mud into lisas mouth she gobbled it gratefully mud makes us tick i said jaak nodded at the dog it doesnt make that dog tick we all looked at the dog its hard to tell what makes it tick lin musharraf was a short guy with black hair and a hooked nose that dominated his face he had carved his skin with swirling patterns of glow implants so he stood out as cobalt spirals in the darkness as he jumped down from his chartered hev the centaurs went wild about the unauthorized visitor and corralled him right up against his ship they were all over him and his dna kit sniffing him running their scanners over his case pointing their s into his glowing face and snarling at him i let him sweat for a minute before calling them away the centaurs backed off swearing and circling but didnt slag him musharraf looked shaken i couldnt blame him theyre scary monsters bigger and faster than a man their behavior patches make them vicious their sentience upgrades give them the intelligence to operate military equipment and their basic fightflight response is so impaired that they only know how to attack when theyre threatened ive seen a halfslagged centaur tear a man to pieces barehanded and then join an assault on enemy ridge fortifications dragging its whole melted carcass forward with just its arms theyre great critters to have at your back when the slag starts flying i guided musharraf out of the scrum he had a whole pack of memory addendums blinking off the back of his skull a fat pipe of data retrieval channeled direct to the brain and no smash protection the centaurs could have shut him down with one hard tap to the back of the head his cortex might have grown back but he wouldnt have been the same looking at those blinking triple fins of intelligence draping down the back of his head you could tell he was a typical lab rat all brains no survival instincts i wouldnt have stuck memadds into my head even for a triple bonus youve got a dog musharraf asked when we were out of reach of the centaurs we think so i led him down into the bunker past our weapons racks and weight rooms to the common room where wed stored the dog the dog looked up at us as we came in the most movement it had made since jaak put it in the cage musharraf stopped short and stared remarkable he knelt in front of the animals cage and unlocked the door he held out a handful of pellets the dog dragged itself upright musharraf backed away giving it room and the dog followed stiff and wary snuffling after the pellets it buried its muzzle in his brown hand snorting and gobbling at the pellets musharraf looked up and you found it in your tailings pits thats right remarkable the dog finished the pellets and snuffled his palm for more musharraf laughed and stood no more for you not right now he opened his dna kit pulled out a sampler needle and stuck the dog the samplers chamber filled with blood lisa watched you talk to it musharraf shrugged its a habit but its not sentient well no but it likes to hear voices the chamber finished filling he withdrew the needle disconnected the collection chamber and fitted it into the kit the analysis software blinked alive and the blood disappeared into the heart of the kit with a soft vacuum hiss how do you know musharraf shrugged its a dog dogs are that way we all frowned musharraf started running tests on the blood humming tunelessly to himself as he worked his dna kit peeped and squawked lisa watched him run his tests clearly pissed off that sesco had sent out a lab rat to retest what she had already done it was easy to understand her irritation a centaur could have run those dna tests im astounded that you found a dog in your pits musharraf muttered lisa said we were going to slag it but bunbaum wouldnt let us musharraf eyed her how restrained of you lisa shrugged orders still im sure your thermal surge weapon presented a powerful temptation how good of you not to slag a starving animal lisa frowned suspiciously i started to worry that she might take musharraf apart she was crazy enough without people talking down to her the memory addendums on the back of his head were an awfully tempting target one slap down goes the lab rat i wondered if we sank him in a catchment lake if anyone would notice him missing a biologist for christs sake musharraf turned back to his dna kit apparently unaware of his hazard did you know that in the past people believed that we should have compassion for all things on earth not just for ourselves but for all living things so i would hope you will have compassion for one foolish scientist and not dismember me today lisa laughed i relaxed encouraged musharraf said it truly is remarkable that you found such a specimen amongst your mining operations i havent heard of a living specimen in ten or fifteen years i saw one in a zoo once jaak said yes well a zoo is the only place for them and laboratories of course they still provide useful genetic data he was studying the results of the tests nodding to himself as information scrolled across the kits screen jaak grinned who needs animals if you can eat stone musharraf began packing up his dna kit weeviltech precisely we transcended the animal kingdom he latched his kit closed and nodded to us all well its been quite enlightening thank you for letting me see your specimen youre not going to take it with you musharraf paused surprised oh no i dont think so its not a dog then oh no its quite certainly a real dog but what on earth would i do with it he held up a vial of blood we have the dna a live one is hardly worth keeping around very expensive to maintain you know manufacturing a basic organisms food is quite complex clean rooms air filters special lights recreating the web of life isnt easy far more simple to release oneself from it completely than to attempt to recreate it he glanced at the dog unfortunately our furry friend over there would never survive weeviltech the worms would eat him as quickly as they eat everything else no you would have to manufacture the animal from scratch and really what would be the point of that a biojob without hands he laughed and headed for his hev we all looked at each other i jogged after the doctor and caught up with him at the hatch to the tarmac he had paused on the verge of opening it your centaurs know me now he asked yeah youre fine good he dilated the hatch and strode out into the cold i trailed after him wait what are we supposed to do with it the dog the doctor climbed into the hev and began strapping in wind whipped around us carrying stinging grit from the tailings piles turn it back to your pits or you could eat it i suppose i understand that it was a real delicacy there are recipes for cooking animals they take time but they can give quite extraordinary results musharrafs pilot started cycling up his turbofans are you kidding musharraf shrugged and shouted over the increasing scream of the engines you should try it just another part of our heritage thats atrophied since weeviltech he yanked down the flight cocoons door sealing himself inside the turbofans cycled higher and the pilot motioned me back from their wash as the hev slowly lifted into the air lisa and jaak couldnt agree on what we should do with the dog we had protocols for working out conflict as a tribe of killers we needed them normally consensus worked for us but every once in a while we just got tangled up and stuck to our positions and after that not much could get done without someone getting slaughtered lisa and jaak dug in and after a couple days of wrangling with lisa threatening to cook the thing in the middle of the night while jaak wasnt watching and jaak threatening to cook her if she did we finally went with a majority vote i got to be the tiebreaker i say we eat it lisa said we were sitting in the monitoring room watching satellite shots of the tailings mountains and the infrared blobs of the mining bots while they ripped around in the earth in one corner the object of our discussion lay in its cage dragged there by jaak in an attempt to sway the result he spun his observation chair turning his attention away from the theater maps i think we should keep it its cool oldtimey you know i mean who the hell do you know who has a real dog who the hell wants the hassle lisa responded i say we try real meat she cut a line in her forearm with her razors she ran her finger along the resulting blood beads and tasted them as the wound sealed they both looked at me i looked at the ceiling are you sure you cant decide this without me lisa grinned come on chen you decide it was a group find jaak wont pout will you jaak gave her a dirty look i looked at jaak i dont want its food costs to come out of group bonuses we agreed wed use part of it for the new immersive response im sick of the old one jaak shrugged fine with me i can pay for it out of my own i just wont get any more tats i leaned back in my chair surprised then looked at lisa well if jaak wants to pay for it i think we should keep it lisa stared at me incredulous but we could cook it i glanced at the dog where it lay panting in its cage its like having a zoo of our own i kind of like it musharraf and the pau foundation hooked us up with a supply of food pellets for the dog and jaak looked up an old database on how to splint its busted bones he bought water filtration so that it could drink i thought id made a good decision putting the costs on jaak but i didnt really foresee the complications that came with having an unmodified organism in the bunker the thing shit all over the floor and sometimes it wouldnt eat and it would get sick for no reason and it was slow to heal so we all ended up playing nursemaid to the thing while it lay in its cage i kept expecting lisa to break its neck in the middle of the night but even though she grumbled she didnt assassinate it jaak tried to act like musharraf he talked to the dog he logged onto the libraries and read all about oldtime dogs how they ran in packs how people used to breed them we tried to figure out what kind of dog it was but we couldnt narrow it down much and then jaak discovered that all the dogs could interbreed so all you could do was guess that it was some kind of big sheep dog with maybe a head from a rottweiler along with maybe some other kind of dog like a wolf or coyote or something jaak thought it had coyote in it because they were supposed to have been big adapters and whatever our dog was it must have been a big adapter to hang out in the tailings pits it didnt have the boosters we had and it had still lived in the rock acids even lisa was impressed by that i was carpet bombing antarctic recessionists swooping low driving the suckers further and further along the ice floe if i got lucky id drive the whole village out onto a vestigial shelf and sink them all before they knew what was happening i dove again strafing and then spinning away from their return slag it was fun but mostly just a way to kill time between real bombing runs the new ir was supposed to be as good as the arcades full immersion and feedback and portable to boot people got so lost they had to take intravenous feedings or they withered away while they were inside i was about to sink a whole load of refugees when jaak shouted get out here youve got to see this i stripped off my goggles and ran for the monitoring room adrenaline amping up when i got there jaak was just standing in the center of the room with the dog grinning lisa came tearing in a second later what what is it her eyes scanned the theater maps ready for bloodshed jaak grinned look at this he turned to the dog and held out his hand shake the dog sat back on its haunches and gravely offered him its paw jaak grinned and shook the paw then tossed it a food pellet he turned to us and bowed lisa frowned do it again jaak shrugged and went through the performance a second time it thinks she asked jaak shrugged got me you can get it to do things the libraries are full of stuff on them theyre trainable not like a centaur or anything but you can make them do little tricks and if theyre certain breeds they can learn special stuff too like what some of them were trained to attack or to find explosives lisa looked impressed like nukes and stuff jaak shrugged i guess can i try i asked jaak nodded go for it i went over to the dog and stuck out my hand shake it stuck out its paw my hackles went up it was like sending signals to aliens i mean you expect a biojob or a robot to do what you want it to centaur go get blown up find the opforce call reinforcements the hev was like that too it would do anything but it was designed feed it jaak said handing me a food pellet you have to feed it when it does it right i held out the food pellet the dogs long pink tongue swabbed my palm i held out my hand again shake i said it held out its paw we shook hands its amber eyes stared up at me solemn thats some weird shit lisa said i shivered nodding and backed away the dog watched me go that night in my bunk i lay awake reading id turned out the lights and only the books surface glowed illuminating the bunkroom in a soft green aura some of lisas art buys glimmered dimly from the walls a bronze hanging of a phoenix breaking into flight stylized flames glowing around it a japanese woodblock print of mount fuji and another of a village weighed down under thick snows a photo of the three of us in siberia after the peninsula campaign grinning and alive amongst the slag lisa came into the room her razors glinted in my books dim light flashes of green sparks that outlined her limbs as she moved what are you reading she stripped and squeezed into bed with me i held up the book and read out loud cut me i wont bleed gas me i wont breathe stab me shoot me slash me smash me i have swallowed science i am god alone i closed the book and its glow died in the darkness lisa rustled under the covers my eyes adjusted she was staring at me dead man right because of the dog i said dark reading she touched my shoulder her hand warm the blades embedded biting lightly into my skin we used to be like that dog i said pathetic scary we were quiet for a little while finally i asked do you ever wonder what would happen to us if we didnt have our science if we didnt have our big brains and our weeviltech and our cellstims and and everything that makes our life good she laughed no she rubbed my stomach i like all those little worms that live in your belly she started to tickle me wormy squirmy in your belly wormy squirmy feeds you nelly microweevils eat the bad and give you something good instead i fought her off laughing thats no yearly third grade basic biologic mrs alvarez she was really big on weeviltech she tried to tickle me again but i fought her off yeah well yearly only wrote about immortality he wouldnt take it lisa gave up on the tickling and flopped down beside me again blah blah blah he wouldnt take any gene modifications no ccell inhibitors he was dying of cancer and he wouldnt take the drugs that would have saved him our last mortal poet cry me a river so what you ever think about why he wouldnt yeah he wanted to be famous suicides good for attention seriously though he thought being human meant having animals the whole web of life thing ive been reading about him its weird shit he didnt want to live without them mrs alvarez hated him she had some rhymes about him too anyway what were we supposed to do work out weeviltech and dna patches for every stupid species do you know what that would have cost she nuzzled close to me if you want animals around you go to a zoo or get some building blocks and make something if it makes you happy something with hands for gods sake not like that dog she stared at the underside of the bunk above id cook that dog in a second i shook my head i dont know that dogs different from a biojob it looks at us and theres something there and its not us i mean take any biojob out there and its basically us poured into another shape but not that dog i trailed off thinking lisa laughed it shook hands with you chen you dont worry about a centaur when it salutes she climbed on top of me forget the dog concentrate on something that matters her smile and her razor blades glinted in the dimness i woke up to something licking my face at first i thought it was lisa but shed climbed into her own bunk i opened my eyes and found the dog it was a funny thing to have this animal licking me like it wanted to talk or say hello or something it licked me again and i thought that it had come a long way from when it had tried to take off jaaks arm it put its paws up on my bed and then in a single heavy movement it was up on the bunk with me its bulk curled against me it slept there all night it was weird having something other than lisa lying next to me but it was warm and there was something friendly about it i couldnt help smiling as i drifted back to sleep we flew to hawaii for a swimming vacation and we brought the dog with us it was good to get out of the northern cold and into the gentle pacific good to stand on the beach and look out to a limitless horizon good to walk along the beach holding hands while black waves crashed on the sand lisa was a good swimmer she flashed through the oceans metallic sheen like an eel out of history and when she surfaced her naked body glistened with hundreds of iridescent petroleum jewels when the sun started to set jaak lit the ocean on fire with his we all sat and watched as the suns great red ball sank through veils of smoke its light shading deeper crimson with every minute waves rushed flaming onto the beach jaak got out his harmonica and played while lisa and i made love on the sand wed intended to amputate her for the weekend to let her try what she had done to me the vacation before it was a new thing in la an experiment in vulnerability she was beautiful lying there on the beach slick and excited with all of our play in the water i licked oil opals off her skin as i sliced off her limbs leaving her more dependent than a baby jaak played his harmonica and watched the sun set and watched as i rendered lisa down to her core after our sex we lay on the sand the last of the sun was dropping below the water its rays glinted redly across the smoldering waves the sky thick with particulates and smoke shaded darker lisa sighed contentedly we should vacation here more often i tugged on a length of barbedwire buried in the sand it tore free and i wrapped it around my upper arm a tight band that bit into my skin i showed it to lisa i used to do this all the time when i was a kid i smiled i thought i was so badass lisa smiled you are thanks to science i glanced over at the dog it was lying on the sand a short distance away it seemed sullen and unsure in its new environment torn away from the safety of the acid pits and tailings mountains of its homeland jaak sat beside the dog and played its ears twitched to the music he was a good player the mournful sound of the harmonica carried easily over the beach to where we lay lisa turned her head trying to see the dog roll me i did what she asked already her limbs were regrowing small stumps which would build into larger limbs by morning she would be whole and ravenous she studied the dog this is as close as ill ever get to it she said sorry its vulnerable to everything it cant swim in the ocean it cant eat anything we have to fly its food to it we have to scrub its water dead end of an evolutionary chain without science wed be as vulnerable as it she looked up at me as vulnerable as i am now she grinned this is as close to death as ive ever been at least not in combat wild isnt it for a day i liked it better when i did it to you im already starving i fed her a handful of oily sand and watched the dog standing uncertainly on the beach sniffing suspiciously at some rusting scrap iron that stuck out of the beach like a giant memory fin it pawed up a chunk of red plastic rubbed shiny by the ocean and chewed on it briefly before dropping it it started licking around its mouth i wondered if it had poisoned itself again it sure can make you think i muttered i fed lisa another handful of sand if someone came from the past to meet us here and now what do you think theyd say about us would they even call us human lisa looked at me seriously no theyd call us gods jaak got up and wandered into the surf standing kneedeep in the black smoldering waters the dog driven by some unknown instinct followed him gingerly picking its way across the sand and rubble the dog got tangled in a cluster of wire our last day on the beach really ripped the hell out of it slashes through its fur broken legs practically strangled it had gnawed one of its own paws half off trying to get free by the time we found it it was a bloody mess of ragged fur and exposed meat lisa stared down at the dog christ jaak you were supposed to be watching it i went swimming you cant keep an eye on the thing all the time its going to take forever to fix this she fumed we should warm up the hunter i said itll be easier to work on it back home lisa and i knelt down to start cutting the dog free it whimpered and its tail wagged feebly as we started to work jaak was silent lisa slapped him on his leg come on jaak get down here itll bleed out if you dont hurry up you know how fragile it is jaak said i think we should eat it lisa glanced up surprised you do he shrugged sure i looked up from where i was tearing away tangled wires from around the dogs torso i thought you wanted it to be your pet like in the zoo jaak shook his head those food pellets are expensive im spending half my salary on food and water filtration and now this bullshit he waved his hand at the tangled dog you have to watch the sucker all the time its not worth it but still its your friend it shook hands with you jaak laughed youre my friend he looked down at the dog his face wrinkled with thought its itsan animal even though we had all idly discussed what it would be like to eat the dog it was a surprise to hear him so determined to kill it maybe you should sleep on it i said we can get it back to the bunker fix it up and then you can decide when you arent so pissed off about it no he pulled out his harmonica and played a few notes a quick jazzy scale he took the harmonica out of his mouth if you want to put up the money for his feed ill keep it i guess but otherwise he shrugged i dont think you should cook it you dont lisa glanced at me we could roast it right here on the beach i looked down at the dog a mass of panting trusting animal i still dont think we should do it jaak looked at me seriously you want to pay for the feed i sighed im saving for the new immersive response yeah well ive got things i want to buy too you know he flexed his muscles showing off his tattoos i mean what the fuck good does it do it makes you smile immersive response makes you smile and you dont have to clean up after its crap come on chen admit it you dont want to take care of it either its a pain in the ass we all looked at each other then down at the dog lisa roasted the dog on a spit over burning plastics and petroleum skimmed from the ocean it tasted okay but in the end it was hard to understand the big deal ive eaten slagged centaur that tasted better afterward we walked along the shoreline opalescent waves crashed and roared up the sand leaving jewel slicks as they receded and the sun sank red in the distance without the dog we could really enjoy the beach we didnt have to worry about whether it was going to step in acid or tangle in barbwire halfburied in the sand or eat something that would keep it up vomiting half the night still i remember when the dog licked my face and hauled its shaggy bulk onto my bed and i remember its warm breathing beside me and sometimes i miss it bread and bombs by m rickert mary rickerts stories have been appearing regularly in the magazine of fantasy science fiction for several years starting in with her first publication the girl who ate butterflies her work has also appeared in sci fiction and the anthology feeling very strange and has been nominated for the nebula award her collection map of dreams won the william l crawford award for best first booklength work of fantasy rickert says that she wrote this story in response to news reports concerning food packages being dropped in afghanistan which were wrapped in the same color packaging as bombs which detonated when picked up by hungry children many authors have been moved to write stories this is rickerts the strange children of the manmensvitzender family did not go to school so we only knew they had moved into the old house on the hill because bobby had watched them move in with their strange assortment of rocking chairs and goats we couldnt imagine how anyone would live there where the windows were all broken and the yard was thorny with brambles for a while we expected to see the children two daughters who bobby said had hair like smoke and eyes like black olives at school but they never came we were in the fourth grade that age that seems like waking from a long slumber into the world the adults imposed streets we werent allowed to cross things we werent allowed to say and crossing them and saying them the mysterious manmensvitzender children were just another in a series of revelations that year including the much more exciting and sometimes disturbing evolution of our bodies our parents without exception had raised us with this subject so thoroughly explored that lisa bitten knew how to say vagina before she knew her address and ralph linster delivered his little brother petey when his mother went into labor one night when it suddenly started snowing before his father could get home but the real significance of this information didnt start to sink in until that year we were waking to the wonders of the world and the body the strange realizations that a friend was cute or stinky or picked her nose or was fat or wore dirty underpants or had eyes that didnt blink when he looked at you real close and all of a sudden you felt like blushing when the crab apple tree blossomed a brilliant pink buzzing with honey bees and our teacher mrs graymoore looked out the window and sighed we passed notes across the rows and made wild plans for the school picnic how we would ambush her with water balloons and throw pies at the principal of course none of this happened only trina needles was disappointed because she really believed it would but she still wore bows in her hair and secretly sucked her thumb and was nothing but a big baby released into summer we ran home or biked home shouting for joy and escape and then began doing everything we could think of all those things wed imagined doing while mrs graymoore sighed at the crab apple tree which had already lost its brilliance and once again looked ordinary we threw balls rode bikes rolled skateboards down the driveway picked flowers fought made up and it was still hours before dinner we watched tv and didnt think about being bored but after a while we hung upside down and watched it that way or switched the channels back and forth or found reasons to fight with anyone in the house i was alone however and could not indulge in this thats when we heard the strange noise of goats and bells in the mothy gray of tv rooms we pulled back the drapes and peered out windows into a yellowed sunlight the two manmensvitzender girls in bright clothes the color of a circus and gauzy scarves one purple the other red glittering with sequins came rolling down the street in a wooden wagon pulled by two goats with bells around their necks that is how the trouble began the news accounts never mention any of this the flame of crab apple blossoms our innocence the sound of bells instead they focus on the unhappy results they say we were wild uncared for strange they say we were dangerous as if life was amber and we were formed and suspended in that form not evolved into that ungainly shape of horror and evolved out of it as we are into a teacher a dancer a welder a lawyer several soldiers two doctors and me a writer everybody promises during times like those days immediately following the tragedy that lives have been ruined futures shattered but only trina needles fell for that and eventually committed suicide the rest of us suffered various forms of censure and then went on with our lives yes it is true with a dark past but you may be surprised to learn that can be lived with the hand that holds the pen or chalk or the stethoscope or the gun or lovers skin is so different from the hand that lit the match and so incapable of such an act that it is not even a matter of forgiveness or healing its strange to look back and believe that any of that was me or us are you who you were then eleven years old and watching the dust motes spin lazily down a beam of sunlight that ruins the picture on the tv and there is a sound of bells and goats and a laugh so pure we all come running to watch the girls in their bright colored scarves sitting in the goat cart which stops in a stutter of goathoofed steps and clatter of wooden wheels when we surround it to observe those dark eyes and pretty faces the younger girl if size is any indication smiling and the other younger than us but at least eight or nine with huge tears rolling down her brown cheeks we stand there for a while staring and then bobby says whats a matter with her the younger girl looks at her sister who seems to be trying to smile in spite of the tears she just cries all the time bobby nods and squints at the girl who continues to cry though she manages to ask where have you kids come from he looks around the group with an areyoukidding kind of look but anyone can tell he likes the weeping girl whose dark eyes and lashes glisten with tears that glitter in the sun its summer vacation trina who has been furtively sucking her thumb says can i have a ride the girls say sure she pushes her way through the little crowd and climbs into the cart the younger girl smiles at her the other seems to try but cries especially loud trina looks like she might start crying too until the younger one says dont worry its just how she is the crying girl shakes the reigns and the little bells ring and the goats and cart go clattering down the hill we listen to trinas shrill scream but we know shes all right when they come back we take turns until our parents call us home with whistles and shouts and screen doors slam we go home for dinner and the girls head home themselves the one still crying the other singing to the accompaniment of bells i see you were playing with the refugees my mother says you be careful around those girls i dont want you going to their house i didnt go to their house we just played with the goats and the wagon well all right then but stay away from there what are they like one laughs a lot the other cries all the time dont eat anything they offer you why not just dont cant you just explain to me why not i dont have to explain to you young lady im your mother we didnt see the girls the next day or the day after that on the third day bobby who had begun to carry a comb in his back pocket and part his hair on the side said well hell lets just go there he started up the hill but none of us followed when he came back that evening we rushed him for information about his visit shouting questions at him like reporters did you eat anything i asked my mother says not to eat anything there he turned and fixed me with such a look that for a moment i forgot he was my age just a kid like me in spite of the new way he was combing his hair and the steady gaze of his blue eyes your mother is prejudiced he said he turned his back to me and reached into his pocket pulling out a fist that he opened to reveal a handful of small brightly wrapped candies trina reached her pudgy fingers into bobbys palm and plucked out one bright orange one this was followed by a flurry of hands until there was only bobbys empty palm parents started calling kids home my mother stood in the doorway but she was too far away to see what we were doing candy wrappers floated down the sidewalk in swirls of blue green red yellow and orange my mother and i usually ate separately when i was at my dads we ate together in front of the tv which she said was barbaric was he drinking shed ask mother was convinced my father was an alcoholic and thought i did not remember those years when he had to leave work early because id called and told him how she was asleep on the couch still in her pajamas the coffee table littered with cans and bottles which he threw in the trash with a grim expression and few words my mother stands leaning against the counter and watches me did you play with those girls today no bobby did though well that figures nobody really watches out for that boy i remember when his daddy was in high school with me did i ever tell you that uhhuh he was a handsome man bobbys a nice looking boy too but you stay away from him i think you play with him too much i hardly play with him at all he plays with those girls all day did he say anything about them he said some people are prejudiced oh he did did he whered he get such an idea anyway must be his grandpa you listen to me theres nobody even talks that way anymore except for a few rabble rousers and theres a reason for that people are dead because of that family you just remember that many many people died because of them you mean bobbys or the girls well both actually but most especially those girls he didnt eat anything did he i looked out the window pretending a new interest in our backyard then at her with a little start as though suddenly awoken what uh no she stared at me with squinted eyes i pretended to be unconcerned she tapped her red fingernails against the kitchen counter you listen to me she said in a sharp voice theres a war going on i rolled my eyes you dont even remember do you well how could you you were just a toddler but there was a time when this country didnt know war why people used to fly in airplanes all the time i stopped my fork halfway to my mouth well how stupid was that you dont understand everybody did it it was a way to get from one place to another your grandparents did it a lot and your father and i did too you were on an airplane even you she smiled see you dont know so much missy the world used to be safe and then one day it wasnt and those people she pointed at the kitchen window straight at the millers house but i knew that wasnt who she meant started it theyre just a couple of kids well not them exactly but i mean the country they come from thats why i want you to be careful theres no telling what theyre doing here so little bobby and his radical grandpa can say were all prejudiced but who even talks that way anymore she walked over to the table pulled out a chair and sat down in front of me i want you to understand theres no way to know about evil so just stay away from them promise me evil hard to understand i nodded well all right she pushed back the chair stood up grabbed her pack of cigarettes from the windowsill make sure not to leave any crumbs this is the time of year for ants from the kitchen window i could see my mother sitting on the picnic table a gray plume of smoke spiraling away from her i rinsed my dishes loaded the dishwasher wiped the table and went outside to sit on the front steps and think about the world i never knew the house on top of the hill blazed in the full sun the broken windows had been covered by some sort of plastic that swallowed the light that night one flew over oakgrove i woke up and put my helmet on my mother was screaming in her room too frightened to help my hands didnt shake the way hers did and i didnt lie in my bed screaming i put the helmet on and listened to it fly past not us not our town not tonight i fell asleep with the helmet on and in the morning woke up with the marks of it dented on my cheeks now when summer approaches i count the weeks when the apple trees and lilacs are in blossom the tulips and daffodils in bloom before they droop with summers heat and i think how it is so much like that period of our innocence that waking into the world with all its incandescence before being subdued by its shadows into what we became you should have known the world then my father says when i visit him at the nursing home weve heard it so much it doesnt mean anything the cakes the money the endless assortment of everything we used to have six different kinds of cereal at one time he raises his finger instructively coated in sugar can you imagine it used to go stale we threw it out and the planes the sky used to be filled with them really people traveled that way whole families did it didnt matter if someone moved away hell you just got on a plane to see them whenever he speaks like this whenever any of them do they sound bewildered amazed he shakes his head he sighs we were so happy i cannot hear about those times without thinking of spring flowers childrens laughter the sound of bells and clatter of goats smoke bobby sits in the cart holding the reigns a pretty darkskinned girl on either side of him they ride up and down the street all morning laughing and crying their gauzy scarves blowing behind them like rainbows the flags droop listlessly from flagpoles and porches butterflies flit in and out of gardens the whitehall twins play in their backyard and the squeaky sound of their unoiled swings echoes through the neighborhood mrs renquat has taken the day off to take several kids to the park i am not invited probably because i hate becky renquat and told her so several times during the school year pulling her hair which was a stream of white gold so bright i could not resist it it is ralph patersons birthday and most of the little kids are spending the day with him and his dad at the snowmans cave amusement park where they get to do all the things kids used to do when snow was still safe like sledding and building snowmen lina breedsore and carol minstreet went to the mall with their babysitter who has a boyfriend who works at the movie theater and can sneak them in to watch movies all day long the town is empty except for the baby whitehall twins trina needles who is sucking her thumb and reading a book on her porch swing and bobby going up and down the street with the manmensvitzender girls and their goats i sit on my porch picking at the scabs on my knees but bobby speaks only to them in a voice so low i cant hear what he says finally i stand up and block their way the goats and cart stutter to a stop the bells still jingling as bobby says whats up weyers he has eyes so blue i recently discovered i cannot look into them for more than thirty seconds as though they burn me instead i look at the girls who are both smiling even the one who is crying whats your problem i say her dark eyes widen increasing the pool of milky white around them she looks at bobby the sequins of her scarf catch the sun jesus christ weyers what are you talking about i just want a know i say still looking at her what it is with all this crying all the time i mean like is it a disease or what oh for christs sake the goats heads rear and the bells jingle bobby pulls on the reigns the goats step back with clomps and the rattle of wheels but i continue to block their path whats your problem its a perfectly reasonable question i shout at his shadow against the bright sun i just wanta know what her problem is its none of your business he shouts and at the same time the smaller girl speaks what i say to her its the war and all the suffering bobby holds the goats steady the other girl holds onto his arm she smiles at me but continues to weep well so did something happen to her its just how she is she always cries thats stupid oh for christs sake weyers you cant cry all the time thats no way to live bobby steers the goats and cart around me the younger girl turns and stares at me until at some distance she waves but i turn away without waving back before it was abandoned and then occupied by the manmensvitzenders the big house on the hill had been owned by the richters oh sure they were rich my father says when i tell him i am researching a book but you know we all were you should have seen the cakes and the catalogs we used to get these catalogs in the mail and you could buy anything that way theyd mail it to you even cake we used to get this catalog what was it called henry and danny something like that two guys names anyhow when we were young it was just fruit but then when the whole country was rich you could order spongecake with buttercream or they had these towers of packages theyd send you filled with candy and nuts and cookies and chocolate and oh my god right in the mail you were telling me about the richters terrible thing what happened to them the whole family it was the snow right your brother jaime thats when we lost him we dont have to talk about that everything changed after that you know thats what got your mother started most folks just lost one some not even but you know those richters that big house on the hill and when it snowed they all went sledding the world was different then i cant imagine well neither could we nobody could of guessed it and believe me we were guessing everyone tried to figure what they would do next but snow i mean how evil is that anyway how many oh thousands thousands no i mean how many richters all six of them first the children and then the parents wasnt it unusual for adults to get infected well not that many of us played in the snow the way they did so you must have sensed it or something what no we were just so busy then very busy i wish i could remember but i cant what we were so busy with he rubs his eyes and stares out the window it wasnt your fault i want you to know i understand that pop i mean you kids thats just the world we gave you so full of evil you didnt even know the difference we knew pop you still dont know what do you think of when you think of snow i think of death well there you have it before that happened it meant joy peace and joy i cant imagine well thats my point are you feeling all right she dishes out the macaroni puts the bowl in front of me and stands leaning against the counter to watch me eat i shrug she places a cold palm on my forehead steps back and frowns you didnt eat anything from those girls did you i shake my head she is just about to speak when i say but the other kids did who when she leans so close that i can see the lines of makeup sharp against her skin bobby some of the other kids they ate candy her hand comes palm down hard against the table the macaroni bowl jumps and the silverware some milk spills didnt i tell you she shouts bobby plays with them all the time now she squints at me shakes her head then snaps her jaw with grim resolve when when did they eat this candy i dont know days ago nothing happened they said it was good her mouth opens and closes like a fish she turns on her heels and grabs the phone as she leaves the kitchen the door slams i can see her through the window pacing the backyard her arms gesturing wildly my mother organized the town meeting and everybody came dressed up like it was church the only people who werent there were the manmensvitzenders for obvious reasons most people brought their kids even the babies who sucked thumbs or blanket corners i was there and so was bobby with his grandpa who chewed the stem of a cold pipe and kept leaning over and whispering to his grandson during the proceedings which quickly became heated though there wasnt much argument the heat being fueled by just the general excitement of it my mother especially in her roses dress her lips painted a bright red so that even i came to some understanding that she had a certain beauty though i was too young to understand what about that beauty wasnt entirely pleasing we have to remember that we are all soldiers in this war she said to much applause mr smyths suggested a sort of house arrest but my mother pointed out that would entail someone from town bringing groceries to them everybody knows these people are starving whos going to pay for all this bread anyway she said why should we have to pay for it mrs mathers said something about justice mr hallensway said no one is innocent anymore my mother who stood at the front of the room leaning slightly against the village board table said then its decided mrs foley who had just moved to town from the recently destroyed chesterville stood up in that way she had of sort of crouching into her shoulders with those eyes that looked around nervously so that some of us had secretly taken to calling her bird woman and with a shaky voice so soft everyone had to lean forward to hear said are any of the children actually sick the adults looked at each other and each others children i could tell that my mother was disappointed that no one reported any symptoms the discussion turned to the bright colored candies when bobby without standing or raising his hand said in a loud voice is that what this is about do you mean these he half laid back in his chair to wiggle his hand into his pocket and pulled out a handful of them there was a general murmur my mother grabbed the edge of the table bobbys grandfather grinning around his dry pipe plucked one of the candies from bobbys palm unwrapped it and popped it into his mouth mr galvin wright had to use his gavel to hush the noise my mother stood up straight and said fine thing risking your own life like that just to make a point well youre right about making a point maylene he said looking right at my mother and shaking his head as if they were having a private discussion but this is candy i keep around the house to get me out of the habit of smoking i order it through the government issue catalog its perfectly safe i never said it was from them said bobby who looked first at my mother and then searched the room until he found my face but i pretended not to notice when we left my mother took me by the hand her red fingernails digging into my wrist dont talk she said just dont say another word she sent me to my room and i fell asleep with my clothes on still formulating my apology the next morning when i hear the bells i grab a loaf of bread and wait on the porch until they come back up the hill then i stand in their path now what dyou want bobby says i offer the loaf like a tiny baby being held up to god in church the weeping girl cries louder her sister clutches bobbys arm what dyou think youre doing he shouts its a present what kind of stupid present is that put it away jesus christ would you put it down my arms drop to my sides the loaf dangles in its bag from my hand both girls are crying i just was trying to be nice i say my voice wavering like the bird womans god dont you know anything bobby says theyre afraid of our food dont you even know that why cause of the bombs you idiot why dont you think once in a while i dont know what youre talking about the goats rattle their bells and the cart shifts back and forth the bombs dont you even read your history books in the beginning of the war we sent them food packages all wrapped up the same color as these bombs that would go off when someone touched them we did that well our parents did he shakes his head and pulls the reigns the cart rattles past both girls pressed against him as if i am dangerous oh we were so happy my father says rocking into the memory we were like children you know so innocent we didnt even know know what pop that we had enough enough what oh everything we had enough everything is that a plane he looks at me with watery blue eyes here let me help you put your helmet on he slaps at it bruising his fragile hands quit it dad stop he fumbles with arthritic fingers to unbuckle the strap but finds he cannot he weeps into his spotted hands it drones past now that i look back on how we were that summer before the tragedy i get a glimmer of what my fathers been trying to say all along it isnt really about the cakes and the mail order catalogs or the air travel they used to take even though he uses stuff to describe it thats not what he means once there was a different emotion people used to have a way of feeling and being in the world that is gone destroyed so thoroughly we inherited only its absence sometimes i tell my husband i wonder if my happiness is really happiness of course its really happiness he says what else would it be we were under attack is how it felt the manmensvitzenders with their tears and fear of bread their strange clothes and stinky goats were children like us and we could not get the town meeting out of our heads what the adults had considered doing we climbed trees chased balls came home when called brushed our teeth when told finished our milk but we had lost that feeling wed had before it is true we didnt understand what had been taken from us but we knew what we had been given and who had done the giving we didnt call a meeting the way they did ours just happened on a day so hot we sat in trina needless playhouse fanning ourselves with our hands and complaining about the weather like the grownups we mentioned house arrest but that seemed impossible to enforce we discussed things like water balloons tping someone mentioned dog shit in brown paper bags set on fire i think thats when the discussion turned the way it did you may ask who locked the door who made the stick piles who lit the matches we all did and if i am to find solace twentyfive years after i destroyed all ability to feel that my happiness or anyones really exists i find it in this it was all of us maybe there will be no more town meetings maybe this plan is like the ones weve made before but a town meeting is called the grownups assemble to discuss how we will not be ruled by evil and also the possibility of widening main street nobody notices when we children sneak out we had to leave behind the babies sucking thumbs or blanket corners and not really part of our plan for redemption we were children it wasnt well thought out when the police came we were not careening in some wild imitation of barbaric dance or having seizures as has been reported i can still see bobby his hair damp against his forehead the bright red of his cheeks as he danced beneath the white flakes that fell from a sky we never trusted trina spinning in circles her arms stretched wide and the manmensvitzender girls with their goats and cart piled high with rocking chairs riding away from us the jingle bells ringing just like in the old song once again the world was safe and beautiful except by the town hall where the large white flakes rose like ghosts and the flames ate the sky like a hungry monster who could never get enough how we got in town and out again by jonathan lethem jonathan lethem is the bestselling author of fortress of solitude motherless brooklyn and several other novels his most recent being you dont love me yet his first novel gun with occasional music won the william l crawford award the locus award and was a finalist for the nebula award lethem has published more than short stories in a diverse range of markets from the new yorker and mcsweeneys to fsf and asimovs his first collection the wall of the sky the wall of the eye won the world fantasy award in he was presented with the macarthur foundation genius grant for his contributions to literature how we got in town and out again is one of a sequence of stories by lethem railing against virtual reality technologies in an interview in science fiction studies lethem said i didnt set out to write a series of stories examining my own resistance to that technology but living in san francisco during the years of an intense kind of utopian ideological boom in virtual reality and computer technologies i felt an instinctive need to represent my own skepticism about claims that were being made that seemed to me naïve and so i found these resistance stories coming out of me combine that with lethems research into s dance marathons and youve got this story when we first saw somebody near the mall gloria and i looked around for sticks we were going to rob them if they were few enough the mall was about five miles out of the town we were headed for so nobody would know but when we got closer gloria saw their vans and said they were scapers i didnt know what that was but she told me it was summer two days before this gloria and i had broken out of a pack of people that had food but we couldnt stand their religious chanting anymore we hadnt eaten since then so what do we do i said you let me talk said gloria you think we could get into town with them better than that she said just keep quiet i dropped the piece of pipe id found and we walked in across the parking lot this mall was long past being good for finding food anymore but the scapers were taking out folding chairs from a store and strapping them on top of their vans there were four men and one woman hey said gloria two guys were just lugs and they ignored us and kept lugging the woman was sitting in the front of the van she was smoking a cigarette the other two guys turned this was kromer and fearing but i didnt know their names yet beat it said kromer he was a tall squinty guy with a gold tooth he was kind of worn but the tooth said hed never lost a fight or slept in a flop were busy he said he was being reasonable if you werent in a town you were nowhere why talk to someone you met nowhere but the other guy smiled at gloria he had a thin face and a little mustache who are you he said he didnt look at me i know what you guys do gloria said i was in one before oh said the guy still smiling youre going to need contestants she said shes a fast one this guy said to the other guy im fearing he said to gloria fearing what said gloria just fearing well im just gloria thats fine said fearing this is tommy kromer we run this thing whats your little friends name i can say my own name i said im lewis are you from the lovely town up ahead nope said gloria were headed there getting in exactly how said fearing anyhow said gloria like it was an answer with you now thats assuming something pretty quick or we could go and say how you ripped off the last town and they sent us to warn about you said gloria fast said fearing again grinning and kromer shook his head they didnt look too worried you ought to want me along said gloria im an attraction cant hurt said fearing kromer shrugged and said skinny for an attraction sure im skinny she said thats why me and lewis ought to get something to eat fearing stared at her kromer was back to the van with the other guys or if you cant feed us started gloria hold it sweetheart no more threats we need a meal well eat something when we get in fearing said you and lewis can get a meal if youre both planning to enter sure she said were gonna enterright lewis i knew to say right the town militia came out to meet the vans of course but they seemed to know the scapers were coming and after fearing talked to them for a couple of minutes they opened up the doors and had a quick look then waved us through gloria and i were in the back of a van with a bunch of equipment and one of the lugs named ed kromer drove fearing drove the van with the woman in it the other lug drove the last one alone id never gotten into a town in a van before but id only gotten in two times before this anyway the first time by myself just by creeping in the second because gloria went with a militia guy towns werent so great anyway maybe this would be different we drove a few blocks and a guy flagged fearing down he came up to the window of the van and they talked then went back to his car waving at kromer on his way then we followed him whats that about said gloria gilmartins the advance man said kromer i thought you knew everything gloria didnt talk i said whats an advance man gets us a place and the juice we need said kromer softens the town up gets people excited it was getting dark i was pretty hungry but i didnt say anything gilmartins car led us to this big building shaped like a boathouse only it wasnt near any water kromer said it used to be a bowling alley the lugs started moving stuff and kromer made me help the building was dusty and empty inside and some of the lights didnt work kromer said just to get things inside for now he drove away one of the vans and came back and we unloaded a bunch of little cots that gilmartin the advance man had rented so i had an idea where i was going to be sleeping apart from that it was stuff for the contest computer cables and plastic spacesuits and loads of televisions fearing took gloria and they came back with food fried chicken and potato salad and we all ate i couldnt stop going back for more but nobody said anything then i went to sleep on a cot no one was talking to me gloria wasnt sleeping on a cot i think she was with fearing gilmartin the advance man had really done his work the town was sniffing around first thing in the morning fearing was out talking to them when i woke up registration begins at noon not a minute sooner he was saying beat the lines and stick around well be serving coffee be warned only the fit need applyour doctor will be examining you and hes never been fooled once its darwinian logic people the future is for the strong the meek will have to inherit the here and now inside ed and the other guy were setting up the gear they had about thirty of those wiredup plastic suits stretched out in the middle of the place and so tangled up with cable and little wires that they were like husks of fly bodies in a spider web under each of the suits was a light metal frame sort of like a bicycle with a seat but no wheels but with a headrest too around the web they were setting up the televisions in an arc facing the seats the suits each had a number on the back and the televisions had numbers on top that matched when gloria turned up she didnt say anything to me but she handed me some donuts and coffee this is just the start she said when she saw my eyes get big were in for three squares a day as long as this thing lasts as long as we last anyway we sat and ate outside where we could listen to fearing he went on and on some people were lined up like he said i didnt blame them since fearing was such a talker others listened and just got nervous or excited and went away but i could tell they were coming back later at least to watch when we finished the donuts fearing came over and told us to get on line too we dont have to said gloria yes you do said fearing on line we met lane she said she was twenty like gloria but she looked younger she could have been sixteen like me you ever do this before asked gloria lane shook her head you sure said gloria you ever been out of this town a couple of times said lane when i was a kid id like to now why i broke up with my boyfriend gloria stuck out her lip and said but youre scared to leave town so youre doing this instead lane shrugged i liked her but gloria didnt the doctor turned out to be gilmartin the advance man i dont think he was a real doctor but he listened to my heart nobody ever did that before and it gave me a good feeling registration was a joke though it was for show they asked a lot of questions but they only sent a couple ofwomen and one guy away gloria said for being too old everyone else was okay despite how some of them looked pretty hungry just like me and gloria this was a hungry town later i figured out thats part of why fearing and kromer picked it youd think theyd want to go where the money was but youd be wrong after registration they told us to get lost for the afternoon everything started at eight oclock we walked around downtown but almost all the shops were closed all the good stuff was in the shopping center and you had to show a town id card to get in and me and gloria didnt have those so like gloria always says we killed time since time was what we had the place looked different they had spotlights pointed from on top of the vans and fearing was talking through a microphone there was a banner up over the doors i asked gloria and she said scape athon ed was selling beer out of a cooler and some people were buying even though he must have just bought it right there in town for half the price he was selling at it was a hot night they were selling tickets but they werent letting anybody in yet fearing told us to get inside most of the contestants were there already anne the woman from the van was there acting like any other contestant lane was there too and we waved at each other gilmartin was helping everybody put on the suits you had to get naked but nobody seemed to mind just being contestants made it all right like we were invisible to each other can we be next to each other i said to gloria sure except it doesnt matter she said we wont be able to see each other inside inside where i said the scapes she said youll see gloria got me into my suit it was plastic with wiring everywhere and padding at my knees and wrists and elbows and under my arms and in my crotch i tried on the mask but it was heavy and i saw nobody else was wearing theirs so i kept it off until i had to then gilmartin tried to help gloria but she said she could do it herself so there we were standing around half naked and dripping with cable in the big empty litup bowling alley and then suddenly fearing and his big voice came inside and they let the people in and the lights went down and it all started thirtytwo young souls ready to swim out of this world into the bright shiny future went fearing the question is how far into that future will their bodies take them new worlds are theirs for the takinga cornucopia of scapes to boggle and amaze and gratify the senses these lucky kids will be immersed in an ocean of data overwhelming to their undernourished sensibilitiesweve assembled a really brilliant collection of environments for them to exploreand youll be able to see everything they see on the monitors in front of you but can they make it in the fast lane how long can they ride the wave which of them will prove able to outlast the others and take home the big prizeone thousand dollars thats what were here to find out gilmartin and ed were snapping everybody into their masks and turning all the switches to wire us up and getting us to lie down on the frames it was comfortable on the bicycle seat with your head on the headrest and a belt around your waist you could move your arms and legs like you were swimming the way fearing said i didnt mind putting on the mask now because the audience was making me nervous a lot of them i couldnt see because of the lights but i could tell they were there watching the mask covered my ears and eyes around my chin there was a strip of wire and tape inside it was dark and quiet at first except fearings voice was still coming into the earphones the rules are simple our contestants get a thirtyminute rest period every three hours these kidsll be well fed dont worry about that our doctor will monitor their health youve heard the horror stories but were a class outfit youll see no horrors here the kids earn the quality care we provide one way continuous waking engagement with the data stream were firm on that to sleep is to dieyou can sleep on your own time but not ours one lapse and youre out of the game thems the rules the earphones started to hum i wished i could reach out and hold glorias hand but she was too far away theyll have no help from the floor judges or one another in locating the perceptual riches of cyberspace some will discover the keys that open the doors to a thousand worlds others will bog down in the antechamber to the future anyone caught coaching during rest periods will be disqualifiedno warnings no second chances then fearings voice dropped out and the scapes started i was in a hallway the walls were full of drawers like a big cabinet that went on forever the drawers had writing on them that i ignored first i couldnt move except my head then i figured out how to walk and just did that for a while but i never got anywhere it felt like i was walking in a giant circle up the wall across the ceiling and then back down the other wall so i pulled open a drawer it only looked big enough to hold some pencils or whatever but when i pulled it opened like a door and i went through welcome to intense personals said a voice there were just some colours to look at the door closed behind me you must be eighteen years of age or older to use this service to avoid any charges please exit now i didnt exit because i didnt know how the space with colours was kind of small except it didnt have any edges but it felt small this is the main menu please reach out and make one of the following selections women seeking men men seeking women women seeking women men seeking men or alternatives each of them was a block of words in the air i reached up and touched the first one after each selection touch one to play the recording again two to record a message for this person or three to advance to the next selection you may touch three at any time to advance to the next selection or four to return to the main menu then a woman came into the coloured space with me she was dressed up and wearing lipstick hi my name is kate she said she stared like she was looking through my head at something behind me and poked at her hair while she talked i live in san francisco i work in the financial district as a personnel manager but my real love is the arts currently painting and writing how did you get into san francisco i said just bought a new pair of hiking boots and im hoping to tackle mount tarn this weekend she said ignoring me i never met anyone from there i said looking for a man whos not intimidated by intelligence she went on its important that you like what you do like where you are i also want someone whos confident enough that i can express my vulnerability you should be a good listener i touched three i can read numbers another woman came in just like that this one was as young as gloria but kind of softlooking i continue to ask myself why in the heck im doing this personals thing she said sighing but i know the reasoni want to date im new to the san francisco area i like to go to the theatre but im really openminded i was born and raised in chicago so i think im a little more east coast than west im fasttalking and cynical i guess im getting a little cynical about these ads the sky has yet to part lightning has yet to strike i got rid of her now that i knew how i have my own garden and landscape business someone whos fun not nerdy im tender im sensuous i started to wonder how long ago these women were from i didnt like the way they were making me feel sort of guilty and bullied at the same time i didnt think i could make any of them happy the way they were hoping but i didnt think i was going to get a chance to try anyway it took pretty long for me to get back out into the hallway from then on i paid more attention to how i got into things the next drawer i got into was just about the opposite all space and no people i was driving an airplane over almost the whole world as far as i could tell there was a row of dials and switches under the windows but it didnt mean anything to me first i was in the mountains and i crashed a lot and that was dull because a voice would lecture me before i could start again and i had to wait but then i got to the desert and i kept it up without crashing much i just learned to say no whenever the voice suggested something different like engage target or evasive action i wanted to fly awhile thats all the desert looked good from up there even though id been walking around in deserts too often except that i had to pee i could have done that forever fearings voice broke in though and said it was time for the first rest period still fresh and eager after their first plunge into the wonders of the future fearing was saying to the people in the seats the place was only half full already this world seems drab by comparison yet consider the irony that as their questing minds grow accustomed to these splendors their bodies will begin to rebel gloria showed me how to unsnap the cables so i could walk out of the middle of all that stuff still wearing the suit leaving the mask behind everybody lined up for the bathroom then we went to the big hall in the back where they had the cots but nobody went to sleep or anything i guessed wed all want to next time but right now i was too excited and so was everybody else fearing just kept talking like us taking a break was as much a part of the show as anything else splendors hah said gloria bunch of secondhand cyberjunk i was in a plane i started shut up said gloria were not supposed to talk about it only if you find something you like remember where it is i hadnt done that but i wasnt worried drink some water she said and get some food they were going around with sandwiches and i got a couple one for gloria but she didnt seem to want to talk gilmartin the fake doctor was making a big deal of going around checking everybody even though it was only the first break i figured that the whole point of taking care of us so hard was to remind the people in the seats that they might see somebody get hurt ed was giving out apples from a bag i took one and went over and sat on lanes cot she looked nice in her suit my boyfriends here she said youre back together i mean ex im pretending i didnt see him where hes sitting right in front of my monitor she tipped her head to point i didnt say anything but i wished i had somebody watching me from the audience when i went back the first thing i got into was a library of books every one you took off the shelf turned into a show with charts and pictures but when i figured out that it was all business stuff about how to manage your money i got bored then i went into a dungeon it started with a wizard growing me up from a bug we were in his workshop which was all full of jars and cobwebs he had a face like a melted candle and he talked as much as fearing there were bats flying around you must resume the quest of kroydhe said to me and started touching me with his stick i could see my arms and legs but they werent wearing the scaper suit they were covered with muscles when the wizard touched me i got a sword and a shield these are your companions rip and batter said the wizard they will obey you and protect you you must never betray them for any other that was kroyds mistake okay i said the wizard sent me into the dungeon and rip and batter talked to me they told me what to do they sounded a lot like the wizard we met a wormlion thats what rip and batter called it it had a head full of worms with little faces and rip and batter said to kill it which wasnt hard the head exploded and all the worms started running away into the stones of the floor like water then we met a woman in sexy clothes who was holding a sword and shield too hers were loaded with jewels and looked a lot nicer than rip and batter this was kroyds mistake anyone could see that only i figured kroyd wasnt here and i was and so maybe his mistake was one i wanted to make too rip and batter started screaming when i traded with the woman and then she put them on and we fought when she killed me i was back in the doorway to the wizards room where i first ran in bugsized this time i went the other way back to the drawers which is when i met the snowman i was looking around in a drawer that didnt seem to have anything in it everything was just black then i saw a little blinking list of numbers in the corner i touched the numbers none of them did anything except one it was still black but there were five pictures of a snowman he was three balls of white more like plastic than snow his eyes were just os and his mouth didnt move right when he talked his arms were sticks but they bent like rubber there were two pictures of him small and far away one from underneath like he was on a hill and one that showed the top of his head like he was in a hole then there was a big one of just his head and a big one of his whole body the last one was of him looking in through a window only you couldnt see the window just the way it cut off part of the snowman whats your name he said lewis im mr sneeze his head and arms moved in all five pictures when he talked his eyes got big and small whats this place youre in its no place said mr sneeze just a garbage file why do you live in a garbage file copyright lawyers said mr sneeze i made them nervous he sounded happy no matter what he was saying nervous about what i was in a christmas special for interactive television but at the last minute somebody from the legal department thought i looked too much like a snowman on a video game called mud flinger it was too late to redesign me so they just cut me out and dumped me in this file can t you go somewhere else i dont have too much mobility he jumped and twirled upside down and landed in the same place five times at once the one without a body spun too do you miss the show i just hope theyre doing well everybody has been working so hard i didnt want to tell him it was probably a long time ago what are you doing here lewis said mr sneeze im in a scape athon whats that i told him about gloria and fearing and kromer and about the contest i think he liked that he was on television again there werent too many people left in the seats fearing was talking to them about what was going to happen tomorrow when they came back kromer and ed got us all in the back i looked over at lanes cot she was already asleep her boyfriend was gone from the chair out front i lay down on the cot beside gloria im tired now i said so sleep a little she said and put her arm over me but i could hear fearing outside talking about a sexathon and i asked gloria what it was thats tomorrow night she said dont worry about it now gloria wasnt going to sleep just looking around i found the smarthouse showroom it was a house with a voice inside at first i was looking around to see who the voice was but then i figured out it was the house answer the phone it said the phone was ringing i picked up the phone and the lights in the room changed to a desk light on the table with the phone the music in the room turned off hows that for responsiveness fine i said i hung up the phone there was a television in the room and it turned on it was a picture of food see that the food you mean i said thats the contents of your refrigerator it said the packages with the blue halo will go bad in the next twentyfour hours the package with the black halo has already expired would you like me to dispose of it for you sure now look out the windows i looked there were mountains outside imagine waking up in the alps every morning and when youre ready for work your car is already warm in the garage the windows switched from the mountains to a picture of a car in a garage and your voicemail tells callers that youre not home when it senses the car is gone from the garage i wondered if there was somewhere i could get if i went down to drive the car but they were trying to sell me this house so probably not and the television notifies you when the book youre reading is available this week as a movie the television switched to a movie the window curtains closed and the light by the phone went off i cant read i said all the more important then isnt it said the house what about the bedroom i said i was thinking about sleep here you go a door opened and i went in the bedroom had another television but the bed wasnt right it had a scribble of electronic stuff over it whats wrong with the bed somebody defaced it said the house pity i knew it must have been fearing or kromer who wrecked the bed because they didnt want anyone getting that comfortable and falling asleep and out of the contest at least not yet sorry said the house let me show you the work centre next rest i got right into glorias cot and curled up and she curled around me it was real early in the morning and nobody was watching the show now and fearing wasnt talking i think he was off taking a nap of his own kromer woke us up he always have to sleep with you like a baby gloria said leave him alone he can sleep where he wants i cant figure said kromer is he your boyfriend or your kid brother neither said gloria what do you care okay said kromer weve got a job for him to do tomorrow though what job said gloria they talked like i wasnt there we need a hacker boy for a little sideshow we put on said kromer hes it hes never been in a scape before said gloria hes no hacker hes the nearest weve got well walk him through it ill do it i said okay but then leave him out of the sexathon said gloria kromer smiled youre protecting him sorry everybody plays in the sexathon sweetheart thats bread and butter the customers dont let us break the rules he pointed out to the rigs youd better get out there i knew kromer thought i didnt know about gloria and fearing or other things i wanted to tell him i wasnt so innocent but i didnt think gloria would like it so i kept quiet i went to talk to mr sneeze i remembered where he was from the first time whats a sexathon i said i dont know lewis ive never had sex i said me neither said mr sneeze everybody always thinks i do with gloria just because we go around together but were just friends thats fine said mr sneeze its okay to be friends id like to be lanes boyfriend i said next break gloria slept while gilmartin and kromer told me about the act a drawer would be marked for me to go into and there would be a lot of numbers and letters but i just had to keep pressing no matter what it was supposed to be a security archive they said the people watching would think i was breaking codes but it was just for show then something else would happen but they wouldnt say what just that i should keep quiet and let fearing talk so i knew they were going to pull me out of my mask i didnt know if i should tell gloria fearing was up again welcoming some people back in i couldnt believe anybody wanted to start watching first thing in the morning but fearing was saying the gritty determination to survive that epitomizes the frontier spirit that once made a country called america great and young bodies writhing in agonized congress with the future and that sounded like a lot of fun i guess a woman from the town had quit already not lane though a good quiet place to go was mars it was like the airplane all space and no people but better since there was no voice telling you to engage targets and you never crashed i went to the drawer they told me about fearings voice in my ear told me it was time the place was a storeroom of information like the business library no people just files with a lot of blinking lights and complicated words a voice kept asking me for security clearance password but there was always a place for me to touch and i did it was kind of a joke like a wall made out of feathers that falls apart every time you touch it i found a bunch of papers with writing some of the words were blacked out and some were bright red and blinking there was a siren sound then i felt hands pulling on me from outside and somebody took off my mask there were two guys pulling on me who i had never seen before and ed and kromer were pulling on them everybody was screaming at each other but it was kind of fake because nobody was pulling or yelling very hard fearing said the feds the feds a bunch of people were crowded around my television screen i guess looking at the papers id dug up but now they were watching the action fearing came over and pulled out a toy gun and so did kromer and they were backing the two men away from me im sure the audience could tell it was fake but they were pretty excited maybe just from remembering when feds were real i got off my frame and looked around i didnt know what they were going to do with me now that i was out but i didnt care it was my first chance to see what it was like when the contestants were all in their suits and masks swimming in the information none of them knew what was happening not even gloria who was right next to me the whole time they just kept moving in the scapes i looked at lane she looked good like she was dancing meanwhile fearing and kromer chased those guys out the back people were craning around to see fearing came out and took his microphone and said it isnt his fault folks just good hacker instincts for ferreting out corruption from encrypted data the feds dont want us digging up their trail but the kid couldnt help it ed and kromer started snapping me back into my suit we chased them off fearing said patting his gun we do take care of our own you cant tell whos going to come sniffing around can you for his protection and ours were going to have to delete that file but it goes to show theres no limit to what a kid with a nose for datas going to root out of cyberspace we cant throw him out of the contest for doing what comes natural give him a big hand folks people clapped and a few threw coins ed picked the change up for me then told me to put on my mask meanwhile gloria and lane and everybody else just went on through their scapes i began to see what kromer and fearing were selling it wasnt any one thing some of it was fake and some was real and some was a mix so you couldnt tell the people watching probably didnt know why they wanted to except it made them forget their screwedup lives for a while to watch the only suckers bigger than themselvesus meanwhile the big show goes on said fearing how long will they last who will take the prize i told gloria about it at the break she just shrugged and said to make sure i got my money from kromer fearing was talking to anne the woman from the van and gloria was staring at them like she wanted them dead a guy was lying in his cot talking to himself as if nobody could hear and gilmartin and kromer went over and told him he was kicked out he didnt seem to care i went to see lane but we didnt talk we sat on her cot and held hands i didnt know if it meant the same thing to her that it did to me but i liked it after the break i went and talked to mr sneeze he told me the story of the show about christmas he said it wasnt about always getting gifts sometimes you had to give gifts too the sexathon was late at night they cleared the seats and everyone had to pay again to get back in because it was a special event fearing had built it up all day talking about how it was for adults only it would separate the men from the boys things like that also that people would get knocked out of the contest so we were pretty nervous by the time he told us the rules what would scapes be without virtual sex he said our voyagers must now prove themselves in the sensual realmfor the future consists of far more than cold hard information its a place of desire and temptation and as always survival belongs to the fittest the soldiers will now be steered onto the sexual battlescape the question is will they meet with the little death or the big one gloria wouldnt explain not real death is all she said the rules again are so simple a child could follow them in the sexscape environment our contestants will be free to pick from a variety of fantasy partners weve packed this program with options theres something for every taste believe you me we wont question their selections butheres the catchwe will chart the results their suits will tell us who does and doesnt attain sexual orgasm in the next session and those who dont will be handed their walking papers the suits dont lie find bliss or die folks find bliss or die you get it now said gloria to me i guess i said as ever audience members are cautioned never to interfere with the contestants during play follow their fantasies on the monitors or watch their youthful bodies strain against exhaustion seeking to bridge virtual lust and bona fide physical response but no touchee kromer was going around checking the suits whos gonna be in your fantasy kid he said to me the snowman id forgotten how they could watch me talk to mr sneeze on my television i turned red screw you kromer said gloria whoever you want honey he said laughing well i found my way around their sexscape and im not too embarrassed to say i found a girl who reminded me of lane except for the way she was trying so hard to be sexy but she looked like lane i didnt have to do much to get the subject around to sex it was the only thing on her mind she wanted me to tell her what i wanted to do to her and when i couldnt think of much she suggested things and i just agreed and when i did that she would move around and sigh as if it were really exciting to talk about even though she was doing the talking she wanted to touch me but she couldnt really so she took off her clothes and got close to me and touched herself i touched her too but she didnt really feel like much and it was like my hands were made of wood which couldnt have felt too nice for her though she acted like it was great i touched myself a little too i tried not to think about the audience i was a little confused about what was what in the suit and with her breathing in my ear so loud but i got the desired result that wasnt hard for me then i could go back to the drawers but kromer had made me embarrassed about visiting mr sneeze so i went to mars even though i would have liked to talk to him the audience was all stirred up at the next break they were sure getting their moneys worth now i got into glorias cot i asked her if she did it with her own hands too you didnt have to do that she said how else i just pretended i dont think they can tell they just want to see you wiggle around well some of the women from the town hadnt wiggled around enough i guess because kromer and ed were taking them out of the contest a couple of them were crying i wish i hadnt i said its the same either way said gloria dont feel bad probably some other people did it too they didnt kick lane out but i saw she was crying anyway kromer brought a man into the back and said to me get into your own cot little snowman let him stay said gloria she wasnt looking at kromer ive got someone here who wants to meet you said kromer to gloria mr warren this is gloria mr warren shook her hand he was pretty old ive been admiring you he said youre very good mr warren is wondering if youd let him buy you a drink said kromer thanks but i need some sleep said gloria perhaps later said mr warren after he left kromer came back and said you shouldnt pass up easy money i dont need it said gloria im going to win your contest you goddamn pimp now gloria said kromer you dont want to give the wrong impression leave me alone i noticed now that anne wasnt around in the rest area and i got the idea that the kind of easy money gloria didnt want anne did im not so dumb worrying about the sexathon had stopped me from feeling how tired i was right after that i started nodding off in the scapes i had to keep moving around after id been to a few new things i went to see the snowman again it was early in the morning and i figured kromer was probably asleep and there was barely any audience to see what i was doing on my television so mr sneeze and i talked and that helped me stay awake i wasnt the only one who was tired after that night on the next break i saw that a bunch of people had dropped out or been kicked out for sleeping there were only seventeen left i couldnt stay awake myself but i woke up when i heard some yelling over where lane was it was her parents i guess they heard about the sexathon maybe from her boyfriend who was there too lane was sitting crying behind fearing who was telling her parents to get out of there and her father just kept saying im her father im her father her mother was pulling at fearing but ed came over and pulled on her i started to get up but gloria grabbed my arm and said stay out of this lane doesnt want to see that guy i said let the townies take care of themselves lewis let lanes daddy take her home if he can worse could happen to her you just want her out of the contest i said gloria laughed im not worried about your girlfriend outlasting me she said shes about to break no matter what so i just watched kromer and ed got lanes parents and boyfriend pushed out of the rest area back toward the seats fearing was yelling at them making a scene for the audience it was all part of the show as far as he was concerned anne from the van was over talking to lane who was still crying but quiet now do you really think you can win i said to gloria sure why not she said i can last im pretty tired in fact my eyeballs felt like they were full of sand well if you fall out stick around you can probably get food out of kromer for cleaning up or something im going to take these bastards you dont like fearing anymore i said i never did said gloria that afternoon three more people dropped out fearing was going on about endurance and i got thinking about how much harder it was to live the way me and gloria did than it was to be in town and so maybe we had an advantage maybe that was why gloria thought she could win now but i sure didnt feel it myself i was so messed up that i couldnt always sleep at the rest periods just lie there and listen to fearing or eat their sandwiches until i wanted to vomit kromer and gilmartin were planning some sideshow but it didnt involve me and i didnt care i didnt want coins thrown at me i just wanted to get through if i built the cities near the water the plague always killed all the people and if i built the cities near the mountains the volcanoes always killed all the people and if i built the cities on the plain the other tribe always came over and killed all the people and i got sick of the whole damn thing when gloria wins we could live in town for a while i said we could even get jobs if there are any then if lane doesnt want to go back to her parents she could stay with us you could win the contest said mr sneeze i dont think so i said but gloria could why did lewis cross mars to get to the other side ha ha i came out for the rest period and gloria was already yelling and i unhooked my suit and rushed over to see what was the matter it was so late it was getting light outside and almost nobody was in the place shes cheating gloria screamed she was pounding on kromer and he was backing up because she was a handful mad that bitch is cheating you let her sleep gloria pointed at anne from the van shes lying there asleep youre running tapes in her monitor you goddamn cheater anne sat up in her frame and didnt say anything she looked confused youre a bunch of cheaters gloria kept saying kromer got her by the wrists and said take it easy take it easy youre going scapecrazy girl dont tell me im crazy said gloria she twisted away from kromer and ran to the seats mr warren was there watching her with his hat in his hands i ran after gloria and said her name but she said leave me alone and went over to mr warren you saw it didnt you she said im sorry said mr warren you must have seen it the way she wasnt moving at all said gloria come on tell these cheaters you saw it ill go on that date with you if you tell them im sorry darling i was looking at you kromer knocked me out of the way and grabbed gloria from behind listen to me girl youre hallucinating youre scapehappy we see it all the time he was talking quiet but hard any more of this and youre out of the show you understand get in the back and lie down now and get some sleep you need it you bastard said gloria sure im a bastard but youre seeing things he held glorias wrist and she sagged mr warren got up and put his hat on ill see you tomorrow darling dont worry im rooting for you he went out gloria didnt look at him kromer took gloria back to the rest area but suddenly i wasnt paying much attention myself i had been thinking fearing wasnt taking advantage of the free action by talking about it because there wasnt anyone much in the place to impress at this hour then i looked around and i realized there were two people missing and that was fearing and lane i found ed and i asked him if lane had dropped out of the contest and he said no maybe theres a way you could find out if anne is really scaping or if shes a cheat i said to mr sneeze i dont see how i could he said i cant visit her she has to visit me and nobody visits me except you he hopped and jiggled in his five places id like it if i could meet gloria and lane lets not talk about lane i said when i saw fearing again i couldnt look at him he was out talking to the people who came by in the morning not in the microphone but one at a time shaking hands and taking compliments like it was him doing the scaping there were only eight people left in the contest lane was still in it but i didnt care i knew if i tried to sleep i would just lie there thinking so i went to rinse out under my suit which was getting pretty rank i hadnt been out of that suit since the contest started in the bathroom i looked out the little window at the daylight and i thought about how i hadnt been out of that building for five days either no matter how much id gone to mars and elsewhere i went back in and saw gloria asleep and i thought all of a sudden that i should try to win but maybe that was just the idea coming over me that gloria wasnt going to i didnt notice it right away because i went to other places first mr sneeze had made me promise id always have something new to tell him about so i always opened a few drawers i went to a tank game but it was boring then i found a place called the american history blood and wax museum and i stopped president lincoln from getting murdered a couple of times i tried to stop president kennedy from getting murdered but if i stopped it one way it always happened a different way i dont know why so then i was going to tell mr sneeze about it and thats when i found out i went into his drawer and touched the right numbers but what i got wasnt the usual five pictures of the snowman it was pieces of him but chopped up and stretched into thin white strips around the edge of the black space like a band of white light i said mr sneeze there wasnt any voice i went out and came back in but it was the same he couldnt talk the band of white strips got narrower and wider like it was trying to move or talk it looked a bit like a hand waving open and shut but if he was still there he couldnt talk i would have taken my mask off then anyway but the heat of my face and my tears forced me to i saw fearing up front talking and i started for him without even getting my suit undipped so i tore up a few of my wires i didnt care i knew i was out now i went right out and tackled fearing from behind he wasnt so big anyway only his voice was big i got him down on the floor you killed him i said and i punched him as hard as i could but you know kromer and gilmartin were there holding my arms before i could hit him more than once i just screamed at fearing you killed him you killed him fearing was smiling at me and wiping his mouth your snowman malfunctioned kid thats a lie you were boring us to death with that snowman you little punk give it a rest for chrissake i kept kicking out even though they had me pulled away from him ill kill you i said right said fearing throw him out of here he never stopped smiling everything suited his plans that was what i hated kromer the big ape and gilmartin pulled me outside into the sunlight and it was like a knife in my eyes i couldnt believe how bright it was they tossed me down in the street and when i got up kromer punched me hard then gloria came outside i dont know how she found out if she heard me screaming or if ed woke her anyway she gave kromer a pretty good punch in the side and said leave him alone kromer was surprised and he moaned and i got away from him gloria punched him again then she turned around and gave gilmartin a kick in the nuts and he went down ill always remember in spite of what happened next that she gave those guys a couple theyd be feeling for a day or two the gang who beat the crap out of us were a mix of the militia and some other guys from the town including lanes boyfriend pretty funny that hed take out his frustration on us but that just shows you how good fearing had that whole town wrapped around his finger outside of town we found an old house that we could hide in and get some sleep i slept longer than gloria when i woke up she was on the front steps rubbing a spoon back and forth on the pavement to make a sharp point even though i could see it hurt her arm to do it well we did get fed for a couple of days i said gloria didnt say anything lets go up to san francisco i said theres a lot of lonely women there i was making a joke of course gloria looked at me whats that supposed to mean just that maybe i can get us in for once gloria didnt laugh but i knew she would

multiple awardwinning sandkings and the story included here in the story that follows youll meet greel he is a scout of the people hes penetrated the oldest tunnels where the taletellers said the people had come from a million years ago he is no coward but he is afraid and with good reason you see hes very used to being in the dark but some visitors have come to the tunnels and theyve brought with them light greel was afraid he lay in the warm rich darkness beyond the place where the tunnel curved his thin body pressed against the strange metal bar that ran along the floor his eyes were closed he strained to remain perfectly still he was armed a short barbed spear was clenched tightly in his right fist but that did not lessen his fear he had come far far he had climbed higher and ranged further than any other scout of the people in long generations he had fought his way through the bad levels where the wormthings still hunted the people relentlessly he had stalked and slain the glowing killer mole in the crumbling middle tunnels he had wiggled through dozens of unmapped and unnamed passages that hardly looked big enough for a man to pass and now he had penetrated to the oldest tunnels the great tunnels and halls of legend where the taletellers said the people had come from a million years ago he was no coward he was a scout of the people who dared to walk in tunnels where men had not trod in centuries but he was afraid and was not ashamed for his fear a good scout knows when to be afraid and greel was a very good scout so he lay silent in the darkness and clutched his spear and thought slowly the fear began to wane greel steeled himself and opened his eyes quickly he shut them again the tunnel ahead was on fire he had never seen fire but the taletellers had sung of it many times hot it was and bright so bright it hurt the eyes blindness was the lot of those who looked too long so greel kept his eyes shut a scout needed his eyes he could not allow the fire ahead to blind him back here in the darkness beyond the bend of the tunnel the fire was not so bad it still hurt the eyes to look at it as it hung upon the curving tunnel wall but the pain was one that could be borne but earlier when he had first seen the fire greel had been unwise he had crept forward squinting to where the wall curved away he had touched the fire that hung upon the stone and then foolishly he had peered beyond the curve his eyes still ached he had gotten only one quick glimpse before whirling and scrambling silently back to where he lay but it was enough beyond the bend the fire had been brighter much brighter brighter than ever he could have imagined even with his eyes closed he could still see it two dancing aching spots of horrible intense brightness they would not go away the fire had burned part of his eyes he thought but still when he had touched the fire that hung upon the wall it had not been like the fire of which the taletellers sing the stone had felt like all other stone cool and a little damp fire was hot the taletellers said but the fire on the stone had not been hot to the touch it was not fire then greel decided after thought what it was he did not know but it could not be fire if it was not hot he stirred slightly from where he lay barely moving he reached out and touched hssig in the darkness his mindbrother was several yards distant near one of the other metal bars greel stroked him with his mind and could feel hssig quiver in response thoughts and sensations mingled wordlessly hssig was afraid too the great hunting rat had no eyes but his scent was keener than greels and there was a strange smell in the tunnel his ears were better too through them greel could pick up more of the odd noises that came from within the fire that was not a fire greel opened his eyes again slowly this time not all at once squinting the holes the fire had burned in his vision were still there but they were fading and the dimmer fire that moved on the curving tunnel wall could be endured if he did not look directly at it still he could not go forward and he must not creep back he was a scout he had a duty he reached out to hssig again the hunting rat had run with him since birth he had never failed him he would not fail him now the rat had no eyes that could be burned but his ears and his nose would tell greel what he must know about the thing beyond the curve hssig felt the command more than he heard it he crept forward slowly towards the fire a treasure house ciffonettos voice was thick with admiration the layer of protective grease smeared onto his face could hardly hide the grin von der stadt looked doubtful not just his face but his whole body radiated doubt both men were dressed alike in featureless grey coveralls woven of a heavy metallic cloth but they could never be mistaken von der stadt was unique in his ability to express doubt while remaining absolutely still when he moved or spoke he underlined the impression as he did now some treasure house he said simply it was enough to annoy ciffonetto he frowned slightly at his larger companion no i mean it he said the beam from his heavy flashlight sliced through the thick darkness and played up and down one of the rusteaten steel pillars that stretched from the platform to the roof look at that ciffonetto said von der stadt looked at it doubtfully i see it he said so wheres the treasure ciffonetto continued to move his beam up and down thats the treasure he said this whole place is a major historical find i knew this was the place to search i told them so whats so great about a steel beam anyway von der stadt asked letting his own flash brush against the pillar the state of preservation ciffonetto said moving closer most everything above ground is radioactive slag even now but down here weve got some beautiful artefacts it will give us a much better picture about what the old civilization was like before the disaster we know what the old civilization was like von der stadt protested weve got tapes books films everything all sorts of things the war didnt even touch luna yes yes but this is different ciffonetto said this is reality he ran his gloved hand lovingly along the pillar look here he said von der stadt moved closer there was writing carved into the metal scratched in rather it didnt go very deep but it could still be read if but faintly ciffonetto was grinning again von der stadt looked doubtful rodney loves wanda he said he shook his head shit cliff he said you can find the same thing in every public john in luna city ciffonetto rolled his eyes von der stadt he said if we found the oldest cave painting in the world youd probably say it was a lousy picture of a buffalo he jabbed at the writing with his free hand dont you understand this is old its history its the remains of a civilization and a nation and a planet that perished almost half a millennium ago von der stadt didnt reply but he still looked doubtful his flashlight wandered theres some more if thats what youre after he said holding his beam steady on another pillar a few feet distant this time it was ciffonetto who read the inscription repent or ye are doomed he said smiling after his flash melted into von der stadts he chuckled slightly the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls he said softly von der stadt frowned some prophet he said they must have had one hell of a weird religion oh christ ciffonetto groaned i didnt mean it literally i was quoting a midtwentiethcentury poet named simon he wrote that only fifty years or so before the great disaster von der stadt wasnt interested he wandered away impatiently his flash darting here and there amid the pitchblack ruins of the ancient subway station its hot down here he complained hotter up there ciffonetto said already lost in a new inscription not the same kind of hot von der stadt replied ciffonetto didnt bother to answer this is the biggest find of the expedition he said when he looked up at last weve got to get pictures and get the others down here were wasting our time on the surface well do better down here von der stadt said doubtfully of course ciffonetto nodded thats what ive said all along the surface was plastered its still a radioactive hell up there even after all these centuries if anything survived it was underground thats where we should look we should branch out and explore this whole system of tunnels his hands swept out expansively you and nagel have been arguing about that the whole trip von der stadt said all the way from luna city i dont see that its done you much good doctor nagel is a fool ciffonetto said carefully i dont think so von der stadt said im a soldier not a scientist but ive heard his side of the argument and it makes sense all this stuff down here is great but its not what nagel wants its not what the expedition was sent to earth to look for i know i know ciffonetto said nagel wants life human life especially so every day he sends the flyers out further and further and so far all hes come up with is a few species of insects and a handful of mutated birds von der stadt shrugged if hed look down here hed find what hes after ciffonetto continued he doesnt realize how deep the cities had dug before the war there are miles of tunnels under our feet level after level thats where the survivors would be if there are any survivors how do you figure von der stadt asked look when war hit the only ones to live through it would be those down in deep shelters or in the tunnels beneath the cities the radioactivity would have prevented them from coming up for years hell the surface still isnt very attractive theyd be trapped down there theyd adjust after a few generations they wouldnt want to come up but von der stadts attention had wandered and he was hardly listening any more he had walked to the edge of the platform and was staring down onto the tracks he stood there silently for a moment then reached a decision he stuffed his flashlight into his belt and began to climb down come on he said lets go look for some of these survivors of yours hssig stayed close to the metal bar as he edged forward it helped to hide him and kept away the fire so he moved in a little band of almost darkness hugging it as best he could he crept silently around the curve and halted through him greel watched watched with the rats ears and with his nose the fire was talking there were two scents alike but not the same and there were two voices just as there had been two fires the bright things that had burned greels eyes were living creatures of some sort greel listened the sounds hssig heard so clearly were words a language of some sort greel was sure of that he knew the difference between the roars and grunts of animals and the patterns of speech but the fire things were talking in a language he did not know the sounds meant no more to him than to hssig who relayed them he concentrated on the scent it was strange unlike anything he had encountered before but somehow it felt like a manscent though it could not be that greel thought an almost manscent and words could it be that the fire things were men they would be strange men much unlike the people but the taletellers sung of men in ancient times that had strange powers and forms might not these be such men here in the oldest tunnels where the legends said the old ones had created the peoplemight not such men still dwell here yes greel stirred he moved slowly from where he lay raising himself to a crouching position to squint at the curve ahead a silent snap brought hssig back to safety from the fiery tunnel beyond the curve there was one way to make sure creel thought trembling he reached out cautiously with his mind von der stadt had adapted to earths gravity a lot more successfully than ciffonetto he reached the floor of the tunnel quickly and waited impatiently while his companion climbed down from the platform ciffonetto let himself drop the last foot or so and landed with a thud he looked up at the platform apprehensively i just hope i can make it back up he said von der stadt shrugged you were the one who wanted to explore all the tunnels yes said ciffonetto shifting his gaze from the platform to look around him and i still do down here in these tunnels are the answers were seeking thats your theory anyway von der stadt said he looked in both directions chose one at random and moved forward his flashlight beam spearing out before him ciffonetto followed a halfstep behind the tunnel they entered was long straight and empty tell me von der stadt said in an offhand manner as they walked even if your survivors did make it through the war in shelters wouldnt they have been forced to surface eventually to survive i meanhow could anyone actually live down here he looked around the tunnel with obvious distaste have you been taking lessons from nagel or something ciffonetto replied ive heard that so often im sick of it i admit it would be difficult but not impossible at first there would be access to large stores of canned goods a lot of that stuff was kept in basements you could get to it by tunnelling later you could raise food there are plants that will grow without light and there would be insects and boring animals too i imagine a diet of bugs and mushrooms it doesnt sound too healthy to me ciffonetto stopped suddenly not bothering to reply look there he said pointing with his flashlight the beam played over a jagged break in the tunnel wall it looked as though someone had smashed through the stone a long time ago von der stadts flash joined ciffonettos to light the area better there was a passage descending from the break ciffonetto moved towards it with a start what the hell do you say to this von der stadt he asked grinning he stuck head and flashlight into the crude tunnel but reemerged quickly not much there he said the passage is caved in after a few feet but still it confirms what ive been saying von der stadt looked vaguely uneasy his free hand drifted to the holstered pistol at his side i dont know he said no you dont said ciffonetto triumphantly neither does nagel men have lived down here they may still live here weve got to organize a more efficient search of the whole underground system he paused his mind flickering back to von der stadts argument of a few seconds earlier as for your bugs and mushrooms men can learn to live on a lot of things men adapt if men survived the warand this says they didthen they survived the aftermath ill wager maybe von der stadt said i cant see what you are so hot on discovering survivors for anyway though i mean the expedition is important and all that weve got to reestablish spaceflight and this is a good test for our new hardware and i guess you scientists can pick up some good stuff for the museums but humans what did earth ever get us besides the great famine ciffonetto smiled tolerantly its because of the great famine that we want to find humans he said he paused weve got enough to entice even nagel now lets head back he started walking back in the direction they had come and resumed talking the great famine was an unavoidable result of the war on earth he said when supplies stopped coming there was absolutely no way to keep all the people in the lunar colony alive ninety per cent starved luna could be made selfsufficient but only with a very small population thats what happened the population adjusted itself but we recycled our air and our water grew foods in hydroponic tanks we struggled but we survived and began to rebuild but we lost a lot too many people died our genetic pool was terribly small and not too diverse the colony had never had a lot of racial diversity to begin with that hasnt helped population actually declined for a long time after we had the physical resources to support more people the idea of inbreeding didnt go over now populations going up again but slowly were stagnant von der stadt its taken us nearly five centuries to get space travel going again for example and we still havent duplicated many of the things they had back on earth before the disaster von der stadt frowned stagnants a strong word he said i think weve done pretty good ciffonetto dismissed the comment with a wave of his flashlight pretty good he said not good enough were not going anywhere theres so damn few changes so little in the way of new ideas we need fresh viewpoints fresh genetic stock we need the stimulation of contact with a foreign culture survivors would give us that after all earths been through theyd have to have changed in some ways and theyd be proof that human life can still flourish on earth thats crucial if were going to establish a colony here the last point was tacked on almost as an afterthought but caught von der stadts approval he nodded gravely they had reached the station again ciffonetto headed straight for the platform cmon he said lets get back to base i cant wait to see nagels face drop when i tell him what weve found they were men greel was almost sure of it the texture of their minds was curious but manlike greel was a strong mindmingler he knew the coarse dim feel of an animals mind the obscene shadows that were the thoughts of the wormthings and he knew the minds of men they were men yet there was a strangeness mindmingling was true communication only with a mindbrother but always it was a sharing with other men a dark and murky sharing full of clouds and flavours and smells and emotions but a sharing here there was no sharing here it was like mindmingling with a lower animal touch feel stroke savourall that a strong mindmingler could do with an animal but never would he feel a response men and mindbrothers responded animals did not these men did not respond these strange firemen had minds that were silent and crippled in the darkness of the tunnel greel straightened from his crouch the fire had faded suddenly from the wall the men were going away down the tunnel away from him the fire went with them he edged forward slowly hssig at his side spear in hand distance made mindmingling difficult he must keep them in range he must find out more he was a scout he had a duty his mind crept out again to taste the flavour of the other minds he had to be sure their thoughts moved around him swirling chaos shot through with streaks of brightness and emotions and dancing halfseen concepts greel understood little but here he recognized something and there something else came to him he lingered and tasted fully of their minds and learned but still it was like mindmingling with an animal he could not make himself felt he could not get an answer still they moved away and their thoughts dimmed and the mindmingling became harder greel advanced he hesitated when he got to the place where the tunnel curved but he knew he must go on he was a scout he lowered himself to the floor squinted and moved around the curve on hands and knees beyond the curve he started and gasped he was in a great hall an immense cavern with a vaulting roof and giant pillars that held up the sky and the hall was bright with light a strange fiery light that danced over everything it was a place of legend a hall of the old ones it had to be never had greel seen a chamber so vast and he of all the people had wandered furthest and climbed highest the men were not in sight but their fire danced around the mouth of the tunnel at the other end of the hall it was intense but not unbearable the men had gone around another curve greel realized that he looked only at the dim reflection of their fire so long as he did not see it direct he was safe he moved out into the hall the scout in him crying to climb the stone wall and explore the upper chamber from which the mighty pillars reared but no the firemen were more important the hall he could return to hssig rubbed up against his leg he reached down and stroked the rats soft fur reassuringly his mindbrother could sense the turmoil of his thoughts men yes he was sure of that and more he knew their thoughts were not those of the people but they were manthoughts and some he could understand one of them burned burned to find other men they seek the people greel thought that he knew he was a scout and a mindmingler he did not make mistakes but what he must do he did not know they sought the people that might be good when first that concept had touched him greel had quivered with joy these firemen were like the old ones of legend if they sought the people he would lead them there would be rewards and glory and the taletellers would sing his name for generations more it was his duty things went not well with the people in recent generations the time of good had ended with the coming of the wormthings who had driven the people from tunnel after tunnel even now below his feet the fight went on still in the bad levels and the tunnels of the people and greel knew the people were losing it was slow but certain the wormthings were new to the people more than animal but less less than men they needed not the tunnels they stalked through the earth itself and nowhere were men safe the people fought back mindminglers could sense the wormthings and spears could slay them and the great hunting rats could rip them to shreds but always the wormthings fled back into the earth itself and there were many wormthings and few people but these new men these firemen they could change the war legends said the old ones had fought with fire and stranger weapons and these men lived in fire they could aid the people they could give mighty weapons to drive the wormthings back into the darkness from which they came but but these men were not quite men their minds were crippled and much much of their thought was alien to greel only glimpses of it could he catch he could not know them as he could know another of the people when they mingled minds he could lead them to the people he knew the way back and down a turn here a twist there through the middle tunnels and the bad levels but what if he led them and they were enemy to the people what if they turned on the people with their fire he feared for what they might do without him they would never find the people greel was certain of that only he in long generations had come this far and only with stealth and mindmingling and hssig alongside him they would never find the ways he had come the twisting tunnels that led deep deep into the earth so the people were safe if he did not act but then the wormthings would win eventually it might take many generations but the people could not hold out his decision no mindmingler could reach a small part of the distance that separated him from the tunnels of the people he alone must decide and he must decide soon for he realized with a shock that the firemen were coming back their odd thoughts grew stronger and the light in the hall grew more and more intense he hesitated then moved slowly backwards towards the tunnel from which he had come wait a minute von der stadt said when ciffonetto was a quarter of the way up the wall lets try the other directions ciffonetto craned his head around awkwardly to look at his companion gave it up as a bad job and dropped back to the tunnel floor he looked disgruntled we should get back he said weve got enough von der stadt shrugged cmon youre the one wanted to explore down here so we might as well do a thorough job of it maybe were only a few feet away from another one of your big finds all right said ciffonetto pulling his flashlight from his belt where he had stashed it for his intended assault on the platform i suppose you have a point it would be tragic if we got nagel down here and he tripped over something we had missed von der stadt nodded assent their flashlight beams melted together and they strode quickly towards the deeper darkness of the tunnel mouth they were coming fear and indecision tumbled in greels thoughts he hugged the tunnel wall back he moved fast and silent he must keep away from their fire until he could decide what he must do but after the first turn the tunnel ran long and straight greel was fast but not fast enough and his eyes were incautiously wide when the fire appeared suddenly in full fury his eyes burned he squealed in sudden pain and threw himself to the ground the fire refused to go away it danced before him even with his eyes closed shifting colours horribly greel fought for control still there was distance between them still he was armed he reached out to hssig nearby in the tunnel the eyeless rat again would be his eyes eyes still shut greel began to crawl back away from the fire hssig remained what the hell was that von der stadts whispered question hung in the air for an instant he was frozen where he had rounded the curve ciffonetto by his side had also stopped dead at the sound the scientist looked puzzled i dont know he said it wasodd sounded like some sort of animal in pain a scream sort of but as if the screamer were trying to remain silent almost his flashlight darted this way and that slicing ribbons of light from the velvet darkness but revealing little von der stadts beam pointed straight ahead unmoving i dont like it von der stadt stated doubtfully maybe there is something down here but that doesnt mean its friendly he shifted his flash to his left hand and drew his pistol well see he said ciffonetto frowned but said nothing they started forward again they were big and they moved fast greel realized with a sick despair that they would catch him his choice had been made for him but perhaps it was right they were men men like the old ones they would help the people against the wormthings a new age would dawn the time of fear would pass the horror would fade the old glories of which the taletellers sing would return and once again the people would build great halls and mighty tunnels yes they had decided for him but the decision was right it was the only decision man must meet man and together they would face the wormthings he kept his eyes closed but he stood and spoke again they froze in midstep this time the sound was no muffled scream it was soft almost hissing but it was too clear to be misunderstood both flash beams swung wildly now for seconds then one froze the other hesitated then joined it together they formed a pool of light against a distant part of the tunnel wall and in the pool stoodwhat my god said von der stadt cliff tell me what it is quick before i shoot it dont ciffonetto replied it isnt moving butwhat i dont know the scientists voice had a strange uncertain quiver in it the creature in the pool of light was small barely over four feet small and sickening there was something vaguely manlike about it but the proportions of the limbs were all wrong and the hands and feet were grotesquely malformed and the skin the skin was a sickly maggoty white but the face was the worst large all out of proportion to the body yet the mouth and nose could hardly be seen the head was all eyes two great immense grotesque eyes now safely hidden by lids of dead white skin von der stadt was rock steady but ciffonetto shook a bit as he looked at it yet he spoke first look he said his voice soft in its hand i thinki think thats a tool silence long strained silence then ciffonetto spoke again his voice was hoarse i think thats a man greel burned the fire had caught him even shut tight his eyes ached and he knew the horror that lurked outside if he opened them and the fire had caught him his skin itched strangely and hurt worse and worse it hurt yet he did not stir he was a scout he had a duty he endured while his mind mingled with those of the others and there in their minds he saw fear but checked fear in a distorted blurry way he saw himself through their eyes he tasted the awe and the revulsion that warred in one and the unmixed revulsion that churned inside the other he angered but he checked his anger he must reach them le must take them to the people they were blind and crippled and could not help their feelings but if they understood they would aid yes he did not move he waited his skin burned but he waited that said von der stadt that thing is a man ciffonetto nodded it must be it carries tools it spoke he hesitated butgod i never envisioned anything like this the tunnels von der stadt the dark for long centuries only the dark i never thoughtso much evolution in so little time a man still von der stadt doubted youre crazy no man could become something like that ciffonetto scarcely heard him i should have realized he mumbled should have guessed the radiation of course it would speed up mutation shorter lifespans probably you were right von der stadt men cant live on bugs and mushrooms not men like us so they adapted adapted to the darkness and the tunnels it suddenly he started those eyes he said he clicked off his flashlight and the walls seemed to move closer he must be sensitive were hurting him divert your flash von der stadt von der stadt gave him a doubtful sidelong glance its dark enough down here already he said but he obeyed his beam swung away history ciffonetto said a moment that will live in he never finished von der stadt was tense triggeredged as his beam swung away from the figure down the tunnel he caught another flicker of movement in the darkness he swung back and forth found the thing again pinned it against the tracks with a beam of light almost he had shot before but he had hesitated because the manlike figure had been still and unfamiliar this new thing was not still it squealed and scurried nor was it unfamiliar this time von der stadt did not hesitate there was a roar a flash then a second got it said von der stadt a damn rat and greel screamed after the long burning there had come an instant of relief but only an instant then suddenly pain flooded him wave after wave after wave rolled over him blotting out the thoughts of the firemen blotting out their fear blotting out his anger hssig died his mindbrother died the firemen had killed his mindbrother he shrieked in pain rage he darted forward swung up his spear he opened his eyes there was a flash of vision then more pain and blindness but the flash was enough he struck and struck again wildly madly blow after blow thrust after thrust then again the universe turned red with pain and then again sounded that awful roar that had come when hssig died something threw him to the tunnel floor and his eyes opened again and fire fire was everywhere but only for a while only for a while then shortly it was darkness again for greel of the people the gun still smoked the hand was still steady but von der stadts mouth hung open as he looked unbelieving from the thing he had blasted across the tunnel to the blood dripping from his uniform then back again then the gun dropped and he clutched at his stomach clutched at the wounds his hand came away wet with blood he stared at it then stared at ciffonetto the rat he said there was pain in his voice i only shot a rat it was going for him why cliff i and he fell heavily his flashlight shattered and went dark there was a long fumbling in the blackness then at last ciffonettos light winked on and the ashen scientist knelt beside his companion von he said tugging at the uniform are you all right he ripped away the fabric to expose the torn flesh von der stadt was mumbling i didnt even see him coming i took my light away like you said cliff why i wasnt going to shoot him not if he was a man i only shot a rat only a rat it was going for him too ciffonetto who had stood paralyzed through everything nodded it wasnt your fault von but you must have scared him you need treating now though he hurt you bad can you make it back to camp he didnt wait for an answer he slipped his arm under von der stadts and lifted him to his feet and began to walk him down the tunnel praying they could make it back to the platform i only shot a rat von der stadt kept saying over and over in a dazed voice dont worry said ciffonetto it wont matter well find others well search the whole subway system if we have to well find them only a rat only a rat they reached the platform ciffonetto lowered von der stadt back to the ground i cant make the climb carrying you von he said ill have to leave you here go for help he straightened hung the flash from his belt only a rat von der stadt said again dont worry said ciffonetto even if we dont find them nothing will be lost they were clearly subhuman men once maybe but no more degenerated there was nothing they could have taught us anyway but von der stadt was past listening past hearing he just sat against the wall clutching his stomach and feeling the blood ooze from between his fingers mumbling the same words over and over ciffonetto turned to the wall a few short feet to the platform then the old rusty escalator and the basement ruins and daylight he had to hurry von der stadt wouldnt last long he grabbed the rock pulled himself up hung on desperately as his other hand scrambled and found a hold he pulled up again he was almost there almost at the platform level when his weak lunar muscles gave out on him there was a sudden spasm his hand slipped loose his other hand couldnt take the weight he fell on the flashlight the darkness was like nothing he had ever seen too thick too complete he fought to keep from screaming when he tried to rise again he did scream more than the flashlight had broken in the fall his scream echoed and reechoed through the long black tunnel he could not see it was a long time dying when it finally faded he screamed again and again finally hoarse he stopped von he said von can you hear me there was no answer he tried again talk he must talk to hold his sanity the darkness was all around him and he could almost hear soft movements a few feet away von der stadt giggled sounding infinitely far away it was only a rat he said only a rat silence then softly ciffonetto yes von yes it was only a rat it was only a rat it was only a rat waiting for the zephyr by tobias s buckell tobias s buckell httpwwwtobiasbuckellcom is the author of the novels crystal rain and ragamuffin as well as many short stories which have appeared in magazines such as analog and nature and the anthologies mojo conjure stories so long been dreaming and i alien forthcoming is a collection tides from the new worlds and his third novel sly mongoose a native of the caribbean buckell lived for a time aboard a boat powered by a wind generator as a result he has long felt it would be natural to bring wind power to a flat desertlike area and when he began speculating about a fossil fuelless future he looked to his own background for an alternative buckell says that postapocalyptic sf is often a way of doing literary penance for all our imagined or real modern sins this story however is perhaps the most optimistic in this volume an audio version of this story is also available for free at telltale weekly httpwwwalexwilsoncomtelltaleaudiobookstobiassbuckellwaitingforthezephyrphp the zephyr was almost five days overdue wind lifted the dust off in little devils of twisting columns that randomly touched down throughout the remains of the town further out beyond the hulks of the super walmart and krogers mara stood and swept the binoculars the platform she stood on reached up a good hundred feet ending in the bulbous water tank that watered the town affording her a look just over the edge of the horizon she strained her eyes for the familiar shape of the zephyrs four bladelike masts but saw nothing but dirttwisters the old asphalt highway laid down back in the time of plenty had finally succumbed to the advancing dirt despite the towns best attempts to keep it out the barriers lay on their side mara still knew the twists and turns of the highway shed memorized since twelve when shed first realized it led to other towns and people mara its getting dark yes ken ken carefully put the binoculars into their pouch and climbed down the side of the tower pushing off down the dust piled at its feet she trudged down to ken now only a large silhouette in the suddenly approaching dusk your mother still wants to talk to you mara didnt respond she wants to work it out ken continued im leaving ive wanted to leave since i was twelve come on ken dont start this again mara started walking quickly towards the house ken matched her pace and even though she could see him wondering what to say next she could also see him examining the farm out of his peripheral vision their farm defied the dust and wind with lush green growth but only because it lay underneath protective glass ken paused slightly twice checking cracks in the façade areas where dust tried to leak in their wind generator is down they need help mara i said i would go over tomorrow mara sighed i really dont want to ken opened the outer door for her stamping his boots clean and letting it shut then passed through as she opened the second door dust slipped in everywhere and covered everything despite precautions brooms didnt quite get it all although ken thought them a useless necessity mara thought the idea of a vacuum cleaner quite fetching i need you help mara just for an afternoon you wouldnt feel right leaving someone without electricity would you ken was right without the windgenerator her parents would be without power okay ill help ken she noticed ever the wonder with his hands already had a dinner set for the two of them despite being slightly cold from sitting out it was wonderful the zephyr was six days overdue mara shimmied up the roof and joined ken he already had parts of the windgenerator laying out on the roof she had just managed to brush past her father without being physically stopped mother stood around looking wounded and helpless ken made a face the blade is all right but the alternator is burned out simple enough to fix the wind generators consisted of no more than an old automobile alternator attached to a propeller blade and swivel mounted on the roof what electricity the houses had depended on deep cycle batteries that used the wind generators to recharge solar panels worked in some areas but here the dust crept into them and unlike wind generators didnt work at night plus it was easy enough to wander out to a car lot and pick an alternator out of the thousands of dead cars mara half suspected her father had called them for help just to get her out to his farm damnit mara her father said from the edge of the dust gutter we need to talk mara looked straight out over the edge out at the miles and miles of brown horizon mara look at me mara we spoke harshly were sorry we like ken her mother chimed in from below but youre young you cant move out just yet come back honey we could use your help on the farm you wouldnt be as busy as you are with ken ken looked up at that with a halfpained grin mara swore and slid off the low end off the roof hitting the dust with a grunt her father started back down the ladder but mara was already in the cart pulling up the sail and bouncing out across the dust back towards the relative safety of kens farm leaving her mothers plaintive entreaties in the dusk air behind her damn how could she have fallen for that her parents were so obvious and ken she fumed on her way back he shouldnt have taken her over even after he showed up sheepishly cooking yet another marvelous meal she tried to remain angry but the anger eventually subsided as it always did on the seventh and eighth day of waiting reception cleared up enough for the both of them to catch some broadcasts from further north ken had enough charge in the house batteries for almost eight hours of television shows and they both cuddled on the couch mara began to wonder if the zephyr would ever show the last visit was two years ago when the giant wheeled caravan sailed into town for a day traders and merchants festooned its various decks with smiles and stalls the zephyr mara knew from talks to its bridge crew was one of the few links the outer towns of america still had with the large cities and each other ever since the petroleum collapse with the middle east nuked into oblivion and portions of europe glowing the country had been trying to replace an entire infrastructure based on oil almost two generations later it was succeeding the large cities used more nuclear power or even harnessed the sewer systems but small towns were hit the hardest accustomed to power but dropped of the line isolated a minor dark age had descended on them life based itself here on bare essentials water and wind mara wanted to see a city lit up in a wanton electrical blaze of light forcing away the dusk and night with artificial manmade day on the tenth day ken found her in the bedroom frantically packing they spotted the zephyr coming in from the east mara said hoisting a pack onto her shoulders are you sure you want to do this what go you dont know whats out there strange places strange people danger mara looked at him of course ken looked down at the ground i thought we had something you me of course mara paused i told you that i would be going but id hoped ken i cant go his voice hardened and he walked into the kitchen mara sat on the edge of the bed biting back tears then snatched the two packs and left angrily the zephyr rolled through main street slowing down to a relative crawl to allow people to run alongside and leap up kids thronged the sides of the street and furious trade went on the four tall masts of the zephyr towered above the small two and three story town buildings the masts looked like vertical wings and used the same principles air flowing across the shorter edge of the bladelike mast caused a vacuum drawing the massive wheeled ship forward mara followed the eager crowd behind the ship she nodded to the occasional familiar face plastic beads more precious than gold due the rarity of oils were draped across stalls that slid out of the side of the hull mara aimed her quick walk for one of these but instead found herself blocked by a familiar form uncle dan hi he had her arm in a firm grip mara saw the bulk of the zephyr slowly moving away she tried to pull out of his grip but couldnt her dad pushed through the crowd dad what are you doing its for your own good mara uncle dan said you dont know what youre doing yes i do she yelled kicking at her uncles shins the crowd around them paid no obvious attention although mara knew full well that by nighttime it would be the talk of the area she begged pleaded yelled kicked scratched and fought but the men of the house already had their minds made they locked her into the basement youll be out when the zephyr leaves mom promised there were no windows mara could only imagine the zephyrs slow progress out of the town she tried to put a brave face on then crawled into a corner and cried after that she beat on the door but no came to let her out the basement was a comfortable area the family den it held several couches and carpet the door creaked open and from looking out mara guessed it to be dusk ken came down the stairs carefully its me mara i suppose youre in on this too actually no youre family wants me to speak some sense into you i wont lie to you mara i want you to stay but holding you here like this is ridiculous the longer we all stay out here away from the cities the crazier it gets maybe youre familys scared they dont want to lose you that doesnt give them the right to lock me up like a damn dog mara yelled ken came closer my sailcart is outside thats as far as you need to get youre a better sailor than anyone else once in you can outrun everyone the zephyr is still reachable on a long tack hey i never did get along with your uncle anyway mara looked up at him and gave him a long hug thank you so much if youre ever back in town look me up will you come with me then ask me then ken pulled away and stepped up the stairs stay close he launched himself into her uncle and dad tackling them with a loud yell mara ran past losing only a shoe pushing past her mom and out into the yard the carts sail puffed out with a snap and she was bouncing her way over the sand before she looked back to see two figures at the door watching her go no one bothered to chase her they all knew her skill with the sail it took the better part of few hours before the four masts showed up mara could hear distant shouting as she overhauled the giant land ship ahoy zephyr she shouted some one tossed a ladder down and mara hauled herself up the small sail cart veered off and tipped into the dust snapping its tiny mast in two it felt faintly liberating to land on the deck with a smile the merchant with the ladder stepped aside letting an officer in khaki step forward weve been watching you approach for the past few hours he said we like the way you handle the wind can you read a map asked a woman in uniform she wore strange braids on her shoulders no you looking for a position on board the ship yes mara felt her stomach flipflop then well teach you how to read charts the woman said she stuck out a hand welcome aboard kid im captain shana ever cross me or give me a reason to ill toss you off the side of the ship and leave you to the vultures understood yes maam good give her a hammock mara stood on the deck of the zephyr enjoying the moment then the man in uniform touched her shoulder it isnt fun and games its a lot of hard work but worth it come on mara paused and looked out at the flat horizon full of tempting futures then she followed him belowdecks never despair by jack mcdevitt jack mcdevitt is the

almostmythical builders of the concrete strips that cover the land and the ruined cities with towers so high that a person could not ascend one in a day in the course of her journey chaka encounters a encounters a historical avatar of a man she doesnt recognize but whom the reader most certainly will the rain began to fall as they threw the last few spadefuls of earth onto the grave quait bowed his head and murmured the traditional farewell chaka looked at the wooden marker which bore flojians name his dates and the legend far from home she hadnt cared all that much for flojian he was selfcentered and he complained a lot and he always knew better ways to do things but you could count on him to pull his weight and now there were only two of them quait finished looked up and nodded her turn she was glad it was over the poor son of a bitch had fallen on his head out of the upper level of a ruin and during four excruciating days theyd been able to do little for him pointless silly way to die flojian she said well miss you she let it go at that because she meant it and the rain was coming harder they retreated to their horses quait packed his spade behind his saddle and mounted in that awkward way that always left her wondering whether lightfoot would chuck him off on the other side she stood looking up at him whats wrong he wiped the back of his hand against his cheek his hat was jammed down on his head water spilled out of it onto his shoulders its time to give it up chaka said go home if we can thunder rumbled it was getting very dark not the best time to discuss this quait waited for her to get on her horse the rain pounded the soft earth fell into the trees she looked back toward the grave flojian lay with the ruins now buried like them beneath the rolling hills and the broad forest it was the sort of grave he would have preferred she supposed he liked stuff that had been dead a long time she pulled her jacket tight and climbed into the saddle quait moved off at a brisk trot theyd buried him at the top of the highest ridge in the area now they rode slowly along the crest picking their way among broken concrete casts and petrified timbers and corroded metal the detritus of the old world sinking slowly into the ground the debris had been softened by time earth and grass had rounded the rubble spilled over it absorbed its sharp edges eventually she supposed nothing would be left and visitors would stand on the ruins and not know they were even here quait bent against the rain his hat pulled low over his eyes his right hand pressed against lightfoots flank he looked worn and tired and discouraged and chaka realized for the first time that he too had given up that he was only waiting for someone else to take responsibility for admitting failure they dropped down off the ridge and rode through a narrow defile bordered by blocks and slabs you okay he asked chaka was fine scared exhausted wondering what they would say to the widows and mothers when they got home there had been six when they started yes she said im okay the grotto lay ahead a square black mouth rimmed by chalkstone and halfhidden by a bracken theyd left a fire burning and it looked warm and good they dismounted and led their horses inside quait threw a couple of logs onto the blaze cold out there he said lightning flashed in the entrance they put the teapot onto its boiling rock fed and watered the animals changed into dry clothes and sank down in front of the fire they didnt talk much for a long time chaka sat wrapped in a blanket enjoying being warm and away from the rain quait made some notes in the journal trying to establish the site of flojians grave so that future travelers if there were any could find it after a while he sighed and looked up not at her but over her shoulder into the middle distance you really think we should turn around yeah i think weve had enough time to go home he nodded i hate to go back like this me too but its time it was hard to guess what the grotto had been it was not a cave the walls were artificial whatever color they might once have possessed had been washed away now they were gray and stained and they curved into a high ceiling a pattern of slanted lines probably intended for decorative effect cut through them the grotto was wide wider than the council hall which could accommodate a hundred people and it went far back under the hill miles maybe as a general principle she avoided the ruins when she could it wasnt easy because they were everywhere but all sorts of critters made their homes among them and the structures were dangerous as flojian had found out prone to caveins collapsing floors you name it the real reason though was that she had heard too many stories about spectres and demons among the crumbling walls she was not superstitious and would never have admitted her discomfort to quait still you never knew they had found the grotto a few hours after flojian got hurt and moved in grateful for the shelter but she was anxious to be gone now thunder shook the walls and they could hear the steady rhythm of rainwater pouring off the ridge it was still late afternoon but all the light had drained out of the day tea should be ready said chaka quait shook his head i hate to give it up well always wonder if it might have been over the next hill she had just picked up the pot and begun to pour when a bolt exploded directly overhead close she said grateful for the protection of the grotto quait smiled took his tea and lifted it in a mock toast to whatever powers lived in the area maybe youre right he said maybe we should take the hint the bolt was drawn by a corroded crosspiece a misshapen chunk of dissolving metal jutting from the side of the hill most of the energy dissipated into the ground but some of it leaped to a buried cable followed it down to a melted junction box flowed through a series of conduits and lit up several ancient circuit boards one of the circuit boards relayed power into a longdormant auxiliary system another turned on an array of sensors which began to take note of sounds in the grotto and a third after an appropriate delay threw a switch and activated the only program that still survived they ate well chaka had come across an unlucky turkey that morning and quait added some berries and freshbaked biscuit theyd long since exhausted their store of wine but a brook ran through the grotto about sixty yards back and the water was clear and cold its not as if we have any reason to think were close said chaka im not sure i believe in it anyway even if it is out there the price is too high the storm eased with the coming of night rain still fell steadily but it was light rain not much more than mist quait talked extensively through the evening about his ambitions about how important it was to find out who had built the great cities scattered through the wilderness and what had happened to them and about mastering the ancient wizardries but she was correct he kept saying glancing her way pausing to give her a chance to interrupt it was better to be safe than sorry damn right said chaka it was warm near the fire and after a while quait fell asleep hed lost twenty pounds since theyd left illyria ten weeks before he had aged and the goodhumoured nonchalance that had attracted her during the early days had disappeared quait was all business now she tried to shake off her sense of despair they were a long way from home alone in a wilderness filled with savages and demons and dead cities in which lights blinked and music played and mechanical things moved she shrank down in her blankets and listened to the water dripping off the trees a log broke and fell into the fire she was not sure what brought her out of it but she was suddenly awake senses alert someone outlined in moonlight illuminated from behind by the fire was standing at the exit to the grotto looking out beside her quaits chest gently rose and fell she was using her saddle bag for a pillow without any visible movement she eased her gun out of it the figure appeared to be a man somewhat thick at the waist dressed in peculiar clothes he wore a dark jacket and dark trousers of matching style a hat with a rounded top and he carried a walking stick there was a red glow near his mouth that alternately dimmed and brightened she detected an door that might have been burning weed dont move she said softly rising to confront the apparition i have a gun he turned looked curiously at her and a cloud of smoke rose over his head he was indeed puffing on something and the smell was vile so you do he said i hope you wont use it he didnt seem sufficiently impressed i mean it she said im sorry he smiled i didnt mean to wake you he wore a white shirt and a dark blue ribbon tied in a bow at his throat the ribbon was sprinkled with white polka dots his hair was white and he had gruff almost fierce features there was something of the bulldog about him he advanced a couple of paces and removed his hat what are you doing here she asked who are you i live here young lady where she glanced around at the bare walls which seemed to move in the flickering light here he lifted his arms to indicate the grotto and took another step forward she glanced at the gun and back at him thats far enough she said dont think i would hesitate im sure you wouldnt young lady the stern cast of his features dissolved into an amiable smile im really not dangerous are you alone she asked taking a quick look behind her nothing stirred in the depths of the cave i am now franklin used to be here and abraham lincoln and an american singer a guitar player as i recall actually there used to be a considerable crowd of us chaka didnt like the way the conversation was going it sounded as if he were trying to distract her if i get any surprises she said the first bullets for you it is good to have visitors again the last few times ive been up and about the buildings been empty really what building oh yes we used to draw substantial crowds but the benches and the gallery have gone missing he looked slowly around i wonder what happened what is your name she said he looked puzzled almost taken aback you dont know he leaned on his cane and studied her closely then i think there is not much point to this conversation how would i know you weve never met she waited for a response when none came she continued i am chaka of illyria the man bowed slightly i suppose under the circumstances you must call me winston he drew his jacket about him it is drafty why dont we retire to the fireside chaka of illyria if he were hostile she and quait would already be dead or worse she lowered the weapon and put it in her belt im surprised to find anyone here no offense but this place looks as if it has been deserted a long time yes it does doesnt it she glanced at quait dead to the world lot of good hed have been if tuks came sneaking up in the night where have you been she asked i beg your pardon weve been here several days where have you been he looked uncertain im not sure he said i was certainly here im always here he lowered himself unsteadily to the ground and held his hands up to the fire feels good it is cold you havent any brandy by chance i dont suppose what was brandy no she said we dont pity its good for old bones he shrugged and looked around strange he said do you know whats happened no she didnt even understand the question i have no idea winston placed his hat in his lap the place looks quite abandoned he said somehow the fact of desolation acquired significance from his having noted it i regret to say i have never heard of illyria where is it may i ask several weeks to the southwest in the valley of the mawagondi i see his tone suggested very clearly that he did not see and who are the mawagondi it is a river do you really not know of it he peered into her eyes i fear there is a great deal i do not know his mood seemed to have darkened are you and your friend going home he asked no she said we seek haven you are welcome to stay here said winston but i do not think you will find it very comfortable thank you no i was referring to the haven and i know how that sounds winston nodded and his forehead crinkled there was a brooding fire in his eyes is it near boston chaka looked over at quait and wondered whether she should wake him i dont know she said where is boston that brought a wide smile well he said it certainly appears one of us is terribly lost i wonder which of us it is she saw the glint in his eye and returned the smile she understood what he was saying in his oddly accented diction they were both lost wheres boston she asked again forty miles east straight down the highway what highway theres no highway out there anywhere at least none that ive seen the cigar tip brightened and dimmed oh my it must be a long time she pulled up her knees and wrapped her arms around them winston i really dont understand much of this conversation nor do i his eyes looked deep into hers what is this haven she was shocked at his ignorance you are not serious i am quite serious please enlighten me well after all he was living out here in the wilderness how could she expect him to know such things haven was the home of abraham polk she said hopefully winston shook his head sheepishly try again he said polk lived at the end of the age of the road makers he knew the world was collapsing that the cities were dying he saved what he could the treasures the knowledge the history everything and he stored it in a fortress with an undersea entrance an undersea entrance said winston how do you propose to get in i dont think we shall said chaka i believe we will give it up at this point and go home winston nodded the fires getting low he said she poked at it and added a log no one even knows whether polk really lived he may only be a legend light filled the grotto entrance seconds later thunder rumbled haven sounds quite a lot like camelot he said what the devil was camelot youve implied he continued after taking a moment to enjoy his weed that the world outside is in ruins oh no the world outside is lovely but there are ruins yes extensive they fill the forests clog the rivers lie in the shallow waters of the harbours they are everywhere some are even active in strange ways there is for example a train that still runs on which no one rides and what do you know of their builders she shrugged very little almost nothing their secrets are locked in this haven yes which you are about to turn your back on were exhausted winston your driving curiosity chaka leaves me breathless damn look its easy enough for you to point a finger you have no idea what weve been through none winston stared steadily at her im sure i dont but the prize is very great and the sea is close there are only two of us left she said the turnings of history are never directed by crowds he said nor by the cautious always it is the lone captain who sets the course its over well be lucky to get home alive that may also be true and certainly going on to your goal entails a great risk but you must decide whether the prize is not worth the risk we will decide i have a partner in the enterprise he will abide by your decision it is up to you she tried to hold angry tears back weve done enough it would be unreasonable to go on the value of reason is often exaggerated chaka it would have been reasonable to accept hitlers offer of terms in what he waved the question away its of no consequence but reason under pressure usually produces prudence when boldness is called for i am not a coward winston i did not imply you are he bit down hard on his weed a blue cloud drifted toward her it hurt her eyes and she backed away are you a ghost she asked the question did not seem at all foolish i suspect i am im something left behind by the retreating tide the fire glowed in his eyes i wonder whether when an event is no longer remembered by any living person it loses all significance whether it is as if it never happened quait stirred in his sleep but did not wake im sure i dont know said chaka for a long time neither of them spoke winston got to his feet im not comfortable here he said she thought he was expressing displeasure with her the floor is hard on an old man and of course you are right you must decide whether you will go on camelot was a nevernever land its chief value lay in the fact that it existed only as an idea perhaps the same thing is true of haven no she said it exists and is anyone else looking for this place no one we will be the second mission to fail i think there will be no more then for gods sake chaka of illyria you must ask yourself why you came all this way why your companions died what you seek money pure and simple ancient manuscripts are priceless wed have been famous throughout the league thats why we came his eyes grew thoughtful then go back he said if this is a purely commercial venture write it off and put your money in real estate beg pardon but i would put it to you that those are not the reasons you dared so much and that you wish to turn back because you have forgot why you came thats not so she said of course its so shall i tell you why you undertook to travel through an unknown world on the hope that you might might find a place thats halfmythical momentarily he seemed to fade to lose definition haven has nothing to do with fame or wealth if you got there if you were able to read its secrets you would have all that provided you could get home with it but you would have acquired something infinitely more valuable and i believe you know that you would have discovered who you really are you would have learned that you are a daughter of the people who designed the acropolis who wrote hamlet who visited the moons of neptune do you know about neptune no she said i dont think so then weve lost everything chaka but you can get it back if you are willing to take it and if not you then someone else but it is worth the taking at whatever cost momentarily he became one with the dark winston she said i cant see you are you still there i am here the system is old and will not keep a charge she was looking through him you really are a ghost she said it is possible you will not succeed nothing is certain save difficulty and trial but have courage never surrender she stared at him never despair he said a sudden chill whispered through her a sense that she had been here before had known this man in another life you seem vaguely familiar have i seen your picture somewhere im sure i do not know perhaps it is the words they have an echo he looked directly at her possibly she could see the cave entrance and a few stars through his silhouette keep in mind whatever happens you are one of a select company a proud band of brothers and sisters you will never be alone as she watched he faded until only the glow of the cigar remained it is your own true self you seek you presume a great deal i know you chaka everything was gone now except the voice i know who you are and you are about to learn was it his first or last name asked quait as they saddled the horses now that you mention it i really dont know she frowned im not sure whether he was real or not he left no prints no marks quait looked toward the rising sun the sky was clear thats the way of it in these places some of its illusion some of its something else but i wish youd woke me so do i she climbed up and patted braks shoulder he said the sea is only forty miles warm spring air flowed over them you want to go on quait you ever hear of neptune he shook his head maybe she said we can try that next when sysadmins ruled the earth by cory doctorow cory doctorow is the author of the novels down and out in the magic kingdom eastern standard tribe and someone

systems administratorshuddle in their network operations centers after a series of disasters ends civilization the internet was supposedly designed to withstand a nuclear blast in this story doctorowa former sysadmin himselfasks if the internet did survive the apocalypse what would the surviving techs do after the world ended when felixs special phone rang at two in the morning kelly rolled over and punched him in the shoulder and hissed why didnt you turn that fucking thing off before bed because im on call he said youre not a fucking doctor she said kicking him as he sat on the beds edge pulling on the pants hed left on the floor before turning in youre a goddamned systems administrator its my job he said they work you like a government mule she said you know im right for christs sake youre a father now you cant go running off in the middle of the night every time someones porn supply goes down dont answer that phone he knew she was right he answered the phone main routers not responding bgp not responding the mechanical voice of the systems monitor didnt care if he cursed at it so he did and it made him feel a little better maybe i can fix it from here he said he could login to the ups for the cage and reboot the routers the ups was in a different netblock with its own independent routers on their own uninterruptible powersupplies kelly was sitting up in bed now an indistinct shape against the headboard in five years of marriage you have never once been able to fix anything from here this time she was wrong he fixed stuff from home all the time but he did it discreetly and didnt make a fuss so she didnt remember it and she was right too he had logs that showed that after am nothing could ever be fixed without driving out to the cage law of infinite universal perversity aka felixs law five minutes later felix was behind the wheel he hadnt been able to fix it from home the independent routers netblock was offline too the last time that had happened some dumbfuck construction worker had driven a ditchwitch through the main conduit into the datacenter and felix had joined a cadre of fifty enraged sysadmins whod stood atop the resulting pit for a week screaming abuse at the poor bastards who labored to splice ten thousand wires back together his phone went off twice more in the car and he let it override the stereo and play the mechanical status reports through the big bassy speakers of more critical network infrastructure offline then kelly called hi he said dont cringe i can hear the cringe in your voice he smiled involuntarily check no cringing i love you felix she said im totally bonkers for you kelly go back to bed s awake she said the baby had been beta test when he was in her womb and when her water broke he got the call and dashed out of the office shouting the gold master just shipped theyd started calling him before hed finished his first cry this little bastard was born to suck tit im sorry i woke you he said he was almost at the data center no traffic at am he slowed down and pulled over before the entrance to the garage he didnt want to lose kellys call underground its not waking me she said youve been there for seven years you have three juniors reporting to you give them the phone youve paid your dues i dont like asking my reports to do anything i wouldnt do he said youve done it she said please i hate waking up alone in the night i miss you most at night kelly im over being angry i just miss you is all you give me sweet dreams ok he said simple as that exactly simple as that cant have you having bad dreams and ive paid my dues from now on im only going on night call to cover holidays she laughed sysadmins dont take holidays this one will he said promise youre wonderful she said oh gross just dumped core all over my bathrobe thats my boy he said oh that he is she said she hung up and he piloted the car into the datacenter lot badging in and peeling up a bleary eyelid to let the retinal scanner get a good look at his sleepdepped eyeball he stopped at the machine to get himself a guaranamedafonil powerbar and a cup of lethal robotcoffee in a spillproof cleanroom sippycup he wolfed down the bar and sipped the coffee then let the inner door read his handgeometry and size him up for a moment it sighed open and gusted the airlocks load of positively pressurized air over him as he passed finally to the inner sanctum it was bedlam the cages were designed to let two or three sysadmins maneuver around them at a time every other inch of cubic space was given over to humming racks of servers and routers and drives jammed among them were no fewer than twenty other sysadmins it was a regular convention of black teeshirts with inexplicable slogans bellies overlapping belts with phones and multitools normally it was practically freezing in the cage but all those bodies were overheating the small enclosed space five or six looked up and grimaced when he came through two greeted him by name he threaded his belly through the press and the cages toward the ardent racks in the back of the room felix it was van who wasnt on call that night what are you doing here he asked no need for both of us to be wrecked tomorrow what oh my personal box is over there it went down around and i got woken up by my processmonitor i should have called you and told you i was coming down spared you the trip felixs own server a box he shared with five other friends was in a rack one floor down he wondered if it was offline too whats the story massive flashworm attack some jackass with a zeroday exploit has got every windows box on the net running monte carlo probes on every ip block including ipv the big ciscos all run administrative interfaces over v and they all fall over if they get more than ten simultaneous probes which means that just about every interchange has gone down dns is screwy too like maybe someone poisoned the zone transfer last night oh and theres an email and im component that sends pretty lifelike messages to everyone in your address book barfing up elizadialog that keys off of your logged email and messages to get you to open a trojan jesus yeah van was a typetwo sysadmin over sixfeettall long ponytail bobbing adams apple over his toastrack chest his tee said choose your weapon and featured a row of polyhedral rpg dice felix was a typeone admin with an extra seventy or eighty pounds all around the middle and a neat but full beard that he wore over his extra chins his tee said hello cthulhu and featured a cute mouthless hellokittystyle cthulhu theyd known each other for fifteen years having met on usenet then ff at toronto freenet beersessions a star trek convention or two and eventually felix had hired van to work under him at ardent van was reliable and methodical trained as an electrical engineer he kept a procession of spiral notebooks filled with the details of every step hed ever taken with time and date not even pebkac this time van said problem exists between keyboard and chair email trojans fell into that category if people were smart enough not to open suspect attachments email trojans would be a thing of the past but worms that ate cisco routers werent a problem with the lusers they were the fault of incompetent engineers no its microsofts fault felix said any time im at work at am its either pebkac or microsloth they ended up just unplugging the frigging routers from the internet not felix of course though he was itching to do it and get them rebooted after shutting down their ipv interfaces it was done by a couple bullgoose bastard operators from hell who had to turn two keys at once to get access to their cage like guards in a minuteman silo percent of the long distance traffic in canada went through this building it had better security than most minuteman silos felix and van got the ardent boxes back online one at a time they were being pounded by wormprobes putting the routers back online just exposed the downstream cages to the attack every box on the internet was drowning in worms or creating wormattacks or both felix managed to get through to nist and bugtraq after about a hundred timeouts and download some kernel patches that should reduce the load the worms put on the machines in his care it was am and he was hungry enough to eat the ass out of a dead bear but he recompiled his kernels and brought the machines back online vans long fingers flew over the administrative keyboard his tongue protruding as he ran loadstats on each one i had two hundred days of uptime on greedo van said greedo was the oldest server in the rack from the days when theyd named the boxes after star wars characters now they were all named after smurfs and they were running out of smurfs and had started in on mcdonaldland characters starting with vans laptop mayor mccheese greedo will rise again felix said ive got a downstairs with over five years of uptime its going to break my heart to reboot it what the everlasting shit do you use a for nothing but who shuts down a machine with five years uptime thats like euthanizing your grandmother i wanna eat van said tell you what felix said well get your box up then mine then ill take you to the lakeview lunch for breakfast pizzas and you can have the rest of the day off youre on van said man youre too good to us grunts you should keep us in a pit and beat us like all the other bosses its all we deserve its your phone van said felix extracted himself from the guts of the which had refused to power up at all he had cadged a spare powersupply from some guys who ran a spam operation and was trying to get it fitted he let van hand him the phone which had fallen off his belt while he was twisting to get at the back of the machine hey kel he said there was an odd snuffling noise in the background static maybe splashing in the bath kelly the line went dead he tried to call back but didnt get anything no ring nor voicemail his phone finally timed out and said network error dammit he said mildly he clipped the phone to his belt kelly wanted to know when he was coming home or wanted him to pick something up for the family shed leave voicemail he was testing the powersupply when his phone rang again he snatched it up and answered it kelly hey whats up he worked to keep anything like irritation out of his voice he felt guilty technically speaking he had discharged his obligations to ardent financial llc once the ardent servers were back online the past three hours had been purely personal even if he planned on billing them to the company there was sobbing on the line kelly he felt the blood draining from his face and his toes were numb felix she said barely comprehensible through the sobbing hes dead oh jesus hes dead who who kelly will she said will he thought who the fuck is he dropped to his knees william was the name theyd written on the birth certificate though theyd called him all along felix made an anguished sound like a sick bark im sick she said i cant even stand anymore oh felix i love you so much kelly whats going on everyone everyone she said only two channels left on the tube christ felix it looks like dawn of the dead out the window he heard her retch the phone started to break up washing her pukenoises back like an echoplex stay there kelly he shouted as the line died he punched but the phone went network error again as soon as he hit send he grabbed mayor mccheese from van and plugged it into the s network cable and launched firefox off the command line and googled for the metro police site quickly but not frantically he searched for an online contact form felix didnt lose his head ever he solved problems and freaking out didnt solve problems he located an online form and wrote out the details of his conversation with kelly like he was filing a bug report his fingers fast his description complete and then he hit submit van had read over his shoulder felix he began god felix said he was sitting on the floor of the cage and he slowly pulled himself upright van took the laptop and tried some news sites but they were all timing out impossible to say if it was because something terrible was happening or because the network was limping under the superworm i need to get home felix said ill drive you van said you can keep calling your wife they made their way to the elevators one of the buildings few windows was there a thick shielded porthole they peered through it as they waited for the elevator not much traffic for a wednesday where there more police cars than usual oh my god van pointed the cn tower a giant whiteelephant needle of a building loomed to the east of them it was askew like a branch stuck in wet sand was it moving it was it was heeling over slowly but gaining speed falling northeast toward the financial district in a second it slid over the tipping point and crashed down they felt the shock then heard it the whole building rocking from the impact a cloud of dust rose from the wreckage and there was more thunder as the worlds tallest freestanding structure crashed through building after building the broadcast centres coming down van said it was the cbcs towering building was collapsing in slow motion people ran every way were crushed by falling masonry seen through the porthole it was like watching a neat cgi trick downloaded from a filesharing site sysadmins were clustering around them now jostling to see the destruction what happened one of them asked the cn tower fell down felix said he sounded far away in his own ears was it the virus the worm what felix focused on the guy who was a young admin with just a little typetwo flab around the middle not the worm the guy said i got an email that the whole citys quarantined because of some virus bioweapon they say he handed felix his blackberry felix was so engrossed in the report purportedly forwarded from health canada that he didnt even notice that all the lights had gone out then he did and he pressed the blackberry back into its owners hand and let out one small sob the generators kicked in a minute later sysadmins stampeded for the stairs felix grabbed van by the arm pulled him back maybe we should wait this out in the cage he said what about kelly van said felix felt like he was going to throw up we should get into the cage now the cage had microparticulate airfilters they ran upstairs to the big cage felix opened the door and then let it hiss shut behind him felix you need to get home its a bioweapon felix said superbug well be ok in here i think so long as the filters hold out what get on irc he said they did van had mayor mccheese and felix used smurfette they skipped around the chat channels until they found one with some familiar handles pentagons gonewhite house too my neighbors barfing blood off his balcony in san diego someone knocked over the gherkin bankers are fleeing the city like rats i heard that the ginzas on fire felix typed im in toronto we just saw the cn tower fall ive heard reports of bioweapons something very fast van read this and said you dont know how fast it is felix maybe we were all exposed three days ago felix closed his eyes if that were so wed be feeling some symptoms i think looks like an emp took out hong kong and maybe paris realtime sat footage shows them completely dark and all netblocks there arent routing youre in toronto it was an unfamiliar handle yeson front street my sisters at uoft and i cnt reach hercan you call her no phone service felix typed staring at network problems i have a soft phone on mayor mccheese van said launching his voiceoverip app i just remembered felix took the laptop from him and punched in his home number it rang once then there was a flat blatting sound like an ambulance siren in an italian movie no phone service felix typed again he looked up at van and saw that his skinny shoulders were shaking van said holy motherfucking shit the world is ending felix pried himself off of irc an hour later atlanta had burned manhattan was hot radioactive enough to screw up the webcams looking out over lincoln plaza everyone blamed islam until it became clear that mecca was a smoking pit and the saudi royals had been hanged before their palaces his hands were shaking and van was quietly weeping in the far corner of the cage he tried calling home again and then the police it didnt work any better than it had the last times he sshed into his box downstairs and grabbed his mail spam spam spam more spam automated messages there an urgent message from the intrusion detection system in the ardent cage he opened it and read quickly someone was crudely repeatedly probing his routers it didnt match a worms signature either he followed the traceroute and discovered that the attack had originated in the same building as him a system in a cage one floor below he had procedures for this he portscanned his attacker and found that port was open was leet or elite in hacker numberletter substitution code that was the kind of port that a worm left open to slither in and out of he googled known sploits that left a listener on port narrowed this down based on the fingerprinted operating system of the compromised server and then he had it it was an ancient worm one that every box should have been patched against years before no mind he had the client for it and he used it to create a root account for himself on the box which he then logged into and took a look around there was one other user logged in scaredy and he checked the proccess monitor and saw that scaredy had spawned all the hundreds of processes that were probing him and plenty of other boxen he opened a chat stop probing my server he expected bluster guilt denial he was surprised are you in the front street datacenter yes christ i thought i was the last one alive im on the fourth floor i think theres a bioweapon attack outside i dont want to leave the clean room felix whooshed out a breath you were probing me to get me to trace back to you yeah that was smart clever bastard im on the sixth floor ive got one more with me what do you know felix pasted in the irc log and waited while the other guy digested it van stood up and paced his eyes were glazed over van pal i have to pee he said no opening the door felix said i saw an empty mountain dew bottle in the trash there right van said he walked like a zombie to the trash can and pulled out the empty magnum he turned his back im felix will felixs stomach did a slow somersault as he thought about felix i think i need to go outside van said he was moving toward the airlock door felix dropped his keyboard and struggled to his feet and ran headlong to van tackling him before he reached the door van he said looking into his friends glazed unfocused eyes look at me van i need to go van said i need to get home and feed the cats theres something out there something fastacting and lethal maybe it will blow away with the wind maybe its already gone but were going to sit here until we know for sure or until we have no choice sit down van sit im cold felix it was freezing felixs arms were broken out in gooseflesh and his feet felt like blocks of ice sit against the servers by the vents get the exhaust heat he found a rack and nestled up against it are you there still heresorting out some logistics how long until we can go out i have no idea no one typed anything for quite some time then felix had to use the mountain dew bottle twice then van used it again felix tried calling kelly again the metro police site was down finally he slid back against the servers and wrapped his arms around his knees and wept like a baby after a minute van came over and sat beside him with his arm around felixs shoulder theyre dead van felix said kelly and my s son my family is gone you dont know for sure van said im sure enough felix said christ its all over isnt it well gut it out a few more hours and then head out things should be getting back to normal soon the fire department will fix it theyll mobilize the army itll be ok felixs ribs hurt he hadnt cried since since was born he hugged his knees harder then the doors opened the two sysadmins who entered were wildeyed one had a tee that said talk nerdy to me and the other one was wearing an electronic frontiers canada shirt come on talk nerdy said were all getting together on the top floor take the stairs felix found he was holding his breath if theres a bioagent in the building were all infected talk nerdy said just go well meet you there theres one on the sixth floor felix said as he climbed to his feet will yeah we got him hes up there talk nerdy was one of the bastard operators from hell whod unplugged the big routers felix and van climbed the stairs slowly their steps echoing in the deserted shaft after the frigid air of the cage the stairwell felt like a sauna there was a cafeteria on the top floor with working toilets water and coffee and vending machine food there was an uneasy queue of sysadmins before each no one met anyones eye felix wondered which one was will and then he joined the vending machine queue he got a couple more energy bars and a gigantic cup of vanilla coffee before running out of change van had scored them some table space and felix set the stuff down before him and got in the toilet line just save some for me he said tossing an energy bar in front of van by the time they were all settled in thoroughly evacuated and eating talk nerdy and his friend had returned again they cleared off the cashregister at the end of the foodprep area and talk nerdy got up on it slowly the conversation died down im uri popovich this is diego rosenbaum thank you all for coming up here heres what we know for sure the buildings been on generators for three hours now visual observation indicates that were the only building in central toronto with working power which should hold out for three more days there is a bioagent of unknown origin loose beyond our doors it kills quickly within hours and it is aerosolized you get it from breathing bad air no one has opened any of the exterior doors to this building since five this morning no one will open the doors until i give the goahead attacks on major cities all over the world have left emergency responders in chaos the attacks are electronic biological nuclear and conventional explosives and they are very widespread im a security engineer and where i come from attacks in this kind of cluster are usually viewed as opportunistic group b blows up a bridge because everyone is off taking care of group as dirty nuke event its smart an aum shin rikyo cell in seoul gassed the subways there about am eastern thats the earliest event we can locate so it may have been the archduke that broke the camels back were pretty sure that aum shin rikyo couldnt be behind this kind of mayhem they have no history of infowar and have never shown the kind of organizational acumen necessary to take out so many targets at once basically theyre not smart enough were holing up here for the foreseeable future at least until the bioweapon has been identified and dispersed were going to staff the racks and keep the networks up this is critical infrastructure and its our job to make sure its got five nines of uptime in times of national emergency our responsibility to do that doubles one sysadmin put up his hand he was very daring in a green incredible hulk ringtee and he was at the young end of the scale who died and made you king i have controls for the main security system keys to every cage and passcodes for the exterior doors theyre all locked now by the way im the one who got everyone up here first and called the meeting i dont care if someone else wants this job its a shitty one but someone needs to have this job youre right the kid said and i can do it every bit as well as you my names will sario popovich looked down his nose at the kid well if youll let me finish talking maybe ill hand things over to you when im done finish by all means sario turned his back on him and walked to the window he stared out of it intensely felixs gaze was drawn to it and he saw that there were several oily smoke plumes rising up from the city popovichs momentum was broken so thats what were going to do he said the kid looked around after a stretched moment of silence oh is it my turn now there was a round of goodnatured chuckling heres what i think the world is going to shit there are coordinated attacks on every critical piece of infrastructure theres only one way that those attacks could be so well coordinated via the internet even if you buy the thesis that the attacks are all opportunistic we need to ask how an opportunistic attack could be organized in minutes the internet so you think we should shut down the internet popovich laughed a little but stopped when sario said nothing we saw an attack last night that nearly killed the internet a little dos on the critical routers a little dnsfoo and down it goes like a preachers daughter cops and the military are a bunch of technophobic lusers they hardly rely on the net at all if we take the internet down well disproportionately disadvantage the attackers while only inconveniencing the defenders when the time comes we can rebuild it youre shitting me popovich said his jaw literally hung open its logical sario said lots of people dont like coping with logic when it dictates hard decisions thats a problem with people not logic there was a buzz of conversation that quickly turned into a roar shut up popovich hollered the conversation dimmed by one watt popovich yelled again stamping his foot on the countertop finally there was a semblance of order one at a time he said he was flushed red his hands in his pockets one sysadmin was for staying another for going they should hide in the cages they should inventory their supplies and appoint a quartermaster they should go outside and find the police or volunteer at hospitals they should appoint defenders to keep the front door secure felix found to his surprise that he had his hand in the air popovich called on him my name is felix tremont he said getting up on one of the tables drawing out his pda i want to read you something governments of the industrial world you weary giants of flesh and steel i come from cyberspace the new home of mind on behalf of the future i ask you of the past to leave us alone you are not welcome among us you have no sovereignty where we gather we have no elected government nor are we likely to have one so i address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks i declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us you have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed you have neither solicited nor received ours we did not invite you you do not know us nor do you know our world cyberspace does not lie within your borders do not think that you can build it as though it were a public construction project you cannot it is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective actions thats from the declaration of independence of cyberspace it was written years ago i thought it was one of the most beautiful things id ever read i wanted my kid to grow up in a world where cyberspace was free and where that freedom infected the real world so meatspace got freer too he swallowed hard and scrubbed at his eyes with the back of his hand van awkwardly patted him on the shoe my beautiful son and my beautiful wife died today millions more too the city is literally in flames whole cities have disappeared from the map he coughed up a sob and swallowed it again all around the world people like us are gathered in buildings like this they were trying to recover from last nights worm when disaster struck we have independent power food water we have the network that the bad guys use so well and that the good guys have never figured out we have a shared love of liberty that comes from caring about and caring for the network we are in charge of the most important organizational and governmental tool the world has ever seen we are the closest thing to a government the world has right now geneva is a crater the east river is on fire and the un is evacuated the distributed republic of cyberspace weathered this storm basically unscathed we are the custodians of a deathless monstrous wonderful machine one with the potential to rebuild a better world i have nothing to live for but that there were tears in vans eyes he wasnt the only one they didnt applaud him but they did one better they maintained respectful total silence for seconds that stretched to a minute how do we do it popovich said without a trace of sarcasm the newsgroups were filling up fast theyd announced them in newsadminnetabuseemail where all the spamfighters hung out and where there was a tight culture of camaraderie in the face of fullout attack the new group was altnovemberdisasterrecovery with recoverygoverance recoveryfinance recoverylogistics and recoverydefense hanging off of it bless the wooly alt hierarchy and all those who sail in her the sysadmins came out of the woodwork the googleplex was online with the stalwart queen kong bossing a gang of rollerbladed grunts who wheeled through the gigantic datacenter swapping out dead boxen and hitting reboot switches the internet archive was offline in the presidio but the mirror in amsterdam was live and theyd redirected the dns so that youd hardly know the difference amazon was down paypal was up blogger typepad and livejournal were all up and filling with millions of posts from scared survivors huddling together for electronic warmth the flickr photostreams were horrific felix had to unsubscribe from them after he caught a photo of a woman and a baby dead in a kitchen twisted into an agonized heiroglyph by the bioagent they didnt look like kelly and but they didnt have to he started shaking and couldnt stop wikipedia was up but limping under load the spam poured in as though nothing had changed worms roamed the network recoverylogistics was where most of the action was we can use the newsgroup voting mechanism to hold regional elections felix knew that this would work usenet newsgroup votes had been running for more than twenty years without a substantial hitch well elect regional representatives and theyll pick a prime minister the americans insisted on president which felix didnt like seemed too partisan his future wouldnt be the american future the american future had gone up with the white house he was building a bigger tent than that there were french sysadmins online from france telecom the ebus datacenter had been spared in the attacks that hammered geneva and it was filled with wry germans whose english was better than felixs they got on well with the remains of the bbc team in canary wharf they spoke polyglot english in recoverylogistics and felix had momentum on his side some of the admins were cooling out the inevitable stupid flamewars with the practice of long years some were chipping in useful suggestions surprisingly few thought that felix was off his rocker i think we should hold elections as soon as possible tomorrow at the latest we cant rule justly without the consent of the governed within seconds the reply landed in his inbox you cant be serious consent of the governed unless i miss my guess most of the people youre proposing to govern are puking their guts out hiding under their desks or wandering shellshocked through the city streets when do they get a vote felix had to admit she had a point queen kong was sharp not many woman sysadmins and that was a genuine tragedy women like queen kong were too good to exclude from the field hed have to hack a solution to get women balanced out in his new government require each region to elect one woman and one man he happily clattered into argument with her the elections would be the next day hed see to it prime minister of cyberspace why not call yourself the grand poobah of the global data network its more dignified sounds cooler and itll get you just as far will had the sleeping spot next to him up in the cafeteria with van on the other side the room smelled like a dingleberry twentyfive sysadmins who hadnt washed in at least a day all crammed into the same room for some of them it had been much much longer than a day shut up will van said you wanted to try to knock the internet offline correction i want to knock the internet offline presenttense felix cracked one eye he was so tired it was like lifting weights look sario if you dont like my platform put one of your own forward there are plenty of people who think im full of shit and i respect them for that since theyre all running opposite me or backing someone who is thats your choice whats not on the menu is nagging and complaining bedtime now or get up and post your platform sario sat up slowly unrolling the jacket he had been using for a pillow and putting it on screw you guys im out of here i thought hed never leave felix said and turned over lying awake a long time thinking about the election there were other people in the running some of them werent even sysadmins a us senator on retreat at his summer place in wyoming had generator power and a satellite phone somehow hed found the right newsgroup and thrown his hat into the ring some anarchist hackers in italy strafed the group all night long posting brokenenglish screeds about the political bankruptcy of governance in the new world felix looked at their netblock and determined that they were probably holed up in a small interaction design institute near turin italy had been hit very bad but out in the small town this cell of anarchists had taken up residence a surprising number were running on a platform of shutting down the internet felix had his doubts about whether this was even possible but he thought he understood the impulse to finish the work and the world why not from every indication it seemed that the work to date had been a cascade of disasters attacks and opportunism all of it adding up to götterdämmerung a terrorist attack here a lethal counteroffensive there from an overreactive government before long theyd made short work of the world he fell asleep thinking about the logistics of shutting down the internet and dreamed bad dreams in which he was the networks sole defender he woke to a papery itchy sound he rolled over and saw that van was sitting up his jacket balled up in his lap vigorously scratching his skinny arms theyd gone the color of corned beef and had a scaly look in the light streaming through the cafeteria windows skin motes floated and danced in great clouds what are you doing felix sat up watching vans fingernails rip into his skin made him itch in sympathy it had been three days since hed last washed his hair and his scalp sometimes felt like there were little egglaying insects picking their way through it hed adjusted his glasses the night before and had touched the backs of his ears his finger came away shining with thick sebum he got blackheads in the backs of his ears when he didnt shower for a couple days and sometimes gigantic deep boils that kelly finally popped with sick relish scratching van said he went to work on his head sending a cloud of dandruffcrud into the sky there to join the scurf that hed already eliminated from his extremeties christ i itch all over felix took mayor mccheese from vans backpack and plugged it into one of the ethernet cables that snaked all over the floor he googled everything he could think of that could be related to this itchy yielded links he tried compound queries and got slightly more discriminating links i think its stressrelated excema felix said finally i dont get excema van said felix showed him some lurid photos of red angry skin flaked with white stressrelated excema he said reading the caption van examined his arms i have excema he said says here to keep it moisturized and to try cortisone cream you might try the first aid kit in the secondfloor toilets i think i saw some there like all of the sysadmins felix had had a bit of a rummage around the offices bathrooms kitchen and storerooms squirreling away a roll of toiletpaper in his shoulderbag along with three or four powerbars they were sharing out the food in the caf by unspoken agreement every sysadmin watching every other for signs of gluttony and hoarding all were convinced that there was hoarding and gluttony going on out of eyeshot because all were guilty of it themselves when no one else was watching van got up and when his face hove into the light felix saw how puffed his eyes were ill post to the mailinglist for some antihistamine felix said there had been four mailing lists and three wikis for the survivors in the building within hours of the first meetings close and in the intervening days theyd settled on just one felix was still on a little mailing list with five of his most trusted friends two of whom were trapped in cages in other countries he suspected that the rest of the sysadmins were doing the same van stumbled off good luck on the elections he said patting felix on the shoulder felix stood and paced stopping to stare out the grubby windows the fires still burned in toronto more than before hed tried to find mailing lists or blogs that torontonians were posting to but the only ones hed found were being run by other geeks in other datacenters it was possible likely even that there were survivors out there who had more pressing priorities than posting to the internet his home phone still worked about half the time but hed stopped calling it after the second day when hearing kellys voice on the voicemail for the fiftieth time had made him cry in the middle of a planning meeting he wasnt the only one election day time to face the music are you nervous nope felix typed i dont much care if i win to be honest im just glad were doing this the alternative was sitting around with our thumbs up our ass waiting for someone to crack up and open the door the cursor hung queen kong was very high latency as she bossed her gang of googloids around the googleplex doing everything she could to keep her data center online three of the offshore cages had gone offline and two of their six redundant network links were smoked lucky for her queriespersecond were way down theres still china she typed queen kong had a big board with a map of the world colored in googlequeriespersecond and could do magic with it showing the dropoff over time in colorful charts shed uploaded lots of video clips showing how the plague and the bombs had swept the world the initial upswell of queries from people wanting to find out what was going on then the grim precipitous shelving off as the plagues took hold chinas still running about ninety percent nominal felix shook his head you cant think that theyre responsible no she typed but then she started to key something and then stopped no of course not i believe the popovich hypothesis every asshole in the world is using the other assholes for cover but china put them down harder and faster than anyone else maybe weve finally found a use for totalitarian states felix couldnt resist he typed youre lucky your boss cant see you type that you guys were pretty enthusiastic participants in the great firewall of china wasnt my idea she typed and my boss is dead theyre probably all dead the whole bay area got hit hard and then there was the quake theyd watched the usgss automated datastream from the that trashed northern cal from gilroy to sebastapol soma webcams revealed the scope of the damage gas main explosions seismically retrofitted buildings crumpling like piles of childrens blocks after a good kicking the googleplex floating on a series of gigantic steel springs had shook like a plateful of jello but the racks had stayed in place and the worst injury theyd had was a badly bruised eye on a sysadmin whod caught a flying cablecrimper in the face sorry i forgot its ok we all lost people right yeah yeah anyway im not worried about the election whoever wins at least were doing something not if they vote for one of the fuckrags fuckrag was the epithet that some of the sysadmins were using to describe the contingent that wanted to shut down the internet queen kong had coined it apparently it had started life as a catchall term to describe clueless it managers that shed chewed up through her career they wont theyre just tired and sad is all your endorsement will carry the day the googloids were one of the largest and most powerful blocs left behind along with the satellite uplink crews and the remaining transoceanic crews queen kongs endorsement had come as a surprise and hed sent her an email that shed replied to tersely cant have the fuckrags in charge gtg she typed and then her connection dropped he fired up a browser and called up googlecom the browser timed out he hit reload and then again and then the google frontpage came back up whatever had hit queen kongs workplace power failure worms another quake she had fixed it he snorted when he saw that theyd replaced the os in the google logo with little planet earths with mushroom clouds rising from them got anything to eat van said to him it was midafternoon not that time particularly passed in the datacenter felix patted his pockets theyd put a quartermaster in charge but not before everyone had snagged some chow out of the machines hed had a dozen powerbars and some apples hed taken a couple sandwiches but had wisely eaten them first before they got stale one powerbar left he said hed noticed a certain looseness in his waistline that morning and had briefly relished it then hed remembered kellys teasing about his weight and hed cried some then hed eaten two power bars leaving him with just one left oh van said his face was hollower than ever his shoulders sloping in on his toastrack chest here felix said vote felix van took the powerbar from him and then put it down on the table ok i want to give this back to you and say no i couldnt but im fucking hungry so im just going to take it and eat it ok thats fine by me felix said enjoy how are the elections coming van said once hed licked the wrapper clean dunno felix said havent checked in a while hed been winning by a slim margin a few hours before not having his laptop was a major handicap when it came to stuff like this up in the cages there were a dozen more like him poor bastards whod left the house on der tag without thinking to snag something wifienabled youre going to get smoked sario said sliding in next to them hed become famous in the center for never sleeping for eavesdropping for picking fights in rl that had the illconsidered heat of a usenet flamewar the winner will be someone who understands a couple of fundamental facts he held up a fist then ticked off his bullet points by raising a finger at a time point the terrorists are using the internet to destroy the world and we need to destroy the internet first point even if im wrong the whole thing is a joke well run out of generatorfuel soon enough point or if we dont it will be because the old world will be back and running and it wont give a crap about your new world point were gonna run out of food before we run out of shit to argue about or reasons not to go outside we have the chance to do something to help the world recover we can kill the net and cut it off as a tool for bad guys or we can rearrange some more deck chairs on the bridge of your personal titanic in the service of some sweet dream about an independent cyberspace the thing was that sario was right they would be out of fuel in two days intermittent power from the grid had stretched their generator lifespan and if you bought his hypothesis that the internet was primarily being used as a tool to organize more mayhem shutting it down would be the right thing to do but felixs son and his wife were dead he didnt want to rebuild the old world he wanted a new one the old world was one that didnt have any place for him not anymore van scratched his raw flaking skin puffs of dander and scurf swirled in the musty greasy air sario curled a lip at him that is disgusting were breathing recycled air you know whatever leprosy is eating you aerosolizing it into the air supply is pretty antisocial youre the worlds leading authority on antisocial sario van said go away or ill multitool you to death he stopped scratching and patted his sheathed multipliers like a gunslinger yeah im antisocial ive got aspergers and i havent taken any meds in four days whats your fucking excuse van scratched some more im sorry he said i didnt know sario cracked up oh you are priceless id bet that three quarters of this bunch is borderline autistic me im just an asshole but im one who isnt afraid to tell the truth and that makes me better than you dickweed fuckrag felix said fuck off they had less than a days worth of fuel when felix was elected the first ever prime minister of cyberspace the first count was spoiled by a bot that spammed the voting process and they lost a critical day while they added up the votes a second time but by then it was all seeming like more of a joke half the datacenters had gone dark queen kongs netmaps of google queries were looking grimmer and grimmer as more of the world went offline though she maintained a leaderboard of new and rising queries largely related to health shelter sanitation and selfdefense wormload slowed power was going off to many home pc users and staying off so their compromised pcs were going dark the backbones were still lit up and blinking but the missives from those datacenters were looking more and more desperate felix hadnt eaten in a day and neither had anyone in a satellite earthstation of transoceanic headend water was running short too popovich and rosenbaum came and got him before he could do more than answer a few congratulatory messages and post a canned acceptance speech to newsgroups were going to open the doors popovich said like all of them hed lost weight and waxed scruffy and oily his bo was like a cloud coming off a trashbags behind a fishmarket on a sunny day felix was quite sure he smelled no better youre going to go for a reccy get more fuel we can charter a working group for it great idea rosenbaum shook his head sadly were going to go find our families whatever is out there has burned itself out or it hasnt either way theres no future in here what about network maintenance felix said thought he knew the answers wholl keep the routers up well give you the root passwords to everything popovich said his hands were shaking and his eyes were bleary like many of the smokers stuck in the datacenter hed gone cold turkey this week theyd run out of caffeine products two days earlier too the smokers had it rough and ill just stay here and keep everything online you and anyone else who cares anymore felix knew that hed squandered his opportunity the election had seemed noble and brave but in hindsight all it had been was an excuse for infighting when they should have been figuring out what to do next the problem was that there was nothing to do next i cant make you stay he said yeah you cant popovich turned on his heel and walked out rosenbaum watched him go then he gripped felixs shoulder and squeezed it thank you felix it was a beautiful dream it still is maybe well find something to eat and some fuel and come back rosenbaum had a sister whom hed been in contact with over im for the first days after the crisis broke then shed stopped answering the sysadmins were split among those whod had a chance to say goodbye and those who hadnt each was sure the other had it better they posted about it on the internal newsgroup they were still geeks after all and there was a little honor guard on the ground floor geeks who watched them pass toward the double doors they manipulated the keypads and the steel shutters lifted then the first set of doors opened they stepped into the vestibule and pulled the doors shut behind them the front doors opened it was very bright and sunny outside and apart from how empty it was it looked very normal heartbreakingly so the two took a tentative step out into the world then another they turned to wave at the assembled masses then they both grabbed their throats and began to jerk and twitch crumpling in a heap on the ground shiii was all felix managed to choke out before they both dusted themselves off and stood up laughing so hard they were clutching their sides they waved once more and turned on their heels man those guys are sick van said he scratched his arms which had long bloody scratches on them his clothes were so covered in scurf they looked like theyd been dusted with icing sugar i thought it was pretty funny felix said christ im hungry van said conversationally lucky for you weve got all the packets we can eat felix said youre too good to us grunts mr president van said prime minister he said and youre no grunt youre the deputy prime minister youre my designated ribboncutter and handerout of oversized novelty checks it buoyed both of their spirits watching popovich and rosenbaum go it buoyed them up felix knew then that theyd all be going soon that had been preordained by the fuelsupply but who wanted to wait for the fuel to run out anyway half my crew split this morning queen kong typed google was holding up pretty good anyway of course the load on the servers was a lot lighter than it had been since the days when google fit on a bunch of handbuilt pcs under a desk at stanford were down to a quarter felix typed back it was only a day since popovich and rosenbaum left but the traffic on the newsgroups had fallen down to near zero he and van hadnt had much time to play republic of cyberspace theyd been too busy learning the systems that popovich had turned over to them the big big routers that had went on acting as the major interchange for all the network backbones in canada still someone posted to the newsgroups every now and again generally to say goodbye the old flamewars about who would be pm or whether they would shut down the network or who took too much food it was all gone he reloaded the newsgroup there was a typical message runaway processes on solaris tk uh hi im just a lightweight msce but im the only one awake here and four of the dslams just went down looks like theres some custom accounting code thats trying to figure out how much to bill our corporate customers and its spawned ten thousand threads and its eating all the swap i just want to kill it but i cant seem to do that is there some magic invocation i need to do to get this goddamned weenix box to kill this shit i mean its not as if any of our customers are ever going to pay us again id ask the guy who wrote this code but hes pretty much dead as far as anyone can work out he reloaded there was a response it was short authoritative and helpful just the sort of thing you almost never saw in a highcaliber newsgroup when a noob posted a dumb question the apocalypse had awoken the spirit of patient helpfulness in the worlds sysop community van shouldersurfed him holy shit who knew he had it in him he looked at the message again it was from will sario he dropped into his chat window sario i thought you wanted the network dead why are you helping msces fix their boxen sheepish grin gee mr pm maybe i just cant bear to watch a computer suffer at the hands of an amateur he flipped to the channel with queen kong in it how long since i slept two days until we run out of fuel three days since we ran out of food two days jeez i didnt sleep last night either were a little short handed around here asl im monica and i live in pasadena and im bored with my homework would you like to download my pic the trojan bots were all over irc these days jumping to every channel that had any traffic on it sometimes you caught five or six flirting with each other it was pretty weird to watch a piece of malware try to con another instance of itself into downloading a trojan they both kicked the bot off the channel simultaneously he had a script for it now the spam hadnt even tailed off a little how come the spam isnt reducing half the goddamned datacenters have gone dark queen kong paused a long time before typing as had become automatic when she went highlatency he reloaded the google homepage sure enough it was down sario you got any food you wont miss a couple more meals your excellency van had gone back to mayor mccheese but he was in the same channel what a dick youre looking pretty buff though dude van didnt look so good he looked like you could knock him over with a stiff breeze and he had a phlegmy weak quality to his speech hey kong everything ok everythings fine just had to go kick some ass hows the traffic van down percent from this morning he said there were a bunch of nodes whose connections routed through them presumably most of these were home or commercial customers in places where the power was still on and the phone companys cos were still alive every once in a while felix would wiretap the connections to see if he could find a person who had news of the wide world almost all of it was automated traffic though network backups status updates spam lots of spam spams still up because the services that stop spam are failing faster than the services that create it all the antiworm stuff is centralized in a couple places the bad stuff is on a million zombie computers if only the lusers had had the good sense to turn off their home pcs before keeling over or taking off at the rate were going well be routing nothing but spam by dinnertime van cleared his throat a painful sound about that he said i think its going to hit sooner than that felix i dont think anyone would notice if we just walked away from here felix looked at him his skin the color of cornedbeef and streaked with long angry scabs his fingers trembled you drinking enough water van nodded all frigging day every ten seconds anything to keep my belly full he pointed to a refilled pepsi max bottle full of water by his side lets have a meeting he said there had been fortythree of them on dday now there were fifteen six had responded to the call for a meeting by simply leaving everyone knew without having to be told what the meeting was about so thats it youre going to let it all fall apart sario was the only one with the energy left to get properly angry hed go angry to his grave the veins on his throat and forehead stood out angrily his fists shook angrily all the other geeks went lidsdown at the site of him looking up in unison for once at the discussion not keeping one eye on a chatlog or a tailed service log sario youve got to be shitting me felix said you wanted to pull the goddamned plug i wanted it to go clean he shouted i didnt want it to bleed out and keel over in little gasps and pukes forever i wanted it to be an act of will by the global community of its caretakers i wanted it to be an affirmative act by human hands not entropy and bad code and worms winning out fuck that thats just whats happened out there up in the topfloor cafeteria there were windows all around hardened and lightbending and by custom they were all blindsdown now sario ran around the room yanking down the blinds how the hell can he get the energy to run felix wondered he could barely walk up the stairs to the meeting room harsh daylight flooded in it was a fine sunny day out there but everywhere you looked across that commanding view of torontos skyline there were rising plumes of smoke the td tower a gigantic black modernist glass brick was gouting flame to the sky its all falling apart the way everything does listen listen if we leave the network to fall over slowly parts of it will stay online for months maybe years and what will run on it malware worms spam systemprocesses zone transfers the things we use fall apart and require constant maintenance the things we abandon dont get used and they last forever were going to leave the network behind like a limepit filled with industrial waste that will be our fucking legacy the legacy of every keystroke you and i and anyone anywhere ever typed you understand were going to leave it to die slow like a wounded dog instead of giving it one clean shot through the head van scratched his cheeks then felix saw that he was wiping away tears sario youre not wrong but youre not right either he said leaving it up to limp along is right were going to all be limping for a long time and maybe it will be some use to someone if theres one packet being routed from any user to any other user anywhere in the world its doing its job if you want a clean kill you can do that felix said im the pm and i say so im giving you root all of you he turned to the whiteboard where the cafeteria workers used to scrawl the days specials now it was covered with the remnants of heated technical debates that the sysadmins had engaged in over the days since the day he scrubbed away a clean spot with his sleeve and began to write out long complicated alphanumeric passwords salted with punctuation felix had a gift for remembering that kind of password he doubted it would do him much good ever again were going kong fuels almost out anyway yeah well thats right then it was an honor mr prime minister you going to be ok ive commandeered a young sysadmin to see to my feminine needs and weve found another cache of food thatll last us a coupel weeks now that were down to fifteen adminsim in hog heaven pal youre amazing queen kong seriously dont be a hero though when you need to go go theres got to be something out there be safe felix seriouslybtw did i tell you queries are up in romania maybe theyre getting back on their feet really yeah really were hard to killlike fucking roaches her connection died he dropped to firefox and reloaded google and it was down he hit reload and hit reload and hit reload but it didnt come up he closed his eyes and listened to van scratch his legs and then heard van type a little theyre back up he said felix whooshed out a breath he sent the message to the newsgroup one that hed run through five drafts before settling on take care of the place ok well be back someday everyone was going except sario sario wouldnt leave he came down to see them off though the sysadmins gathered in the lobby and felix made the safety door go up and the light rushed in sario stuck his hand out good luck he said you too felix said he had a firm grip sario stronger than he had any right to be maybe you were right he said maybe he said you going to pull the plug sario looked up at the dropceiling seeming to peer through the reinforced floors at the humming racks above who knows he said at last van scratched and a flurry of white motes danced in the sunlight lets go find you a pharmacy felix said he walked to the door and the other sysadmins followed they waited for the interior doors to close behind them and then felix opened the exterior doors the air smelled and tasted like a mown grass like the first drops of rain like the lake and the sky like the outdoors and the world an old friend not heard from in an eternity bye felix the other sysadmins said they were drifting away while he stood transfixed at the top of the short concrete staircase the light hurt his eyes and made them water i think theres a shoppers drug mart on king street he said to van well throw a brick through the window and get you some cortisone ok youre the prime minister van said lead on they didnt see a single soul on the fifteen minute walk there wasnt a single sound except for some bird noises and some distant groans and the wind in the electric cables overhead it was like walking on the surface of the moon bet they have chocolate bars at the shoppers van said felixs stomach lurched food wow he said around a mouthful of saliva they walked past a little hatchback and in the front seat was the dried body of a woman holding the dried body of a baby and his mouth filled with sour bile even though the smell was faint through the rolledup windows he hadnt thought of kelly or in days he dropped to his knees and retched again out here in the real world his family was dead everyone he knew was dead he just wanted to lie down on the sidewalk and wait to die too vans rough hands slipped under his armpits and hauled weakly at him not now he said once were safe inside somewhere and weve eaten something then and then you can do this but not now understand me felix not fucking now the profanity got through to him he got to his feet his knees were trembling just a block more van said and slipped felixs arm around his shoulders and led him along thank you van im sorry no sweat he said you need a shower bad no offense none taken the shoppers had a metal security gate but it had been torn away from the front windows which had been rudely smashed felix and van squeezed through the gap and stepped into the dim drugstore a few of the displays were knocked over but other than that it looked ok by the cashregisters felix spotted the racks of candy bars at the same instant that van saw them and they hurried over and grabbed a handful each stuffing their faces you two eat like pigs they both whirled at the sound of the womans voice she was holding a fireaxe that was nearly as big as she was she wore a labcoat and comfortable shoes you take what you need and go ok no sense in there being any trouble her chin was pointy and her eyes were sharp she looked to be in her forties she looked nothing like kelly which was good because felix felt like running and giving her a hug as it was another person alive are you a doctor felix said she was wearing scrubs under the coat he saw you going to go she brandished the axe felix held his hands up seriously are you a doctor a pharmacist i used to be a rn ten years ago im mostly a webdesigner youre shitting me felix said havent you ever met a girl who knew about computers actually a friend of mine who runs googles datacenter is a girl a woman i mean youre shitting me she said a woman ran googles datacenter runs felix said its still online nfw she said she let the axe lower way have you got any cortisone cream i can tell you the story my names felix and this is van who needs any antihistamines you can spare i can spare felix old pal i have enough dope here to last a hundred years this stuffs going to expire long before it runs out but are you telling me that the nets still up its still up he said kind of thats what weve been doing all week keeping it online it might not last much longer though no she said i dont suppose it would she set the axe down have you got anything to trade i dont need much but ive been trying to keep my spirits up by trading with the neighbors its like playing civilization you have neighbors at least ten she said the people in the restaurant across the way make a pretty good soup even if most of the veg is canned they cleaned me out of sterno though youve got neighbors and you trade with them well nominally itd be pretty lonely without them ive taken care of whatever sniffles i could set a bone broken wrist listen do you want some wonder bread and peanut butter i have a ton of it your friend looks like he could use a meal yes please van said we dont have anything to trade but were both committed workaholics looking to learn a trade could you use some assistants not really she spun her axe on its head but i wouldnt mind some company they ate the sandwiches and then some soup the restaurant people brought it over and made their manners at them though felix saw their noses wrinkle up and ascertained that there was working plumbing in the back room van went in to take a sponge bath and then he followed none of us know what to do the woman said her name was rosa and she had found them a bottle of wine and some disposable plastic cups from the housewares aisle i thought wed have helicopters or tanks or even looters but its just quiet you seem to have kept pretty quiet yourself felix said didnt want to attract the wrong kind of attention you ever think that maybe theres a lot of people out there doing the same thing maybe if we all get together well come up with something to do or maybe theyll cut our throats she said van nodded shes got a point felix was on his feet no way we cant think like that lady were at a critical juncture here we can go down through negligence dwindling away in our hiding holes or we can try to build something better better she made a rude noise ok not better something though building something new is better than letting it dwindle away christ what are you going to do when youve read all the magazines and eaten all the potato chips here rosa shook her head pretty talk she said but what the hell are we going to do anyway something felix said were going to do something something is better than nothing were going to take this patch of the world where people are talking to each other and were going to expand it were going to find everyone we can and were going to take care of them and theyre going to take care of us well probably fuck it up well probably fail id rather fail than give up though van laughed felix you are crazier than sario you know it were going to go and drag him out first thing tomorrow hes going to be a part of this too everyone will screw the end of the world the world doesnt end humans arent the kind of things that have endings rosa shook her head again but she was smiling a little now and youll be what the popeemperor of the world he prefers prime minister van said in a stagey whisper the antihistamines had worked miracles on his skin and it had faded from angry red to a fine pink you want to be minister of health rosa he said boys she said playing games how about this ill help out however i can provided you never ask me to call you prime minister and you never call me the minister of health its a deal he said van refilled their glasses upending the wine bottle to get the last few drops out they raised their glasses to the world felix said to humanity he thought hard to rebuilding to anything van said to anything felix said to everything to everything rosa said they drank he wanted to go see the house see kelly and though his stomach churned at the thought of what he might find there but the next day they started to rebuild and months later they started over again when disagreements drove apart the fragile little group theyd pulled together and a year after that they started over again and five years later they started again it was nearly six months before he went home van helped him along riding cover behind him on the bicycles they used to get around town the further north they rode the stronger the smell of burnt wood became there were lots of burntout houses sometimes marauders burnt the houses theyd looted but more often it was just nature the kinds of fires you got in forests and on mountains there were six choking burnt blocks where every house was burnt before they reached home but felixs old housing development was still standing an oasis of eerily pristine buildings that looked like maybe their somewhat neglectful owners had merely stepped out to buy some paint and fresh lawnmower blades to bring their old homes back up to their neat groomed selves that was worse somehow he got off the bike at the entry of the subdivision and they walked the bikes together in silence listening to the sough of the wind in the trees winter was coming late that year but it was coming and as the sweat dried in the wind felix started to shiver he didnt have his keys anymore they were at the datacenter months and worlds away he tried the doorhandle but it didnt turn he applied his shoulder to the door and it ripped away from its wet rotted jamb with a loud splintering sound the house was rotting from the inside the door splashed when it landed the house was full of stagnant water four inches of stinking pondscummed water in the living room he splashed carefully through it feeling the floorboards sag spongily beneath each step up the stairs his nose full of that terrible green mildewy stench into the bedroom the furniture familiar as a childhood friend kelly was in the bed with the way they both lay it was clear they hadnt gone easy they were twisted double kelly curled around their skin was bloated making them almost unrecognizable the smell god the smell felixs head spun he thought he would fall over and clutched at the dresser an emotion he couldnt name rage anger sorrow made him breathe hard gulp for air like he was drowning and then it was over the world was over kelly and over and he had a job to do he folded the blanket over them van helped solemnly they went into the front yard and took turns digging using the shovel from the garage that kelly had used for gardening they had lots of experience digging graves by then lots of experience handling the dead they dug and wary dogs watched them from the tall grass on the neighboring lawns but they were also good at chasing off dogs with wellthrown stones when the grave was dug they laid felixs wife and son to rest in it felix quested after words to say over the mound but none came hed dug so many graves for so many mens wives and so many womens husbands and so many children the words were long gone felix dug ditches and salvaged cans and buried the dead he planted and harvested he fixed some cars and learned to make biodiesel finally he fetched up in a datacenter for a little government little governments came and went but this one was smart enough to want to keep records and needed someone to keep everything running and van went with him they spent a lot of time in chat rooms and sometimes they happened upon old friends from the strange time theyd spent running the distributed republic of cyberspace geeks who insisted on calling him pm though no one in the real world ever called him that anymore it wasnt a good life most of the time felixs wounds never healed and neither did most other peoples there were lingering sicknesses and sudden ones tragedy on tragedy but felix liked his datacenter there in the humming of the racks he never felt like it was the first days of a better nation but he never felt like it was the last days of one either go to bed felix soon kong soonalmost got this backup running youre a junkie dude look whos talking he reloaded the google homepage queen kong had had it online for a couple years now the os in google changed all the time whenever she got the urge today they were little cartoon globes one smiling the other frowning he looked at it for a long time and dropped back into a terminal to check his backup it was running clean for a change the little governments records were safe ok night night take care van waved at him as he creaked to the door stretching out his back with a long series of pops sleep well boss he said dont stick around here all night again felix said you need your sleep too youre too good to us grunts van said and went back to typing felix went to the door and walked out into the night behind him the biodiesel generator hummed and made its acrid fumes the harvest moon was up which he loved tomorrow hed go back and fix another computer and fight off entropy again and why not it was what he did he was a sysadmin the last of the oforms by james van pelt james van pelt is the author of the novel summer of the apocalypse and nearly short stories which have mostly appeared in analog asimovs realms of fantasy and talebones he also has two collections strangers and beggars and the last of the oforms and other stories van pelt had been writing a series of stories about slowerthanlight ark ships fleeing earth when it occurred to him that he had generalized that the ark ship passengers were escaping from the mutation plagues and it might be interesting to write about what was going on back on earth thus the last of the oforms was born this story which was a finalist for the nebula award takes place in a world where there are no more normal births each and every one is a mutationwhich is both good and bad for dr trevins traveling zoological extravaganza beyond the big rigs open window the mississippi river lands rolled darkly by boggy areas caught the moon low on the horizon like a silver coin flickering through blacktreed hummocks or strained by splitrail fence mile after mile the air smelled damp and deadfish mossy heavy as a wet towel but it was better than the animal enclosures on a hot afternoon when the sun pounded the awnings and the exhibits huddled in weak shade traveling at night was the way to go trevin counted the distance in minutes theyd blow through roxie soon then hit hamburg mcnair and harriston in quick secession in fayette there was a nice diner where they could get breakfast but it meant turning off the highway and theyd hit the worst of vicksburgs morning traffic if they stopped no the thing to do was to keep driving driving to the next town where he could save the show he reached across the seat to the grocery sack between him and caprice she was asleep her babyblonde head resting against the door her small hands holding a greek edition of the odyssey open on her lap if she were awake she could glance at the map and tell him exactly how many miles they had left to mayersville how long to the minute at this speed it would take and how much diesel to the ounce theyd have left in their tanks her littlegirl eyes would pin him to the wall why cant you figure this out on your own theyd ask he thought about hiding her phone book so shed have nothing to sit on and couldnt look out the window that would show her she might look two years old but she was really twelve and had the soul of a middleaged tax attorney at the sacks bottom beneath an empty donut box he found the beef jerky it tasted mostly of pepper but underneath it had a tingly metallic flavor he tried not to think about who knew what it might have been made from he doubted there were any originalform cows the ocows left to slaughter after a long curve a city limit sign loomed out of the dark trevin stepped on the brakes then geared down roxie cops were infamous for speed traps and there wasnt enough bribe money in the kitty to make a ticket go away in his rearview mirror the other truck and a car with hardy the handyman and his crew of roustabouts closed ranks roxies traffic signal blinked yellow over an empty intersection while the closed shops stood mute under a handful of streetlights after the fourblock long downtown another mile of beatup houses and trailers lined the road where broken washing machines and pickups on cinder blocks dotted moonlit front yards something barked at him from behind a chain link fence trevin slowed for a closer look professional curiosity it looked like an odog under a porch light an originalform animal an old one if his stiffgaited walk was an indicator werent many of those left anymore not since the mutagen hit trevin wondered if the owners keeping an odog in the backyard had troubles with their neighbors if there was jealousy a toddler voice said if we dont clear in mayersville well have to sell a truck daddy dont call me daddy ever he took a long curve silently twolaned highways often had no shoulder and concentration was required to keep safe i didnt know you were awake besides a thousand will do it caprice closed her book in the darkness of the cab trevin couldnt see her eyes but he knew that they were polarice blue she said a thousand for diesel sure but were weeks behind on payroll the roustabouts wont stand for another delay not after what you promised in gulfport the extension on the quarterly taxes is past and i cant keep the feds off like the other creditors by pledging extra payments for a couple months weve got food for most of the animals for ten days or so but we have to buy fresh meat for the tigerzelle and the crocomouse or theyll die we stay afloat with but just barely trevin scowled it had been years since hed found her littlegirl voice and littlegirl pronunciation to be cute and almost everything she said was sarcastic or critical it was like living with a pintsized advocate for his own self doubt so we need a house of he wrinkled his forehead divided by four and a half bucks five hundred and seventyeight thatll leave you an extra dollar for a cup of coffee caprice said we havent had a take that big since ferriday last fall and that was because oktoberfest in natchez closed early thank god for louisiana liquor laws we ought to admit the shows washed up cut the inventory loose sell the gear and pay off the help she turned on the goosenecked reading light that arced from the dashboard and opened her book if we can hold on until rosedale he remembered rosedale when they last came through seven years ago the city had recruited him sent letters and emails theyd met him in new orleans with a committee including a brunette beauty who squeezed his leg under the table when they went out to dinner we cant caprice said trevin recalled the hand on his leg feeling good and warm hed almost jumped from the table his face flushed the soybean festival draws them in everythings made out of soybeans soybean pie soybean beer soybean ice cream he chuckled we cleaned up there i got to ride down main street with the rosedale soybean queen were dead take your pulse she didnt look up the rosedale soybean queen had been friendly too and oh so grateful that hed brought the zoo to town he wondered if she still lived there he could look her up yeah if we make the soybean festival well do fine one good show and were sailing again ill repaint the trucks folks love us when we come into town music playing worlds greatest traveling novelty zoo you remember when newsweek did that story god that was a day he glanced out the window again the moon rested on the horizon now pacing them big as a beachball like a burnished hubcap rolling with them in the night rolling up the mississippi twenty miles to the west he could smell the river flowing to the sea how could she doubt that they would make it big ill show her he thought wipe that smirk off her littlegirl face ill show her in mayersville and then rosedale moneyll be falling off the tables well have to store it in sacks shell see grinning he dug deep for another piece of beef jerky and he didnt think at all what it tasted like this time trevin pulled the truck into mayersville at half past ten keeping his eyes peeled for their posters and flyers hed sent a box of them up two weeks earlier and if the boy hed hired had done his job they should have been plastered everywhere but he only saw one and it was torn nearly in half there were several banners welcoming softball teams to the southcentral spring time regional softball tourney and the hotels sported no vacancy signs so the crowds were there he turned the music on and it blared from the loudspeakers on top of the truck zoos in town he thought come see the zoo but other than a couple of geezers sitting in front of the barbershop who watched them coolly as they passed no one seemed to note their arrival they cant play ball all day eh caprice theyve got to do something in between games she grunted her laptop was open on the seat beside her and she was doubleentering receipts and bills into the ledger the fairgrounds were on the north edge of town next to the ball fields a park attendant met them at the gates then climbed onto the running board so his head was just below the window theres a hundred dollar occupancy fee he said his face hidden beneath a widebrimmed straw hat that looked like it had been around the world a few times trevin drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and stayed calm we paid for the site up front the attendant shrugged its a hundred dollars or you find some other place to plant yourself caprice on her knees leaned across trevin she deepened her voice in her best trevin impersonation do we make that check out to mayersville city parks or to issaquena county startled the attendant looked up before caprice could duck out of sight his sixtyyearold face as dusty as his hat cash no checks thats what i thought she said to trevin as she moved back from the window give him twenty there better be the portable potties and the electrical hookups we ordered trevin flicked the bill to him and the attendant caught it neatly in flight as he stepped off the running board hey mister he said how olds your little girl a million and ten asshole said trevin dropping the clutch to move the big rig forward ive told you to stay out of sight well get into all kinds of trouble if the locals find out ive got a mutant keeping the books they have labor laws you know whyd you tell me to give him any money anyway we could have bought a day or two of meat with that caprice stayed on her knees to look out her window hes really a janitor never piss off the janitor hey they cleaned this place up a bit there was a patch of woods between us and the river last time trevin leaned on the wheel turning the truck was tough at anything less than highway speed would you want trees and brush next to where you were playing softball you chase a foul shot into the undergrowth and never come back beyond the fair grounds the land sloped down to the levee and past that flowed the mississippi less than a hundred yards away a great muddy plain marked with lines of sullen grey foam drifting under the midmorning sun a black barge so distant that he couldnt hear it chug upstream trevin noted with approval the endless stretch of tenfoottall chainlink fence between them and the river who knew what godawful thing might come crawling out of there as always it took most of the day to set up the big animals stinking of hot fur and unwashed cage bottoms in their eightfoothigh enclosures came out of the semitrailers first looking lethargic and sick the tigerzelle a longlegged hoofed animal sporting almost no neck below an impressive face filled with saberlike teeth barely looked up as its cage was lowered to the soggy ground it hooted softly trevin checked its water get a tarp over it right away he said to handyman harper a big grouchy man who wore old rock concert tshirts inside out trevin added that trailer had to be a hundred and twenty degrees inside looking at the animal fondly trevin remembered when hed acquired it from a farm in illinois one of the first american mutababies before the mutagen was recognized and named before it became a plague the tigerzelles sister was almost as bizarre heavy legs scaly skin and a long thin head like a whippet but the farmer had already killed it by the time trevin arrived their mother as ordinary a cow as youd ever see looked at its children with dull confusion what the hells wrong with my cow asked the farmer several times until they started dickering for the price once trevin had paid him the man said ifn i get any other weirdlookin animal you want i should give you a call trevin smelled profit charging twenty dollars per customer he cleared ten thousand a week in june and july showing the tigerzelle from the back of his pickup he thought i may not be too smart but i do know how to make a buck by the end of the summer dr trevins traveling zoological extravaganza was born that was the year caprice rode beside him in a childs car seat her momma dead in childbirth in august they were going north from senetobia to memphis and at eleven months old caprice said her first words isnt eighty over the speed limit even then there was a biting sardonic tone to her voice trevin nearly wrecked the truck the crocomouse snarled and bit at the bars as it came out its furry snout banging against the metal it threw its two hundred pounds against the door and almost tipped the cage out of the handlers grip keep your hands away snapped harper to his crew or youll be taping a pencil to a stub to write your mommas then the rest of the animals were unloaded a porcumander the warped child of a bullfrog that waved its wet thorny hide at every shadow the unigoose about the size of a wild turkey atop four tiny legs shedding ragged feathers by the handful below the pearllike glinting horn and each of the other mutababies the unrecognizable progeny of cats and squirrels and horses and monkeys and seals and every other animal trevin could gather to the zoo big cages little ones aquariums terrariums little corrals bird cages tethering polesall came out for display by sunset the last animal had been arranged and fed circus flags fluttered from the semitrailer truck tops the loudspeakers perched atop their posts the park attendant wandered through the cages his hands pushed deep into his pockets as casual and friendly as if he hadnt tried to rip them off earlier in the day yall best stay in your trucks once the sun sets if youre camping here suspicious trevin asked whys that the man raised his chin toward the river which was glowing red like a bloody stain in the setting sun water level was up a couple days ago over the fences the levee held but any sorta teethy mutoid might be floppin around on our side now its got so you cant step in a puddle without somethin takin a bite outta ya civil defense volunteers walk the banks everyday lookin for the more cantankerous critters but its a big old river you got a gun trevin shrugged baseball bat maybe well get lucky and add something to the zoo you expecting crowds for the softball tournament thirtytwo teams we shipped in extra bleachers trevin nodded if he started the music early in the morning maybe hed attract folks waiting for games nothing like a little amusement before the heat set in after a couple of minutes the park attendant left trevin was glad to see him walk away he had the distinct impression that the man was looking for something to steal after dinner caprice clambered into the upper bunk her short legs barely giving her enough of a reach to make it trevin kicked his blanket aside even though it was after ten it was still over ninety degrees and there wasnt a hint of a breeze most of the animals had settled in their cages only the tigerzelle made noise one long warbling hoot after another a soft melodic call that hardly fit its ferocious appearance you lay low tomorrow im not kidding said trevin after hed turned off the light i dont want you driving people off caprice sniffed loudly its pretty ironic that i cant show myself at a mutoid zoo im tired of hiding away like a freak another fifty years and there wont be any of your kind left anyway might as well accept the inevitable im the future they should be able to deal with that trevin put his hands behind his head and stared up at her bunk through the screen hed fitted over the windows he could hear the mississippi lapping against the bank an animal screeched in the distance its call a cross between a whistle and a bad cough he tried to imagine what would make a sound like that finally he said people dont like human mutoids at least ones that look human whys that she asked all the sarcasm and bitterness suddenly gone im not a bad person if theyd get to know me we could discuss books or philosophy im a mind not just a body the animal cried out again in the dark over and over until in midscreech it stopped a heavy thrashing sound followed by splashes marked the creatures end i guess it makes them sad caprice do i make you sad in the truck cabs dim interior she sounded exactly like a twoyearold he remembered when she was a little girl before he knew that she wasnt normal that shed never grow up that her dna showed that she wasnt human before she started talking uppity and making him feel stupid with her babydoll eyes before hed forbidden her to call him dad hed thought she looked a little like her mother then he still caught echoes of her when caprice combed her hair or when she fell asleep and her lips parted to take a breath just like her mother the air caught in his throat thinking of those times no caprice you dont make me sad hours later long after caprice had gone to sleep trevin drifted off into a series of dreams where he was being smothered by steaming turkish towels and when he threw the towels off his creditors surrounded him they carried paymentoverdue notices and none of them were human trevin was up before dawn to feed the animals half the trick of keeping the zoo running was in figuring out what the creatures ate just because the parent had been say an oform horse didnt mean hay was going to do the trick caprice kept extensive charts for him the animals weight how much food it consumed what vitamin supplements seemed most helpful there were practicalities to running a zoo he dumped a bucket of corn on the cob into the pigahumps cage it snorted then lumbered out of the doghouse it stayed in not looking much like a pig or any other animal trevin knew eyes like saucers it gazed at him gratefully before burying its face in the trough he moved down the rows mealworms in one cage grain in the next bones from the butcher dog food spoiled fish bread cereal old vegetables oats the tigerzelle tasted the rump roast he tossed in its delicate tongue so like a cats lapping at the meat before it tore a small chunk off to chew delicately it cooed in contentment at the end of the row closest to the river two cages were knocked off their display stands and smashed black blood and bits of meat clung to the twisted bars and both animals the cages had contained blind leathery birdlike creatures were gone trevin sighed and walked around the cages inspecting the ground in a muddy patch a single webbed print a foot across marked with four deep claw indents showed the culprit a couple of partial prints led up from the river trevin put his finger in the track which was a halfinch deep the ground was wet but firm it took a hard press to push just his fingertip a halfinch he wondered at the weight of the creature and made a note to himself that tonight theyd have to store the smaller cages in the truck which would mean more work he sighed again by eight the softball fields across the park had filled players warmed up outside the fences while games took place tents to house teams or for food booths sprang up trevin smiled and turned on the music banners hung from the trucks dr trevins traveling zoological extravaganza see natures oddities educational entertaining by noon there had been fifteen paying customers leaving hardy in charge of tickets trevin loaded a box with handbills hung a staple gun to his belt then marched to the ballfields handing out flyers the sun beat down like a humid furnace and only the players in the field werent under tents or umbrellas several folks offered him a beerhe took onebut his flyers wrinkly with humidity vanished under chairs or behind coolers were doing a first day of the tournament special he said two bucks each or three for you and a friend his shirt clung to his back well be open after sunset when its cooler these are displays not to be missed folks a woman in her twenties her cheeks sunreddened her blonde hair tied back said i dont need to pay to see a reminder damn it she crumpled the paper and dropped it one of her teammates sitting on the ground a beer between his knees said give him a break doris hes just trying to make a living trevin said we were in newsweek you might have read about us maybe well come over later fella said the player on the ground doris popped a can open it might snow this afternoon too maybe it will said trevin congenially he headed toward town on the other side of the fairgrounds the sun pressured his scalp with prickly fire by the time hed gone a hundred yards he wished hed worn a hat but it was too hot to go back he stapled a flyer to the first telephone pole he came to yep he said to himself a little publicity and well rake it in the sidewalk shimmered in white heat waves as he marched from pole to pole past the hardware past the liquor store past the baptist churchsuffer the children read the marqueepast the pool hall and the auto supply shop he went inside every store and asked the owner to post his sign most did behind main street stood several blocks of homes trevin turned up one street and down the next stapling flyers noting with approval the wire mesh over the windows cant be too careful nowadays he said his head swimming in the heat the beer seemed to be evaporating through his skin all at once and he felt sticky with it the sun pulsed against his back the magic number is fiveseventyeight he thought it beat within him like a song call it six hundred six hundred folks come to the zoo come to the zoo come to the zoo when he finally made his way back to the fairgrounds the sun was on its way down trevin dragged his feet but the flyers were gone evening fell trevin waited at the ticket counter in his zoomasters uniform a broadshouldered red suit with gold epaulets the change box popped open with jingly joy the roll of tickets was ready circus music played softly from the loudspeakers as fireflies flickered in the darkness above the river funny he thought how the mutagen affected only the bigger vertebrate animals not micesized mammals or little lizards not small fish or bugs or plants what would a bug mutate into anyway they look alien to begin with he chuckled to himself his walkingupthesidewalk song still echoing six hundred folks come to the zoo come to the zoo come to the zoo every car that passed on the highway trevin watched waiting for it to slow for the turn into the fairgrounds from sunset until midnight only twenty customers bought admissions most of them were ball players whod discovered that there wasnt much nightlife in mayersville clouds had moved in and distant lightning flickered within their steelwool depths trevin spun the roll of tickets back and forth on its spool an old farmer couple wearing overalls their clothes stained with rich mississippi soil shuffled past on their way out you got some strange animals here mister said the old man his wife nodded but nothing stranger than what ive found wandering in my fields for the last few years gettin so i dont remember what oform normal looks like too close to the river said his wife thats our place right over there she pointed at a small farm house under a lone light just beyond the last ball field trevin wondered if they ever retrieved homerun balls off their porch the thin pile of bills in the cash box rustled under trevins fingers the money should be falling off the tables he thought we should be drowning in it the old couple stood beside him looking back into the zoo they reminded him of his parents not in their appearance but in their solid patience they werent going anywhere fast he had no reason to talk to them but there was nothing else left to do i was here a few years ago did really well whats happened the wife held her husbands hand she said this towns dyin mister dyin from the bottom up they closed the elementary school last fall no elementaryage kids if you want to see a real zoo display go down to issaquena county hospital pediatrics the penalty of parenthood not that many folks are having babies though or whatever you want to call them added the old man your zoos depressin id heard you had somethin special though said the woman shyly did you see the crocomouse asked trevin theres quite a story about that one and the tigerzelle have you seen that one saw em she said looking disappointed the old couple climbed into their pickup and it rattled into life after a halfdozen startergrinding tries i found a buyer in vicksburg for the truck said caprice trevin whirled she stood in the shadows beside the ticket counter a notebook jammed under her arm i told you to stay out of view whos going to see me you cant get customers even on a discount she gazed at the vacant lot we dont have to deliver it hes coming to town next week on other business i can do the whole transaction transfer the deed take the money all of it over the internet one taillight out the farmers pickup turned from the fairgrounds and onto the dirt road that led to their house which wasnt more than two hundred yards away what would we do with the animals he felt like weeping let the safe ones go kill the dangerous ones trevin rubbed his eyes she stamped her foot look this is no time for sentimentality the zoos a bust youre going to lose the whole thing soon anyway if youre too stubborn to give it all up sell this truck now and you get a few extra weeks maybe a whole season if we economize trevin looked away from her the fireflies still flickered above the river ill have to make some decisions he said heavily she held out the notebook ive already made them this is what will fit in one semitrailer i already let hardy and the roustabouts go with a severance check postdated what about the gear cages the county dump is north of here was that a note of triumph he detected in her voice trevin took the notebook she dropped her hands to her side chin up staring at him the zoos lights cast long shadows across her face i could kick her he thought and for a second his leg trembled with the idea of it he tucked the notebook under his arm go to bed caprice opened her mouth then clamped it shut on whatever she might have said she turned away long after shed vanished into the cab trevin sat on the stool elbow on his knee chin in his hand watching insects circle the lights the tigerzelle squatted on its haunches alert looking toward the river trevin remembered a ghastly cartoon hed seen once a couple of crones sat on the seat of a wagon full of bodies the one holding the reins turned to the other and said you know once the plague is over were out of a job the tigerzelle rose to its feet focusing on the river it paced intently in its cage never turning its head from the darkness trevin straightened what did it see out there for a long moment the tableau remained the same insects swirled around the lights which buzzed softly highlighting the cages shining metal against the enveloping spring night the pacing tigerzelle the ticket counters polished wood against trevins hand and the mississippis pungent murmuring in the background beyond the cages from the river a piece of blackness detached itself from the night trevin blinked in fascinated paralysis all the hairs dancing on the back of his neck the shortarmed creature stood taller than a man surveyed the zoo then dropped to all fours like a bear except that its skin gleamed with salamander wetness its triangular head sniffed at the ground moving over the moist dirt as if following a scent when it reached the first cage a small one that held the weaselsnake the river creature lifted its forelegs off the ground grasping the cage in webfingered claws in an instant the cage was unrecognizable and the weaselsnake was gone hey trevin yelled shaking off his stupor the creature looked at him reaching under the ticket counter trevin grabbed the baseball bat and advanced the monster turned away to pick up the next cage trevins face flushed no no no damn it he stepped forward again stepped again and suddenly he was running bat held overhead get away get away he brought the bat down on the animals shoulder with a meaty whump it shrieked trevin fell back dropping the bat to cover his ears it shrieked again loud as a train whistle for a dozen heartbeats it stood above him claws extended then it seemed to lose interest and moved to the next cage dismantling it with one jerk on the bars his ears ringing trevin snatched the bat off the ground and waded in swinging on its rear legs the monster bared its teeth dozens of glinting needles in the triangular jaw trevin nailed the creature in the side it folded with surprising flexibility backing away claws distended snarling in a deafening roar trevin swung missed the monster swiped at his leg ripping his pants and almost jerking his feet out from under him the thing moved clumsily backing down the hill toward the levee fence as trevin swung again missed it howled tried to circle around him trevin scuttled sideways careful of his balance on the slick dirt if he should fall the thing charged mouth open but pulled back like a threatened dog when trevin raised the bat he breathed in short gasps poked the bats end at it always shepherding it away from the zoo behind him a police siren sounded and car engines roared but he didnt dare look around he could only stalk and keep his bat at the ready after a long series of feints its back to the fence the nightmare stopped hunched its back and began to rise just as trevin brought the bat down in a twohanded overthehead chop through the bat he felt the skull crunch and the creature dropped into a shuddery mass in the mud trevin his pulse pounding swayed for a moment then sat beside the beast up the hill under the zoos lights people shouted into the darkness were they ball players town people a police cruisers lights blinked blue then red and three or four cars headlights on were parked near the trucks obviously they couldnt see him but he was too tired to call ignoring the wet ground he lay back the dead creature smelled of blood and river mud trevin rested a foot on it almost sorry that it was dead if he could have captured it what an addition it would have made to the zoo gradually the heavy beat in his chest calmed the mud felt soft and warm overhead the clouds thinned a bit scudding across the full moon at the zoo there was talking trevin craned his head around to see people jostled about and flashlights cut through the air they started down the hill trevin sighed he hadnt saved the zoo not really tomorrow would come and theyd leave one of the trucks behind in a couple of months it would all be gone the other truck the animalshe was most sorry about the tigerzellethe pulling into town with music blaring and flags flapping and people lined up to see the menagerie no more reason to wear the zoomasters uniform with its beautiful gold epaulets newsweek would never interview him again it was all gone if he could only sink into the mud and disappear then he wouldnt have to watch the dissolving of his own life he sat up so that they wouldnt think he was dead waved a hand when the first flashlight found him mud dripped from his jacket the policemen arrived first god almighty thats a big one the cop trained his light on the river creature told you the fences warnt no good said the other everyone stayed back except the police the first cop turned the corpse over laying on its back its little arms flopped to the side it didnt look nearly as big or intimidating more folk arrived some townies he didnt recognize the old couple from the farmhouse across the ball fields and finally caprice the flashlight looking almost too big for her to carry the first cop knelt next to the creature shoved his hat up off his forehead then said low enough that trevin guessed that only the other cop could hear him hey doesnt this look like the andersons kid they said theyd smothered him he wasnt half that big but i think youre right the other cop threw a coat over the creatures face then stood for a long time looking down at it dont say anything to them all right maggie anderson is my wifes cousin nothing here to see people announced the first cop in a much louder voice this is a dead un yall can head back home but the crowds attention wasnt on them anymore the flashlights turned on caprice its a baby girl someone said and they moved closer caprice shined her flashlight from one face to the other then desperation on her face she ran clumsily to trevin burying her face in his chest what are we going to do she whispered quiet play along trevin stroked the back of her head then stood a sharp twinge in his leg told him hed pulled something the world was all bright lights and he couldnt cover his eyes he squinted against them is that your girl mister someone said trevin gripped her closer her little hands fisted in his coat i havent seen a child in ten years said another voice the flashlights moved in closer the old farmer woman stepped into the circle her face suddenly illuminated can i hold your little girl son can i just hold her she extended her arms her hands quivering ill give you fifty bucks if you let me hold her said a voice behind the lights trevin turned slowly lights all around until he faced the old woman again a picture formed in his

scared up the hill the tigerzelle hooted and just beyond the fence barely visible by flashlight the mississippi gurgled and wept still life with apocalypse by richard kadrey richard kadrey is the author of six novels including angel scene butcher bird and the quintessential cyberpunk novel metrophage his short fiction has appeared in numerous anthologies as well as the magazines asimovs interzone omni and wired still life with apocalypse first appeared in the webzine the infinite matrix the version that appears here is revised and slightly expanded kadrey says that the story came from a dream image of horse carcasses being dragged from canals under industrial lights he took that image and turned it into a snapshot of life after everything has fallen apartabout the people left behind and the jobs they do to fill their days about the poor slobs who have to clean up the mess at the end of the world theyre dragging another horse from the canal its chestnut coat sheened bubblegum pink from the freon each night more pools bubble to the surface from deep underground freon old engine oil heavy water from forgotten nukes every day a few dozen more hungry animals drown in the stagnant pools looselimbed in death the horse sways raglike as the little diesel crane pulls it noisily from the muck and sets in on the pier with the other bodies in the bluetinted work lights we divide the dead into human and animal subdivide the animals into mammals and other then subdivide the others into vertebrates and invertebrates and so on i started out on information retrieval looking for documents in submerged government offices old libraries and bookstores once i came up in a police records vault surrounded by mug shots and photos of murder scenes and rapes i came up in an irs office where a dissatisfied citizen had gutted an auditor then placed the bureaucrats viscera on a photocopier i swam through hundreds of grainy duplicates of his liver and intestines i came up in adult bookshops and bought back waterlogged sex toys and old issues of wet messy fun bring back anything useful they said so why not everything i bought back went into one big pile to be sorted by information classification i wish there had been a war a plague or some new grand chernobyl something we could point to and say thats it thats what killed the world but it wasnt like that it started in new york or london mumbai possibly a minor traffic accidentjust a fender benderand someone missed a meeting which meant someone else couldnt send a fax which made someone else miss a plane that someone got into an argument with the cabbie and was shot no one knows by whom whatever happened the shooting sparked a riot tv cameras broadcast the riot live to a country so knotted with fury and tension that riots broke out from maine to hawaii when the footage hit the satellites riots spontaneously exploded around the world in the helinskivantaa airport a group of baggage handlers and striking sex workers pushed vending machines from third floor windows into the parking lot killing a visiting spanish diplomat in shanghai farmers and students went on a rampage destroying the newly built oceanfront casinos burning the buildings and tossing billions of yen into the harbor in new orleans children invaded the aboveground cemeteries and dragged the dead through the streets ancient national rivalries and recent jealousies surfaced around the world governments went into emergency sessions many politicians saw the sudden eruption of violence as an attack on their citizens as the work of terrorist cells others claimed it was a biblical plague ragnarok or the early return of the rudras i cant say how long its been since the world went to pieces all the clocks seem to have stopped a couple of kids built a sundial but with half the cities in the world still burning the sky is mostly a swirling soup of ash we keep warm by looting the libraries i used to wade through burning first the old periodicals then the card catalogs bestsellers and selfhelp books finally working our way up to the first editions some days the sky bursts open and rains fish sometimes stones or barbie dolls last night i cooked a sky salmon over an autographed copy of the great gatsby i shared the fish with natasha a mute girl who runs one of the cranes hauling carcasses from the freon pools shes been staying with me out by the docks in the cargo container i commandeered i killed a man to get the container and still have to slice and dice the occasional house crasher natashas not shy with a knife or length of rebar and has done more than a few intruders herself i assume the ones she did were intruders anyway it keeps us in meat im not sure that youd call what we have a typical romance i live with a girl who can make gloves from a poodles hide and scavenges boots and clothes for me and theyre always my size she grows herbs in a bathtub on the roof and decorates our home with windup toys and parts of smaashed statues from looted museums i miss ice cream convertibles and going to the movies im not fool enough to say that im happier since the world went away but except for the rains of stones im no more miserable they found a layer of zoo animals under the collapsed roadway of the williamsburg bridge people over there have been living large on elephant steaks and giraffe burgers the local government wants us to help gather up the remaining body parts so we do no one asks why its something to do besides the paper pushers refuse to let the world end until every form is turned in timestamped and properly initialed apocalypse is the last gasp of bureaucracy after dinner natasha and i sit on top of the cargo container watching a field full of cop cars sink slowly into a newly risen tar pit everyone from the docks is there we give might whoop as the last car slides bubbling below the surface will the last person on the planet please turn off the lights arties angels by catherine wells catherine wells is the author of several books including the postapocalyptic novel mother grimm and the coconino trilogy the earth is all that lasts children of the earth and the earth saver her latest is stones of destiny her first foray into historical fiction her short fiction has appeared in asimovs and analog and the anthologies redshift and the doom of camelot this story which first appeared in realms of fantasy was inspired by a disturbing dream wells had more than years ago in the dream a young man shimmied up a drainpipe in a tenement to visit his friend and although he was a good person someone came to his bicycle shop and fired a shotgun through the plate glass window the senselessness and injustice of that dream event haunted wells and years later as she rode a tandem bicycle along the back roads of arizona she imagined a postapocalyptic society involving bicycles and young man such as the one in her dream and arties angels was the result when you set out to perpetrate a lie i suppose its counterproductive to write down the truth like this but whatever population survives here on earth is not likely to read this much less believe it most of them cant read anymore as it isnot bookenglish anywayand it will probably get worse before it gets better much much worse my birth name is faye but i have not used it since i was ten thats the year we moved inside the radiation shield into a wreck of a building in kansas habitat my mother cried because my little brother died just before we got there and she kept moaning that if only wed gotten inside sooner he might have lived but you had to have either money or skills to get inside the radiation shield and my parents had neither so we fried our skins and our eyeballs in earths unfiltered sunlight until enough rich people moved offworld to make room for us under the shield artie knocked at my window the first night hed shinnied up the drainpipe from his apartment just below the artificial rain no longer worked in our sector of course because the infrastructure was well on the road to hell but the drainpipe was still there artie dangelo was this skinny kid just my age a little goofylooking but agile as a monkey when i saw him hanging on that drainpipe i was more amazed than frightened hi he said through the glass grinning widely he had dark curly hair deep brown eyes and big ears i climbed onto my bed which was under the window and stared at him you gonna open up he asked or let me hang on this drainpipe all night with a glance over my shoulder to make sure my door was shut i lifted the sash and artie climbed in im artie he introduced i live downstairs faye i replied you cant use the door i knocked before he said but no one would answer i knew the cause of that my dads scared to open the door i told artie he shrugged in this neighborhood youre better off but i saw you moving in and i thought you must be from outside so youd probably need someone to show you around during the next months artie did just that born in kanhab he knew its grid upground and under if not for his tutelage i would probably have died in that first year by the time they got around to letting dregs like my family in half the sectors were more or less lawless and a yearold kid could easily get snuffed if she didnt know where to run and where to hide artie taught me that and more in those early days he was my salvation in these latter days i shall be his it was while we were hiding from the citizen patrols in b that he first spoke the name i took as my own that was back when the sisters of literacy still tried to run schools in b which was as close as they would get to b where artie and i lived school didnt excite me but mom wanted me to go and artie insisted crossing into b was at least as safe as living in b most of the time that was true but not when the citizen patrols were out we knew there was going to be trouble that day because melissas desk had been empty at roll call and word got around by recess that shed been found in a trash bin missing a few parts so the citizen patrols were out that afternoon looking for someone to punish bers were a favorite target artie and i ran from shadow to shaft upground and under trying to stay out of their way we watched from beneath an abandoned maintenance cart as they rousted three teenage boys playing hoops in the street the boys must have scanned as bs because the cps started to walk away but then one of the boys said something something dirty and cruel and a cp just shot him with a crossbow that is because no pulse or projectile weapons were ever allowed in the habitatstoo much danger of damaging the shielding when the other two boys went for their knives the cps shot them too id seen people die beforethings were even worse outside than under the shield but this was the first time i knewi knewif i twitched id be next one cp went over to kick the boys and make sure they were dead another one cut open the mouthy boys pants and sliced off his privates thats for melissa i heard him say and he flung the bloody flesh across the street it landed right beside the cart where we lay hidden the sight of it there so close to my face made me gag in horror i stuffed my fist in my mouth to keep from screaming and artie pulled me to him pushing my face against his scrawny chest and holding me tight sh he breathed in my ear knowing both how terrified i was and how bad it would be if the cp heard us they cant hurt you they cant hurt you faye becausebecause youre magic i was so startled i stopped crying wondering what in the dying world he was talking about i couldnt see the civilian patrol the way he had me pressed up against him but after a minute or two he let go of me so i knew they had gone what you say magic i demanded in the barest of whispers not knowing how far away they were they left didnt they he whispered back magic youve got the magic name i told him what i thought he was full of maybe he agreed checking the street carefully to be sure it really was clear but your name faye thats like morgan lefey right he started to squirm out from under the cart i squirmed right after him who king arthurs sister he said she was magic she took arthur to the isle of avalon where he couldnt die later that night artie shinnied up the drainpipe to my room and we sat there for hours in the dark while he told me stories of king arthur and his knights men who defended the helpless instead of victimizing them men who fought against the villains of their age and inevitably prevailed not until many years later did i learn what a spin he put on the stories for me that night to make me believe that once there had been people who cared about the likes of me who stood for justice and nobility of spirit who made it honorable to protect the weak that night i took the name of morgan not because i ever believed it was magic but because i wanted to be a part of that ideal i needed the hope that king arthur represented and i saw it in my arthurartie to think of myself as his sister pleased me in a quiet deep way i could not explain nor was i the only one so drawn to artie he had already begun to acquire a following when i met him children he had grown up with and others like myself whom he befriended along the way there was safety in numbers as long as no crossbows were involved a pack offered the protection of a dozen knives that could not all be taken away at once and then we discovered another form of protectionor rather artie discovered it and it changed him it changed us all we were thieves in those days i hate to say it but thats what we were artie was a thief i was a thief there was an ethic to our larceny for we never stole from people poorer and weaker than we werethe rather rude beginnings of the code but we took things we did not own and thought no more of it than a goat thinks of cropping grass thats how we came by the first bicycles jose started it a procurement convoy had come in from outside loaded with goods for the launch pad thats what we called the sectors where the engineers and administrators and other elite live those who will surely have berths on the next transport ship carrying people away from this dying planet while the last driver stopped to flirt with the gatekeeper josh jimmied the lock on his truck and slipped inside he was working for some older kids of course but by the time they road blocked the convoy in g jose had the cargo mapped out so they knew which crates to snatch one of them had six bicycles the bike was his fee no one could have been prouder than jose when he showed up with that bicycle he carried it on his shoulder because he didnt know how to ride and it had slipped its chain anyway artie looked at it and looked at it and i could see the ideas spinning through his head like a cyclone he was thirteen by then and though he was still skinny hed grown into his ears and his teeth enough so the girls were starting to give him second looks but when an idea possessed him he still looked like a goofy kid his mouth hanging slack and his eyes glazed over you can ride it right jose asked because like most of the younger kids he believed implicitly that artie knew everything worth knowing and had all skills worth acquiring artie had even wrangled his way into spark academy which amazed everyone kids from b didnt get into spark academy most of them didnt bother with school at all artie had not answered joses question i wasnt sure he had even heard it i nudged him i can ride i told him softly learned outside bikes lay around freefornothing my old man he fix one up for me finally arties eyes left the bicycle and fastened on me still whirling with the enchantment of his racing thoughts your dad can fix bicycles i shrugged he know machines n things that how we got under shield finally learned him welding at that artie scowled and came back to the present dont talk street morgan he chided youve got to practice book english if youre going to get into the academy with me that was his dream for me that i would pass the entrance exams to go to spark academy too i worked at it because he thought i should but i never had much hope yes artie he knows something about bicycles i said with exaggerated articulation im not sure how much it was enough when my father got off shift he had the bike running in less than fifteen minutes then artie took it and me and found a deserted stretch of tunnel where he could master the twowheeler without an audience i was the only one he trusted to witness the ignominy of his early failures a week later when he returned the bike to jose he rode into the street where the others waited braked to a smooth stop and dismounted with practiced ease we need more of these artie announced we need every one of us to be mounted we can outrun anyone on these things we can pick up our families rations and not worry about being mugged on the way home because no one will be able to catch us we can get to a friend whos in trouble and we can get away from trouble when it comes looking for us bicycles are the answer and because he was artie we all believed him over the next year bicycles sprouted like primalloy mushrooms in the streets of b we lost one kid in the processtorey got shot by security making a run out of f where he should never have been grazingbut that left seventeen of us on wheels kniuhts of the wheel round i laughed you might wonder how artie could develop such a following win the loyalty of so many people who wouldand sometimes didsacrifice themselves and their own wellbeing to follow his code the answer im convinced lies in three qualities artie possessed in greater measure than other human beings compassion conviction and compulsion when artie latched onto a notion he pursued it with a focus ordinary mortals can t hope to achieve and the intensity of his devotion sucked other people in like a black hole bicycles became his world between my fathers sketchy knowledge and some books we found online artie not only learned how to maintain and repair the bikes he also learned frame geometry and stress factors and performance metrics i learned some too because you couldnt hang around artie and not learn but mostly i stuck with maintenance and repair it wasnt enough for him though that we should all learn to ride and care for our bikeswe had to train he had us up before dawn each day racing along the empty streets of b and b our legs grew thick with muscle as we vied with each other for dominance in speed and endurance soon we ventured out of our home sectors becoming a familiar sight throughout the upground bs and gs and even in parts of the as seventeen cyclists whooshing along in a pack at twentyplus miles an hour is an impressive sightthat was both good and bad a pack of thugs in a called the big dogs tried to lay traps for us whenever we crossed their sector and we crossed it often escorting artie to and from spark academy but we were always too quick and too smart and too mobile for them there were two reasons artie kept running the gauntlet to get to spark academy okay three the third was that he couldnt stand for someone to tell him he couldnt do something but the first was that he liked learning it charged his batteries he was into mechanical engineering and the teachers at spark actually encouraged him in that i guess they thought he could help keep habitat infrastructure from collapsing around us but the second reason he kept going to the academy was yvonne now artie had girlfriends in the neighbourhood and had since he was old enough to understand why a man would want to insert tab a into slot b he didnt exactly tell me the first time he got laidhe did have some notion that i was a girl and wouldnt appreciate hearing about his conquestsbut i knew it had happened because i saw the girl try to take ownership of him fat chance she had artie always had champagne taste when it came to girls and you dont find champagne in b yvonne was champagne i never met her but i knew because artie told me all about her hed lost his heart and it wasnt the kind of thing you could tell other guys so he told me most of what he was learning in spark academy he confided he could pick up out of books and vids that were available remotely even on the archaic b equipment and besides he could earn a ration just running the courier service hed started so he didnt really need to get into a university program but a girl like yvonne wouldnt marry a courier and live in b so he had to get a degree and a better housing assignment so he could make a life with yvonne for the record i think he would have gone to the academy anyway not that he didnt like running courierhe liked using his cycling skills evading obstacles flirting with danger only to escape he liked organizing the rest of us as couriers and he liked being able to deliver packages quickly and safely for people who were afraid to walk the streets as with protecting smaller children and helping outsiders adjust to the habitat it was a way for him to touch peoples lives and make them better the need to do that was deep in him and it was the foundation of the code he established for yvonne though he needed to be more than a courier the others in our pack knew artie had an academy girlfriend but they assumed she was no different than the girls he fooled around with in bexcept it was somehow more exciting to get your rocks offwith some c princess so the rest of the guys looked at artie in awe that was why when yvonne dumped him he climbed the drainpipe to my room and cried in my arms we were never lovers artie and i he never wanted me that way and i knew better than to try enticing him it would have been laughable i am a homely woman and i was an ugly child my mother said it was the radiation i endured outsideshe blamed everything on radiationbut i didnt have to look far to find the long jaw and the closeset eyes i inherited or the limp colorless hair and crooked teeth my shape too eschews beauty i have a bony frame and tiny breasts there are boys who dont care what slot b looks like as long as it will accommodate tab a but artie was never one of them so i held him the night yvonne rejected his love knowing this was as close to him as i would ever get the next day he went out and built his first bicycle before he graduated from spark academy the counsellors there tried to push him into vocational training because he was so gifted in working with his hands carving moulding welding wouldnt you be happier they asked crafting components building machines turning out a product if yvonne had dumped him earlier he might have yielded to their pressure but he had told them he could do both design and build with his heart torn to shreds he needed to prove that it was no work of art that first bicycle primalloy tubes patchwelded together but it was serviceable and it was a start deron and i took over running the courier businesswe already handled the routine maintenance and repair of our pack bicyclesso artie would have time to build his instructors in the university engineering program derided him he told me for wasting his time building toys new robots to evacuate clogged water and sewer lines or innovative geometries to prop up the sagging tunnels of kanhabthose were projects worthy of a mechanical engineer they said not swift transportation through the unsavoury streets of lawless sectors but he did all they asked of him by day and when darkness blanketed kanhab he locked the front door of the abandoned storefront that served as our headquarters called up his drawings and began to build artie made it his business to see that every child in b who kept the code had a sleek efficient machine that could carry him or her away from danger the code was fairly simple at that point take care of your bike and your friends never fight when you can run study and learn make things better for everyone not just yourself those same tenets were required of everyone in his pack by this time we had left thievery behind and were a legitimate business recognized by admin delivering parcels and providing reconnaissance for electric cart convoys and groups of pedestrians throughout kanhab we wore patches that showed we were part of arties packarties angels we called ourselveswith authorization to cross sectors and ride through public tunnels and buildings admin gave us helmets gloves and light body armour as part of our ration and they stamped out cleats for artie to fasten on flexible steelshanked shoes so we could lock into our pedals when we rode as a pack armoured and shod identically people stood aside gaping as our customer base expanded to other sectors our fees originally accepted as comestibles tools and clothingwere paid more and more in excees or exchange credits flushed through habitat accounting and redeemable in rations entertainment or just about anything else we could want i drew a single ration for myself and gave everything else i earned to artie to buy materials for the bicycles that gave the kids of b a chance a chance to learn a chance to grow a chance to believe in the goodness and worth of other people but its hard to give hope to a dying planet all the time artie was trying to make things better in b outside kanhab life became more and more futile plants and animals died in the unfiltered sunlight people starved to death babies were born with mutations so horrible their own parents killed them brutality reigned for life was short and ugly and people snatched what pleasure they could too often that meant the adrenalin rush gained by inflicting ones will on someone or something else how long the reapers were a problem outside i dont know but the day they broke through security into kanhab is a day we will never forget they rode old combustionengine motorcycles powered by whatever alcohol they could manufacture to fuel them their philosophy was nihilistic earth and its inhabitants were doomed so why not help them along the path to destruction whether or not they died in the process seemed of no consequence to the reapers of the twenty or so who crashed the gate that day only two made any effort to escape the certain death they found at the hands of kanhabs defenders but before they died eighteen security officers and over a hundred civilians fell to the reapers projectile weaponsnot to mention the people they simply rode down hundreds more burned to death in the fires they started infrastructure at the gate including the radiation shield was so badly damaged that admin sealed off the entire sector and simply built a new gate further in they did nothing to repair the collapsed tunnels and firegutted buildings of a and why should they physical space was not what kept people out of kanhab but the lack of food from our greenhouses housing was plentiful and it was only residential areas the reapers had terrorized in their eighteenhour frenzy of destruction artie got two months off from classes while he and other students helped repair the damage to the shield and other critical parts of the infrastructure one day as we worked in c undergroundartie as field engineer and deron and i as his crew chiefsthe most strikingly beautiful woman i have ever seen approached us tall and lithe with high cheekbones in an oval face and dark unblemished skin mr dangelo she asked and her voice was like thick cream a smooth rich fluid that spilled out and soaked into the thirsty air artie was smitten it was written all over his face as he stepped down from the ladder he had just mounted im artie dangelo he said i tried to see what saronda was seeing a wiry young man well shy of six feet with a flat gut and thighs like tree trunks dark hair clumped in curls from sweating beneath his hard hat redrimmed eyes and two days growth of beard telling how little he had done the past fortyeight hours except work to salvage something from the destruction but she smiled a smile as warm and sincere as it was brilliantly white im saronda mccabe i understand you build bicycles she was an electrical engineering student and her father worried about her travelling from her home in f to her practicum in c she thought a bicycle might be the answer artie agreed provided she also got some practical training in avoiding dangerwhich he of course would be happy to provide at no charge deron and i exchanged a look then took our crew in search of some lunch while the two of them made eyes and traded compliments ten excees hes in her pants before morning deron muttered as we turned a corner i didnt think soshe was highclass stuffbut i wasnt stupid enough to take the bet good thingi would have lost once sarondas bicycle was made we started swinging through f on our morning rides to pick her up for a couple of miles after which she and artie would break off and go their own waybecause he said she couldnt keep up with us quite yet that was true and they did stay with us longer as she improved but she had a housing assignment separate from her parentsher father was high up in adminand within a couple of months we were picking up artie in f too his bicycle building went by the wayside all the kids in b had bikes by this time anyway and every angel had a topnotch custom machine on weekends he came back to b to check on the courier operation and hang with his pack and he was still the same artie same huge smile same warm laugh same abiding concern for his neighbourhood but the kids missed him and some of them started acting out breaking the code that brought him back for a while because he recognized that his presence was necessary to keep them on track to keep them believing i worried more about him then though because when night came and things started locking up thats when hed get on his bicycle and head for f to see saronda it was a bad hour to be out without your pack i told myself that artie was making a terrible mistake that he was headed for another fall like with yvonne but i dont think i really believed that he was too happy and sarondablast her sculpted perfect facewas a nice person genuinely nice i liked her hard as i tried not to once she came with us into b because she wanted to see where artie and the rest of us lived to meet the children and hear them recite the code i wanted to join the sisters of literacy when i was younger she confided to me as artie explained to a nineyearold how the derailleur worked and the easiest way to replace a slipped chain but my dad wouldnt hear of it he pointed out that where were going she broke off suddenly and i saw the pain on her face before she changed the topic quickly but i knew i knew and i wanted to scream at artie for being so stupid and at saronda for not stopping this and at myself for not shaking them both and making them face realitybut they were so in love all we have here in b is moments i figured they were entitled to theirs it was september when the transport ship arrived and began to load those who could pay the coop fee for their passage off world there was a brief stir of excitement as a renegade reaper popped out from wherever hed been hiding for ten months to throw a homemade grenade at the shuttle when it docked he died with six crossbow bolts in his chest and some heroic security officer threw himself on the grenade so there was no damage to the shuttle but i watched it all on the news without much interest waiting instead for the tap at my window arties grin through the glass was forced you gonna open up he asked or let me hang on this drainpipe all night i expected a repeat of the night yvonne dumped him because i knew what had happened sarondas family was departing on the transport and shed chosen life off worldwhere you can live for hundreds of years in peace and comfortover a couple of decades with a boy from b but i was wrong her father had purchased arties passage as well for sarondas happiness and because he found artie to be a man worth saving a man with a contribution to make then this is goodbye i said my voice choked with my loss but artie shook his head im not going he said as though he had never seriously considered it what do you mean i demanded you have to go artie you have to get out and leave you guys here to have all the fun he asked though his voice broke and his eyes swam with tears naa you have to i shouted again and i struck his chest with my fist you have to artie for all of us youre the only ber whos ever ever been offered transport out of here and you have to go you have to go where you can live for hundreds of years you have to do it for us you have to live all those years for us artieyoure the only one who can still he shook his head though it took him a moment longer to speak this time naa he repeated whod make bikes for the kids whod make them live by the code you saw what happened when i was gone for just a couple of months he smiled at me though he had to brush his eyes with the back of his hand besides i cant leave the angels deron would go mercenary inside of six weeks and stash is already smuggling on the sideim going to have to come down on him before he drags the whole operation lawless and you know there are bike packs in five other sectors now and three of them follow the code ive got to stick around and make sure it stays that way and saronda i challenged desperate for some way to talk him into going he drew a deep breath she thinks im already onboard her dad wont tell her till they launch he promised me then he looked out my window as a bright streak of light flashed across the darkened sky the shuttle leaping upward to meet the waiting transport damn you artie i screamed at him as though i were the one he had abandoned damn you artie you should have gone with her and i hit him again and again and again until he grabbed my fists to make me stop and i dissolved in weeping then he held me close and we both wept until exhausted we finally slept in each others arms and our dreams echoed with the whisper of sarondas anguished wails what a story it would be if it ended there you would understand then and perhaps believe all the legends that surround artie and his angels you would think that he devoted the rest of his life to protecting the children of b and eventually of other sectors and that he restored pride and honour anddare i saychivalry to a society that had lost all that that was his intention certainly but he never had the chance we had known for months there was a reaper hanging with the big dogs one who had escaped death on the day of their invasion we knew because the reapers insidious philosophy began creeping out of a when the assault was made on the shuttle though we all supposed that was him and the assailants death put an end to the threat we were wrong it was six months later and artie was in his shop building a bicycle for a kid who had just come in from outside i was in my room just across the street studying taningers treatise on folk myths although i was never accepted for advanced schooling artie had insisted that i keep studying remotely with his help i was working at the firstyear university level in math and science and higher in social studies it had just occurred to me reading taninger that the arthurian cycle had many parallels to the christ cycle when i heard the double shotgun blasts i bolted for the door not even pausing to look out my window though the sound was foreign to me and i wouldnt know until much later what had made it i was seized with a dread conviction that it had come from arties shop the reaper hadnt stuck around but his handiwork was all too evident the fiberforced glass in the storefront window was not meant to withstand the onslaught of outlaw projectile weapons it had shattered into a million harmless shards that crunched under my feet as i stumbled through the wreckage to the back of the room artie was on the floor between the truing stand and his frame building jig in a litter of primalloy tubing and joining patches his chest was shredded where the brunt of one blast had caught him and spots of blood glistened on his legs and arms from a spray of pellets someone else entered behind melouis it turned out get a doctor i screamed call for medevac but the light was already fading from arties eyes wanted to take you with me he slurred blood foaming with the words from his lips dont talk i commanded lie still help is coming said id go if you could too he managed shut up artie i shouted dont you lay that on me dont you do it then impossibly he smiled morgan lefey he whispered take me to avalon the story goes that we got him to a hospital and the doctors were able to stabilize him enough to put him in a cryogenic chamber that chamber went on the next transport ship to a distant world where saronda was waiting and where they have the medical science to heal him someday when hes recovered hell come back to earth again to kanhab in the meantime arties angels are still here seeing that what he started doesnt die thats the story but artie died in my arms that night and no medevac bothered to come not to b louis and i took him underground to a place where a collapsed tunnel had left only a crawl space we laid him in there and sealed it up and we didnt tell anyone else then i concocted that story about the cryogenic chamber ha as if kanhab had any such thing so that is the truth of what happened to artie dangelo but dont try to tell that to anyone in kanhab he has become larger in death than he ever was in lifei have seen to that a brutal act of nihilism deprived me of my friend my pack leader my guiding light but i will not let it deprive kanhab of hope the stories of arties exploits grow richer with each telling and in them he succeeds in ways he could only dream of in protecting the helpless and improving the lives of those he left behind for us he turned down a chance to live hundreds of years in comfort and peace with his beloved i will give him in its place immortality sleep well in avalon my arthur kanhab will not forget judgment passed by jerry oltion jerry oltion is the author the novels paradise passed the getaway special anywhere but here and several others in he won the nebula award for his novella abandon in place which he later expanded into a novel he is also the author of more than short stories most of which have appeared in the pages of fsf and analog judgment passed which is original to this volume tells of the biblical day of judgment from a rationalist viewpoint a starship crew returns to earth to find that the rapture has occurred without them oltion has strong views on religionnamely that its a scourge on humanitythat led him to write this story which speculates on whether or not being left behind would be such a bad thing it was cold that morning and the snow squeaked beneath my boots as i walked up the lane in search of jody last nights storm had left an ankle deep layer of fresh powder over the weekold crust and her tracks stood out sharp and clear as they led away through the bare skeletons of aspen trees and out of sight around the bend she had gone toward the mountains i didnt need to see her tracks to know that she had gone alone except for jodys footprints there was no sign of humanity anywhere my boots on the snow made the only sound in the forest and the only motion other than my own was in the clouds that puffed away behind me with every breath insulated as i was inside my downfilled coat i felt an overwhelming sense of solitude i knew why jody had come this way in a place that was supposed to be empty she wouldnt find herself looking for people who werent there i found her sitting on a rail fence staring out across a snowcovered field at the mountains she sat on the bottom rail with her chin resting on her mittened hands on the top rail her shoulderlength brown hair stuck out below a green stocking cap there were trenches dug in the snow where she had been swinging her feet she turned her head as i squeaked up behind her said hi gregor then turned back to the mountains i sat down beside her propping my chin on my hands like she had and looked up at them myself sunlight was shining full on the peaks making the snowfields glow brilliant white and giving the rocks a color of false warmth no trees grew on their jagged flanks they were nothing but rock and ice the tetons i thought gods country how true that had proved to be id forgotten how impressive mountains could be i said my breath frosting the edges of my gloves so had i she said its been a long time twelve years five years going five years coming and two years spent there on a dusty planet around a foreign star she said there was nothing like this on dessica no glaciers it takes glaciers to carve up a mountain like that hmm we stared up at the sunlit peaks each thinking our own thoughts i thought about dessica wed waited two months after landing to name it but the decision was unanimous hot dry with dust storms that could blow for weeks at a timeif ever there was a hell that place had to be it but eight of us had stayed there for two years exploring and collecting data the first interstellar expedition at work and then we had packed up and come backto an empty earth not a soul left anywhere nothing to greet us but wild animals and abandoned cities full of yellowed newspapers four years old according to those papers this was where jesus had first appeared not in jerusalem nor at the vatican nor even salt lake city the grand teton tallest of the range ruggedly beautiful a fitting monument to the son of god i could almost see him myself floating down from the peak and alighting next to the chapel of the transfiguration back by the lodge where wed spent the night hard as it was to believe it was easy to imagine what came next was the hard part hed apparently given people six days to prepare themselves then on the seventh he had called them all to judgment no special call for the faithful no time of tribulation for the unbelievers hed hauled everyone off at once presumably to sort them out later the newspapers were silent on the method hed used all the reporters and editors and press operators apparently caught up in the moment along with everyone else but i couldnt imagine how it had worked most people had expected to rise into the sky but above feet they would start to asphyxiate and above or so their blood would boil not quite the sort of thing i imagined even the old testament god would want his faithful to endure slipping into an alternate dimension seemed more likely but i couldnt imagine what that would be like either trying to visualize the unimaginable reminded me why id come looking for judy the captains going to be holding services in a little while she thought maybe youd like to be there jody looked over at me with an expression usually reserved for a stupid younger brother why to pray to try getting gods attention i nodded dave talked her into it he figures the more of us doing it the stronger the signal very scientific daves an engineer gwen agrees with him i suppose shes going to ask god to send jesus back for us thats the general idea yeah i said beginning to get embarrassed she gave me the look again you dont really think itll work do you its worth a try it cant hurt can it she laughed spoken like a true agnostic i shifted my weight so a knot on the fence rail would stop poking me in the thigh the joint where the rail met the post squeaked were all agnostic i pointed out or were when the mission planners selected the crew they had wanted people who made decisions based on the information at hand not wishful thinking or hearsay those sort of people tended to be agnostic i still am she said i looked at her in surprise how can you be the entire population of the world disappears every newspaper we find has stories about the second coming of christcomplete with picturesand all the graveyards are empty doesnt that make a believer out of you she shook her head and asked simply why are we here what do you mean i mean if im supposed to believe that jesus came back for the second time called the day of judgment and took every human soul to heaven then what are we doing here why didnt he take us too we werent on earth neither were three thousand lunar colonists and they got taken we were doing ninetyeight percent of the speed of light we were three and a half lightyears away and so god missed us thats my point if he was omniscient he would have known we were there id been thinking about that myself in the days since wed been home maybe he did i said huh maybe god did know about us maybe he left us behind on purpose as punishment for not believing in him she snorted what about atheists then what about other agnostics why just us eight i held up my gloved hands palms up i dont know im not god if you were youd have done a better job i wasnt sure whether to take that as a compliment or what so i decided to ignore it what do you think happened then if it wasnt god i dont know maybe aliens came and took us all for slaves maybe we were a lab experiment and they got all the data they needed maybe we taste like chicken there are plenty of more believable explanations than god what about the photos of jesus i asked she rubbed her red nose with a mitten if you were going to harvest an entire planets population wouldnt you use their local religion to keep them in line jesus wouldnt have much sway with jews i pointed out or moslems or athesists so says the former agnostic who believes in him because of what he read in the paper she said it kindly but it still stung look i said gwens going to start pretty soon you coming or not she shrugged what the hell it ought to be fun listening to an agnostic sermon we swung our legs around off the fence rail and stood up then started following our tracks back to the lodge an enormous log hotel built around the turn of the last century to house the crush of tourists who came to visit one of the last unspoiled places on earth i took jodys right hand in my left as we walked it was an unconsciously natural act we werent a pair at the moment but we had been a few times with the small crew on the ship and lots of time to experiment we had tried just about every combination at least once the warmth and comfort i felt as we walked through the fresh snow together made me glad wed never broken up hard it felt like maybe we were headed for another stretch of time together jody must have been feeling the same way when we got down in among the aspen trees she said assuming god really is behind all this and its not just some sort of enormous practical joke then maybe this is a reward a reward she nodded i like it here its pretty and peaceful the last time i was here it was a zoo tourists wherever you looked lines of motor homes and suvs on the road as far as you could see trash blowing all around i feel like now im finally getting to see it the way its supposed to be the way god intended yeah maybe she grinned an agnostictheologian grin and said maybe were the next ark we were all set to start our own colony after all were the best genetic stock the un space authority could find and weve got more fertilized ova in the freezer maybe god decided it would be a good time to clear away all the riffraff and give humanity a fresh start its a little cold for eden i said weve got the whole world she pointed out i thought about that i supposed we did at least until the airplanes and hovercars all fell apart there was no way eight people could maintain a technological civilization indefinitely our colonization equipment was designed to keep us at what the uns social scientists called an artificially augmented industrial age until we could increase the population enough to build our own factories and so forth but that level wasnt particularly cosmopolitan the idea had been to pick a spot and settle in rather than to play tourist on a new planet of course the planet needed at least one habitable spot which was why wed given up after two years of searching and come home id never considered just going on with our lives i said i mean after the second coming of christ that simply never occurred to me jody shrugged we just landed weve all been too busy trying to figure out what happened give em time though and i think most of us will start thinking about it i mean this could be all the heaven we need if we do it right a sudden chill ran up my spine and it wasnt from the snow we may not have time i said if gwens little prayer meeting works god may come back for us today jody looked up at me her face mirroring the concern in my own damn she said then she took off running for the chapel i took off after her both of us shouting gwen gwen wait up running in snow isnt easy our feet punched right through the crust that had supported us when wed been walking and we wound up struggling for every step we were both sweating and panting when we burst into the chapel gasping for enough breath to cry out dont pray gwen was standing behind the pulpit wearing a long white robe with gold hems a hands width wide shed found it in a closet in the priests sacristy the wall behind her was mostly window affording the congregationdave and maria and hammad and arjuna and keung in the front pewa fantastic view of the tetons behind her own splendor everyone turned and looked at us as jody said again dont pray weve got to think this through first gwen frowned whats there to think through weve got to contact god do we what do you mean of course we do he left us behind maybe thats a good thing tugging off her mittens stocking hat and coat as she talked jody told her what shed told me ending with so maybe we ought to just keep quiet and go on about our business gwen had been shaking her head the whole time jody had been speaking she was a big woman with a thick halo of curly black hair that wagged from side to side as she shook it now she said we dont know what that business is this could just as easily be a test of some sort exactly it could be a test so i think wed be smart to be careful what we ask for we might get it dave had been listening with as much impatience as gwen before she could answer he said if god intends for us to repopulate the earth wouldnt he have told us so he told noah what he wanted him to do jody shrugged god was a lot more talkative in those days if you believe the judeochristian bible hammad put in the christian day of judgment has come and gone gwen said what else are we supposed to believe hammad spread his hands to indicate the chapel and by implication everything beyond it we should believe what we have always believed the evidence of our own senses the earth has been depopulated newspapers left behind tell us a being calling himself jesus christ claimed responsibility beyond that we can only speculate wait a minute maria said but before she had a chance to finish her thought arjuna said we can too and keung said yeah what about and the room descended into babble gwen hadnt been chosen captain for nothing she let it go on for a few seconds then shouted at top volume quiet the chapel grew quiet all right she said into the silence i obviously made a false assumption when i thought we all wanted to ask god to come back for us jody doesnt think we should try to contact him at all what do the rest of you think a chorus of voices nearly drowned her out again one at a time she yelled you dave i think we should ask his forgiveness and ask him to take us with him hammad ask what he wants us to do rather than just assume maria iuh i definitely think we should try to contact him but i think hammad kind of makes sepse actually thank you said hammad gwen looked at me gregor i looked at hammad then at jody im not sure its a good idea to call his attention to us at all depending on whose version of christianity is true we could do a lot worse than where we are now arjuna arjuna said i kind of agree with jody and gregor except i wonder what wed do if god decides to turn out the lights its been four years hammad said that doesnt mean dave said and the babble started up again quiet shouted gwen she snatched the wooden cross from the front of the pulpit and banged it down like a gavel on the angled top all right she said when wed quieted down lets try this again keung what do you think keung shrugged i dont think it matters if we can reach him with prayer then one of us would have done it already i think if we can get his attention at all then theres no point in hiding out because hell eventually realize were here is that a vote for or against praying to him its an dont care gwen nodded well then it looks like the prayer contingent wins but i dont see anything wrong with asking politely what god intends for us to do before we start begging for divine intervention can we all agree on that no jody said but daves and marias and hammads assent was louder gwen said jody keungs right if prayer works then somebodys bound to get gods attention sooner or later no theyre not jody said theres millions of guns lying around but that doesnt mean we have to start shooting each other with them we dont have to pray i do dave said jody stared at him a moment then shook her head and picked up her coat and hat and mittens again ill wait outside then she said brushing past me toward the door maybe hell miss me again when he comes for you idiots i followed her out i hadnt taken my coat off just unzipped it the cold air felt good through my shirt idiots jody said again when we were alone theyre playing with dynamite in there worse antimatter maybe literally i said who knows what god might be made of aaahhh god god god she growled im sick of the whole subject i wish hed just stayed the hell out of my life i poked a finger in her ribs he did silly its not funny sure it is weve spent our whole lives saying it didnt matter what we thought or did about religion since the truth is inherently unknowable and now were afraid somebody is going to pray us out of existence i think its hilarious we were walking back toward the guest lodge along a path surrounded by pine trees and snow banks on impulse i reached up and slapped a branch just as jody walked under it yow she screamed as a clump of snow went down her neck and before i could back out of range she bent down scooped up a handful and hurled it at my face i stumbled backward and sat down unexpectedly in a snow bank which saved me from another faceful that flew over my head instead as long as i was on the ground i figured i might as well defend myself so i started throwing snow back at her as fast as i could scoop it up it was too cold to stick into balls so we just shovelled it at each other shrieking and laughing like fools while the rest of humanity prayed for a miracle the prayer meeting broke up a half hour or so later by then jody and i were snuggling on the bear rug in front of the lodges main fireplace an enormous flagstone construction with a firebox big enough to roast a hover car in hammad found us first we seem to have failed in raising the deity he said as he stripped off his coat and hung it over a peg on the wall unless of course theres a timelag involved oh great said jody now ill be waiting all night for the skies to open and a choir of angels to wake me up by the looks of you two you wont be sleeping much in the first place unless its from exhaustion he sat down in one of the overstuffed chairs beside us and stuck his feet toward the flames you know i think you have the right of it he said we should get on with our lives and let god get on with his i have to admit i feel greatly relieved to have missed all the commotion me too i said ever since we found out he exists ive felt like an outsider in gang territory i keep waiting for the tap on the shoulder that means im in big trouble i wonder if thats how religious people normally get through life so they wouldnt attract the wrong kind of attention hammad shook his head i doubt if most people even considered it that way they probably the solid wood door banged open and dave gwen and the others came in stomping snow from their boots and talking dave glared at jody and me and took off for his room or somewhere but gwen maria arjuna and keung took off their coats and joined us by the fire well at least we can say we tried gwen said as she presented her backside to the flames she had left the robe in the chapel and was wearing a regular shirt and pants so what now asked jody travel sightsee play with the leftover toys before they all rust back into the ground or do we get straight to work starting a colony arjuna said no offense but after twelve years of close contact with you guys im ready for some time alone keung edged playfully away from her but he said my sentiments exactly i wouldnt mind having a whole continent to myself for a while maria looked shocked wait a minute splitting up could mean some of us might get left behind again if god comes back hes not coming back keung said what makes you so sure he shrugged im not actually but i didnt spend my whole life disregarding the issue just to start worrying about it now if he comes for me he comes and if not thats fine too ive got plenty to do on my own thats kind of how i feel about it i said id like to see the world a little while ive got the chance me too said jody gwen turned around to face the fire saying over her shoulder the satellite phone system still works so it shouldnt be too hard to stay in touch theres hundreds of cell phones right here in the hotel and ill bet at least some of them still have active accounts paid automatically every month by credit card it shouldnt be hard to find a working phone for each of us of course we dont all have to play tourist whoever wants to could start setting up the colony where hammad asked the mediterranean arjuna said just as i said california we looked at each other for a moment then i shrugged and said okay the mediterranean a sharp bang sounded from the back of the lodge that sounded like a gun gwen said and she took off running down the hallway shouting dave dave the whole way the rest of us followed close behind her but i took the time to grab the fireplace poker maybe hed committed suicide and maybe he hadnt a poker wasnt much of a weapon against a gun but it felt better than nothing we found dave outside on the deck overlooking the snake river a shotgun in his hand and a mess of feathers and blood smeared across the snow i could see bird seed among the feathers evidently dave had scattered a handful and waited for something to come for it that something had been hardly bigger than a mouse by the looks of its remains kind of small for dinner isnt it i asked reaching out with the poker and flipping the tiny bird body over so i could see its underside its an experiment dave said i was glad to see he was carefully pointing the shotgun away from everyone according to jesus not even a sparrow can fall without god noticing i figured that would be pretty easy to test jody had come up beside me and was examining the bird it would be if youd managed to shoot a sparrow she said this is a chickadee dave blushed when we all laughed but he said its not the species its the concept whatever it doesnt seem to be working maybe you should have tied a message to its foot first i said keung laughed youre supposed to use a pigeon for that its not funny dave snapped he took a deep breath then said i am trying to attract the attention of god if you think its funny or useless im sorry but i think its important and im going to try everything i can until i get the job done whats next gwen asked him sacrificing sheep rebuilding the ark of the covenant whatever is necessary dave said i felt myself shivering and when it didnt stop i suddenly realized all of us but dave were out there without our coats come on i said to jody lets get inside before we catch our death we left the next morning for yellowstone park the rest of the crew split up for other parts of the globe but jody and i decided as long as we were that close we might as well visit the biggest tourist attraction in the world we found a hover car that still ran and whose diagnostics told us it would continue to run for another few hundred hours tossed our personal belongings in the back and flew low up the snake river valley past jackson lake and into the park we ignored the loading ramps and the rail cars that had ferried tourists through for the last fifty years blowing right past the sign proclaiming it a federal crime to drive a private vehicle within the parks borders the forest seemed endless we flew along the old roadbed down among the trees so we could see more of it including the animals the park was famous for in parts of the world where the human population had been denser the ecosystem was still out of whack from our sudden disappearance but yellowstone had already reached a balance without us before the second coming we watched moose and elk and buffalo plodding along like great hoofed snowploughs and we even caught a glimpse of a wolf drinking out of a stream near old faithful the geysers were probably the same as always too but with just the two of us standing there on the snowcovered boardwalk in front of old faithful it seemed to me that we must be watching its best eruption ever steam and boiling water shot up over a hundred feet in the air and the ground shook with the force of its eruption you know jody said as it subsided i just realized how silly it is to come here right now silly how i asked if dave succeeds in reaching god we might have all of eternity to watch this sort of thing in action i looked out at the steaming mound of reddish rock then at the brilliant white snowfield and green forest beyond it you talking about the pretty parts or the hot parts who knows yeah who knew id lived a perfectly moral life by agnostic standards but who could tell if that would be good enough for god for that matter who knew whether heaven or hell really existed even now so jesus had come and taken everyone away he could have hauled them to andromeda for all we knew all the same i wondered if we were wise for leaving dave free to pursue god the crew had talked about it before wed gone our separate ways but none of us knew what else we could do about him he wouldnt rest until hed tried everything he could think of and none of us wanted to attempt confining him to prevent it i suppose after the prayer meeting and the chickadee incident none of us really believed he would succeed which was why we werent more concerned about it we were all hoping hed give it up after a while and become the normalif somewhat obsessivefriend and crewmember wed all learned to live with we realized wed made a mistake when gwen got a call from him a few days later she had formally renounced her title as captain and flown to hawaii but she was still acting as our coordinator dave had called to find out where the rest of us were and when shed asked him why he would only tell her to warn us away from cheyenne wyoming or any place downwind of it downwind i asked when gwen called us to relay his message what the hell is he trying this time jody and i were in the car again headed north toward mammoth hot springs a ghost of gwens face peered at us through the phones headsup windshield display he wouldnt tell me she replied he just said to keep everyone away from the american midwest for a while i bet hes going to blow up a nuclear bomb jody said cheyennes one of the air force bases where they stored them a nuclear bomb asked gwen what does that have to do with god i laughed maybe he thinks we just need to knock loud enough to be heard yeah but wheres the door jody asked certainly not in cheyenne ive been there its a dirty little government town out on the prairie my smile faded if physical location matters at all id guess the grand teton he wouldnt nuke the tetons would he jody asked horrified at the thought i dont know gwen said probably not for his first shot at least hell probably just lob one into nebraska or somewhere but if that doesnt work then he might wed been passing through a long straight notch cut in an ocean of lodge pole pine i let off the throttle and the hover car slid to a stop snow billowing up all around it were still in yellowstone i told gwen but we could get to cheyenne inwhat four hours five wed been dawdling along on groundeffect until now but we could fly as high as we liked if we had to i dont know if thats a good idea or not gwen said i dont like the idea of you two heading toward a nuclear explosion i dont exactly like it either i said but im even less happy about the idea of him blowing up an entire mountain range just to get gods attention and screwing up the ecosystem just as its starting to straighten out again jody put in snow had quit swirling around us the cars fans had blown it all away i tilted the joystick to the side until the car pivoted halfway around then pulled upward on it and shoved it forward again the car rose up above the trees and began accelerating southeast i said cheyenne itself should be safe enough thats where dave will be after all do you think we should call and let him know were coming or should we try to catch him off guard hell just hide if we tell him were coming jody said but he might not blow the bomb if we make him think youre near the blast zone gwen said might not i asked just how far around the bend do you figure hes gone maybe not at all gwen said i dont know this is a very emotionally charged issue for all of us i doubt if any of us are behaving entirely rationally but how can we tell if we are or we arent were on completely new ground here i dont think exploding a nuclear bomb is a rational act jody said not even if he succeeds in getting god to notice us especially not then gwen smiled wryly thats not entirely rational either jody its the way i feel and dave no doubt feels he has to get god to come back for him no doubt well i feel like i have to stop him nodding gwen said just dont get yourself killed in the process jody laughed that would kind of defeat the purpose now wouldnt it we were flying over a windswept basin about a hundred kilometres northwest of cheyenne when we saw the mushroom cloud peek up over the horizon for a second i was too stunned to move watching the way the shock wave raced inward in a spherical shell and how the surface of the cloud roiled and churned inside it then remembering where we were i shouted christ and yanked the emergency descent handle under the dashboard it was the first time id ever done that in a car the air bags blossoming out of the doors and roof and dash slammed me back in the seat and completely blocked my view for ten or fifteen terrifying seconds while the automatic landing sequence took over and dropped us like a rock we bobbed once hard like a cork smacking into water then settled with a crunch on the ground the air bags sucked back inside their cubbyholes and i fell forward against the dash we were listing at about a thirtydegree angle toward the front jody had caught herself with her hands before she fell forward she looked out the window and said were sitting on a sagebrush i looked out my side sure enough a gnarled knobby little bush was holding the rear end of the car in the air not a good position to be in when the shock wave rolled over us i started the motor and lifted the joystick to raise us off it and with a sound like ice cubes in a blender the car chopped the bush to shreds blowing bluegray bits of foliage everywhere and sending an eyewatering burst of sage smell in through the vents we lifted up though and the wind shoved us forward a few meters before i could set us back down again we sat there watching the cloud rise and waited for the blast to reach us and waited and waited the wind shifted a little then shifted back and after a while we realized we werent going to feel anything more this far away so i cautiously took us up a few meters and started flying southeast again the car had picked up a bad vibration from the sagebrush but it still flew the mushroom cloud blew eastward in front of us as we approached the wind at different altitudes slowly tearing it apart we were moving faster than the wind though and as we approached it we realized the bomb couldnt have gone off very far out of cheyenne jody looked at me with a worried expression i thought gwen said hed lob one into nebraska i was starting to worry too maybe it went off in the launch tube wed better call and see if hes okay i didnt want to blow our chances of surprising him but if he was hurt i supposed we should know it okay i said and jody dialled his number when it rang half a dozen times without an answer i began worrying in earnest but then the phone display flickered on and his face appeared before us dave here he said jody put on a stern expression god called and he told me to tell you to knock it off for just a moment i could see hope blossom in daves face then he scowled and said very funny did you call just to harass me or do you have something important to say we called to see if you were okay that blast looked like it was pretty close to town it was in town said daveat the air force base anyway which is pretty much the same thing none of the rockets were in shape to fly so i just blew one of the missiles in place where were you i asked dave laughed colorado springs norad control ive got a half mile of mountain over my head right now in case you were thinking of trying to stop me in a teasing voice jody said arent you afraid god will miss you again dave shook his head you wouldnt believe the spy network theyve got here ive got satellite surveillance all over the world if he shows up ill know it and ill set off another one closer to home hell know im here and so did we now i angled the car straight south have you ever considered how god might feel about nuclear bombs jody asked him destroying so much of his handiwork all at once might make him mad its a risk im willing to take dave said but youre taking it for all of us and im not willing not now dave said but youll thank me when i succeed and what if you dont none of us are going to thank you for blowing a bunch of fallout into the air were going to have to live here dave you too probably he laughed thats what the environmentalists thought so they quit cutting the forests and burning fossil fuels and all for what the environmentalists are gone and the forests and the fossil fuels are still here it was a complete waste i could hardly believe my ears you really believe that i really do then youre a lot worse off than i thought his eyes narrowed ah why am i even talking to you he reached forward and his image flicked out jody looked over at me i dont think subduing hims going to be easy if hes in the norad command centre then i dont know if well even be able to get to him well figure out something when we get there i said i was trying to convince myself as well as her i didnt have any idea what wed do but what else could we do but try thin as our plans were the car put an unexpected twist in them just south of the wyomingcolorado border the vibration in the rear fans had been getting steadily worse and id brought us down closer to the ground to reduce the strain on them hoping to make it to another city before they died completely but we were still quite a ways north of fort collins when the right one gave up with a shriek and the car dropped on that side hit the ground then slewed halfway around and flipped completely over the air bags whooshed out to hold us in place again but the one in front of jody burst with a bang and i heard her shriek in surprise as she fell head first into the windshield jody i fought to reach her over the bags still holding me in place we skidded to a stop but with the car upside down they deflated slowly so we wouldnt fall to the roof and break our necks i managed to squeeze out through the gap between the one in front of me and the one between the seats jody lay in the hollow made by the roof and the curved windshield her face bloody from a gash in her forehead she was groping for something to pull herself up against my first thought was that she should lie flat in case shed hurt her neck or spine but then i realized there wasnt enough space for that and shed probably be better off sitting upright anyway i took her hand in mine and helped her twist around until she could sit on the roof the seats were just over our heads is anything broken i asked as i looked in the gap between seats and floor for a medical kit i dont know she flexed her arms and legs then said doesnt feel like it she held a hand to her forehead to keep the blood out of her eyes while she blinked to clear them both eyes are okay she said after a moment her voice was a little slurred but completely calm the result of years of training for emergencies i couldnt find a medical kit so i tore a strip of cloth from my shirt and used that to sop up the blood from her wound she winced when i blotted her cut with it but i was glad to see muscle instead of bone before the blood welled up again i think youll live i said trying not to let her hear the worry in my voice her injuries probably wouldnt kill her but a night outside in colorado in the wintertime just might i bent down so i could look out the windows the sun was still fairly high over the mountains we had a couple of hours of daylight left but i couldnt see any houses and i didnt know how far we could walk to find one the wind wasnt as strong here as it had been farther north but it was still blowing hard enough to drop the chill factor by twenty degrees or so it was already sucking the heat out of the car jody had been thinking along the same lines all of a sudden im not so happy the worlds empty she said were not in trouble yet i told her for one thing the worlds not empty i flicked on the cars phone dialled upside down and waited hoping the transmitter could make contact with its antenna underneath us who are you calling jody asked dave thats right hes the only one anywhere close to us what makes you think hell help us i dont know if he will or not but it cant hurt to ask we waited for ten or fifteen seconds while the phone tried to make a connection finally we saw a flickering snowy phantom on the windshield and daves voice shot through with static said what now this is gregor i said weve been in a wreck just north of fort collins jodys been hurt can you come get us his upsidedown face looked us over suspiciously this is a trick to get me out of here no its not jody said here have a look she bent down toward the camera eye and took the bloodsoaked rag from her forehead daves expression grew a little more sympathetic but not enough sorry he said you got yourselves into this you can get yourselves out i said dave were not just asking a favour we could die of exposure out here quit being melodramatic youre resourceful his image broke up for a second then came backmust have brought coats and hats and stuff were in an upsidedown car in the middle of nowhere and youre telling us to put on our coats damn it jodys injured we need to get her to a hospital and see if shes broken anything she could have internal injuries it was hard to read his expression in the snowy upsidedown image i thought he was scowling then for a brief moment the scowl reversed itself all right he said ill come itll take me a while to get out of the mountain and an hour or two more to get up there and find you just sit tight then before either of us could say anything more he switched off i thought for a moment about his sudden capitulation i didnt like the feel of it and pretty soon i realized why the bastard isnt going to come jody looked around at me sharply what he just said he wants us to think hes coming but hes going to wait for us to die of exposure think about it what better way to get gods attention than to send a couple of free souls to go knock on heavens gates for him but he would he do that sure he would he just said so its going to take him a while to get out of the mountain and a while to fly up here and a while longer to find us hell make sure it takes a long while so when he gets here he can honestly say he tried to rescue us but he was just too late she shook her head no i dont think hed do that i do im not waiting around to find out the hard way what are you going to do i reached under the seats into the back for our coats as i helped jody into hers i said im going to walk toward fort collins and see if i can find a house or another car that works i wont go any farther than i can walk back before dark she thought about it then said all right while youre doing that ill call gwen and see who else might be able to come get us good i pulled on my coat and hat and gloves then opened the window and slid out onto the frozen ground a cold blast of air swirled snow inside i leaned in to give jody a kiss then backed away and made sure she closed the window tight before i stood up the car was a dark oblong against white snow i wouldnt have much trouble finding it again if i got back before dark i started off toward where i hoped town would be turning back periodically to make sure i could spot the car again until the slope of the land hid it from view the colorado foothills didnt have nearly as much snow as yellowstone but there was enough to leave a pretty good set of tracks it would take a few hours for them to fill in so i wasnt that worried i trudged along hands in pockets and head tilted to the side to keep the wind from blowing down my neck looking for any sign of civilization as i walked realized how much i was going to hate living a primitive life when all the machinery started falling apart by the time i was an old man id probably be walking everywhere i went i might even be burning wood for heat depending on how long the colonys power plant lasted no wonder dave was so desperate to have god come back for him i thought about jody waiting for me in the car possibly dying of injuries or exposure before i got back at the moment i didnt mind the idea of a god watching over us either provided hed actually do something to help if we needed it even if he wouldntor couldntkeep her alive the idea that i might somehow join her again after we both died was at least a little comfort not much because i could never be sure it would happen until it did but the possibility might keep me going for a while it came to me then that if jody died i could easily join dave in his quest but she wasnt going to die all i needed was to find some shelter and wed both be fine i eventually spotted what i was looking for down in a gentle valley a house and barn set in among a stand of tall bare cottonwood trees there were a couple of vehicles parked out front and a long winding road leading down to them from a highway off to my left i kept going crosscountry straight for it it was farther away than it looked but i made it just as the sun touched the mountains the house was unlocked so i didnt have to break in it was also unheated but it felt wonderful compared to outside i tried to call jody on my cell phone but when i opened it up the screen had a big crack in it and it failed to light i had apparently landed on it in the crash the house phone was dead too no surprise after four years of weather like this but i found a hook by the back door with a set of keys dangling from it so i took them outside and tried them in the vehicles there was a hover car and a fourwheeler pickup truck in the driveway the hover car was as dead as the phone but the pickup lurched forward when i turned the key i pushed in the clutch and tried again and was rewarded with the whine of a flywheel winding up to speed the power gauge read low but i didnt think id need much just to reach jody and come back while the flywheel spun up i checked in the glove box for a working phone but all i found were a bunch of wrenches and fuses that wasnt reassuring i let out the clutch slowly and the truck began to roll forward though so i steered it around the driveway and began to bounce and spin my way up toward the highway id heard it was easy to get a wheeled vehicle stuck in snow so i figured i should drive on roads as much as i could until i got close enough to try driving crosscountry it was a good idea and it would have worked if there hadnt been a big drift about a kilometre down the road where it crossed the bottom of the valley and began to climb the other side i realized too late that the road didnt rise up with the terrain and by the time the pickup nosed into the bank shuddered as it dug itself in a few more meters and came to a stop it was thoroughly stuck i couldnt back out or go forward not even when left it in gear and got out and pushed of course there was no shovel in the truck i would have to go back to the house to get one cursing my stupidity in not thinking ahead i followed the tire tracks back the way i had come it was starting to get dark by the time i reached the house again so i prowled through the kitchen drawers until i found a flashlight that worked then went out to the barn and found a shovel i jogged back to the truck and started digging it out hoping jody wasnt too worried that i hadnt come back yet she was only a kilometre or two away if i was careful not to get stuck again i could be there in a few minutes i had just dug a path for the left wheel and was starting in on the right when i saw a bright light descending toward me from the south it slid on past still dropping right toward the car dave well ill be damned i said aloud he actually came i leaned back against the pickup for a moment catching my breath i didnt have to break my back at it now he and jody would probably be coming for me pretty soon if they could find me my tracks would be pretty hard to follow in a hover car and if they missed the farmhouse then they could very easily miss me out on the road in a pickup i reached inside and turned on the headlights that would help but i started digging again too ten minutes later i finished the other wheel track they still hadnt come for me i climbed into the pickup put it in forward and let out the clutch but it didnt budge back outside with the shovel this time digging the snow out from underneath it took another fifteen minutes when i tried it again the truck moved a little and i rocked it back and forth until it started rolling then drove on up the road as fast as i could something wasnt right dave had left his landing light on as soon as i came up over the edge of the valley i saw it shining straight at our overturned car i could see a figure standing beside it but i couldnt tell if it was dave or jody the road curved the wrong way cursing my luck i gunned the pickup and swerved off the road bouncing over rocks and sagebrush and trying to steer whenever the wheels touched ground the tires spun and the flywheel motor screeched in protest but i kept the throttle all the way to the floor and held on while the pickup bounced toward the two air cars as i drew closer i could see that it was dave standing in the light and jody was lying flat on the ground in front of him she wasnt moving i popped open the glove box just as the truck hit a hard bump scattering wrenches all over the seat and floor i snatched one of the bigger ones in my right hand as i skidded to a stop beside daves car leaped out with it upraised and shouted what have you done to her he didnt even try to defend himself he just stood there with a beatific smile on his face and said go ahead it wont matter ill even tell god it was justified god aint the guy youll be talking with i said i raised the wrench to cave in his head but with him just standing there found that i couldnt do it not even with jody lying before us on the ground hed taken off her coat and gloves her face and hands were white as the snow and no breath rose from her open mouth we should have realized right away that one of us would have to go get him for the rest of us dave told me as i bent down to feel her neck for a pulse i would have gone myself once i figured it out but jody was already so close i figured she might as well be the one it really doesnt matter i didnt see any wounds other than the one on her forehead she must have been unconscious when he arrived or hed stunned her somehow i couldnt find a pulse but my fingers were so cold from digging snow that i probably couldnt have found my own i bent down and felt for breath against my cheek but there was none not knowing what else to do i covered her mouth with mine and blew a breath into her lungs dave grabbed me by the collar no i cant allow that you cant bring her back until were sure shes done the job in one quick motion i stood up and smacked him in the left temple with the flat of the wrench his head jerked sideways and he fell over backwards with a thump that swirled snow up around him i bent back down to jody five compressions of the chest breath five compressions of the chest breath over and over again sometime between forever and an eternity later she shuddered gasped a breath on her own and moaned i whooped with joy lifted her up in my arms and carried her over to daves car where i set her in the passenger seat and turned the heater up all the way i ran around to the other side and climbed in she woke with a scream when i slammed the door then she saw it was me and slumped back in the seat christ you scared me she said i had a hell of a crazy dre wait a minute she looked around at the car a much bigger one than what wed been flying this is daves car she said after a moment he did come thats right and he dragged you outside to die too i looked out to make sure he was still lying where hed dropped i had just enough time to realize he wasnt when the door beside me popped open and he stood there with my wrench in his hand i lunged for the lift controls but he reached across me and rapped my hand with the wrench before the car even began to move no you dont he said get out were going to finish this experiment one way or another i cradled my suddenly numb right hand in my left wondering if i could clench it into a fist and whether i could do any good with it if i could jody leaned over so he could see her its already finished she said what do you mean it cant be youre still alive she laughed im alive again idiot i was dead i was there i saw your precious gates to heaven and theyre slammed tight you did i asked they are asked dave yup jodys eyes held a spark of elemental fire as she looked at him in a subdued voice he said let me in its cold out here i thought about it a moment much preferring the idea of leaving him outside a while longer but jody said go ahead ive got something i want to tell him so i tilted my seat forward and let him climb in back the moment he sat down i pulled on the lift control and took us straight up a hundred meters or so where are you going he asked high enough to make you think twice about trying something cute i replied he wont try anything jody said not now or ever again what makes you so sure i asked she grinned like a whole pack of wolves surrounding a deer because if he does he might get hurt and if you think its lonely on this side of the great divide wait til you see whats waiting for us over there what dave asked leaning forward between the seats what did you find she got a faraway look in her eyes i found the place where heaven used to be at the end of a long tunnel of light there werent gates really it was more of aa place its hard to describe physically but i could tell that was where i was supposed to go and i could tell it was closed permanently dave asked it felt that way there was just the memory of a doorway no promise of one to come so i turned around to come back but i couldnt find the way at first i wandered around quite a while before i stumbled across it if gregor hadnt kept my body going i dont think i would have found it wandered around where dave demanded what was it like like fog jody said her voice picked up a tremor as she added i was just a viewpoint in a formless shapeless gray fog there wasnt any sound any smell i didnt even have a body to hear or smell or feel with i dont even know if i was actually seeing anything there was nothing there to see then how did you know where your body was how do you know where your chin is it was just there jody turned away from him and leaned back in her seat look im tired and my head hurts and ive been dead once too often today i just want to get some rest ill tell you all about it tomorrow i took the hint and flew us away in search of a hospital later after wed bandaged her head and made sure she had no other injuries we took the bridal suite at the top of the fort collins hilton dave was in one of the rooms down below id wanted to put him in the city jail but jody wouldnt let me his teeth are pulled she told me as we lay in the enormous bed a dozen blankets pulled over us for warmth and as many candles providing light hell believe anything i tell him now besides we need him the best thing we can do is treat him like a recovering alcoholic or something and just integrate him back into our lives as fast as we can integrate him back into our lives i asked incredulously after what he did to you he murdered you you were dead she giggled well im not so sure about that huh what about the tunnel of light and the gates to heaven and all that she lowered her voice to a whisper that was all total vacuum i told him what he wanted to hear well what i wanted him to hear anyway i stared at her in the flickering candlelight dumbfounded she shrugged i dont remember a thing from the moment dave knocked me out until the moment i woke up with you next to me you dont no youre one hell of an actress then good because i want him convinced i thought about that even if we arent i asked after a while what you want dave convinced but were still in the same shape we were before we dont know anything at all about whats waiting for us after we die she giggled again and snuggled up closer to me under the covers then god is just if he exists she said after all im agnostic i wouldnt have it any other way mute by gene wolfe gene wolfe who is perhaps best known for his multivolume epic the book of the new sun is the author of more than short stories and novels is a twotime winner of both the nebula and world fantasy award and was once praised as the greatest writer in the english language alive today by author michael swanwick his most recent novels are the wizardknight soldier of sidon and pirate freedom this story is about two children who return home find an empty house and are forced to grow up in a hurry it first appeared in the program book for the world horror convention where wolfe was guest of honor in that same program book neil gaiman offered up some advice on how to read gene wolfe the first two points of his essay were trust the text implicitly the answers are in there do not trust the text farther than you can throw it if that far its tricksy and desperate stuff and it may go off in your hand at any time keep that in mind when youre reading this story and when youre done you might want to heed gaimans third point as well reread its better the second time jill was not certain it was a bus at all although it was shaped like a bus and of a buslike color to begin with she said to herself jimmy and i are the only people if its a school bus why arent there other kids and if its a paywhenyougeton bus why doesnt anybody get on besides there was a sign that said bus stop and it didnt the road was narrow cracked and broken the bus negotiated it slowly trees closed above it to shut out the sun relented for a moment or two then closed again as it seemed forever there were no cars on the road no trucks or suvs and no other buses they passed a rusty sign with a picture of a girl on a horse but there were no girls and no horses a deer with wide innocent eyes stood beside a sign showing a leaping buck and watched their bus if it really was a bus rumble past it reminded jill of a picture in a book a little girl with long blond hair with her arm around the neck of just such a deer that girl was always meeting bad animals and horrible ugly people and it seemed to jill that the artist had been nice to give her this respite jill looked at the other pictures with horrified fascination then turned to this one with a sense of relief there were bad things but there were good things too do you remember the knight falling off his horse she whispered to her brother you never saw a knight jelly me neither in my book most of the people that girl met were awful but she liked the knight and he liked the drivers voice cut through hers right over yonders where your mas buried he pointed coughing jill tried to see it and saw only trees after that she tried to remember mother no clear image would come no tone of voice or remembered words there had been a mother their mother her mother she had loved her mother and mother had loved her she would hold on to that she promised herself they could not bury that trees gave way to a stone wall pierced by a wide gate of twisted bars a gate flanked by stone pillars on which stone lions crouched and glared an iron sign on the iron bars read poplar hill gate sign pillars and lions were gone almost before she could draw breath the stone wall ran on and on with trees in front of it and more trees behind it alders in front she decided and maples and birches in back no poplars did i ever read your storybook she shook her head i didnt think so i was always going to but i never got around to it was it good seeing her expression he put his arm around her its not gone forever jelly okay maybe theyll send it when she had dried her eyes the bus had left the road and was creeping up a narrow winding drive between trees it slowed for a curve slowed more turned again through the windshield she glimpsed a big house a man in a tweed jacket stood in what seemed to be its back doorway smoking a pipe the driver coughed and spat this heres your papas place he announced hell be around somewhere and glad to see you you be good kids so hes not sorry he was glad you hear jill nodded the bus coasted to a stop and its door opened thiss where you get out dont you forget them bags she would not have forgotten hers without the reminder it held all the worldly goods she had been allowed to take and she picked it up without difficulty her brother preceded her out of the bus carrying his own bag and the door shut behind them she stared at the back door of the house it was closed dad was here she said i saw him i didnt her brother said he was standing in the door waiting for us her brother shrugged maybe the phone rang behind them the bus backed up pulled forward backed a second time and started down the drive jill waved wait wait a minute if its driver heard her there was no sign of it we ought to go in the house her brother strode away he might be in there waiting for us maybe its locked reluctantly jill followed him it was not and was not even closed enough to latch there were leaves on the floor of the big kitchen as though the door had stood open for hours while the wind blew jill pushed it solidly shut behind her he might be her brothers voice cracked in front if he was talking on the phone wed hear him not if the other person was talking her brother had already seen enough of the kitchen come on she did not there was an electric stove whose burners glowed crimson then fiery scarlet a refrigerator containing a pound of cheese and two bottles of beer and a pantry full of cans there were dishes pots pans knives spoons and forks in plenty her brother returned the tvs on in the front room but theres nobody there dad has to be around somewhere jill said i saw him i didnt well i did she followed her brother down a wide hall with high dark windows on one side past the big door to a big dining room where no one sat eating and into a living room in which half a dozen drivers might have parked half a dozen buses full of sunshine a man did this she said looking around did what in here a man picked out this furniture the rugs and everything her brother pointed have a look over there theres a chair made out of horns i think thats hot she nodded so do i only i wouldnt have bought it a room isits a frame and the people in it are the pictures youre crazy no im not she shook her head in selfdefense youre saying dad got this stuff to make him look good to make him look right you cant make people look good if they dont they dont thats all there is to it but you can make them look right and thats more important everybody looks right in the right place if you had a picture of dad i dont if you did and you were going to get a frame for it the man in the frame store says take any of these you want would you take a pretty black one with silver flowers heck no there you are but id like a picture of me in a frame like that her brother smiled ill do it someday jelly did you notice the tv she nodded i saw it as soon as we came in only you cant hear what that mans saying because its on mute so he could talk on the phone maybe in another room the telephone was on an end table near the television she lifted the receiver and held it to her ear whats wrong could you hear him no gently she returned the receiver to its cradle theres no noise at all its not hooked up hes not on a phone in another room then it was not logical but she felt too drained to argue i dont think hes here at all her brother said the tv is on she sat down in a chair bare waxed wood and brownandorange cushions did you turn on these lights her brother shook his head besides i saw him he was standing in the door okay her brother was silent for a moment he was tall and blond like dad with a face that was already beginning to discover that it had been made for seriousness id have heard the car if he went away ive been listening for something like that so have i she sensed although she did not say that there was a presence in this empty house that made you listen listen listen all the time mute said the screen and made no sound id like to know what that man on the tvs saying she told her brother its on mute and i cant find the remote i looked she said nothing snuggling back against the brownandorange cushion and staring at the screen the chair made her feel that she was enclosed by some defence however small want me to change the channel you said you couldnt find the changer theres buttons he swung back a hinged panel at the side of the screen on and off channel up and channel down volume up and volume down only no mute button we dont need a mute button she whispered we need an unmute button want to change the channel look the next channel was a gray screen with wavy lines and the yellow word mute in one corner but the next one after it had a pretty friendly looking woman sitting at a table and talking the yellow mute was in the corner of her screen too she had a very sharp yellow pencil in her hands and she played with it as she talked jill wished that she would write something instead but she did not the next channel showed an almost empty street and the yellow mute the street was not quite empty because two people a man and a woman were lying down in it they did not move you want to watch this jill shook her head go back to the man dad was watching the first one she nodded and channels flicked past you like her brother froze in midsentence seconds crept past fearful and somehow guilty ijill began shhh someones walking around upstairs hear it her brother dashed out of the room she who had heard nothing murmured to herself i really dont like him at all but he talks slower than the woman and i think maybe i can learn to read his lips if i watch him long enough she tried and searched for the control between times there had been no one upstairs but there was a big bedroom there with two small beds one against the east wall and one against the south three windows and two dressers her brother had wanted a room of his own but she terrified at the thought of lying alone in the dark promised that the room would be his room and she would have no roomthat she would sweep and dust his room for him every day and make his bed for him reluctantly he consented they ate canned chili the first night and oatmeal the next morning the house they found had three floors and fourteen rooms fifteen counting the pantry the tv which jill had turned off when she had left the room to heat their supper was on again still on mute there was an attached garage with two cars her brother spent all afternoon hunting for the keys to one or the other without finding them indeed without finding any keys at all in the living room the man who had been silently talking talked silently still on and on jill spent most of her time watching him and eventually concluded that he was on tape his last remark at which he looked down at the polished top of his desk being followed by his first that evening as she prepared vienna sausages and canned potato salad she heard her brother shout dad the shout was followed by the banging of a door and the sound of her brothers running feet she ran too and caught up with him as he was looking through a narrow doorway in the back hall i saw him he said he was standing there looking right at me the narrow doorway opened upon darkness and equally narrow wooden steps then i heard this slam i know it was this one it had to be jill looked down troubled by a draft from the doorway that was surely cold dank and foul it looks like the basement she said it is the basement ive been down here a couple times only i never could find the light i kept thinking id find a flashlight and come down again her brother started down the steps and turned in surprise when a single dim bulb suspended from a wire came on howd you do that jelly the switch is here in the hall on the wall behind the door well come on arent you coming she did i wish we were back at that place her brother did not hear her or if he heard her chose to ignore her hes down here somewhere jellyhes got to be with two of us he cant hide very long isnt there any other way out i dont think so only i didnt stay long it was really dark and it smelled bad they found the source of that smell in back of a bank of freestanding shelves heaped with tools and paint cans it was rotting and had stained its clothing in places its flesh had fallen in and in others had fallen away her brother cleared scrap wood a garden sprayer and half a dozen bottles and jugs from the shelves so that the light might better reach the dead thing on the floor after a minute or two jill helped him when they had done all they could he said who was it and she whispered dad after that she turned away and went back up the stairs washed her hands and arms at the kitchen sink and sat at the table until she heard the basement door close and her brother came in wash she told him we ought to take baths really both of us then lets do it there were two bathrooms upstairs jill used the one nearest their room her brother the other when she had bathed and dried herself she put on a robe that had perhaps been her mothers once hitching it up and knotting the sash tight to keep the hem off the floor so attired she carried their clothes downstairs and into the laundry room and put them in the machine in the living room the man whose lips she had tried to read was gone the screen was gray and empty now save for the single word mute in glowing yellow she found the panel her brother had shown her other channels she tried were equally empty equally gray equally muted her brother came in in undershorts and shoes arent you going to eat later jill said i dont feel like it you mind if i do she shrugged you think that was dad dont you what we found in the basement yes she said i didnt know being dead was like that i saw him i didnt believe you did that time but i did and he closed the basement door i heard it she said nothing you think well see him anymore no just like that he wanted us to find him and we did and that was all he wanted he was telling us that he was dead her voice was flat expressionless he wanted us to know he wouldnt be around to help us now we do youre going to eat yeah wait just a minute and ill eat with you did you know there isnt any more tv there wasnt any before her brother said i guess tomorrow im going out you remember that gate we passed on the bus he nodded poplar hill thats it im going to walk there maybe it will be unlocked to let cars in if it isnt i can probably get over the wall some way there were a lot of trees and it wasnt very high id like it if you came with me but if you wont im going to anyhow well both go he said come on lets eat they set out next morning shutting the kitchen door but making very certain that it was unlocked and walking down the long curving drive the bus had climbed when the house was almost out of sight jill stopped to look back at it its sort of like we were running away from home she said were not her brother told her i dont know well i do listen thats our house dads dead so it belongs to you and me i dont want it jill said and then when the house was out of sight but its the only home weve got the drive was long but not impossibly so and the highwayif it could be called a highwaystretched away to right and left at the end of it stretched silent and empty i was thinking if there were some cars we could flag one down her brother said or maybe the bus will come by theres grass in the cracks yeah i know this way jelly he set out looking as serious as always and very very determined she trotted behind are you going into poplar hill with me if we can flag down a car first or a truck or anything im going with them if theyll take me so are you she shook her head but if we cant im going to poplar hill like you say maybe theres somebody ill bet somebody is she tried to sound more confident than she felt theres no picture on the tv i tried all the channels he was three paces ahead of her and did not look back so did i it was a lie but she had tried several it means theres nobody in the tv stations not in any of them he cleared his throat and his voice suddenly deepened as the voices of adolescent boys will nobody alive anyhow maybe theres somebody alive who doesnt know how to work it she suggested after a moments thought she added maybe they dont have any electricity where they are he stopped and looked around at her we do so people are still alive thats what i said right and it means a car might come past and thats what i said a small bush fresh and green sprouted from a crevice in the middle of the highway seeing it jill sensed that some unknown and unknowable power had overheard them and was gently trying to show them that they were wrong she shuddered and summoned up all the good reasons that argued that the bush was wrong instead there were live people back at that place the bus driver was all right too the iron gates were still there just as she had seen them the previous day graceful and strong between their pillars of cut stone the lions still snarled atop those pillars and the iron sign on the iron bars still proclaimed poplar hill theyre locked her brother announced he rattled the lock to show hera husky brass padlock that looked new weve got to get in sure im going to go along this wall see im going to look for a place where i can climb over or maybe its fallen down somewhere when i find one ill come back and tell you i want to go with you fear had come like a chill wind what if jimmy went away and she never saw him again listen back at the house you were going to do this all by yourself if you could do it by yourself you can stay here for ten minutes to watch for cars now dont follow me she did not but an hour later she was waiting for him when he came back along the inside of the wall scratched and dirty and intent on speaking to her through the gate howd you get in he asked when she appeared at his shoulder she shrugged you first how did you i found a little tree that had died and fallen over it was small enough that i could drag it if i didnt try to pick up the root end i leaned it on the wall and climbed up it and jumped down then you cant get out she told him and started up a road leading away from the gate ill find some way how did you get in through the bars it was tight and scrappy though i dont think you could somewhat maliciously she added ive been waiting in here a long time the private road led up a hill between rows of slender trees that made her think of models showing off green gowns the big front door of the big square house at the top of the hill was locked and the big brass knocker produced only empty echoes from inside the house no matter how hard her brother pounded the pretty pearlcoloured button that she pressed sounded distant chimes that brought no one peering through the window to the left of the door she saw a mostly wooden chair with brownandorange cushions and a gray tv screen one corner of the gray screen read mute in bright yellow letters circling the house they found the kitchen door unlocked as they had left it she was heaping corned beef hash out of her frying pan when the lights went out that means no more hot food she told her brother its electric my stove is theyll come back on he said confidently but they did not that night she undressed in the dark bedroom they had made their own in the lightless house folding clothes she could not see and laying them as neatly as her fingers could manage upon an invisible chair before slipping between the sheets warm and naked her brother followed her half a minute later you know jelly he said as he drew her to him were probably the only live people in the whole world inertia by

and the next its snappedoff twobyfours and an irregular fence as high as my waist the edges both jagged and furry as if they were covered with powder through the hole a sickly tree pokes upward in the narrow space between the back of our barracks and the back of a barracks in e block i try to get out of bed for a closer look but today my arthritis is too bad which is why im in bed in the first place rachel rushes into the bedroom what happened gram are you all right i nod and point rachel bends into the hole her hair haloed by california twilight the bedroom is hers too her mattress lies stored under my scarred fourposter termites damn i didnt know we had them you sure you re all right im fine i was all the way across the room honey im fine wellwell have to get mom to get somebody to fix it i say nothing rachel straightens throws me a quick glance looks away still i say nothing about mamie but in a sudden flicker from my oil lamp i look directly at rachel just because she is so good to look at not pretty not even here inside although so far the disease has affected only the left side of her face the ridge of thickened ropy skin coarse as old hemp isnt visible at all when she stands in right profile but her nose is large her eyebrows heavy and low her chin a bony knob an honest nose expressive brows direct gray eyes chin that juts forward when she tilts her head in intelligent listeningto a grandmothers eye rachel is good to look at they wouldnt think so outside but they would be wrong rachel says maybe i could trade a lottery card for more drywall and nails and patch it myself the termites will still be there well yes but we have to do something i dont contradict her she is sixteen years old feel that air coming inyoull freeze at night this time of year itll be terrible for your arthritis come in the kitchen now gramive built up the fire she helps me into the kitchen where the metal woodburning stove throws a rosy warmth that feels good on my joints the stove was donated to the colony a year ago by whoknowswhat charity or special interest group for i suppose whatever tax breaks still hold for that sort of thing if any do rachel tells me that we still get newspapers and once or twice ive wrapped vegetables from our patch in some fairly newlooking ones she even says that the young stevenson boy works a donated computer news net in the block j community hall but i no longer follow outside tax regulations nor do i ask why mamie was the one to get the woodburning stove when it wasnt a lottery month the light from the stove is stronger than the oil flame in the bedroom i see that beneath her concern for our dead bedroom wall rachels face is flushed with excitement her young skin glows right from intelligent chin to the ropy ridge of disease which of course never changes color i smile at her sixteen is so easy to excite a new hair ribbon from the donations repository a glance from a boy a secret with her cousin jennie gram she says kneeling beside my chair her hands restless on the battered wooden arm gramtheres a visitor from outside jennie saw him i go on smiling rachelnor jennie eithercant remember when disease colonies had lots of visitors first bulky figures in contamination suits then a few years later sleeker figures in the sanisuits that took their place people were still being interred from outside and for years the checkpoints at the rim had traffic flowing both ways but of course rachel doesnt remember all that she wasnt born mamie was only twelve when we were interred here to rachel a visitor might well be a great event i put out one hand and stroke her hair jennie said he wants to talk to the oldest people in the colony the ones who were brought here with the disease hal stevenson told her did he sweetheart her hair is soft and silky mamies hair had been the same at rachels age he might want to talk to you well here i am but arent you excited what do you suppose he wants im saved from answering her because mamie comes in her boyfriend peter malone following with a stringbag of groceries from the repository at the first sound of the doorknob turning rachel gets up from beside my chair and pokes at the fire her face goes completely blank although i know that part is only temporary mamie cries here we are in her high dollbaby voice cold air from the hall swirling around her like bright water mama darlinghow are you feeling and rachel youll never guesspete had extra depository cards and he got us some chicken im going to make a stew the back wall fell off the bedroom rachel says flatly she doesnt look at peter with his stringcrossed chicken but i do he grins his patient wolfish grin i guess that he won the depository cards at poker his fingernails are dirty the part of the newspaper i can see says esident confiscates c mamie says what do you mean fell off rachel shrugs just fell off termites mamie looks helplessly at peter whose grin widens i can see how it will be they will have a scene later not completely for our benefit although it will take place in the kitchen for us to watch mamie will beg prettily for peter to fix the wall he will demur grinning she will offer various smirking hints about barter each hint becoming more explicit he will agree to fix the wall rachel and i having no other warm room to go to will watch the fire or the floor or our shoes until mamie and peter retire ostentatiously to her room its the ostentation that embarrasses us mamie has always needed witnesses to her desirability but peter is watching rachel not mamie the chicken isnt from outside rachel its from that chickenyard in block b i heard you say how clean they are yeah rachel says shortly gracelessly mamie rolls her eyes say thank you darling pete went to a lot of trouble to get this chicken thanks cant you say it like you mean it mamies voice goes shrill thanks rachel says she heads towards our threewalled bedroom peter still watching her closely shifts the chicken from one hand to the other the pressure of the string bag cuts lines across the chickens yellowish skin rachel anne wilson let her go peter says softly no mamie says between the five crisscrossing lines of disease her face sets in unlovely lines she can at least learn some manners and i want her to hear our announcement rachel you just come right back out here this minute rachel returns from the bedroom ive never known her to disobey her mother she pauses by the open bedroom door waiting two empty candle scones both blackened by old smoke frame her head it has been since at least last winter that weve had candles for them mamie her forehead creased in irritation smiles brightly this is a special dinner all of you pete and i have an announcement were going to get married thats right peter says congratulate us rachel already motionless somehow goes even stiller peter watches her carefully mamie casts down her eyes blushing and i feet a stab of impatient pity for my daughter propping up midthirties girlishness on such a slender reed as peter malone i stare at him hard if he ever touches rachelbut i dont really think he would things like that dont happen anymore not inside congratulations rachel mumbles she crosses the room and embraces her mother who hugs her back with theatrical fervor in another minute mamie will start to cry over her shoulder i glimpse rachels face momentarily sorrowing and loving and i drop my eyes well this calls for a toast mamie cries gaily she winks makes a clumsy pirouette and pulls a bottle from the back shelf of the cupboard rachel got at the last donations lottery the cupboard looks strange in our kitchen gleaming white lacquer vaguely orientallooking amid the wobbly chairs and scarred table with the broken drawer no one has ever gotten around to mending mamie flourishes the bottle which i didnt know was there its champagne what had they been thinking the outsiders who donated champagne to a disease colony poor devils even if they never have anything to celebrateor heres something they wont know what to do withor better them than meas long as the sickies stay insideit doesnt really matter i just love champagne mamie cries feverishly i think she has drunk it once and oh lookheres someone else to help us celebrate come in jenniecome in and have some champagne jennie comes in smiling i see the same eager excitement that animated rachel before her mothers announcement it glows on jennies face which is beautiful she has no disease on her hands or her face she must have it somewhere she was born inside but one doesnt ask that probably rachel knows the two girls are inseparable jennie the daughter of mamies dead husbands brother is rachels cousin and technically mamie is her guardian but no one pays attention to such things anymore and jennie lives with some people in a barracks in the next block although rachel and i asked her to live here she shook her head the beautiful hair so blonde its almost white bouncing on her shoulders and blushed in embarrassment painfully not looking at mamie im getting married jennie mamie says again casting down her eyes bashfully i wonder what she did and with whom to get the champagne congratulations jennie says warmly you too peter call me pete he says as he has said before i catch his hungry look at jennie she doesnt but some sixth sense even here even insidemakes her step slightly backwards i know she will go on calling him peter mamie says to jennie have some more champagne stay for dinner with her eyes jennie measures the amount of champagne in the bottle the size of the chicken bleeding slightly on the table she measures unobtrusively and then of course she lies im sorry i cantwe ate our meal at noon today i just wanted to ask if i could bring someone over to see you later gram a visitor her voice drops to a hush and the glow is back from outside i look at her sparkling blue eyes at rachels face and i dont have the heart to refuse even though i can guess as the two girls can not how the visit will be i am not jennies grandmother but she has called me that since she was three all right oh thank you jennie cries and she and rachel look at each other with delight im so glad you said yes or else we might never get to talk to a visitor up close at all youre welcome i say they are so young mamie looks petulant her announcement has been upstaged peter watches jennie as she impulsively hugs rachel suddenly i know that he too is wondering where jennies body is diseased and how much he catches my eye and looked at the floor his dark eyes lidded half ashamed but only half a log cackles in the wooden stove and for a brief moment the fire flares the next afternoon jennie brings the visitor he surprises me immediately he isnt wearing a sanisuit and he isnt a sociologist in the years following the internments the disease colonies had a lot of visitors doctors still hopeful of a cure for the thick gray ridges of skin that spread slowly over a human bodyor didnt nobody knew why disfiguring ugly maybe eventually fatal and communicable that was the biggie communicable so doctors in sanisuits came looking for causes or cures journalists in sanisuits came looking for stories with fourcolor photo spreads legislative factfinding committees in sanisuits came looking for facts at least until congress took away the power of colonies to vote pressured by taxpayers who increasingly pressured themselves resented our dollardependent status and the sociologists came in droves minicams in hand ready to record the collapse of the illorganized and ill colonies into streetgang dogeatdog anarchy later when this did not happen different sociologists came in latermodel sanisuits to record the reasons why the colonies were not collapsing on schedule all these groups went away dissatisfied there was no cure no cause no story no collapse no reasons the sociologists hung on longer than anybody else journalists have to be timely and interesting but sociologists merely have to publish besides everything in their cultural tradition told them that inside must sooner or later degenerate into war zones deprive people of electricity power became expensive of municipal police who refused to go inside of freedom to leave of political clout of jobs of freeways and movie theatres and federal judges and state administered elementary school accreditationand you get unrestrained violence to just survive everything in the culture said so bombedout inner cities lord of the flies the chicago projects western movies prison memoirs the bronx east la thomas hobbes the sociologists knew only it didnt happen the sociologists waited and inside we learned to grow vegetables and raise chickens who we learned will eat anything those of us with computer knowledge worked real jobs over modems for a few yearsmaybes it was as long as a decadebefore the equipment became too obsolete and unreplaced those who had been teachers organized classes among the children although the curriculum i think must have gotten simpler every year rachel and jennie dont seem to have much knowledge of history or science doctors practiced with medicines donated by corporations for the tax writeoffs and after a decade or so they began to train apprentices for a whileit might have been a long whilewe listened to radios and watched tv maybe some people still do if we have any working ones donated from outside eventually the sociologists remembered older models of deprivation and discrimination and isolation from the larger culture jewish shtetls french huguenots amish farmers selfsufficient models stagnant but uncollapsed and while they were remembering we held goods lotteries and took on apprentices and rationed depository food according to who needed it and replaced our brokendown furniture with other brokendown furniture and got married and bore children we paid no taxes fought no wars wielded no votes provided no drama after a whilea long whilethe visitors stopped coming even the sociologists but here stands this young man without a sanisuit smiling from brown eyes under thick dark hair and taking my hand he doesnt wince when he touches the ropes of disease nor does he appear to be cataloguing the kitchen furniture for later recording three chairs one donated imitation queen anne and one inside genuine joe kleinschmidt the table the wood stove the sparkling new oriental lacquered cupboard plastic sink with hand pump connected to the reservoir pipe from outside woodbox with donated wood stamped gift of boisecascade two eager and intelligent and loving young girls he had better not try to patronize as diseased freaks it has been a long time but i remember hello mrs pratt im tom mchabe thank you for agreeing to talk to me i nod what are we going to talk about mr mchabe are you a journalist no im a doctor i didnt expect that nor do i expect the sudden strain that flashes across his face before its lost in another smile although it is natural enough that strain should be there having come inside of course he can never leave i wonder where he picked up the disease no other new cases have been admitted to our colony for as long as i could remember had they been taken for some outside political reason to one of the other colonies instead mchabe says i dont have the disease mrs pratt then why on earth im writing a paper on the progress of the disease in longestablished colony residents i have to do that from inside of course he says and immediately i know he is lying rachel and jennie of course do not they sit one on each side of him like eager birds listening and how will you get this paper out once its written i said shortwave radio colleagues are expecting it but he doesnt quite meet my eyes and this paper is worth permanent internment how rapidly did your case of the disease progress he says not answering my question he looks at my face and hands and forearms an objective and professional scrutiny that makes me decide at least one part of his story is true he is a doctor any pain in the infected areas none any functional disability or decreased activity as a result of the disease rachel and jennie look slightly puzzled hes testing me to see if i understand the terminology none any change in appearance over the last few years in the first skin areas to be affected changes in colour or tissue density or size of the thickened ridges none any other kinds of changes i havent thought to mention none he nods and rocks back on his heels hes cool for someone who is going to develop nondysfunctional ropes of disease himself i wait to see if hes going to tell me why hes really here the silence lengthens finally mchabe says you were a cpa at the same time that rachel says anyone want a glass of ade mchabe accepts gladly the two girls relieved to be in motion busy themselves pumping cold water crushing canned peaches mixing the ade in a brown plastic pitcher with a deep wart on one side where it once touched the hot stove yes i say to mchabe i was a cpa what about it theyre outlawed now cpas why staunch pillars of the establishment i say and realize how long its been since i used words like that they taste metallic like old tin not anymore irs does all tax computations and sends every household a customized bill the calculations on how they reach your particular customized figure is classified to prevent foreign enemies from guessing at revenue available for defense ah my uncle was a cpa what is he now not a cpa mchabe says he doesnt smile jennie hands glasses of ade to me and then to mchabe and then he does smile jennie drops her lashes and a little colour steals into her cheeks something moves behind mchabes eyes but its not like peter not at all like peter i glance at rachel she doesnt seem to have noticed anything she isnt jealous or worried or hurt i relax a little mchabe says to me you also published that artical how do you happen to know that again he doesnt answer me its an unusual combination of abilities accounting and history writing i suppose so i say without interest it was so long ago rachel says to mchabe can i ask you something sure outside do you have medicines that will cure wood of termites her face is deadly serious mchabe doesnt grin and i admitreluctantlythat he is likable he answers her courteously we dont cure the wood we do away with the termites the best way is to build with wood saturated with creosote a chemical they dont like so that they dont get into the wood in the first place but there must be chemicals that will kill them after theyre already there ill ask around and try to bring you something on my next trip inside his next trip inside he drops this bombshell as if easy passage in and out were a given rachels and jennies eyes grow wide they both look at me mchabe does too and i see that his look is a cool scrutiny an appraisal of my reaction he expects me to ask for details or maybe evenits been a long time since i thought in these terms and its an effortto become angry at him for lying but i dont know whether or not hes lying and at any rate what does it matter a few people from outside coming into the colonyhow could it affect us there wont be large immigration and no emigration at all i say quietly why are you really here dr mchabe i told you mrs pratt to measure the progress of the disease i say nothing he adds maybe youd like to hear more about how it is now outside not especially why not i shrug they leave us alone he weighs me with his eyes jennie says timidly id like to hear more about outside before rachel can add me too the door flings violently open and mamie backs into the room screaming into the hall behind her and dont ever come back if you think id ever let you touch me again after screwing thatthat hope shes got a diseased twat and you get it on your she sees mchabe and breaks off her whole body jerking in rage a soft answer from the hall the words unintelligible from my chair by the fire makes her gasp and turn even redder she slams the door bursts into tears and runs into her bedroom slamming that door as well rachel stands up let me honey i say but before i can risemy arthritis is much betterrachel disappears into her mothers room the kitchen rings with embarrassed silence tom mchabe rises to leave sit down doctor i say hoping i think that if he remains mamie will restrain her hystericsmaybeand rachel will emerge sooner from her mothers room mchabe looks undecided then jennie says yes please stay and would you tell us i see her awkwardness her desire to not sound stupid about how people do outside he does looking at jennie but meaning me he talks about the latest version of martial law about the failure of the national guard to control protestors against the south american war until they actually reached the edge of the white house electrowired zone about the growing power of the fundamentalist underground that the other undergroundshe uses the pluralcall the god gang he tells us about the industries losing out steadily to korean and chinese competitors the leaping unemployment rate the ethnic backlash the cities in flames miami new york los angelesthese had been rioting for years now its portland st louis atlanta phoenix grand rapids burning its hard to picture i say as far as i can tell donations to our repositories havent fallen off he looks at me again with that shrewd scrutiny weighing something i cant see then touches the edge of the stove with one boot the boot i notice is almost as old and scarred as one of ours koreanmade stove they make nearly all the donations now public relations even a lot of martiallaw congressmen had relatives interred although they wont admit it now the asians cut deals warding off complete protectionism although of course your donations are only a small part of that but just about everything you get inside is chink or splat he uses the words casually this courteous young man giving me the news from such a liberal slant and that tells me more about the outside than all his bulletins and summaries jennie says haltingly i saw i think it was an asian man yesterday where i say sharply very few asian americans contract the disease something else no one understands there are none in our colony at the rim one of the guards two other men were kicking him and yelling names at himwe couldnt hear too clearly over the intercom boxes we you and rachel what were you two doing at the rim i say and heard my own tone the rim a wide empty strip of land is electromined and barbwired to keep us communicables inside the rim is surrounded by miles of defoliated and disinfected land poisoned by preventive chemicals but even so its patrolled by unwilling soldiers who communicate with the inside by intercoms set up every halfmile on both sides of the barbed wire when the colony used to have a fight or a rape oronce in the early yearsa murder it happened on the rim when the hateful and the hating came to hurt us because before the elecrowiring and barbed wire we were easy targets and no police would follow them inside the soldiers and sometimes our men as well stopped them at the rim our dead are buried near the rim and rachel and jennie dear gods at the rim we went to ask the guards over the intercom boxes if they knew how to stop termites jennie says logically after all their work is to stop things germs and things we thought they might be able to tell us how to stop termites we thought they might have special training in it the bedroom door opens and rachel comes out her young face drawn mchabe smiles at her and then his gaze returns to jenniei dont think soldiers are trained in stopping termites but ill definitely brim on his second visit to me six days later just before the block dance tom mchabe seems different id forgotten that there are people who radiate such energy and purpose that they seem to set the very air tingling he stands with his legs braced slightly apart flanked by rachel and jennie both dressed in their other skirts for the dance jennie has woven a red ribbon through her blonde curls it glows like a flower mchabe touches her lightly on the shoulder and i realize from her answering look what must be happening between them my throat tightens i want to be honest with you mrs pratt ive talked to jack stevenson and mary kramer as well as some others in blocks c and e and ive gotten a feel for how you live here a little bit anyway im going to tell mr stevenson and mrs kramer what i tell you but i wanted you to be first why i say more harshly than i intend or think i intend he isnt fazed because youre one of the oldest survivors of the disease because you had a strong education outside because your daughters husband died of axoperidine at the same moment that i realize what mchabe is going to say next i realize too that rachel and jennie have already heard it they listen to him with the slightly openmouthed intensity of children hearing a marvellous but familiar tale but do they understand rachel wasnt present when her father finally died gasping for air his lungs couldnt use mchabe watching me says theres been a lot of research on the disease since those deaths mrs pratt no there hasnt too risky your government said i see that he caught the pronoun actual administration of any cures is illegal yes to minimize contact with communicables so how has this research been carried on by doctors willing to go inside and not come out again data is transmitted out by laser in code what clean doctor would be willing to go inside and not come out again mchabe smiles again im struck by that quality of spontaneous energy oh youd be surprised we had three doctors inside the pennsylvania colony one past retirement age another an oldstyle catholic who dedicated his research to god a third nobody could figure out a dour persistent guy who was a brilliant researcher was and you no mchabe says quietly i go in and out what happened to the others theyre dead he makes a brief aborted movement with his right hand and i realize that he is or was a smoker how long since i had reached like that for a nonexistent cigarette nearly two decades cigarettes are not among the things people donate theyre too valuable yet i recognize the movement still two of the three doctors caught the disease they worked on themselves as well as volunteers then one day the government intercepted the relayed data and went in and destroyed everything why jennie asks research on the disease is illegal everyone outside is afraid of a leak a virus somehow getting out on a mosquito a bird even as a spore nothing has gotten out in all these years rachel says no but the government is afraid that if researchers start splicing and intercutting genes it could make viruses more viable you don t understand the outside rachel everything is illegal this is the most repressive period in american history everyones afraid youre not jennie says so softly i barely hear her mchabe gives her a smile that twists my heart some of us havent given up research goes on but its all underground all theoretical and weve learned a lot weve learned that the virus doesnt just affect the skin there are be quiet i say because i see that hes about to say something important be quiet a minute let me think mchabe waits jennie and rachel look at me that glow of suppressed excitement on them both eventually i find it you want something dr mchabe all this research wants something from us besides pure scientific joy with things outside as bad as you say there must be plenty of diseases outside you could research without killing yourself plenty of need among your own people he nods his eyes gleaming but youre here inside why we dont have any more new or interesting symptoms we barely survive the outside stopped caring what happened to us a long time ago we have nothing so why are you here youre wrong mrs pratt you do have something interesting going on here you have survived your society has regressed but not collapsed youre functioning under conditions where you shouldnt have the same old crap i raise my eyebrows at him he stares into the fire and says quietly to say washington is rioting says nothing you have to see a twelveyearold hurl a homemade bomb a man sliced open from neck to crotch because he still has a job to go to and his neighbour doesnt a threeyearold left to starve because someone abandoned her like an unwanted kittenyou dont know it doesnt happen inside were better than they are rachel says i look at my grandchild she says it simply without selfaggrandizement but with a kind of wonder in the firelight the thickened gray ropes of skin across her cheek glow dull maroon mchabe said perhaps you are i started to say earlier that weve learned that the virus doesnt affect just the skin it alters neurotransmitter receptor sites in the brain as well its a relatively slow transformation which is why the flurry of research in the early years of the disease missed it but its real as real as the faster sitecapacity transformations brought about by say cocaine are you following me mrs pratt i nod jennie and rachel dont look lost although they dont know any of this vocabulary and i recognize that mchabe must have explained all this to them as the disease progresses to the brain the receptors which receive excitory transmitters slowly become harder to engage and the receptors which receive inhibiting transmitters become easier to engage you mean that we become stupider oh no intelligence is not affected at all the results are emotional and behavioural not intellectual you becomeall of youcalmer disinclined to action or innovation mildly but definitely depressed the fire burns down i pick up the poker bent slightly where someone once tried to use it as a crowbar and poke at the log which is a perfectly shaped mouldedpulp synthetic stamped donated by weyerhaeuserseyyed i dont feel depressed young man its a depression of the nervous system but a new kindwithout the hopelessness usually associated with clinical depression i dont believe you really with all due courtesy when was the last time youor any of the older block leaderspushed for any significant change in how you do things inside sometimes things cannot be constructively changed only accepted thats not chemistry its reality not outside mchabe says grimly outside they dont change constructively or accept they get violent inside youve had almost no violence since the early years even when your resources tightened again and again when was the last time you tasted butter mrs pratt or smoked a cigarette or had a new pair of jeans do you know what happens outside when consumer goods become unavailable and there are no police in a given area but inside you just distribute whatever you have as fairly as you can or make do without no looting no rioting no cancerous envy no one outside knew why now we do we have envy but it doesnt erupt into anger each time one of us speaks jennie and rachel turn their heads to watch like rapt spectators at tennis which neither of them has ever seen jennies skin glows like pearl our young people arent violent either and the disease hasnt advanced very far in some of them they learn how to behave from their eldersjust like kids everywhere else i dont feel depressed do you feel energetic i have arthritis thats not what i mean what do you mean doctor again that restless furtive reach for a nonexistent cigarette but his voice is quiet how long did it take you to get around to applying that insecticide i got rachel for the termites she told me you forbid her to do it and i think you were right its dangerous stuff how many days went by before you or your daughter spread it around the chemical is still in its can how much anger are you feeling now mrs pratt he goes on because i think we understand each other you and i and that you guess now why im here but you arent shouting or ordering me out of here or even telling me what you think of me youre listening and youre doing it calmly and youre accepting what i tell you even though you know what i want you to the door opens and he breaks off mamie flounces in followed by peter she scowls and stamps her foot where were you rachel weve been standing outside waiting for you all for ten minutes now the dance has already started a few more minutes mama were talking talking about what whats going on nothing mchabe says i was just asking your mother some questions about life inside im sorry we took so long you never ask me questions about life inside and besides i want to dance mchabe says if you and peter want to go ahead ill bring rachel and jenme mamie chews her bottom lip i suddenly know that she wants to walk up the street to the dance between peter and mchabe an arm linked with each the girls trailing behind mchabe meets her eyes steadily well if thats what you want she says pettishly come on pete she closes the door hard i look at mchabe unwilling to voice the question in front of rachel trusting him to know the argument i want to make he does in clinical depression theres always been a small percentage for whom the illness is manifested not as passivity but as irritability it may be the same we dont know gram rachel says as if she cant contain herself any longer he has a cure for the skin manifestation only mchabe says quickly and i see that he wouldnt have chosen to blurt it out that way not for the effects on the brain i say despite myself how can you cure one without the other he runs his hand through his hair thick brown hair i watch jennie watch his hand skin tissue and brain tissue arent alike mrs pratt the virus reaches both the skin and the brain at the same time but the changes to brain tissue which is much more complex take much longer to detect and they cant be reversednerve tissue is nonregenerative if you cut your fingertip it will eventually break down and replace the damaged cells to heal itself shit if youre young enough you can grow an entire new fingertip something like that is what we think our cure will stimulate the skin to do but if you damage your cortex those cells are gone forever and unless another part of the brain can learn to compensate whatever behaviour those cells governed is also changed forever changed into depression you mean into calmness into restraint of actionthe country desperately needs restraint mrs pratt and so you want to take some of us outside cure the skin ropes and let the depression spread the restraint the slowness to act we have enough action out there and no one can control itits all the wrong kind what we need now is to slow everything down a littlebefore theres nothing left to slow down youd infect a whole population slowly gently for their own good is that up to you to decide considering the alternative yes because it works the colonies work despite all your deprivations and they work because of the disease each new case would have skin ropes which well then cure does your cure work doctor rachels father died of a cure like yours not like ours he says and i hear in his voice the utter conviction of the young of the energetic of the outside this is new and medically completely different this is the right strain and you want me to try this new right strain as your guinea pig there is a moment of electric silence eyes shift gray blue brown even before rachel rises from her stool or mchabe says we think the best chances to avoid scarring are with young people without heavy skin manifestations i know rachel puts her arms around me and jenniejennie with the red ribbon woven in her hair sitting on her broken chair as on a throne jennie who never heard of neurotransmitters or slow viruses or risk calculationssays simply it has to be me and looks at mchabe with eyes shining with love i say no i send mchabe away and say no i reason with both girls and say no they look unhappily at each other and i wonder how long it will be before they realize they can act without permission without obedience but they never have we argue for nearly an hour and then i insist they go on to the dance and that i go with them the night is cold jennie puts on her sweater a heavy handknitted garment that covers her shapelessly from neck to knees rachel drags on her coat a black donated synthetic frayed at cuffs and hem as we go out the door she stops me with a hand on my arm gramwhy did you say no why honey ive been telling you for an hour the risk the danger is it that or i can feel her in the darkness of the hall gathering herself together or is itdont be mad gram please dont be mad at meis it because the cure is a new thing a change a different thing you dont want because its exciting like tom said no it isnt that i say and feel her tense beside me and for the first time in her life i dont know what the tensing means we go down the street towards block b theres a moon and stars tiny high pinpoints of cold light block b is further lit by kerosene lamps and by torches stuck in the ground in front of the peeling barracks walls that form the cheerless square or does it only seem cheerless because of what mchabe said could we have done better than this blank utilitarianism this subdued bleaknessthis peace before tonight i wouldnt have asked i stand in the darkness at the head of the street just beyond the square with rachel and jennie the band plays across from me a violin guitar and trumpet with one valve that keeps sticking people bundled in all the clothes they own ring the square clustering in the circles of light around the torches talking in quiet voices six or seven couples dance slowly in the middle of the barren earth holding each other loosely and shuffling to a plaintive version of starships and roses the song was a hit the year i got the disease and then had a revival a decade later the year the first manned expedition left for mars the expedition was supposed to set up a colony are they still there we had written no new songs peter and mamie circle among the other couples starships and roses ends and the band begins yesterday a turn brings mamies face briefly into full torchlight its clenched and tight streaked with tears you should sit down gram rachel says this is the first time shes spoken to me since we left the barracks her voice is heavy but not angry and there is no anger in jennies arm as she sets down the threelegged stool she carried for me neither of them is ever really angry under my weight the stool sinks unevenly into the ground a boy twelve or thirteen years old comes up to jennie and wordlessly holds out his hand they join the dancing couples jack stevenson much more arthritic than i hobbles towards me with his grandson hal by his side hello sarah been a long time hello jack thick disease ridges cross both his cheeks and snakes down his nose once long ago we were at yale together hal go dance with rachel jack says give me that stool first hal obedient exchanges the stool for rachel and jack lowers himself to sit beside me big doings sarah so i hear mchabe told you all of it he said hed been to see you just before me he told me what do you think i dont know he wants hal to try the cure hal i hadnt thought the boys face is smooth and clear the only visible skin ridges on his right hand i say jennie too jack nods apparently unsurprised hal said no hal did you mean jennie didnt he stares at me shed even consider something as dangerous as an untried curenot to mention this alleged passing outside i dont answer peter and mamie dance from behind the other couples disappear again the song they dance to is slow sad and old jackcould we have done better here with the colony jack watches the dancers finally he says we dont kill each other we dont burn things down we dont steal or at least not much and not cripplingly we dont hoard it seems to me weve done better than anyone had ever hoped including us his eyes search the dancers for hal hes the best thing in my life that boy another rare flash of memory jack debating in some longforgotten political science class at yale a young man on fire he stands braced lightly on the balls of his feet leaning forward like a fighter or a dancer the electric lights brilliant on his glossy black hair young women watch him with their hands quiet on their open textbooks he has the pro side of the debating question resolved fomenting firststrike thirdworld wars is an effective method of deterring nuclear conflict among superpowers abruptly the band stops playing in the centre of the square peter and mamie shout at each other saw the way you touched her you bastard you faithless prick for gods sake mamie not here why not here you didnt mind dancing with her here touching her back here and ass and and she starts to cry people look away embarrassed a woman i dont know steps forward and puts a hesitant hand on mamies shoulder mamie shakes it off her hands to her face and rushes away from the square peter stands there dumbly a moment before saying to no one in particular im sorry please dance he walks towards the band who begin raggedly to play didnt we almost have it all the song is twentyfive years old jack stevenson says can i help sarah with your girl how i dont know he says and of course he doesnt he offers not out of usefulness but out of empathy knowing how the ugly little scene in the torchlight depresses me do we all so easily understand depression rachel dances by with someone i dont know a stillfaced older man she throws a worried glance over his shoulder now jennie is dancing with peter i cant see peters face but i see jennies she looks directly at no one but then she doesnt have to the message shes sending is clear i forbade her to come to the dance with mchabe but i didnt forbid her to dance with peter and so she is even though she doesnt want to even though its clear from her face that this tiny act of defiance terrifies her peter tightens his arm and she jerks backward against it smiling hard kara desmond and rob cottrell come up to me blocking my view of the dancers theyve been here as long as i kara has an infant greatgrandchild one of the rare babies born already disfigured by the disease karas dress which she wears over jeans for warmth is torn at the hem her voice is soft sarah its great to see you out rob says nothing hes put on weight in the few years since i saw him last in the flickering torchlight his jowly face shines with the serenity of a diseased buddha its two more dances before i realize that jennie has disappeared i look around for rachel shes pouring sumac tea for the band peter dances by with a woman not wearing jeans under her dress the woman is shivering and smiling so it isnt peter that jennie left with rob will you walk me home in case i stumble the cold is getting to my arthritis rob nods incurious kara says ill come too and we leave jack stevenson on his stool waiting for his turn at hot tea kara chatters happily as we walk along as fast as i can go which isnt as fast as i want to go the moon has set the ground is uneven and the street dark except for the stars and fitful lights in barracks windows candles oil lamps once a single powerful glow from what i guess to be a donated storedsolar light the only one ive seen in a long time korean tom said youre shivering kara says here take my coat i shake my head i make them leave me outside our barracks and they do unquestioning quietly i open the door to our dark kitchen the stove has gone out the door to the back bedroom stands halfopen voices coming from the darkness i shiver again and karas coat wouldnt have helped but i am wrong the voices arent jennie and peter not what i wanted to talk about just now mamie says but its what i want to talk about is it yes i stand listening to the rise and fall of their voices to the petulance in mamies the eagerness in mchabes jennie is your ward isnt she oh jennie yes for another year then shell listen to you even if your mother the decision is yours and hers i guess so but i want to think about it i need more information ill tell you anything you ask will you are you married dr thomas mchabe silence then his voice different dont do that are you sure are you really sure im sure really really sure that you want me to stop i cross the kitchen hitting my knee against an unseen chair in the open doorway a sky full of stars moves into view through the termite hole in the wall ow i said to stop it mrs wilson now please think about what i said about jennie ill come back tomorrow morning and you can you can go straight to hell mamie shouts and then in a different voice strangely calm is it because im diseased and youre not and jennie is not no i swear it no but i didnt come here for this no mamie says in that same chill voice and i realize that i have never heard it from her before never you came to help us to bring a cure to bring the outside but not for everybody only for the few who arent too far gone who arent too uglywho you can use it isnt like that a few who you can rescue leaving all the rest of us here to rot like we did before in time research on the time what do you think time matters inside time matters shit here time only matters when someone like you comes in from the outside showing off your healthy skin and making it even worse than it was before with your new whole clothing and your working wristwatch and your shiny hair and youryour she is sobbing i step into the room all right mamie all right neither of them react to seeing me mchabe just stands there until i wave him towards the door and he goes not saying a word i put my arms around mamie and she leans against my breast and cries my daughter even through my coat i feet the thick ropy skin of her cheek pressing against me and all i can think of is that i never noticed at all that mchabe wears a wristwatch late that night after mamie has fallen into damp exhausted sleep and i have lain awake tossing for hours rachel creeps into our room to say that jennie and hal stevenson have both been injected with an experimental disease cure by tom mchabe shes cold and trembling defiant in her fear afraid of all their terrible defiance i hold her until she too sleeps and i remember jack stevenson as a young man classroom lights glossy on his thick hair spiritedly arguing in favour of the sacrifice of one civilization for another mamie leaves the barracks early the next morning her eyelids are still swollen and shiny from last nights crying i guess that shes going to hunt up peter and i say nothing we sit at the table rachel and i eating our oatmeal not looking at each other its an effort to even lift the spoon mamie is gone a long time later i picture it later when jennie and hal and mchabe have come and gone i cant stop picturing it mamie walking with her swollen eyelids down the muddy streets between the barracks across the unpaved squares with their corner vegetable gardens of rickety bean poles and the yellow green tops of carrots past the depositories with their donated chinese and japanese and korean wool and wood stoves and sheets of alloys and unguarded medicines past the chicken runs and goat pens past central administration that dusty cinderblock building where people stopped keeping records maybe a decade ago because why would you need to prove youd been born or had changed barracks past the last of the communal wells reaching deep into a common and plentiful water table mamie walking until she reaches the rim and is stopped and says what she came to say they come a few hours later dressed in full sanksuits and armed with automatic weapons that dont look americanmade i can see their faces through the clear shatterproof plastic of their helmets three of them stare frankly at my face at rachels at hal stevensons hands the other two won t look directly at any of us as if viruses could be transmitted over locked gazes they grab tom mchabe from his chair at the kitchen table pulling him up so hard he stumbles and throw him against the wall they are gentler with rachel and hal one of them stares curiously at jennie frozen on the opposite side of the table they dont let mchabe make any of the passionate explanations he had been trying to make to me when he tries the leader hits him across the face rachelrachelthrows herself at the man she wraps her strong young arms and legs around him from behind screaming stop it stop it the man shrugs her off like a fly a second soldier pushes her into a chair when he looks at her face he shudders rachel goes on yelling sound without words jennie doesnt even scream she dives across the table and clings to mchabes shoulder and whatever is on her face is hidden by the fall of her yellow hair shut you fucking doctors down once and for all the leader yells over rachels noise the words come through his helmet as clearly as if he werent wearing one think you can just go on coming inside and outside and diseasing us all i mchabe says fuck it the leader says and shoots him mchabe slumps against the wall jennie grabs him desperately trying to haul him up upright the soldier fires again the bullet hits jennies wrist shattering the bone a third shot and mchabe slides to the floor the soldiers leave there is little blood only two small holes where the bullets went in and stayed in we didnt know inside that they have guns like that now we didnt know bullets could do that we didnt know you did it rachel says i did it for you mamie says i did they stand across the kitchen from each other mamie pinned against the door she just closed behind her when she finally came home rachel standing in front of the wall where tom died jennie lies sedated in the bedroom hal stevenson his young face anguished because he had been useless against five armed soldiers had run for the doctor who lives in barracks j who had been found setting the leg of a goat you did it you her voice is dull heavy scream i want to say rachel scream i did it so you would be safe you did it so i would be trapped inside like you you never thought it was a trap mamie cries you were the one who was happy here and you never will be never not here not anyplace else i close my eyes to not see the terrible maturity on my rachels face but the next moment shes a child again pushing past me to the bedroom with a furious sob slamming the door behind her i face mamie why but she doesnt answer and i see that it doesnt matter i wouldnt have believed her anyway her mind is not her own it is depressed ill i have to believe that now shes my daughter and her mind has been affected by the ugly ropes of skin that disfigure her she is the victim of disease and nothing she says can change anything at all its almost morning rachel stands in the narrow aisle between the bed and the wall folding clothes the bedspread still bears the imprint of jennies sleeping shape jennie herself was carried by hal stevenson to her own barracks where she wont have to see mamie when she wakes up on the crude shelf beside rachel the oil lamp burns throwing shadows on the newly whole wall that smells of termite exterminator she has few enough clothes to pack a pair of blue tights old and clumsily darned a sweater with pulled threads two more pairs of socks her other skirt the one she wore to the block dance everything else she already has on rachel i say she doesnt answer but i see what silence costs her even such a small defiance even now yet she is going using mchabes contacts to go outside leaving to find the underground medical research outfit if they have developed the next stage of the cure the one for people already disfigured she will take it perhaps even if they have not and as she goes she will contaminate as much as she can with her disease depressive and nonaggressive communicable she thinks she has to go because of jennie because of mamie because of mchabe she is sixteen years old and she believeseven growing up inside she believes thisthat she must do something even if it is the wrong thing to do the wrong thing she has decided is better than to do nothing she has no real idea of outside she has never watched television never stood in a bread line never seen a crack den or a slasher movie she cannot define napalm or political torture or neutron bomb or gang rape to her mamie with her confused and selfjustifying fear represents the height of cruelty and betrayal peter with his shambling embarrassed lewdness the epitome of danger the theft of a chicken the last word in criminality she has never heard of auschwitz cawnpore the inquisition gladiatorial games nat turner pol pot stalingrad ted bundy hiroshima my lai wounded knee babi yar bloody sunday dresden or dachau raised with a kind of mental inertia she knows nothing of the savage inertia of destruction that once set in motion in a civilization is as hard to stop as a disease i dont think she can find the underground researchers no matter how much mchabe told her i dont think her passage outside will spread enough infection to make any difference at all i dont think its possible that she can get very far before she is picked up and either returned inside or killed she cannot change the world its too old too entrenched too vicious too there she will fail there is no force stronger than destructive inertia i get my things ready to go with her and the deep blue sea by elizabeth bear elizabeth bear is the author of several sf novels including jenny casey trilogy hammered scardown and worldwired which won the locus award for best first novel undertow and carnival which was a finalist for the philip k dick award she is also the author of the promethean age fantasy series and with sarah monette a companion to wolves she is a prolific short story writer with nearly publications to her credit since much of her work has been collected in the chains that you refuse and a look at her website wwwelizabethbearcom httpwwwelizabethbearcom reveals several more pieces of short fiction as well as a number of novels forthcoming in the near future and the deep blue sea which first appeared in the online magazine sci fiction is bears take on the postapocalyptic messenger story reminiscent without being derivative of roger zelaznys damnation alley bears fascination with abandoned places and the fact that she lived for years in las vegas americas nuclear city led her to write this story as research for this piece she says she learned how to move safely through a radioactive zone which should come in handy should the events leading up to this story ever come to pass the end of the world had come and gone it turned out not to matter much in the long run the mail still had to get through harrie signed yesterdays paperwork checked the dates against the calendar contemplated her signature for a moment and capped her pen she weighed the metal barrel in her hand and met dispatchs faded eyes whats special about this trip he shrugged and turned the clipboard around on the counter checking each sheet to be certain shed filled them out properly she didnt bother watching she never made mistakes does there have to be something special you dont pay my fees unless its special patch she grinned as he lifted an insulated steel case onto the counter this has to be in sacramento in eight hours he said what is it medical goods fetal stemcell cultures in a climatecontrolled unit they cant get too hot or too cold theres some arcane formula about how long they can live in this given quantity of growth media and the customers paying very handsomely to see them in california by eighteen hundred hours its almost oh ten hundred now whats too hot or too cold harrie hefted the case it was lighter than it looked it would slide effortlessly into the saddlebags on her touring bike any hotter than it already is dispatch said mopping his brow can you do it eight hours phoenix to sacramento harrie leaned back to check the sun itll take me through vegas the california routes arent any good at that speed since the big one i wouldnt send anybody else fastest way is through reno theres no gasoline from somewhere this side of the dam to tonopah even my courier card wont help me there theres a checkpoint in boulder city theyll fuel you military i did say they were paying very well he shrugged shoulders already gleaming with sweat it was going to be a hot one harrie guessed it would hit a hundred and twenty in phoenix at least she was headed north ill do it she said and held her hand out for the package receipt any pickups in reno you know what they say about reno yeah its so close to hell that you can see sparks naming the citys largest suburb right you dont want anything in reno go straight through patch said dont stop in vegas whatever you do the overpasss come down but that wont affect you unless theres debris stay on the through to fallon itll see you clear check she slung the case over her shoulder pretending she didnt see patch wince ill radio when i hit sacramento telegraph he said the crackle between here and there would kill your signal otherwise check again turning to the proppedopen door her prewar kawasaki concours crouched against the crumbling curb like an enormous restless cat not the prettiest bike around but it got you there assuming you didnt ditch the topheavy son of a bitch in the parking lot harrie what she paused but didnt turn if you meet the buddha on the road kill him she glanced behind her strands of hair catching on the strap of the insulated case and on the shoulder loops of her leathers what if i meet the devil she let the concours glide through the curves of the long descent to hoover dam a breather after the hard straight push from phoenix and considered her options shed have to average near enough a hundred sixty klicks an hour to make the run on time it should be smooth sailing shed be surprised if she saw another vehicle between boulder city and tonopah shed checked out a backup dosimeter before she left phoenix just in case both clicked softly as she crossed the dam and the poisoned river reassuring her with alert friendly chatter she couldnt pause to enjoy the expanse of blue on her right side or the view down the escarpment on the left but the dam was in pretty good shape all things considered it was more than you could say for vegas once upon a time she downshifted as she hit the steep grade up the north side of black canyon sweat already soaking her hair once upon a time a delivery like this would have been made by aircraft there were places where it still would be places where there was money for fuel money for airstrip repairs places where most of the aircraft werent parked in tidy rows poisoned birds lined up beside poisoned runways hot enough that you could hear the dosimeters clicking as you drove past a runners contract was a hell of a lot cheaper even when you charged the way patch charged sunlight glinted off the colorado river so far below flashing red and gold as mirrors crumbling casino on the right now and the canyon echoing the purr of the sleek black bike the asphalt was spiderwebbed but still halfway smoothsmooth enough for a big bike anyway a big bike cruising at a steady ninety kph much too fast if there was anything in the road something skittered aside as she thought it a grey blur instantly lost among the red and black blurs of the receding rock walls on either side bighorn sheep nobodyd bothered to tell them to clear out before the wind could make them sick funny thing was they seemed to be thriving harrie leaned into the last curve braking in and accelerating out just to feel the tug of gforces and gunned it up the straightaway leading to the checkpoint at boulder city a red light flashed on a peeling steel pole beside the road the kawasaki whined and buzzed between her thighs displeased to be restrained then gentled as she eased the throttle mindful of dust houses had been knocked down across the top of the rise that served as host to the guards shielded quarters permitting an unimpeded view of boulder city stretching out below the bulldozer that had done the work slumped nearby rusting under bubbled paint too radioactive to be taken away too radioactive even to be melted down for salvage boulder city had been affluent once harrie could see the husks of trendy businesses on either side of main street brick and stucco buildings in red and taupe some whitewashed wood frames peeling in slow curls submissive to the desert heat the gates beyond the checkpoint were closed and so were the lead shutters on the guards shelter a digital sign over the roof gave an ambient radiation reading in the mid double digits and a temperature reading in the low triple digits fahrenheit it would get hotter and hotter as she descended into vegas harrie dropped the sidestand as the kawasaki rolled to a halt and thumbed her horn the young man who emerged from the shack was surprisingly tidy given his remote duty station cap set regulation boots shiny under the dust he was still settling his breathing filter as he climbed down red metal steps and trotted over to harries bike harrie wondered who hed pissed off to draw this duty or if he was a novelist who had volunteered runner she said her voice echoing through her helmet mike she tapped the id card visible inside the windowed pocket on the breast of her leathers tugged her papers from the pouch on her tank with a clumsy gloved hand and unfolded them inside their transparent carrier youre supposed to gas me up for the run to tonopah you have an independent filter or just the one in your helmet all efficiency as he perused her papers independent visor up please he wouldnt ask her to take the helmet off there was too much dust she complied and he checked her eyes and nose against the photo id angharad crowther this looks in order youre with ups independent contractor harrie said its a medical run he turned away gesturing her to follow and led her to the pumps they were shrouded in plastic one diesel and one unleaded is that a connie a little modified so she doesnt buzz so much harrie petted the gas tank with a gloved hand anything i should know about between here and tonopah he shrugged you know the rules i hope stay on the road she said as he slipped the nozzle into the fill dont go inside any buildings dont go near any vehicles dont stop dont look back and especially dont turn around its not wise to drive through your own dust if it glows dont pick it up and nothing from the black zone leaves ill telegraph ahead and let tonopah know youre coming he said as the gas pump clicked you ever crash that thing not in going on ten years she said and didnt bother to cross her fingers he handed her a receipt she fumbled her lacquered stainless cross pen out of her zippered pocket and signed her name like she meant it the gloves made her signature into an incomprehensible scrawl but the guard made a show of comparing it to her id card and slapped her on the shoulder be careful if you crash out there youre probably on your own godspeed thanks for the reassurance she said and grinned at him before she closed her visor and split digitized music rang over her helmet headset as harrie ducked her head behind the fairing the hot wind tugging her sleeves trickling between her gloves and her cuffs the kawasaki stretched out under her ready for a good hard run and harrie itched to give it one one thing you could say about the vegas black zone there wasnt much traffic housesidentical in red tile roofs and cream stucco wallsblurred past on either side flanked by trees that the desert had killed once people werent there to pump the water up to them she cracked a hundred and sixty kph in the wind shadow of the sound barriers the tach winding up like a watch just gliding along in sixth as the kawasaki hit its stride the big bike handled like a pig in the parking lot but out on the highway she ran smooth as glass she had almost a hundred miles of range more than shed need to get to tonopah god willing and the creek didnt rise but she wasnt about to test that with any side trips through what was left of las vegas her dosimeters clicked with erratic cheer nothing to worry about yet and harrie claimed the center lane and edged down to one forty as she hit the winding patch of highway near the old downtown the shells of casinos on the lefthand side and godforsaken wasteland and ghetto on the right gave her back the kawasakis welltuned shriek she couldnt wind it any faster with the roads so choppy and the krail canyons so tight the sky overhead was flat blue like cheap turquoise a pall of dust showed burnt sienna the inversion layer trapped inside the ring of mountains that made her horizon in four directions the freeway opened out once she cleared downtown the overpass patch had warned her about arching up and over a tangle of banked curves the crossroads at the heart of the silent city she bid the ghosts of hotels good day as the sun hit zenith heralding peak heat for another four hours or so harrie resisted the urge to reach back and pat her saddlebag to make sure the precious cargo was safe shed never know if the climate control failed on the trip and moreover she couldnt risk the distraction as she wound the kawasaki up to one hundred seventy and ducked her helmet into the slipstream off the fairing straight shot to the dead town called beatty from here if you minded the cattle guards along the roads by the little forlorn towns straight shot with the dosimeters clicking and vintage rock and roll jamming in the helmet speakers and the kawasaki purring thrusting eager to spring and run there were worse days to be alive she dropped it to fourth and throttled back coming up on that overpass the big one where the phoenix to reno highway crossed the one that used to run la to salt lake when there was an la to speak of patch had said overpasss down which could mean unsafe for transit and could mean littering the freeway underneath with blocks of concrete the size of a semi and harrie had no interest in finding out which it was with no room left to brake she adjusted the volume on her music down as the rush of wind abated and took the opportunity to sightsee a bit and swore softly into her air filter slowing further before she realized shed let the throttle slip something no someone leaned against a shotgunned paintpeeled sign that might have given a speed limit once when there was anyone to care about such things her dosimeters clicked aggressively as she let the bike roll closer to the verge she shouldnt stop but it was a death sentence being alone and on foot out here even if the sun werent climbing the sky sweat rolling from under harries helmet adhering her leathers to her skin she was almost stopped by the time she realized she knew him knew his ocher skin and his natty pinstriped doublebreasted suit and his fedora tilted just so and the cordovan gleam of his loafers for one mad moment she wished she carried a gun not that a gun would help her even if she decided to swallow a bullet herself nick she put the bike in neutral dropping her feet as it rolled to a stop fancy meeting you in the middle of hell i got some papers for you to sign harrie he pushed his fedora back over his hollowcheeked face you got a pen you know i do she unzipped her pocket and fished out the cross i wouldnt lend a fountain pen to just anybody he nodded leaning back against a krail so he could kick a knee up and spread his papers out over it he accepted the pen you know your notes about come due nick no whining now he said didnt i hold up my end of the bargain have you ditched your bike since last we talked no nick crestfallen had it stolen been stranded missed a timetable im about to miss one now if you dont hurry up with my pen she held her hand out imperiously not terribly convincing but the best she could do under the circumstances mmmhmmm he was taking his own sweet time perversely the knowledge settled her if the debts due have you come to collect ive come to offer you a chance to renegotiate he said and capped the pen and handed it back ive got a job for you could buy you a few more years if you play your cards right she laughed in his face and zipped the pen away a few more years but he nodded lips pressed thin and serious and she blinked and went serious too you mean it i never offer what im not prepared to give he said and scratched the tip of his nose with his thumbnail what say ohthree more years threes not very much the breeze shifted her dosimeters crackled tens not very much now that im looking back on it goes by quick dont it he shrugged all right seven for what what do you mean she could have laughed again at the transparent and ohsocalculated guilelessness in his eyes i mean what is it you want me to do for seven more years of protection the bike was heavy but she wasnt about to kick the sidestand down im sure its bad news for somebody it always is but he tipped the brim of his hat down a centimeter and gestured to her saddlebag negligently i just want a moment with what youve got there in that bag huh she glanced at her cargo pursing her lips thats a strange thing to ask what would you want with a box full of research cells he straightened away from the sign he was holding up and came a step closer thats not so much yours to worry about young lady give it to me and you get seven years if you dontthe notes up next week isnt it tuesday she would have spat but she wasnt about to lift her helmet aside im not scared of you nick youre not scared of much he smiled all smooth its part of your charm she turned her head staring away west across the sunsoaked desert and the roofs of abandoned houses abandoned lives nevada had always had a way of making ghost towns out of metropolises what happens if i say no i was hoping you werent going to ask that sweetheart he said he reached to lay a hand on her right hand where it rested on the throttle the bike growled a high hysterical sound and nick yanked his hand back i see you two made friends we get along all right harrie said patting the kawasakis gas tank what happens if i say no he shrugged and folded his arms you wont finish your run no threat in it no extra darkness in the way the shadow of his hat brim fell across his face no menace in his smile cold fact and she could take it how she took it she wished she had a piece of gum to crack between her teeth it would fit her mood she crossed her arms balancing the kawasaki between her thighs harrie liked bargaining thats not the deal the deals no spills no crashes no breakdowns and every run complete on time i said id get these cells to sacramento in eight hours youre wasting my daylight somebodys life could depend on them somebodys life does nick answered letting his lips twist aside a lot of somebodies when it comes down to it break the deal nickfuck with my rideand youre in breach of contract youve got nothing to bargain with she laughed then outright the kawasaki purred between her legs encouraging theres always time to mend my ways not if you die before you make it to sacramento he said last chance to reconsider angharad my princess we can still shake hands and part friends or you can finish your last ride on my terms and it wont be pretty for youthe kawasaki snarled softly the tang of burning oil underneath itor your bike fuck off harrie said and kicked her feet up as she twisted the throttle and drove straight at him just for the sheer stupid pleasure of watching him dance out of her way nevada had been dying slowly for a long time perchloratepoisoned groundwater a legacy of world war two titanium plants cancer rates spiked by exposure to fallout from aboveground nuclear testing crushing drought and climactic change childhood leukemia clusters in rural towns the explosion of the pepcon plant in might have been perceived by a sufficiently imaginative mind as gods shot across the bow but the real damage didnt occur until decades later when a train carrying highlevel nuclear waste to the yucca mountain storage facility collided with a fuel tanker stalled across the rails the resulting fire and radioactive contamination of the las vegas valley proved to be a godsend in disguise when the war came to nellis air force base and the nuclear mountain las vegas was already as much a ghost town as rhyolite or goldfieldexcept deserted not because the banks collapsed or the gold ran out but because the dust that blew through the streets was hot enough to drop a sparrow in midflight or so people said harrie didnt know if the sparrow story was true so she muttered into her helmet crouched over the kawasakis tank as the bike screamed north by northwest leaving eerie las vegas behind what do you think hes going to throw at us girl the bike whined digging in central city gave way to desolate suburbia and the highway dropped to ground level and straightened out a narrow strip of black reflecting the summer heat in mirage silver the desert sprawled on either side a dun expanse of scrub and hardpan narrowing as the kawasaki climbed into the broad pass between two dusty ranges of mountains harries dosimeters clicked steadily counting marginally more rads as she roared by the former nuclear testing site at mercury at close to two hundred kph she throttled back as a sad little townshipa few discarded trailers another military base and a disregarded prisoncame up there were no pedestrians to worry about but the grated metal cattle guard was not something to hit at speed on the far side there was nothing to slow her for fifty miles she cranked her music up and dropped her head behind the fairing and redlined her tach for beatty and the far horizon it got rocky again coming up on beatty civilization in nevada huddled up to the oases and springs that lurked at the foot of mountains and in the low parts in valleys this had been mining country mountains gnawed away by dynamite and sharptoothed payloaders a long gorge on the right side of the highway showed green clots of trees water ran there tainted by the broken dump and her dosimeters clicked as the road curved near it if she walked down the bank and splashed into the stream between the roots of the willows and cottonwoods shed walk out glowing and be dead by nightfall she rounded the corner and entered the ghost of beatty the problem she thought arose because every little town in nevada grew up at the same place a crossroads and she halfexpected nick to be waiting for her at this one too the kawasaki whined as they rolled through tumbleweedclogged streets but they passed under the towns sole blindly staring stoplight without seeing another creature despite the sun like a physical pressure on her leathers a chill ran spidery fingers up her spine shed rather know where the hell he was thank you very much maybe he took a wrong turn at rhyolite the kawasaki snarled impatient to be turned loose on the open road again but harrie threaded it through slumping cars and around windblown debris with finicky care nobodys looking out for us any more connie harrie murmured and stroked the sunscorched fuel tank with her gloved left hand they passed a deserted gas station the pumps crouched useless without power the dosimeters chirped and warbled i dont want to kick up that dust if i can help it the ramshackle one and twostory buildings gave way to desert and highway harrie paused feet down on tarmac melted stickysoft by the sun and made sure the straw of her camel pack was fixed in the holder the horizon shimmered with heat ridges of mountains on either side and dun hardpan stretching to infinity she sighed and took a long drink of stale water here we go she said hands nimble on the clutch and the throttle as she lifted her feet to the peg the kawasaki rolled forward gathering speed not too much further to tonopah and then we can both get fed nick was giving her time to think about it and she drowned the worries with the dead kennedys boiled in lead and the acid trip the ride from beatty to tonopah was swift and uneventful the flat road unwinding beneath her wheels like a spunout tape measure the banded mountains crawling past on either side the only variation along the way was forlorn goldfield its windtouched streets empty and sere it had been a town of twenty thousand abandoned before vegas fell to radiation sickness even longer before the nuke dump broke open she pushed two hundred kph most of the way the road all hers not so much as the glimmer of sunlight off a distant windshield to contest her ownership the silence and the empty road just gave her more to worry at and she did picking at her problem like a vulture picking at a corpse the fountain pen was heavy in her breast pocket as tonopah shimmered into distant visibility her head swam with the heat the helmet squelching over saturated hair she sucked more water trying to ration the temperature was climbing toward one twenty and she wouldnt last long without hydration the kawasaki coughed a little rolling down a slow extended incline but the gas gauge gave her nearly a quarter of a tankand there was the reserve if she exhausted the main still instruments werent always right and luck wasnt exactly on her side harrie killed her music with a jab of her tongue against the control pad inside her helmet she dropped her left hand from the handlebar and thumped the tank the sound she got back was hollow but there was enough fluid inside to hear it refract off a moving surface the small city ahead was a welcome sight thered be fresh water and gasoline and she could hose the worst of the dust off and take a piss god damn youd think with the sweat soaking her leathers to her body thered be no need for that last but the devil was in the details it turned out harried never wanted to be a boy but some days she really wished she had the knack of peeing standing up she was only about half a klick away when she realized that there was something wrong about tonopah other than the usual her dosimeters registered only background noise as she came up on it but a harsh reek like burning coal rasped the back of her throat even through the dust filters and the weird little town wasnt the weird little town she remembered rolling green hills rose around it on all sides thick with shadowy leafless trees and it was smoke haze that drifted on the still air not dust a heat shimmer floated over the cracked road and the buildings that crowded alongside it werent tonopahs desertweathered construction but peeling white shinglesided houses a storefront post office a white church with the steeple caved in and half the facade dropped into a smoking sinkhole in the ground the kawasaki whined shivering as harrie throttled back she sat upright in the saddle letting the big bike roll where the hell are we her voice reverberated she startled shed forgotten shed left her microphone on exactly a familiar voice said at her left welcome to centralia nick wore an openfaced helmet and straddled the back of a honda goldwing the color of dried blood if blood had gold dust flecked through it the honda hissed at the kawasaki and the connie growled back wobbling in eager challenge harrie restrained her bike with gentling hands giving it a little more gas to straighten it out centralia harrie had never heard of it and she flattered herself that shed heard of most places pennsylvania nick lifted his blackgloved hand off the clutch and gestured vaguely around himself or jharia in india or maybe the chinese province of xinjiang subterranean coal fires you know anthracite burning in evacuated mines whole towns abandoned sulfur and brimstone seeping up through vents the ground hot enough to flash rain to steam your tires will melt youll put that bike into a crevasse not to mention the greenhouse gases lovely things he grinned showing sharks teeth four rows second time asking angharad my princess second time saying no she fixed her eyes on the road she could see the way the asphalt buckled now and the dim glow from the bottom of the sinkhole underneath the church you really are used to people doing your bidding arent you nick they dont usually put up much of a fight he twisted the throttle while the clutch was engaged coaxing a whining competitive cough from his honda harrie caught his shrug sideways but kept her gaze trained grimly forward was that the earth shivering or was it just the shimmer of heathaze over the road the kawasaki whined she petted the clutch to reassure herself the groaning rumble that answered her wasnt the kawasaki she tightened her knees on the seat as the ground pitched and bucked under her tires hand clutching the throttle to goose the connie forward broken asphalt sprayed from her rear tire the road split and shattered vanishing behind her she hauled the bike upright by raw strength and nerved herself to check her mirrors lazy steam rose from a gaping hole in the road nick cruised along unperturbed you sure princess what was that you said about hell nick she hunkered down and grinned at him over her shoulder knowing he couldnt see more than her eyes crinkle through the helmet it was enough to draw an irritated glare he sat back on his haunches and tipped his toes up on the footpegs throwing both hands up releasing throttle and clutch letting the honda coast away behind her i said welcome to it the kawasaki snarled and whimpered by turns heavy and agile between her legs as she gave it all the gas she dared shed been counting on the refuel stop here but compact southwestern tonopah had been replaced by a shattered sprawl of buildings most of them obviously either bulldozed or vanished into pits that glared like a wolfs eye reflecting a flash and a gas station wasnt one of the remaining options the streets were broad at least and deserted not so much winding as curving gently through shallow swales and over hillocks broad but not intact the asphalt rippled as if heaved by moles and some of the rises and dips hid fissures and sinkholes her tires scorched she coughed into her filter her mike amplifying it to a hyenas bark the cross pen in her pocket pressed her breast over her heart she took comfort in it ducking behind the fairing to dodge the stinking wind and the clawing skeletons of ungroomed trees shed signed on the line after all and either nick had to see her and the kawasaki safe or she got back what shed paid as if nick abided by contracts as if he couldnt just kill her and get what he wanted that way except he couldnt keep her if he did damn she murmured to hear the echoes and hunched over the kawasakis tank the wind tore at her leathers the heavy bike caught air coming over the last rise she had to pee like she couldnt believe and the vibration of the engine wasnt helping but she laughed out loud to set the city behind she got out easier than she thought she would although her gauge read empty at the bottom of the hill she switched to reserve and swore dead trees and smoking stumps rippled into nonexistence around her and the lone and level sands stretched to ragged mountains east and west back in nevada if shed ever left it hard westbound now straight into the glare of the afternoon sun her polarized faceplate helped somewhat maybe not enough but the road was smooth again before and behind and she could see tonopah sitting dusty and forsaken in her rearview mirror inaccessible as a mirage a city at the bottom of a well maybe nick could only touch her in the towns maybe he needed a little of mans hand on the wilderness to twist to his own ends or maybe it amused him maybe it was where the roads crossed after all she didnt think she could make it back to tonopah if she tried however so she pretended she didnt see the city behind her and cruised west toward hawthorne praying she had enough gas to make it but not expecting her prayers to be answered by anybody she particularly wanted to talk to the turned northwest again at the deserted coaldale junction there hadnt been a town there since long before the war or even the disaster at vegas mina was gone too its outskirts marked by a peeling sign advertising an abandoned crawfish farm the desert lobster facility harries camel bag went dry she sucked at the straw forlornly one last time and spat it out letting it sag against her jaw damp and tacky she hunkered down and laid a long line of smoking road behind cornering gently when she had to corner worried about her scorched and bruised tires at least the day was cooling as evening encroached as she progressed north and gained elevation it might be down into the double digits even although it was hard to tell through the leather on her left the sarcophagus mountains rose between her and california the name didnt amuse her as much as it usually did and then they were climbing she breathed a low sigh of relief and patted the hungry grumbling kawasaki on the fuel tank as the blistering blue of walker lake came into view the dusty little town of hawthorne huddled like a crab on the near shore there was nothing moving there either and harrie chewed her lip behind the filter dust had gotten into her helmet somehow gritting every time she blinked weeping streaks marked her cheeks behind the visor she hoped the dust wasnt the kind that was likely to make her glow but her dosimeters had settled down to chickenlike clucking so she might be okay the kawasaki whimpered apologetically and died as she coasted into town christ she said and flinched at the echo of her own amplified voice she reached to thumb the mike off and on second thought left it alone it was too damned quiet out here without the kawasakis commentary she tongued her music back on flipping selections until she settled on a tune by grey line out she dropped her right foot and kicked the stand down on the left then stood on the peg and slung her leg over the saddle she ached with vibration her hands stiff claws from clutching the handlebars the stretch of muscle across her ass and thighs was like the reminder of a twodayold beating but she leaned into the bike boot sole slipping on grit as she heaved it into motion she hopped on one foot to kick the stand up wincing it wasnt the riding it was the standing up afterward she walked the kawasaki up the deserted highway between the deserted buildings the pavement hot enough to sear her feet through the boot leather if she stood still for too long good girl she told the kawasaki stroking the forward brake handle it leaned against her heavily cumbersome at a walking pace like walking a drunk friend home gotta be a gas station somewhere of course there wouldnt be any power to run the pumps and probably no safe water but shed figure that out when she got there sunlight glimmered off the lake she was fine she told herself because she wasnt too dehydrated for her mouth to wet at the thought of all that cool fresh water except there was no telling what kind of poison was in that lake there was an old naval base on its shore and the lake itself had been used as a kind of kiddie pool for submarines anything at all could be floating around in its waters not she admitted that there wasnt a certain irony to taking the long view at a time like this she spotted a texaco station the red and white sign bleached pink and ivory crazed by the relentless desert sun harrie couldnt remember if she was in the mojave or the black rock desert now or some other desert entirely they all ran together she jumped at her own slightly hysterical giggle the pumps were off as shed anticipated but she leaned the kawasaki up on its sidestand anyway grabbed the climatecontrolled case out of her saddlebag and went to find a place to take a leak the leather was hot on her fingers when she pulled her gloves off and dropped her pants damned stupid first thing i do when i get back to civilization is buy a set of leathers and a helmet in white dammit she glanced at the kawasaki as she fixed herself expecting a hiss of agreement but the black bike was silent she blinked stinging eyes and turned away there was a garden hose curled on its peg behind one of the tanfaced houses huddled by the texaco station the upper side bleached yellow on green like the belly of a dead snake harrie wrenched it off the peg onehanded the rubber was brittle from dry rot she broke it twice trying to uncoil a section but managed to get about seven feet clean she pried the fill cap off the underground tank with a tire iron and yanked off her helmet and air filter to sniff checking both dosimeters first it had after all been one of those days the gas smelled more or less like gasoline though and it tasted like fucking gasoline too when she got a good mouthful of it from sucking it up her impromptu siphon not very good gasoline maybe but beggars and choosers the siphon wouldnt work as a siphon because she couldnt get the top end lower than the bottom end but she could suck fuel up into it and transfer it hoseful by hoseful into the kawasakis empty tank the precious case leaning against her boot while she did finally she saw the dark gleam of fluid shimmer through the fill hole when she peered inside and tapped the side of the tank she closed the tank and spat and spat wishing she had water to wash the gasoline away the lake glinted mocking her and she resolutely turned her back on it and picked up the case it was light in her hand she paused with one hand on the flap of the saddlebag weighing that gleaming silver object staring past it at her boots she sucked on her lower lip tasted gas and turned her head and spat again a few more years of freedom connie she said and stroked the metal with a blackgloved hand you and me i could drink the water it wouldnt matter if that was bad gas i fed you nothing could go wrong the kawasaki was silent its keys jangled in harries hip pocket she touched the throttle lightly drew her hand back laid the unopened case on the seat what do you say girl nothing of course it was quiescent slumbering a dreaming demon she hadnt turned it on with both thumbs at once harrie flicked up the latches and opened the case it was cool inside cool enough that she could feel the difference on her face when she bent over it she kept the lid at halfmast trying to block that cool air with her body so it wouldnt drift away she tipped her head to see inside blue foam threaded through with cooling elements shaped to hold the contents without rattling papers in a plastic folder and something in sealed culture plates clear jelly daubed with ragged polka dots there was a sticky note tacked on the plastic folder she reached into the cool case and flicked the sticky note out bringing it into the light patchs handwriting she blinked sacramento next if these dont get there it said thick black definite lines like faustus we all get one good chance to change our minds if you meet the buddha on the road i always thought there was more to that son of a bitch than met the eye she said and closed the case and stuffed the note into her pocket beside the pen she jammed her helmet back on doublechecking the filter that had maybe started leaking a little around the edges in tonopah slung her leg over the kawasakis saddle and closed the choke it gasped dry when she clutched and thumbed the start button shaking between her legs like an asthmatic pony she gave it a little throttle then eased up on it like easing up on a virgin lover coaxing pleading under her breath gasoline fumes from her mouth made her eyes tear inside the helmet the tears or something else washed the grit away one cylinder hiccuped a second one caught she eased the choke as the kawasaki coughed and purred shivering ready to run both dosimeters kicked hard as she rolled across the flat open plain toward fallon a deadly oasis in its own right apparently nick hadnt been satisfied with a leukemia cluster and perchlorate and arsenic tainting the ground water the trees harrie saw as she rolled up on the startling green of the farming town werent desert cottonwoods but towering giants of the european forest and something grey and massive shimmering with lovely crawling blue cherenkov radiation gleamed behind them the signs she passed were in an alphabet she didnt understand but she knew the name of this place a light rain was falling as she passed through chernobyl it drove down harder as she turned west on the toward reno and sparks and a crack under the edge of the clouds that glowed a toxic sallow color with evening coming on her tires skittered on slick greasy asphalt where the cities should have been stinking piles of garbage crouched against the yellowing evening sky and nearly naked starvationslender people picked their way over slumped rubbish calling the names of loved ones buried under the avalanche water sluiced down her helmet soaked her saddle plastered her leathers to her body she wished she dared drink the rain it didnt make her cool it only made her wet she didnt turn her head to watch the wretched victims of the garbage slide she was one hour out of sacramento and in manila of fifty years ago donner pass was green and pleasant sunset staining the sky ahead as red as meat she was in plenty of time it was all downhill from here nick wasnt about to let her get away without a fight the big one had rerouted the sacramento river too and harrie turned back at the edge because the bridge was down and the water was on fire she motored away a hundred meters two hundred until the heat of the burning river faded against her back whats that she asked the slim man in the pinstriped suit who waited for her by the roadside cuyahoga river fire he said count your blessings it could have been bhopal blessings she spared him a sardonic smile invisible behind her helmet he tilted the brim of his hat with a greygloved finger i suppose you could say that what is it really phlegethon she raised her visor and peeked over her shoulder watching the river burn even here it was hot enough that her sodden leathers steamed against her back the back of her hand pressed her breast pocket the paper from patchs note crinkled her cross poked her in the tit she looked at nick and nick looked at her so thats it thats all she wrote its too far to jump i can see that give me the case and ill let you go home ill give you the kawasaki and ill give you your freedom well call it even she eyed him tension up her right leg toe resting on the ground the great purring bike shifted heavily between her legs lithe as a cat ready to turn and spit gravel from whirring tires too far to jump thats what i said too far to jump maybe and maybe if she gave him what was in the case and doomed sacramento like bhopal like chernobyl like las vegas maybe shed be damning herself even if he gave it back to her and even if she wasnt she wasnt sure she and the kawasaki could live with that answer if he wanted to keep her he had to let her make the jump and she could save sacramento if he was willing to lose her she might die on the way over and sacramento might die with her but they would die free either way nick lost and that was good enough for her devil take the hindmost she said under her breath and touched the throttle one more time speech sounds by octavia e butler octavia e butler was the author of a dozen novels and several short stories a giant of the field who died long before her time she was the first science fiction writer to be receive the macarthur foundations prestigious genius grant and also received a lifetime achievement award for her writing from the pen american center in the speculative fiction field she was also wellappreciated having won two hugos two nebulas and a locus awardwith her novelette bloodchild winning all three she died in february butlers work frequently explored the subject of life after apocalypse though none of her novellength works would be classified primarily as postapocalyptic her three multibook seriesthe xenogenesis trilogy the patternist series and the parable duologyall take place in postapocalyptic settings making her an important author to the read in the subgenre even if her books are not really a part of it this story which won the hugo award in was conceived by butler after witnessing a bloody senseless fight while riding the bus in her story collection bloodchild and other stories butler said that witnessing the fight made her wonder whether the human species would ever grow up enough to learn to communicate without using fists of one kind or another and then the first line of the story came to her there was trouble aboard the washington boulevard bus rye had expected trouble sooner or later in her journey she had put off going until loneliness and hopelessness drove her out she believed she might have one group of relatives left alive a brother and his two children twenty miles away in pasadena that was a days journey oneway if she were lucky the unexpected arrival of the bus as she left her virginia road home had seemed to be a piece of luck until the trouble began two young men were involved in a disagreement of some kind or more likely a misunderstanding they stood in the aisle grunting and gesturing at each other each in his own uncertain t stance as the bus lurched over the potholes the driver seemed to be putting some effort into keeping them off balance still their gestures stopped just short of contact mock punches hand games of intimidation to replace lost curses people watched the pair then looked at one another and made small anxious sounds two children whimpered rye sat a few feet behind the disputants and across from the back door she watched the two carefully knowing the fight would begin when someones nerve broke or someones hand slipped or someone came to the end of his limited ability to communicate these things could happen anytime one of them happened as the bus hit an especially large pothole and one man tall thin and sneering was thrown into his shorter opponent instantly the shorter man drove his left fist into the disintegrating sneer he hammered his larger opponent as though he neither had nor needed any weapon other than his left fist he hit quickly enough hard enough to batter his opponent down before the taller man could regain his balance or hit back even once people screamed or squawked in fear those nearby scrambled to get out of the way three more young men roared in excitement and gestured wildly then somehow a second dispute broke out between two of these three probably because one inadvertently touched or hit the other as the second fight scattered frightened passengers a woman shook the drivers shoulder and grunted as she gestured toward the fighting the driver grunted back through bared teeth frightened the woman drew away rye knowing the methods of bus drivers braced herself and held on to the crossbar of the seat in front of her when the driver hit the brakes she was ready and the combatants were not they fell over seats and onto screaming passengers creating even more confusion at least one more fight started the instant the bus came to a full stop rye was on her feet pushing the back door at the second push it opened and she jumped out holding her pack in one arm several other passengers followed but some stayed on the bus buses were so rare and irregular now people rode when they could no matter what there might not be another bus todayor tomorrow people started walking and if they saw a bus they flagged it down people making intercity trips like ryes from los angeles to pasadena made plans to camp out or risked seeking shelter with locals who might rob or murder them the bus did not move but rye moved away from it she intended to wait until the trouble was over and get on again but if there was shooting she wanted the protection of a tree thus she was near the curb when a battered blue ford on the other side of the street made a uturn and pulled up in front of the bus cars were rare these daysas rare as a severe shortage of fuel and of relatively unimpaired mechanics could make them cars that still ran were as likely to be used as weapons as they were to serve as transportation thus when the driver of the ford beckoned to rye she moved away warily the driver got outa big man young neatly bearded with dark thick hair he wore a long overcoat and a look of wariness that matched ryes she stood several feet from him waiting to see what he would do he looked at the bus now rocking with the combat inside then at the small cluster of passengers who had gotten off finally he looked at rye again she returned his gaze very much aware of the old fortyfive automatic her jacket concealed she watched his hands he pointed with his left hand toward the bus the darktinted windows prevented him from seeing what was happening inside his use of the left hand interested rye more than his obvious question lefthanded people tended to be less impaired more reasonable and comprehending less driven by frustration confusion and anger she imitated his gesture pointing toward the bus with her own left hand then punching the air with both fists the man took off his coat revealing a los angeles police department uniform complete with baton and service revolver rye took another step back from him there was no more lapd no more any large organization governmental or private there were neighbourhood patrols and armed individuals that was all the man took something from his coat pocket then threw the coat into the car then he gestured rye back back toward the rear of the bus he had something made of plastic in his hand rye did not understand what he wanted until he went to the rear door of the bus and beckoned her to stand there she obeyed mainly out of curiosity cop or not maybe he could do something to stop the stupid fighting he walked around the front of the bus to the street side where the drivers window was open there she thought she saw him throw something into the bus she was still trying to peer through the tinted glass when people began stumbling out the rear door choking and weeping gas rye caught an old woman who would have fallen lifted two little children down when they were in danger of being knocked down and trampled she could see the bearded man helping people at the front door she caught a thin old man shoved out by one of the combatants staggered by the old mans weight she was barely able to get out of the way as the last of the young men pushed his way out this one bleeding from nose and mouth stumbled into another and they grappled blindly still sobbing from the gas the bearded man helped the bus driver out through the front door though the driver did not seem to appreciate his help for a moment rye thought there would be another fight the bearded man stepped back and watched the driver gesture threateningly watched him shout in wordless anger the bearded man stood still made no sound refused to respond to clearly obscene gestures the least impaired people tended to do thisstand back unless they were physically threatened and let those with less control scream and jump around it was as though they felt it beneath them to be as touchy as the less comprehending this was an attitude of superiority and that was the way people like the bus driver perceived it such superiority was frequently punished by beatings even by death rye had had close calls of her own as a result she never went unarmed and in this world where the only likely common language was body language being armed was often enough she had rarely had to draw her gun or even display it the bearded mans revolver was on constant display apparently that was enough for the bus driver the driver spat in disgust glared at the bearded man for a moment longer then strode back to his gasfilled bus he stared at it for a moment clearly wanting to get in but the gas was still too strong of the windows only his tiny drivers window actually opened the front door was open but the rear door would not stay open unless someone held it of course the air conditioning had failed long ago the bus would take some time to clear it was the drivers property his livelihood he had pasted old magazine pictures of items he would accept as fare on its sides then he would use what he collected to feed his family or to trade if his bus did not run he did not eat on the other hand if the inside of his bus was torn apart by senseless fighting he would not eat very well either he was apparently unable to perceive this all he could see was that it would be some time before he could use his bus again he shook his fist at the bearded man and shouted there seemed to be words in his shout but rye could not understand them she did not know whether this was his fault or hers she had heard so little coherent human speech for the past three years she was no longer certain how well she recognized it no longer certain of the degree of her own impairment the bearded man sighed he glanced toward his car then beckoned to rye he was ready to leave but he wanted something from her first no no he wanted her to leave with him risk getting into his car when in spite of his uniform law and order were nothingnot even words any longer she shook her head in a universally understood negative but the man continued to beckon she waved him away he was doing what the less impaired rarely did drawing potentially negative attention to another of his kind people from the bus had begun to look at her one of the men who had been fighting tapped another on the arm then pointed from the bearded man to rye and finally held up the first two fingers of his right hand as though giving twothirds of a boy scout salute the gesture was very quick its meaning obvious even at a distance she had been grouped with the bearded man now what the man who had made the gesture started toward her she had no idea what he intended but she stood her ground the man was half a foot taller than she was and perhaps ten years younger she did not imagine she could outrun him nor did she expect anyone to help her if she needed help the people around her were all strangers she gestured oncea clear indication to the man to stop she did not intend to repeat the gesture fortunately the man obeyed he gestured obscenely and several other men laughed loss of verbal language had spawned a whole new set of obscene gestures the man with stark simplicity had accused her of sex with the bearded man and had suggested she accommodate the other men presentbeginning with him rye watched him wearily people might very well stand by and watch if he tried to rape her they would also stand and watch her shoot him would he push things that far he did not after a series of obscene gestures that brought him no closer to her he turned contemptuously and walked away and the bearded man still waited he had removed his service revolver holster and all he beckoned again both hands empty no doubt his gun was in the car and within easy reach but his taking it off impressed her maybe he was all right maybe he was just alone she had been alone herself for three years the illness had stripped her killing her children one by one killing her husband her sister her parents the illness if it was an illness had cut even the living off from one another as it swept over the country people hardly had time to lay blame on the soviets though they were falling silent along with the rest of the world on a new virus a new pollutant radiation divine retribution the illness was strokeswift in the way it cut people down and stroke like in some of its effects but it was highly specific language was always lost or severely impaired it was never regained often there was also paralysis intellectual impairment death rye walked toward the bearded man ignoring the whistling and applauding of two of the young men and their thumbsup signs to the bearded man if he had smiled at them or acknowledged them in any way she would almost certainly have changed her mind if she had let herself think of the possible deadly consequences of getting into a strangers car she would have changed her mind instead she thought of the man who lived across the street from her he rarely washed since his bout with the illness and he had gotten into the habit of urinating wherever he happened to be he had two women alreadyone tending each of his large gardens they put up with him in exchange for his protection he had made it clear that he wanted rye to become his third woman she got into the car and the bearded man shut the door she watched as he walked around to the drivers doorwatched for his sake because his gun was on the seat beside her and the bus driver and a pair of young men had come a few steps closer they did nothing though until the bearded man was in the car then one of them threw a rock others followed his example and as the car drove away several rocks bounced off harmlessly when the bus was some distance behind them rye wiped sweat from her forehead and longed to relax the bus would have taken her more than halfway to pasadena she would have had only ten miles to walk she wondered how far she would have to walk nowand wondered if walking a long distance would be her only problem at figuroa and washington where the bus normally made a left turn the bearded man stopped looked at her and indicated that she should choose a direction when she directed him left and he actually turned left she began to relax if he was willing to go where she directed perhaps he was safe as they passed blocks of burned abandoned buildings empty lots and wrecked or stripped cars he slipped a gold chain over his head and handed it to her the pendant attached to it was a smooth glassy black rock obsidian his name might be rock or peter or black but she decided to think of him as obsidian even her sometimes useless memory would retain a name like obsidian she handed him her own name symbola pin in the shape of a large golden stalk of wheat she had bought it long before the illness and the silence began now she wore it thinking it was as close as she was likely to come to rye people like obsidian who had not known her before probably thought of her as wheat not that it mattered she would never hear her name spoken again obsidian handed her pin back to her he caught her hand as she reached for it and rubbed his thumb over her calluses he stopped at first street and asked which way again then after turning right as she had indicated he parked near the music centre there he took a folded paper from the dashboard and unfolded it rye recognized it as a street map though the writing on it meant nothing to her he flattened the map took her hand again and put her index finger on one spot he touched her touched himself pointed toward the floor in effect we are here she knew he wanted to know where she was going she wanted to tell him but she shook her head sadly she had lost reading and writing that was her most serious impairment and her most painful she had taught history at ucla she had done freelance writing now she could not even read her own manuscripts she had a houseful of books that she could neither read nor bring herself to use as fuel and she had a memory that would not bring back to her much of what she had read before she stared at the map trying to calculate she had been born in pasadena had lived for fifteen years in los angeles now she was near la civic centre she knew the relative positions of the two cities knew streets directions even knew to stay away from freeways which might be blocked by wrecked cars and destroyed overpasses she ought to know how to point out pasadena even though she could not recognize the word hesitantly she placed her hand over a pale orange patch in the upper right corner of the map that should be right pasadena obsidian lifted her hand and looked under it then folded the map and put it back on the dashboard he could read she realized belatedly he could probably write too abruptly she hated himdeep bitter hatred what did literacy mean to hima grown man who played cops and robbers but he was literate and she was not she never would be she felt sick to her stomach with hatred frustration and jealousy and only a few inches from her hand was a loaded gun she held herself still staring at him almost seeing his blood but her rage crested and ebbed and she did nothing obsidian reached for her hand with hesitant familiarity she looked at him her face had already revealed too much no person still living in what was left of human society could fail to recognize that expression that jealousy she closed her eyes wearily drew a deep breath she had experienced longing for the past hatred of the present growing hopelessness purposelessness but she had never experienced such a powerful urge to kill another person she had left her home finally because she had come near to killing herself she had found no reason to stay alive perhaps that was why she had gotten into obsidians car she had never before done such a thing he touched her mouth and made chatter motions with thumb and fingers could she speak she nodded and watched his milder envy come and go now both had admitted what it was not safe to admit and there had been no violence he tapped his mouth and forehead and shook his head he did not speak or comprehend spoken language the illness had played with them taking away she suspected what each valued most she plucked at his sleeve wondering why he had decided on his own to keep the lapd alive with what he had left he was sane enough otherwise why wasnt he at home raising corn rabbits and children but she did not know how to ask then he put his hand on her thigh and she had another question to deal with she shook her head disease pregnancy helpless solitary agony no he massaged her thigh gently and smiled in obvious disbelief no one had touched her for three years she had not wanted anyone to touch her what kind of world was this to chance bringing a child into even if the father were willing to stay and help raise it it was too bad though obsidian could not know how attractive he was to heryoung probably younger than she was clean asking for what he wanted rather than demanding it but none of that mattered what were a few moments of pleasure measured against a lifetime of consequences he pulled her closer to him and for a moment she let herself enjoy the closeness he smelled goodmale and good she pulled away reluctantly he sighed reached toward the glove compartment she stiffened not knowing what to expect but all he took out was a small box the writing on it meant nothing to her she did not understand until he broke the seal opened the box and took out a condom he looked at her and she first looked away in surprise then she giggled she could not remember when she had last giggled he grinned gestured toward the backseat and she laughed aloud even in her teens she had disliked backseats of cars but she looked around at the empty streets and ruined buildings then she got out and into the backseat he let her put the condom on him then seemed surprised at her eagerness sometime later they sat together covered by his coat unwilling to become clothed nearstrangers again just yet he made rockthebaby gestures and looked questioningly at her she swallowed shook her head she did not know how to tell him her children were dead he took her hand and drew a cross in it with his index finger then made his babyrocking gesture again she nodded held up three fingers then turned away trying to shut out a sudden flood of memories she had told herself that the children growing up now were to be pitied they would run through the downtown canyons with no real memory of what the buildings had been or even how they had come to be today s children gathered books as well as wood to be burned as fuel they ran through the streets chasing one another and hooting like chimpanzees they had no future they were now all they would ever be he put his hand on her shoulder and she turned suddenly fumbling for his small box then urging him to make love to her again he could give her forgetfulness and pleasure until now nothing had been able to do that until now every day had brought her closer to the time when she would do what she had left home to avoid doing putting her gun in her mouth and pulling the trigger she asked obsidian if he would come home with her stay with her he looked surprised and pleased once he understood but he did not answer at once finally he shook his head as she had feared he might he was probably having too much fun playing cops and robbers and picking up women she dressed in silent disappointment unable to feel any anger toward him perhaps he already had a wife and a home that was likely the illness had been harder on men than on womenhad killed more men had left male survivors more severely impaired men like obsidian were rare women either settled for less or stayed alone if they found an obsidian they did what they could to keep him rye suspected he had someone younger prettier keeping him he touched her while she was strapping her gun on and asked with a complicated series of gestures whether it was loaded she nodded grimly he patted her arm she asked once more if he would come home with her this time using a different series of gestures he had seemed hesitant perhaps he could be courted he got out and into the front seat without responding she took her place in front again watching him now he plucked at his uniform and looked at her she thought she was being asked something but did not know what it was he took off his badge tapped it with one finger then tapped his chest of course she took the badge from his hand and pinned her wheat stalk to it if playing cops and robbers was his only insanity let him play she would take him uniform and all it occurred to her that she might eventually lose him to someone he would meet as he had met her but she would have him for a while he took the street map down again tapped it pointed vaguely northeast toward pasadena then looked at her she shrugged tapped his shoulder then her own and held up her index and second fingers tight together just to be sure he grasped the two fingers and nodded he was with her she took the map from him and threw it onto the dashboard she pointed back southwestback toward home now she did not have to go to pasadena now she could go on having a brother there and two nephewsthree righthanded males now she did not have to find out for certain whether she was as alone as she feared now she was not alone obsidian took hill street south then washington west and she leaned back wondering what it would be like to have someone again with what she had scavenged what she had preserved and what she grew there was easily enough food for them there was certainly room enough in a fourbedroom house he could move his possessions in best of all the animal across the street would pull back and possibly not force her to kill him obsidian had drawn her closer to him and she had put her head on his shoulder when suddenly he braked hard almost throwing her off the seat out of the corner of her eye she saw that someone had run across the street in front of the car one car on the street and someone had to run in front of it straightening up rye saw that the runner was a woman fleeing from an old frame house to a boardedup storefront she ran silently but the man who followed her a moment later shouted what sounded like garbled words as he ran he had something in his hand not a gun a knife perhaps the woman tried a door found it locked looked around desperately finally snatched up a fragment of glass broken from the storefront window with this she turned to face her pursuer rye thought she would be more likely to cut her own hand than to hurt anyone else with the glass obsidian jumped from the car shouting it was the first time rye had heard his voicedeep and hoarse from disuse he made the same sound over and over the way some speechless people did da da da rye got out of the car as obsidian ran toward the couple he had drawn his gun fearful she drew her own and released the safety she looked around to see who else might be attracted to the scene she saw the man glance at obsidian then suddenly lunge at the woman the woman jabbed his face with her glass but he caught her arm and managed to stab her twice before obsidian shot him the man doubled then toppled clutching his abdomen obsidian shouted then gestured rye over to help the woman rye moved to the womans side remembering that she had little more than bandages and antiseptic in her pack but the woman was beyond help she had been stabbed with a long slender boning knife she touched obsidian to let him know the woman was dead he had bent to check the wounded man who lay still and also seemed dead but as obsidian looked around to see what rye wanted the man opened his eyes face contorted he seized obsidians justholstered revolver and fired the bullet caught obsidian in the temple and he collapsed it happened just that simply just that fast an instant later rye shot the wounded man as he was turning the gun on her and rye was alonewith three corpses she knelt beside obsidian dryeyed frowning trying to understand why everything had suddenly changed obsidian was gone he had died and left herlike everyone else two very small children came out of the house from which the man and woman had runa hoy and girl perhaps three years old holding hands they crossed the street toward kye they stared at her then edged past her and went to the dead woman the girl shook the womans arm as though trying to wake her this was too much rye got up feeling sick to her stomach with grief and anger if the children began to cry she thought she would vomit they were on their own those two kids they were old enough to scavenge she did not need any more grief she did not need a strangers children who would grow up to be hairless chimps she went back to the car she could drive home at least she remembered how to drive the thought that obsidian should be buried occurred to her before she reached the car and she did vomit she had found and lost the man so quickly it was as though she had been snatched from comfort and security and given a sudden inexplicable beating her head would not clear she could not think somehow she made herself go back to him look at him she found herself on her knees beside him with no memory of having knelt she stroked his face his beard one of the children made a noise and she looked at them at the woman who was probably their mother the children looked back at her obviously frightened perhaps it was their fear that reached her finally she had been about to drive away and leave them she had almost done it almost left two toddlers to die surely there had been enough dying she would have to take the children home with her she would not be able to live with any other decision she looked around for a place to bury three bodies or two she wondered if the murderer were the childrens father before the silence the police had always said some of the most dangerous calls they went out on were domestic disturbance calls obsidian should have known thatnot that the knowledge would have kept him in the car it would not have held her back either she could not have watched the woman murdered and done nothing she dragged obsidian toward the car she had nothing to dig with her and no one to guard for her while she dug better to take the bodies with her and bury them next to her husband and her children obsidian would come home with her after all when she had gotten him onto the floor in the back she returned for the woman the little girl thin dirty solemn stood up and unknowingly gave rye a gift as rye began to drag the woman by her arms the little girl screamed no rye dropped the woman and stared at the girl no the girl repeated she came to stand beside the woman go away she told rye dont talk the little boy said to her there was no blurring or confusing of sounds both children had spoken and rye had understood the boy looked at the dead murderer and moved further from him he took the girls hand be quiet he whispered fluent speech had the woman died because she could talk and had taught her children to talk had she been killed by a husbands festering anger or by a strangers jealous rage and the children they must have been born after the silence had the disease run its course then or were these children simply immune certainly they had had time to fall sick and silent ryes mind leaped ahead what if children of three or fewer years were safe and able to learn language what if all they needed were teachers teachers and protectors rye glanced at the dead murderer to her shame she thought she could understand some of the passions that must have driven him whomever he was anger frustration hopelessness insane jealousy how many more of him were therepeople willing to destroy what they could not have obsidian had been the protector had chosen that role for who knew what reason perhaps putting on an obsolete uniform and patrolling the empty streets had been what he did instead of putting a gun into his mouth and now that there was something worth protecting he was gone she had been a teacher a good one she had been a protector too though only of herself she had kept herself alive when she had no reason to live if the illness let these children alone she could keep them alive somehow she lifted the dead woman into her arms and placed her on the backseat of the car the children began to cry but she knelt on the broken pavement and whispered to them fearful of frightening them with the harshness of her long unused voice its all right she told them youre going with us too come on she lifted them both one in each arm they were so light had they been getting enough to eat the boy covered her mouth with his hand but she moved her face away its all right for me to talk she told him as long as no ones around its all right she put the boy down on the front seat of the car and he moved over without being told to to make room for the girl when they were both in the car rye leaned against the window looking at them seeing that they were less afraid now that they watched her with at least as much curiosity as fear im valerie rye she said savouring the words its all right for you to talk to me killers by carol emshwiller carol emshwiller is the author of six novels and more than short stories

help but wonder if our civilization will fall apart one of these days but being the kind of person who loves the simple lifeoil lamps walking pumping up water for a shower washing diapers at the shore of a lake on an old fashioned washboardshes hesitant to say shes afraid itll happen shes not looking forward to it either but she says its just as much fun writing about regression and devastation as it is writing about a future full of new gadgets and inventions killers grew out of emshwillers objections to the war in iraq the american people have been told that were fighting terrorists over there so we dont have to fight them here this story ponders what it would be like afterward if such a war did come to our shores most people left because of no water i dont know where they found a place where things were any better some of us felt safer here than anywhere else and even way before the war wound down it was hard to pick up and go someplace no gas for civilians pretty soon no gas at all after the bombing of our pipeline one man with a grenade could have done that we got together and moved the town up higher along a stream and put in ditches so that the water came past several houses we have to carry water into the house in buckets and we have to empty the sink by hand back out into the yard at least the water flows into our kitchen gardens and past our fruit trees in warm weather we bathe in our irrigation ditch in colder we sponge off inside in basins but theres hardly any cold weather anymore there wasnt much to moving the town since most of us were gone already all the ablebodied men of course so it took us women to make the move ourselves and without horses or mules the enemy stole them or killed them or maimed them just to make things harder for us no electricity though some of the women think they can hook the dam back up and get some nobody has bothered to try it yet in a way none of this bothers me as much as youd think i always liked walking and we have rendered fat lamps and candles that send out a soft cozy glow our house was already well above where the town used to be good because i didnt want to move i want my brother to have our old home to come back to and besides i couldnt move mother beyond our back yard there used to be the department of water and power after that forest service land and then the john muir wilderness now the town has moved above me and of course theres no dwp or forest service anymore our house has a good view we always sat on the front steps and looked at the mountains now that everybody has moved up the mountain side everybody has a good view the town below is empty the vons and kmart are big looted barns up here theres one small store where we sell each other our produce or our sewing and knitting especially socks hard to get socks these days before the war we were so wasteful nobody darned anymore but now we not only darn but reinforce the heels and toes of brand new socks before we wear them we moved the little library up actually its got more books than before we brought all the books we could find ours and those from the people who left we dont need a librarian everybody brings them back honor system we have a little hospital but no doctors just a couple of elderly nurses who were too old to be recruited theyre in their seventies and still going theyve trained new ones no medicines though only what we can get from local herbs we went to the paiute to find out more theres a couple of paiute nurses who come to help out every now and then though they have their own nursing to do on the reservation they moved the rez up too and they dont call it the reservation anymore its a womans town now full of womens arts and crafts quilt makers sweater knitters and the women do the heavy work theres a good roof repair group and theres carpenters lots of women went to war along with the men but i had to look after mother i was taking care of her even before my brother left she wasnt exactly sick but she was fat and she drank her legs looked terrible full of varicosities it hurt her to walk so she didnt when the war came she got a little better because of the shortages though there was still plenty of homemade beer but she couldnt walk or wouldnt i think her muscles had all withered away looking after somebody who cant walk seems normal to me ive done it since i can first remember anything now that mothers gone i have a chance to do something useful if i knew the war was still going on in some specific place id go fight but it seems to be over maybe it didnt stop exactly i dont know how it ended or even if its ended we dont have a way to find out but there hasnt been any action that we know of for quite some time overhead nothing flies by not even anything old fashioned not that we ever had any action to speak of way out here except for the bombing of our pipeline and stealing our livestock nobody cared much about us but thats the way the war was hardly a beginning and hardly an end wars arent like they used to bewith two clearly separated sides the enemy was among us even before it started they could never win a real oldfashioned war with us they were weak and low tech but low tech was good enough as long as there were lots of them you never knew who to trust and we still dont our side put all we could in internment camps practically everybody with black eyes and hair and olive skin but you cant get them all and then the war went on so long we used up all our resources but they still had theirssabotage doesnt ever have to stop they escaped from the camps actually they just walked away the guards had already walked away too lots of those men brought their injuries and craziness to our mountains both sides came here to get away from everything theyre hermits they dont trust anybody some of them are still fighting each other up there its almost as bad as having leftover mine fields theyre all damaged physically or mentally of course most likely all of us are too and we probably dont even know it my brother might be out there somewhere if hes alive hes got to be here he loves this place he hunted and trapped and fished hed get along fine and i know hed do anything to come back most of those men dont come down to us even if theyre starving or cold or sick those that do come to steal they take our tomatoes and corn and radishes other things disappear too kitchen knives spoons fishhooks and of course sweaters and woolen socks those crazies live up even higher than we do it does still get cold up there and they are crazies and now one of them has been killing other men and dumping them at the edge of the village theyve all been shot in the back by wooden crossbow darts beautifully carved and polished i hope it isnt one of our side though i dont suppose sides matter anymore every time this happens before we put them into the depository i go to check if its my brother i wouldnt want my brother in the depository ever but those men are always such a messdirty and beardedi wonder would i recognize him i keep thinking how could i not but i was only fifteen when he left he was eighteen hed be thirtytwo now if hes alive were all a little edgy even if its not us getting killed and then last night i saw someone looking in my window id been asleep but i heard a noise and woke up i saw the silhouette of a lumpy hat and a mass of tangled hair flying out from under it the moonlit sky glowing behind i called out clement i didnt mean to i was half asleep and in that state i knew it was my brother whoever it was ducked down in a hurry and i heard the crunch crunch of somebody running away afterwards i got scared i could have been shot as i slept the next morning i saw footprints and it looked like somebody had spent some time behind my shed i keep hoping its my brother though i wouldnt want him to be the one killing those poor men but youd think he wouldnt be afraid of coming to his own house of course he doesnt know that mother is dead i can understand him being afraid of her they never got along when she was drunk she used to throw things at him if he got close enough shed grab his arm and twist then he got too strong for her but he couldnt be afraid of me could he im the baby sister mother was nicer to me she got worried id stay out of reach or not help anymore i could have just walked off and left her but until she died i didnt think of it i actually didnt id looked after her for so long i thought thats just the way life is and i might not have left anyway she was my mother and there was nobody else to look after her but me if its my brother been looking in the window he must know mother isnt here she never left her bed the house is small and all on one floor so he could have looked in all the windows we have three tiny bedrooms and one kitchenliving room combined mother and her big bed took up wall to wall space in the biggest bedroom i posted clements picture at the store and the library but of course it was a picture from long ago in it he has the usual army shaved head i drew a version with wild hair then i drew another of him bald with wild hair around the sides baldness runs in our family i drew a different kind of beard on each of them i put up both versions leo at the store said he might not want to talk to youor anybody but i know that already i think hes come looking in my window well there you are hed a come in if hed wanted to you went to war how come youre okay and most all the other men have gone wild i was lucky i never saw real horror actually he may not be so okay most of us never married we never had the chance with all the men gone he could have married one of us but he never did he lives in a messy shed behind the store and he smells even though the ditch passes right by his store and hes always grumpy you have to get used to him if my brother comes around tell him im going out to look for him in all his favourite spots even if you find him he wont come back so then ill go after that crazy person whos been killing those men truth is i dont know what to do with myself i dont know how to live with just me to care about i can go anywhere and do anything i ought to find the man whos the killer i have nothing else to do who better to do it than i but i might find that man right here hiding at the edge of the villageor most likely looking in my window maybe i can trap him in my house he must have been looking in for a reason i pack up and pretend to leave i stay out of sight of the village this is wild rock landlots of hiding places nobody will know i didnt go anywhere my backpack is mostly empty i have pepper pepper is hard to get these days so ive saved mine for a weapon i have a small knife in my boot and a bigger one at my belt streams arent stocked anymore but theres still fish around though not as many as before i bring a line and hooks ill use those today i wont go far i catch a trout i have to make a fire the oldfashioned way no more matches i always carry a handful of dead sage fibres for tinder i cook the fish and eat after dark and the halfmoon comes up i sneak back to our house as if i was one of those crazies myself the door is wide open theres sand all over the floor couldnt he even shut the door these days we have sand storms and dust devils more often than we use to doesnt whoever it is know that and thats another reason to move higher up into the trees where its less deserty i smell him before i see him i put my knife up my sleeve so itll drop down into my hand i can hear him breathing sounds like scared breathing a man this frightened will be dangerous hes huddled in mothers bedroom down between the bed and the bedside table all i see is his hat pulled low so his face is in shadow i see his bare knees showing through his torn pants i have a better look at them than his face right away i think my brother wouldnt be in mothers room hed be in his own room besides the room still smells of death and dying i call clement even though i know it cant be him come on out he groans are you sick he sounds sick i suppose thats why hes here in the first place i wish id lit a lamp first i was counting on the moonlight but there isnt much shining in here it still could be my brother under all that dirt and wild hair and beard gone crazy just like everybody else come out come to the main room ill light a lamp ill fix you food no light why not theres only me and theres no war going on anymore its most likely over i pledged to fight until i died i suppose my brother did too i finger my knife im going to go light the lamp i deliberately turn my back i go to the main room light the lamp with the sparker keeping my back to the bedroom door i hear him come in i turn and get a good look piecedtogether hat long scraggly hair hanging under it i cant tell if hes a brown man or just weatherbeaten sunburned and dirty a full beard with grit in it eyes as black as the enemys always are eyebrows just as thick as theirs he has a broken front tooth nowadays thats not unusual nobody to fix them he has a greenish look under his tan and dark circles around his eyes if he thinks he isnt sick he doesnt know much you are the enemy and youre halfdead already theres a chair right beside him but he sinks sideways to the floor ends up flat on our worn linoleum if he thinks hes still fighting the war i should kill him now while i have the chance he looks such a mess and smells so bad im almost ready to kill him just for those reasons alone after mother died i thought i was finished with disagreeable messes hide me just for tonight ill leave in the morning are you crazy i kneel beside him youre the one killing people i should kill you right now hes trying to prop himself up against the wall i dont want to touch him but i grab his shirt front to help him and the rotten cloth rips completely out you stink something awful and why would i think you wont kill me youve been killing everybody else i dont have a weapon strip what take those filthy clothes off ill burn them ill bring you a basin to wash in and ill find out if he has a weapon he hasnt the energy to undress or wash i hate to touch him but i do it im used to it mother was a mess as she was dying at the end i sprinkled pine needles all over but it didnt help much i thought that was the last of that sort of thing id ever have to do i thought i was free but all right one more thing i wash him and dress him in my brothers old clothes and what then if i kill him the town will be grateful at least his body is entirely different from mothers thin and strong and hairy its a nice change if he wasnt so smelly id enjoy it well i do enjoy it hes half asleep through it all i burn his clothes in our little stove after ive washed him i feed him jerky broth with an egg in it though i keep thinking why waste my egg on him he falls asleep right after hes finished the broth slides down the wall flat out again in what seems more a faint than a sleep i decide to shave him and cut his hair he wont notice if hed been more conscious id have asked him if he wanted a moustache or a little goatee but im glad he isnt i have fun with different haircuts different sideburns smaller and smaller moustaches until theres none hair too i take off more than i meant to except what does it matter hes a dead man not a very handsome man whatever way i fixed his hair and beard though along the way there were some nicer stagesbetter than what i ended up with i finish by shaving him also not a good job i make nicks where i shaved his beard his skin is pale his forehead where his hat was is pale too theres only a sunbrowned strip across his face just below his eyes i like the maleness of him no matter that hes ugly i dont mind his broken tooth were all in the same boat as to teeth i fall asleep at the kitchen table right in the middle of thinking up ways to kill him also thinking about how weve all changedhow in the olden days id not ever have been thinking things at all like that in the morning he seems some betterwell enough for me to help him stagger first to the outhouse and then into my brothers room he keeps feeling his face and hair i stop at the hall mirror and let him take a look hes shocked he has a kind of wet catplucked chicken look i say sorry i am sorry sorry for anybody who gets their hair cut by me but he should be glad i havent slit his throat he stares at himself but then says thank you and so sincerely that i realize ive made him the best disguise there is he said hide me and i did nobody will take him for one of those wild men now i prop him up on the pillows of my brothers bed and bring him milk and tea he looks so much better i wonder if hes not going to die on his own ill have to think what to do with him whats your name he doesnt answer he could say anything id have believed him and id have had something to call him by tell me a name i dont care what he thinks then says jal make it joe i dont trust him but if he has any sense at all he knows im the only one can keep him safe though nobody has much sense anymore everybody got tired of the war a long time ago i bang my cup down so hard that my tea spills havent you noticed i swore to fight to the death ill bet you dont even know which side is which anymore if you ever did youre the ones heated up the planet it wasnt us it was you and your greed i havent been so aggravated since my brother was around it heated up mostly by itself its done that before you know besides all thats over our part in it anyway killing crazies isnt going to help youre crazy not the best thing to say to a crazy but i go on anyway all you hermits are crazy youre nothing but trouble hes taking it all in maybe he is maybe he just doesnt have the energy to argue im going out to get us a rabbit if you want to keep on making trouble dont be here when i come back i leave hell be all alone with my butcher knife and pepper and i suppose his crossbow isnt far off i might as well give him a chance to show what he is i make the rounds of my traps theyre lower down ive set them around the town its a ghost town im the only one goes down there now and thenusually only on a cool day which hardly ever happens today it must be well over degrees now our whole valley in winter is as if death valley in summer what i trap down there are rats we cook those up and call them rabbit though nobody cares anymore what we call them i find two big black ones big as cats we like those better than the small brown kind lots more meat on them seems as if the rats are getting bigger all the time my traps broke their necks i dont have to worry about killing them i tie their tails to my belt then wander the town in hopes of finding something not already scavenged i find a quarter i take it though its worthless maybe a paiute might turn it into jewellery on purpose i dont climb back up to my house until late afternoon and until i drink all the water i brought before i go in i check around my shed and house for a crossbow and darts and then beyond under the bushes but i dont find them hes still there asleep and no weapons that i can see but i check the kitchen knives the largest one big as a machete is gone and he might be pretending to be sicker than he is enemy or not i do like a man in the house i watch him sleep he has such long eyelashes i like the hair on his knuckles just looking at his hands makes me think how theres so few men around actually only four his forearms ours dont ever look like that no matter how much we saw and hammer even my brothers never looked like that i like that he already needs a shave again i even like his bushy eyebrows but i have to go clean rats when i start rattling around the kitchen section of our main room he gets up and staggers to the table stops at the hall mirror again on the way and studies himself for a long time as if he forgot what he looked like under all that hair he sits then and watches me make tworat stew with wild onions and turnips i thicken it with acorn flour i traded for with the paiute it takes a while for the stew to finish up i make squaw tea and sit across from him being so close and looking into his eyes upsets me i have to get up and turn my back i pretend the stew needs stirring to hide my feelings i say wheres your crossbow and wheres my knife i wont let you have my stew until you tell me i sound more angry than i meant to under the bed in the big room both of them i go check and there they are and several darts i bring the bow back to the table its a beautiful piece of work old scraps of metal and an old screw salvaged from something now shiny and oiled the wood of the bow carved as if a work of art all kept up with care ill bring it to the town meeting to show ive found the killer and dealt with him but have i and they may want a body ill not shoot anybody not now yeah but youre still sworn i can fight someplace else oh yeah after we eat i put whats left over into an old bearproof can take it to the irrigation ditch and sink it in wet mud to keep it cool i dont know if i should go to bed without barricading my door some way i wish i still had our dog but mother and i ate him long ago hed be dead by now anyway it would be nice to have him though id feel a lot safer he was a good dog but getting old we thought wed better eat him ourselves before somebody else got to him that was before we were eating rats tired as i am it takes a while for me to get to sleep i keep telling myself if hes going to sneak into my room i might as well find out about it but i put the chair against the door in a way that itll fall at least ill hear if he comes in mainly i cant sleep because in spite of my better judgment im thinking of keeping the man trying to i like the idea of having him around even though its scary i make plans its logical that somebody coming in to our new higher village would come to my house first perhaps an outsider with news from the north and its logical that id take him to a town meeting to tell the news what news though in the morning the chair hasnt fallen we make some up carson city is as empty and ratinfested as our town its a good bet it really is i remember an airplane i think it was called the gossamer condor that flew by the propeller being pumped by a bicycle and doesnt need gas it cant go far or wed have seen it down here joe can say hes seen it he says how about an epidemic of a new disease passed on by fleas it hasnt reached here yet he says how about way up in reno they found a cache of ammunition so they can clean up their old guns and use them again i give him news about clement to tell people ill say thats another reason joe came to me firstto give me news of my brother i think i made up that news because i know my brothers dead otherwise id not have mentioned anything about him id keep on thinking hes out in our mountains as one of the crazies but i dont think i ever really believed that i just hoped once he takes my hand and squeezes itsays how grateful he is i have to get up again turn my back i wash our few dishes slowly im so flustered i hardly know what his hand felt like strong and warm i know that lots of good things happen in those town meetings we give each other our news we have all kinds of helping committees in some ways we take care of each other more than we did before the war people used to bring in their deer and wild sheep and share the meat around except theres less and less wild game and more and more mountain lions theyre eating all the game and were not good at killing lions ill bet joe would be with his crossbow so i bring him to the meeting introduce him they crowd around and ask questions about all their favourite spots or places where they used to have relatives hes good at making stuff up makes me wonder was he once an officer or did he act i admire him more and more and i can see all the women do too he could have any one of us im worried hell get away from me and im the only one knows who he really is whoever gets him in the end will have to be careful hes looking pretty good too horrible haircut and all my brothers blue farmer shirt sets off his brown skin its too large for him but thats the usual the women have been out at the bird nets and had made a big batch of littlebird soup i was glad theyd made that instead of the other theres a paiute woman who comes to our meetings and reports back to the reservation shes beautifulmore than beautiful strange and striking i should have known at his first view of her you can seeboth of them stare and then quickly stop looking at each other later he sits drinking tea with several women including the paiute they all crowd around but i saw him push in so that he was next to her the tables are small but now nine chairs are wedged in close around the one where he sits i cant see whats going on but i do see her shoulder is touching his and their faces are so close i dont see how they can see anything of each other i sneak away and run home i wish id saved his smelly fallingapart clothes i wish id saved the dirty tangled hair i cut off but i burned that too i do find the old hat that helps them to believe me i bring the crossbow it also helps that he tries to get away they hung joe up in the depository i told them not to tell me anything about it id rather not know when we get around to using him ginny sweethips flying circus by neal barrett jr neal barrett jr is the author of more than novels

minute you wait and see if it doesnt dont get greedy del said ginny curled her toes on the dash her legs felt warm in the sun the stockade was a hundred yards off barbed wire looped above the walls the sign over the gate read first church of the unleaded god ace high refinery welcome keep out the refinery needed paint it had likely been silver but was now dull as pewter and black rust ginny leaned out the window and called to possum dark whats happening friend those mothers dead in there or what thinking possum said fixing to make a move considering what to do possum dark sat atop the van in a steno chair bolted to the roof circling the chair was a swivelring mount sporting fine twinfifties black as grease possum had a deathview clean around keeping out the sun was a red cinzano umbrella faded pink possum studied the stockade and watched heat distort the flats he didnt care for the effect he was suspicious of things less than cut and dried apprehensive of illusions of every kind he scratched his nose and curled his tail around his leg the gate opened up and men started across the scrub he teased them in his sights he prayed theyd do something silly and grand possum counted thirtyseven men a few carried sidearms openly or concealed possum spotted them all at once he wasnt too concerned this seemed like an easygoing bunch more intent on fun than fracas still there was always the hope that he was wrong the men milled about they wore patched denim and faded shirts possum made them nervous del countered that his appearance set them at ease the men looked at del poked each other and grinned del was scrawny and bald except for tufts around the ears the dusty black coat was too big his neck thrust out of his shirt like a newborn buzzard looking for meat the men forgot possum and gathered around waiting to see what del would do waiting for del to get around to showing them what theyd come to see the van was painted turtlegreen gold barnum type named the owner and the selected vices for sale ginny sweethips flying circus sex tacos dangerous drugs del puttered about with this and that he unhitched the wagon from the van and folded out a handy little stage it didnt take three minutes to set up but he dragged it out to ten then ten on top of that the men started to whistle and clap their hands del looked alarmed they liked that he stumbled and they laughed hey mister you got a girl in there or not a man called out better be something here besides you another said gents del said raising his hands for quiet ginny sweethips herself will soon appear on this stage and youll be more than glad you waited your every wish will be fulfilled i promise you that im bringing beauty to the wastelands gents lust the way you like it passion unrestrained sexual crimes you never dreamed cut the talk mister a man with peachpit eyes shouted to del show us what you got others joined in stomped their feet and whistled del knew he had them anger was what he wanted frustration and denial hatred waiting for sweet release he waved them off but they wouldnt stop he placed one hand on the door of the vanand brought them to silence at once the double doors opened a worn red curtain was revealed stenciled with hearts and cherubs del extended his hand he seemed to search behind the curtain one eye closed in concentration he looked alarmed groping for something he couldnt find uncertain he remembered how to do this trick at all and then in a sudden burst of motion ginny did a double forward flip and appeared like glory on the stage the men broke into shouts of wild abandon ginny led them in a cheer she was dressed for the occasion short white skirt shiny bright white boots with tassels white sweater with a big red g sewn on the front ginny sweethips gents del announced with a flair giving you her own interpretation of barbara jean the cheerleader next door innocent as snow yet a little bit wicked and willing to learn if biff the quarterback will only teach her now what do you say to that they whistled and yelled and stomped ginny strutted and switched doing longlegged kicks that left them gasping with delight thirtyseven pairs of eyes showed their needs men guessed at hidden parts dusted off scenarios of violence and love then as quickly as shed come ginny was gone men threatened to storm the stage del grinned without concern the curtain parted and ginny was back blond hair replaced with saucy red costume changed in the blink of an eye del introduced nurse nora an angel of mercy weak as soup in the hands of patient pete moments later hair black as a ravens throat she was school teacher sally cold as well water until steve the bad student loosed the fury chained within ginny vanished again applause thundered over the flats del urged them on then spread his hands for quiet did i lie to you gents is she all you ever dreamed is this the love youve wanted all your life could you ask for sweeter limbs for softer flesh for whiter teeth for brighter eyes yeah but is she real a man shouted a man with a broken face sewn up like a sock were religious people here we dont fuck with no machines others echoed the question with bold shouts and shaking fists now i dont blame you sir at all del said ive had a few dolly droids myself a plastic embrace at best ill grant you that not for the likes of you for i can tell youre a man who knows his women no sir ginnys real as rain and shes yours in the role of your choice seven minutes of bliss itll seem like a lifetime gents i promise you that your goods gladly returned if im a liar and all for only a us gallon of gas howls and groans at that as del expected thats a cheat is what it is aint a woman worth it gas is bettern gold and we work damn hard to get it del stood his ground looked grim and disappointed id be the last man alive to try to part you from your goods del said its not my place to drive a fellow into the arms of sweet content to make him rest his manly frame on golden thighs not if he thinks this lovely girls not worth the fee no sir i dont do business that way and never have the men moved closer del could smell their discontent he read sly thoughts above their heads there was always this moment when it occurred to them there was a way ginnys delights might be obtained for free give it some thought friends del said a mans got to do what hes got to do and while youre making up your minds turn your eyes to the top of the van for a startling and absolutely free display of the slickest bit of marksmanship youre ever likely to see before dels words were out of his mouth and on the way before the men could scarcely comprehend ginny appeared again and tossed a dozen china saucers in the air possum dark moved in a blur turned degrees in his bolted steno chair and whipped his guns on target blasting saucers to dust thunder rolled across the flats crockery rained on the men below possum stood and offered a pink killer grin and a little bow the men saw sixfootnine and a quarter inches of happy marsupial fury and awesome speed of black agate eyes and a snout full of icy varmint teeth doubts were swept aside fiftycaliber madness wasnt the answer fun today was clearly not for free gentlemen start your engines del smiled ill be right here to take your fee enjoy a hot taco while you wait your turn at glory have a look at our display of fine pharmaceutical wonders and mindexpanding drugs in moments men were making their way back to the stockade soon after that they returned toting battered tins of gas del sniffed each gallon in case some buffoon thought water would get him by each man received a token and took his place del sold tacos and dangerous drugs taking what he could get in trade candles and mason jars a rusty knife half a manual on fullfield maintenance for the chrysler mark xx urban tank the drugs were different colors but the same twelve parts oregano three parts rabbit shit one part marijuana stems all this under possums watchful eye by god said the first man out of the van shes worth it ill tell you that have her do the nurse you wont regret it the schoolteachers best said the second man through i never seen

nose first thing we hit a town you hose er out good now del place smells like a sewer or maybe worse del squinted at the sky and pulled up under the scant shade of mesquite he stepped out and kicked the tires ginny got down walked around and stretched its getting late del said you want to go on or stop here you figure those boys might decide to get a rebate on this gas hope they do possum said from atop the van youre a pisser ginny laughed ill say that hell lets keep going i could use a hot bath and town food what you figures up the road east bad news del said if this maps worth anything at all ginny night drivings no good you dont know whats waiting down the road i know whats on the roof ginny said lets do it im itchy all over with bugs and dirt and that tub keeps shinin in my head you want me to drive a spell i sure will get in del grumbled your drivings scarier than anything ill meet morning arrived in purple shadow and metal tones copper silver and gold from a distance east bad news looked to ginny like garbage strewn carelessly over the flats closer it looked like larger garbage tin shacks and tents and haphazard buildings rehashed from whatever they were before cookfires burned and the locals wandered about and yawned and scratched three places offered food other places bed and a bath something to look forward to at least she spotted the sign down at the far end of town moros repairs armaments machinery electronic shit of all kinds hold it ginny said pull er in right there del looked alarmed what for dont get excited theres gear needs tending in back i just want em to take a look didnt mention it to me del said ginny saw the sad and droopy eyes the tired wisps of hair sticking flat to dels ears del there wasnt anything to mention she said in a kindly tone nothing you can really put your finger on i mean okay whatever you think del said clearly out of sorts ginny sighed and got out barbed wire surrounded the yard behind the shop the yard was ankledeep in tangles of rope and copper cable rusted unidentifiable parts a battered pickup hugged the wall morning heat curled the tin roof of the building more parts spilled out of the door possum made a funny noise and ginny saw the dog step into the light a shepherd maybe sixfoottwo it showed possum dark yellow eyes a man appeared behind the dog wiping heavy grease on his pants bare to the waist hair like stuffing out of a chair features hard as rock flint eyes to match not bad looking thought ginny if you cleaned him up good well now said the man he glanced at the van read the legend on the side took in ginny from head to toe what can i do for you little lady im not real little and dont guess im any lady ginny said whatever youre thinking dont you open for business or just talk the man grinned my names moro gain never turn business away if i can help it i need electric stuff we got it whats the problem huhunh ginny shook her head first i gotta ask you do confidential work or tell everything you know secrets my middle name moro said might cost a little more but you got it how much moro closed one eye now how do i know that you got a nuclear device in there or a broken watch drive it on in and well take a look he aimed a greasy finger at possum dark leave him outside no way no arms in the shop thats a rule he isnt carrying just the guns you see ginny smiled you can shake him down if you like i wouldnt i dont think he looks imposing all right id say he is what the hell moro said drive it in dog unlocked the gate possum climbed down and followed with oily eyes go find us a place to stay ginny said to del clean if you can find it all the hot water in town christ sakes del you still sulking or what dont worry about me del said dont concern yourself at all right she hopped behind the wheel moro began kicking the door of his shop it finally sprang free wide enough to take the van the supply wagon rocked along behind moro lifted the tarp eyed the thirtyseven tins of unleaded with great interest you get lousy mileage or what he asked ginny ginny didnt answer she stepped out of the van light came through broken panes of glass the skinny windows reminded her of a church her eyes got used to shadow and she saw that thats what it was pews sat to the side piled high with auto parts a olds was jacked up before the altar nice place you got here she said it works for me moro told her now what kind of trouble you got something in the wiring you said electric stuff i didnt mean the motor back here she led him to the rear and opened the doors god amighty moro said smells a little raunchy right now cant help that till we hose er down ginny stepped inside looked back and saw moro still on the ground you coming up or not just thinking about what shed seen him watching her move and didnt really have to ask well you know moro shuffled his feet how do you figure on paying for whatever it is i got to do gas you take a look tell me how many tins i say yes or no we could work something out we could huh sure moro gave her a foolish grin why not ginny didnt blink mister what kind of girl do you think i am moro looked puzzled and intent i can read good lady believe it or not i figured you wasnt tacos or dangerous drugs you figured wrong ginny said sex is just software to me and dont you forget it i havent got all day to watch you moonin over my parts i got to move or stand still when i stand still you look when i move you look more cant fault you for that im about the prettiest thing you ever saw dont let it get in the way of your work moro couldnt think of much to say he took a breath and stepped into the van there was a bed bolted flat against the floor a red cotton spread a worn satin pillow that said durango colorado and pictured chipmunks and waterfalls an end table a pinkshaded lamp with flamingos on the side red curtains on the walls ballet prints and a naked minnie mouse somethin else moro said back heres the problem ginny said she pulled a curtain aside at the front of the van there was a plywood cabinet fitted with brass screws ginny took a key out of her jeans and opened it up moro stared a minute then laughed aloud sensory tapes well ill be a son of a bitch he took a new look at ginny a look ginny didnt miss havent seen a rig like this in years didnt know there were any still around ive got three tapes ginny explained a brunette a redhead and a blond found a whole cache in ardmore oklahoma had to look at bout three or four hundred to find girls that looked close enough to me nearly went nuts fore it was over anyway i

sevenminute dose headpiece is in the end table there i get it on and off them real quick wires go under the floorboards back here to the rig jesus moro said they ever catch you at this you are cooked

pretty good at tacos and drugs a little too sensitive you ask me well nobodys perfect so they say the trouble youre havings in the rig i guess ginny said beats the hell out of me she bit her lip and wrinkled her brow moro found the gestures most inviting slips a little i think maybe i got a short huh maybe moro fiddled with the rig testing one of the spools with his thumb ill have to get in here and see its all yours ill be wherever it is dels got me staying ruby johns moro said only place there is with a good roof id like to take you out to dinner well sure you would you got a real shitty attitude friend i get a whole lot of practice ginny said and ive got a certain amount of pride moro told her i dont intend to ask you more than three or four times and thats it ginny nodded right on the edge of approval youve got promise she said not a whole lot maybe but some does that mean dinner or not means not means if i wanted to have dinner with some guy youd maybe fit the bill moros eyes got hot hell with you lady i dont need the company that bad fine ginny sniffed the air and walked out you have a nice day moro watched her walk watched denims mould her legs studied the hydraulics of her hips considered several unlikely acts considered cleaning up searching for proper clothes considered finding a bottle and watching the tapes a plastic embrace at best or so hed heard but a lot less hassle in the end possum dark watched the van disappear into the shop he felt uneasy at once his place was on top keeping ginny from harm sending feral prayers for murder to absent genetic gods his eyes hadnt left dog since hed appeared primal smells old fears and needs assailed his senses dog locked the gate and turned around didnt come closer just turned im dog quick he said folding hairy arms i dont much care for possums i dont much care for dogs said possum dark dog seemed to understand what did you do before the war worked in a theme park our wildlife heritage that kind of shit what about you security what else dog made a face learned a little electrics picked up a lot more from moro gain ive done worse he nodded toward the shop you like to shoot people with that thing anytime i get the chance you ever play any cards some possum dark showed his teeth i guess i could handle myself with a dog for real goods dog returned the grin new deck unbroken seal table stakes possum said moro showed up at ruby johns cot emporium close to noon ginny had a semiprivate stall covered by a blanket shed bathed and braided her hair and cut the legs clean off her jeans she tugged at moros heart itll be tomorrow morning moro said cost you ten gallons of gas ten gallons ginny said thats stealin and you know it take it or leave it moro said you got a bad head in that rig going to come right off you dont fix it you wouldnt like that your customers wouldnt like it any at all ginny appeared subdued but not much four gallons tops eight i got to make the parts myself five six moro said six and i take you to dinner five and a half and i want to be out of this sweatbox at dawn on the road and gone when the sun starts bakin your lovely town damn youre fun to have around ginny smiled sweet and disarming an unexpected event im all right you got to get to know me just how do i go about that you dont the smile turned sober i havent figured that one out it looked like rain to the north sunrise was dreary muddy lessthanspectacular yellows and reds colours through a window no one had bothered to wash moro had the van brought out he said hed thrown in a lube and hosed out the back five and a half gallons were gone out of the wagon ginny had del count while moro watched im honest moro said you dont have to do that i know ginny said glancing curiously at dog who was looking rather strange he seemed out of sorts sulky and off his feed ginny followed his eyes and saw possum atop the van possum showed a wet possum grin where you headed now moro asked wanting to hold her as long as he could south ginny said since she was facing that direction i wouldnt moro said not real friendly folks down there im not picky business is business no sir moro shook his head bad business is what it is you got the dry heaves south and east doom city after that straight down and youll hit the hackers might run into fort pru bunch of disgruntled insurance agents out on the flats stay clear away from them isnt worth whatever youll make youve been a big help ginny said moro gripped her door you ever listen to anyone lady im giving good advice fine ginny said im bout as grateful as i can be moro watched her leave he was consumed by her appearance the day seemed to focus in her eyes nothing he said pleased her in the least still her disdain was friendly enough there was no malice at all that he could see there was something about the sound of doom city she didnt like ginny told del to head south and maybe west around noon a yellow haze appeared on the ragged rim of the world like someone rolling a cheap dirty rug across the flats sandstorm possum called from the roof right out of the west i dont like it at all i think we better turn looks like trouble coming fast there was nothing possum said she couldnt see he had a habit of saying either too little or more than enough she told him to cover his guns and get inside that the sand would take his hide and there was nothing out there he needed to kill that wouldnt wait possum dark sulked but climbed down hunched in back of the van he grasped air in the shape of grips and trigger guards practiced rage and windage in his head ill bet i can beat that storm del said i got this feeling i can do it beat it where ginny said we dont know where we are or whats ahead thats true del said all the more reason then to get there soon as we can ginny stepped out and viewed the world with disregard i got sand in my teeth and in my toes she complained ill bet that moro gain knows right where stormsll likely be ill bet thats what happened all right seemed like a decent sort to me del said thats what i mean ginny said you cant trust a man like that at all the storm had seemed to last a couple of days ginny figured maybe an hour the sky looked bad as cabbage soup the land looked just the way it had she couldnt see the difference between sand recently gone or newly arrived del got the van going again ginny thought about yesterdays bath east bad news had its points before they topped the first rise possum dark began to stomp on the roof vehicles to port he called out sedans and pickup trucks flatbeds and semis buses of all kinds what are they doing del said coming right at us hauling timber doing what ginny made a face damn it all del will you stop the car i swear youre a driving fool del stopped ginny climbed up with possum to watch the caravan kept a straight line cars and trucks werent exactly hauling timber but they were each carried a section of a wall split logs bound together sharpened at the top the lead car turned and the others followed the lead car turned again in a moment there was a wooden stockade assembled on the flats square as if youd drawn it with a rule a stockade and a gate over the gate a wooden sign fort pru games of chance amusement term whole life half life death i dont like it said possum dark you dont like anythings still alive ginny said theyve got small arms and theyre a nervouslooking bunch theyre just horny possum thats the same as nervous or close enough possum pretended to understand looks like theyre pulled up for the night she called to del lets do some business friend the overhead dont ever stop five of them came out to the van they all looked alike stringy darkened by the sun bare to the waist except for collars and striped ties each carried an attache case thin as two slices of bread without butter two had pistols stuck in their belts the leader carried a finelooking sawedoff remington it hung by a camou guitar strap to his waist del didnt like him at all he had perfect white teeth and a bald head eyes the colour of jellyfish melting on the beach he studied the sign on the van and looked at del you got a whore inside or not del looked him straight on im a little displeased at that its not the way to talk hey the man gave del a wink you dont have to give us the pitch were show business folk ourselves is that right wheels of chance and honest cards odds i know youll like im head actuary of this bunch names fred that animal up there has a pisspoor attitude friend no reason to poke that weapon down my throat were friendly people here no reason i can see why possumd spray this place with lead and diarrhetics del said less you can think of something i cant fred smiled at that the sun made a big gold ball on his head i guess well try your girl he told del course we got to see her first what do you take in trade goods as fine as what youre getting in return ive got just the thing the head actuary winked again the gesture was starting to irritate del fred nodded and a friend drew clean white paper from his case this here is heavy bond he told del shuffling the edges with his thumb fifty percent linen weave and we got it by the ream wont find anything like it you can mark on it good or trade it off seventh mercenary writers came through a week ago whole brigade of mounted horse near cleaned us out but we can spare a few reams we got pencils too mirado twos and threes unsharpened with erasers on the end whens the last time you saw that why this stuffs good as gold we got staples and legal pads claim forms

there i got seventeen rustyass guzzlers runnin dry a gnatwhisker wire sparked hot in dels head he could see it in the underwriters eyes gasoline greed was what it was and he knew these men were bent on more than fleshly pleasure he knew with androidial dread that when they could theyd make their play well now the gas is not for trade he said as calmly as he could sex and tacos and dangerous drugs is what we sell no problem the actuary said why no problem at all just an idea is all it was you get that little gal out here and ill bring in my crew hows half a ream a man sound to you just as fair as it can be del said thinking that half of that wouldve been fine knowing dead certain now that fred intended to take back whatever he gave that moro fellow was right del said these insurance boys are bad news best thing we can do is take off and let it go pooh said ginny thats just the way men are they come in mad as foamin dogs and go away like cats licking cream thats the nature of the fornicatin trade you wait and see besides they wont get funny with possum dark you wouldnt pray for rain if you were afire del muttered well im not unhitching the gas ill set you up a stage over the tarp you can do your number there suit yourself ginny said kissing a plastic cheek and scooting him out the door now get on out of here and let me start getting cute it seemed to be going well cheerleader barbara jean awoke forgotten wet dreams left their mouths as dry as snakes set them up for sally the teach and nora nurse secret violations of the soul maybe ginny was right del decided faced with girlie delights a mans normally shitty outlook disappeared when he was done he didnt want to wreck a thing for an hour or maybe two didnt care about killing for half a day del could only guess at this magic and how it worked data was one thing sweet encounters something else he caught possums eye and felt secure fortyeight men waited their turns possum knew the calibre of their arms the length of every blade his black twinfifties blessed them all fred the actuary sidled up and grinned at del we sure ought to talk about gas thats what we ought to do look del said gas isnt for trade i told you that go talk to those boys at the refinery same as us tried to they got no use for office supplies thats not my problem del said maybe it is del didnt miss the razor tones you got something to say just say it half of your gas we pay our way with the girl and dont give you any trouble you forget about him fred studied possum dark i can afford losses better than you listen i know what you are friend i know youre not a man had a cpa droid just like you tore the war maybe we can talk del said trying to figure what to do say now thats what i like to hear ginnys fourth customer staggered out wildeyed and white around the gills goddamn try the nurse he bawled to the others never had nothin like it in my life next del said and started stacking bond paper lust is the name of the game gents what did i tell you now the girl plastic too fred asked real as you del said we make some kind of deal how do i know youll keep your word jesus fred said what do you think i am you got my life underwriters oath the next customer exploded through the curtain tripped and fell on his face picked himself up and shook his head he looked damaged bleeding around the eyes shes a tiger del announced wondering what the hell was going on scuse me a minute he told fred and slipped inside the van just what are you doing in here he asked ginny those boys look like they been through a thrasher beats me ginny said halfway between nora and barbara jean last old boy jerked around like a snake having a fit started pulling out his hair somethin isnt right here del its gotta be the tapes i figure that moro fellows a cheat we got trouble inside and out del told her the head of this bunch wants our gas well he sure cant have it by god ginny the mans got bugspit eyes says hell take his chances with possum we better clear out while we can huhunh ginny shook her head thatll rile em for sure give me a minute or two weve done a bunch of noras and a sally ill switch them all to barbara jean and see del slipped back outside it seemed a dubious answer at best thats some woman said fred shes something else today your insurance boys have got her fired fred grinned at that guess i better give her a try i wouldnt del said why not let her calm down some might be more than you want to handle he knew at once this wasnt the thing to say fred turned the colour of ketchup pie why you plastic piece of shit i can handle any woman born or put together out of a kit suit yourself del said feeling the day going down the drain no charge at all damn right theres not fred jerked the next man out of line get ready in there little lady am going to handle all your policy needs the men cheered possum dark who understood at least threefifths of the trouble down below shot del a questioning look got any of those tacos someone asked not likely del said del considered turning himself off android suicide seemed the answer but in less than three minutes unnatural howls began to come from the van the howls turned to shrieks life underwriters went rigid then fred emerged shattered he looked like a man whod kicked a bear with boils his joints appeared to bend the wrong way he looked whompereyed at del dazed and outofsynch everything happened then in seconds thin as wire del saw fred find him saw the oilspill eyes catch him clean saw the sawedoff barrels match the eyes so fast even electric feet couldnt snatch him out of the way in time dels arm exploded he let it go and ran for the van possum couldnt help the actuary was below and too close the twinfifties opened up underwriters fled possum stitched the sand and sent them flying ragged and dead del reached the drivers seat as lead peppered the van he felt slightly silly sitting there with one arm one hand on the wheel move over ginny said that isnt going to work i guess not ginny sent them lurching through the scrub never saw anything like it in my life she said aloud turned that poor fella on he started twisting out of his socks bones snapping like sticks damndest orgasm i ever saw somethings not working just right well i can see that del jesus whats that ginny twisted the wheel as a large part of the desert rose straight up in the air smoking sand rained down on the van rockets del said grimly thats the reason they figured that crazyfingered possum was a snap watch where youre going girl two fiery pillars exploded ahead del leaned out the window and looked back half of fort prus wall was in pursuit possum sprayed everything in sight but he couldnt spot where the rockets were coming from underwriter assault cars split up came at them from every side trying to flank us del said a rocket burst to the right ginny im not real sure what to do hows the stub slight electric tingle like a doorbell half a mile away ginny they get us in a circle were in very deep shit they hit that gas we wont have to worry about a thing oh lord now why did i think of that possum hit a semi clean on it came to a stop and died fell over like a bug del could see that being a truck and a wall all at once had its problems balance being one head right at them he told ginny then veer off sharp they cant turn quick going fast del bullets rattled the van something heavy made a noise the van skewed to a halt ginny took her hands off the wheel and looked grim it appears they got the tires del were flat dead is what we are lets get out of this thing and do what del wondered bearings seemed to roll about in his head he sensed a malfunction on the way the fort pru vehicles shrieked to a stop crazed life agents piled out and came at them over the flats firing small arms and hurling stones a rocket burst nearby possums guns suddenly stopped ginny grimaced in disgust dont you tell me were out of ammo possum dark that stuffs plenty hard to get possum started to speak del waved his good arm to the north hey now would you look at that suddenly there was confusion in the underwriters ranks a vaguely familiar pickup had appeared on the rise the driver weaved through traffic hurling grenades they exploded in clusters bright pink bouquets he spotted the man with the rocket lying flat atop a bus grenades stopped him cold underwriters abandoned the field and ran ginny saw a fairly peculiar sight six black harleys had joined the truck chow dogs with uzis snaked in and out of the ranks motors snarling and spewing horsetails of sand high in the air they showed no mercy at all picking off stragglers as they ran a few underwriters made it to cover in a moment it was over fort pru fled in sectional disarray well if that wasnt just in the nick of time del said i hate chow dogs possum said they got black tongues and thats a fact i hope you folks are all right moro said well now friend looks as if youve thrown an arm nothing real serious del said im grateful ginny said guess i got to tell you that moro was taken by her penetrating charm her thankless manner the fetching smudge of grease on her knee he thought she was cute as a pup i felt it was something i had to do circumstances being what they are and just what circumstances are that ginny asked that pesky shepherd dogs sorta responsible for any trouble you mightve had got a little pissed when that possum cleaned him out fivecard stud i think it was course there might have been marking and crimping of cards i couldnt say ginny blew hair out of her eyes mister far as i can see youre not making a lot of sense im real embarrassed about this that dog got mad and kinda screwed up your gear you let a dog repair my stuff ginny said perfectly good technician taught him mostly myself okay if you dont get his dander up those shepherds are inbred so i hear what he did was set your tapes in a loop and speed em up customerd get say twentysix times his moneys worth works out to a mach seven fuck could cause bodily harm lord i ought to shoot you in the foot ginny said look moro said i stand behind my work and i got here quick as i could brought friends along to help and im eating the cost of that damn right ginny said the chow dogs sat their harleys a ways off and glared at possum possum dark glared back he secretly admired their leather gear the purina crests sewn on the backs ill be adding up costs ginny said im expecting full repairs youll get it of course youll have to spend some time in bad news might take a little while she caught his look and had to laugh youre a stubborn son of a bitch ill give you that whatd you do with that dog you want taco meat ill make you a deal yuck i guess ill pass del began to weave about in roughly trapezoidal squares smoke started to curl out of his stub for christs sake possum sit on him or something ginny said i can fix that moro told her youve about fixed enough seems to me were going to get along fine you wait and see you think so ginny looked alarmed i better not get used to having you around it could happen it could just as easy not ill see about changing that tire moro said we ought to get del out of the sun you think about finding something nice to wear to dinner east bad news is kinda picky we got a lot of pride around here the end of the world as we know it by dale bailey dale bailey is the author of three novels the fallen house of bones and sleeping policemen with jack slay jr hes published more than pieces of short fiction mostly in the magazine of fantasy science fiction a selection of which has been collected in the resurrection mans legacy and other stories this story which was a finalist for the nebula award grew out of baileys attempt to understand our rather morbid fascination with the genre and the prospect of our own extinction the end of the world as we know it is about the lone survivor of an apocalypse attempting to grapple with the emotional dimension of his loss but more than that its an endoftheworld story about how endoftheworld stories actually work one thing bailey realized in writing the story is that the world is ending for someone every minute of every day he says we dont need the destruction of entire cities to know what its like to survive a catastrophe whenever we lose someone we love deeply we experience the end of the world as we know it the central idea of the story is not merely that the apocalypse is coming but that its coming for you and theres nothing you can do to avoid it between and ad bubonic plague overran europe killing some million people the plague dubbed the black death because of the black pustules that erupted on the skin of the afflicted was caused by a bacterium now known as yersinia pestis the europeans of the day lacking access to microscopes or knowledge of disease vectors attributed their misfortune to an angry god flagellants roamed the land hoping to appease his wrath they died by the hundreds both day and night agnolo di tura tells us i buried my five children with my own hands so many died that all believed it was the end of the world today the population of europe is about million evenings wyndham likes to sit on the porch drinking he likes gin but hell drink anything hes not particular lately hes been watching it get darkreally watching it i mean not just sitting thereand so far hes concluded that the cliché is wrong night doesnt fall its more complex than that not that hes entirely confident in the accuracy of his observations its high summer just now and wyndham often begins drinking at two or three so by the time the sun sets around nine hes usually pretty drunk still it seems to him that if anything night rises gathering first in inky pools under the trees as if it has leached up from underground reservoirs and then spreading out toward the borders of the yard and up toward the yetlighted sky its only toward the end that anything fallsthe blackness of deep space he supposes unscrolling from high above the earth the two planes of darkness meet somewhere in the middle and thats night for you thats his current theory anyway it isnt his porch incidentally but then it isnt his gin eitherexcept in the sense that in so far as wyndham can tell anyway everything now belongs to him endoftheworld stories usually come in one of two varieties in the first the world ends with a natural disaster either unprecedented or on an unprecedented scale floods lead all other contendersgod himself were told is fond of that onethough plagues have their advocates a renewed ice age is also popular ditto drought in the second variety irresponsible human beings bring it on themselves mad scientists and corrupt bureaucrats usually an exchange of icbms is the typical route although the scenario has dated in the present geopolitical environment feel free to mix and match genetically engineered flu virus anyone melting polar ice caps on the day the world ended wyndham didnt even realize it was the end of the worldnot right away anyway for him at that point in his life pretty much every day seemed like the end of the world this was not a consequence of a chemical imbalance either it was a consequence of working for ups where on the day the world ended wyndham had been employed for sixteen years first as a loader then in sorting and finally in the coveted position of driver the brown uniform and everything by this time the company had gone public and he also owned some shares the money was goodvery good in fact not only that he liked his job still the beginning of every goddamn day started off feeling like a cataclysm you try getting up at am every morning and see how you feel this was his routine at am the alarm went offan oldfashioned alarm he wound it up every night he couldnt tolerate the radio before he drank his coffee he always turned it off right away not wanting to wake his wife he showered in the spare bathroom again not wanting to wake his wife her name was ann poured coffee into his thermos and ate something he probably shouldnta bagel a pop tartwhile he stood over the sink by then it would be if he was running late then he would do something paradoxical he would go back to his bedroom and wake up the wife hed spent the last twenty minutes trying not to disturb have a good day wyndham always said his wife always did the same thing too she would screw her face into her pillow and smile ummm she would say and it was usually such a cozy loving earlymorning cuddling kind of ummm that it almost made getting up at in the goddamn morning worth it wyndham heard about the world trade centernot the end of the world though to wyndham it sure as hell felt that wayfrom one of his customers the customerher name was monicawas one of wyndhams regulars a home shopping network fiend this woman she was big too the kind of woman of whom people say she has a nice personality or she has such a pretty face she did have a nice personality tooat least wyndham thought she did so he was concerned when she opened the door in tears whats wrong he said monica shook her head at a loss for words she waved him inside wyndham in violation of about fifty ups regulations stepped in after her the house smelled of sausage and floral air freshener there was home shopping network shit everywhere i mean everywhere wyndham hardly noticed his gaze was fixed on the television it was showing an airliner flying into the world trade center he stood there and watched it from three or four different angles before he noticed the home shopping network logo in the lower righthand corner of the screen that was when he concluded that it must be the end of the world he couldnt imagine the home shopping network preempting regularly scheduled programming for anything less the muslim extremists who flew airplanes into the world trade center into the pentagon and into the unyielding earth of an otherwise unremarkable field in pennsylvania were secure we are told in the knowledge of their imminent translation into paradise there were nineteen of them every one of them had a name wyndhams wife was something of a reader she liked to read in bed before she went to sleep she always marked her spot using a bookmark wyndham had given her for her birthday one year it was a cardboard bookmark with a yarn ribbon at the top and a picture of a rainbow arching high over whitecapped mountains smile the bookmark said god loves you wyndham wasnt much of a reader but if hed picked up his wifes book the day the world ended he would have found the first few pages interesting in the opening chapter god raptures all true christians to heaven this includes true christians who are driving cars and trains and airplanes resulting in uncounted lost lives as well as significant damages to personal property if wyndham had read the book hed have thought of a bumper sticker he sometimes saw from high in his ups truck warning the bumper sticker read in case of rapture this car will be unmanned whenever he saw that bumper sticker wyndham imagined cars crashing planes falling from the sky patients abandoned on the operating tablepretty much the scenario of his wifes book in fact wyndham went to church every sunday but he couldnt help wondering what would happen to the untold millions of people who werent true christianswhether by choice or by the geographical fluke of having been born in some place like indonesia what if they were crossing the street in front of one of those cars he wondered or watering lawns those planes would soon plow into but i was saying on the day the world ended wyndham didnt understand right away what had happened his alarm clock went off the way it always did and he went through his normal routine shower in the spare bath coffee in the thermos breakfast over the sink a chocolate donut this time and gone a little stale then he went back to the bedroom to say goodbye to his wife have a good day he said as he always said and leaning over he shook her a little not enough to really wake her just enough to get her stirring in sixteen years of performing this ritual minus federal holidays and two weeks of paid vacation in the summer wyndham had pretty much mastered it he could cause her to stir without quite waking her up just about every time so to say he was surprised when his wife didnt screw her face into her pillow and smile is something of an understatement he was shocked actually and there was an additional consideration she hadnt said ummm either not the usual luxurious warmmorningbed kind of ummm and not the infrequent but still familiar stuffy ihaveacoldandmyheadaches kind of ummm either no ummm at all the airconditioning cycled off for the first time wyndham noticed a strange smella faint organic funk like spoiled milk or unwashed feet standing there in the dark wyndham began to have a very bad feeling it was a different kind of bad feeling than the one hed had in monicas living room watching airliners plunge again and again into the world trade centre that had been a powerful but largely impersonal bad feelingi say largely impersonal because wyndham had a third cousin who worked at cantor fitzgerald the cousins name was chris wyndham had to look it up in his address book every year when he sent out cards celebrating the birth of his personal savoir the bad feeling he began to have when his wife failed to say ummm on the other hand was powerful and personal concerned wyndham reached down and touched his wifes face it was like touching a woman made of wax lifeless and cool and it was at that momentthat moment preciselythat wyndham realized the world had come to an end everything after that was just details beyond the mad scientists and corrupt bureaucrats characters in endoftheworld stories typically come in one of three varieties the first is the rugged individualist you know the type selfreliant iconoclastic loners who know how to use firearms and deliver babies by storys end theyre well on their way to reestablishing western civilization though theyre usually smart enough not to return to the bad old ways the second variety is the postapocalyptic bandit these characters often come in gangs and they face off against the rugged survivor types if you happen to prefer cinematic incarnations of the endoftheworld tale you can usually recognize them by their penchant for bondage gear punkedout haircuts and customized vehicles unlike the rugged survivors the postapocalyptic bandits embrace the bad old waysthough theyre not displeased by the expanded opportunities to rape and pillage the third type of characteralso pretty common though a good deal less so than the other twois the worldweary sophisticate like wyndham such characters drink too much unlike wyndham they suffer badly from ennui wyndham suffers too of course but whatever he suffers from you can bet its not ennui we were discussing details though wyndham did the things people do when they discover a loved one dead he picked up the phone and dialled there seemed to be something wrong with the line however no one picked up on the other end wyndham took a deep breath went into the kitchen and tried the extension once again he had no success the reason of course was that this being the end of the world all the people who were supposed to answer the phones were dead imagine them being swept away by a tidal wave if that helpswhich is exactly what happened to more than people during a storm in pakistan in not that this is literally what happened to the operators who would have taken wyndhams call you understand but more about what really happened to them laterthe important thing is that one moment they had been alive the next they were dead like wyndhams wife wyndham gave up on the phone he went back into the bedroom he performed a fumbling version of mouthtomouth resuscitation on his wife for fifteen minutes or so and then he gave that up too he walked into his daughters bedroom she was twelve and her name was ellen he found her lying on her back her mouth slightly agape he reached down to shake herhe was going to tell her that something terrible had happened that her mother had diedbut he found that something terrible had happened to her as well the same terrible thing in fact wyndham panicked he raced outside where the first hint of red had begun to bleed up over the horizon his neighbours automatic irrigation system was on the heads whickering in the silence and as he sprinted across the lawn wyndham felt the spray like a cool hand against his face then chilled he was standing on his neighbours stoop hammering the door with both fists screaming after a timehe didnt know how longa dreadful calm settled over him there was no sound but the sound of the sprinklers throwing glittering arcs of spray into the halo of the street light on the corner he had a vision then it was as close as he had ever come to a moment of genuine prescience in the vision he saw the suburban houses stretching away in silence before him he saw the silent bedrooms in them curled beneath the sheets he saw a legion of sleepers also silent who would never again wake up wyndham swallowed then he did something he could not have imagined doing even twenty minutes ago he bent over fished the key from its hiding place between the bricks and let himself inside his neighbours house the neighbours cat slipped past him mewing querulously wyndham had already reached down to retrieve it when he noticed the smellthat unpleasant faintly organic funk not spoiled milk either and not feet something worse soiled diapers or a clogged toilet wyndham straightened the cat forgotten herm he called robin no answer inside wyndham picked up the phone and dialled he listened to it ring for a long time then without bothering to turn it off wyndham dropped the phone to the floor he made his way through the silent house snapping on lights at the door to the master bedroom he hesitated the doorit was unmistakable now a mingled stench of urine and faeces of all the bodys muscles relaxing at oncewas stronger here when he spoke again whispering really herm robin he no longer expected an answer wyndham turned on the light robin and herm were shapes in the bed unmoving stepping closer wyndham stared down at them a fleeting series of images cascaded through his mind images of herm and robin working the grill at the neighbourhood block party or puttering in their vegetable garden theyd had a knack for tomatoes robin and herm wyndhams wife had always loved their tomatoes something caught in wyndhams throat he went away for a while then the world just greyed out on him when he came back wyndham found himself in the living room standing in front of robin and herms television he turned it on and cycled through the channels but there was nothing on literally nothing snow thats all seventyfive channels of snow the end of the world had always been televised in wyndhams experience the fact that it wasnt being televised now suggested that it really was the end of the world this is not to suggest that television validates human experienceof the end of the world or indeed of anything else for that matter you could ask the people of pompeii if most of them hadnt died in a volcano eruption in ad nearly two millennia before television when vesuvius erupted sending lava thundering down the mountainside at four miles a minute some people perished by some freakish geological quirk some of themtheir shells anywaywere preserved frozen inside casts of volcanic ash their arms outstretched in pleas for mercy their faces frozen in horror for a fee you can visit them today heres one of my favourite endoftheworld scenarios by the way carnivorous plants wyndham got in his car and went looking for assistancea functioning telephone or television a helpful passerby he found instead more nonfunctioning telephones and televisions and of course more nonfunctioning people lots of those though he had to look harder for them than you might have expected they werent scattered in the streets or dead at the wheels of their cars in a massive traffic jamthough wyndham supposed that might have been the case somewhere in europe where the catastrophewhatever it washad fallen square in the middle of the morning rush here however it seemed to have caught most folks at home in bed as a result the roads were more than usually passable at a lossnumb reallywyndham drove to work he might have been in shock by then hed gotten accustomed to the smell anyway and the corpses of the night shiftmen and women hed known for sixteen years in some casesdidnt shake him as much what did shake him was the sight of all the packages in the sorting area he was struck suddenly by the fact that none of them would ever be delivered so wyndham loaded his truck and went out on his route he wasnt sure why he did itmaybe because hed rented a movie once in which a postapocalyptic drifter scavenges a us postal uniform and manages to reestablish western civilization but not the bad old ways by assuming the postmans appointed rounds the futility of wyndhams own efforts quickly became evident however he gave it up when he found that even monicaor as he more often thought of her the home shopping network ladywas no longer in the business of receiving packages wyndham found her face down on the kitchen floor clutching a shattered coffee mug in one hand in death she had neither a pretty face nor a nice personality she did have that same ripe unpleasant door however in spite of it wyndham stood looking down at her for the longest time he couldnt seem to look away when he finally did look away wyndham went back to the living room where he had once watched nearly people die and opened her package himself when it came to ups rules the home shopping network ladys living room was turning out to be something of a postapocalyptic zone in its own right wyndham tore the mailing tape off and dropped it on the floor he opened the box inside wrapped safely in three layers of bubble wrap he found a porcelain statue of elvis presley elvis presley the king of rock n roll died august while sitting on the toilet an autopsy revealed that he had ingested an impressive cocktail of prescription drugsincluding codeine ethinamate methaqualone and various barbiturates doctors also found trace elements of valium demerol and other pharmaceuticals in his veins for a time wyndham comforted himself with the illusion that the end of the world had been a local phenomenon he sat in his truck outside the home shopping network ladys house and awaited rescuethe sound of sirens or approaching choppers whatever he fell asleep cradling the porcelain statue of elvis he woke up at dawn stiff from sleeping in the truck to find a stray dog nosing around outside clearly rescue would not be forthcoming wyndham chased off the dog and placed elvis gently on the sidewalk then he drove off heading out of the city periodically he stopped each time confirming what he had already known the minute he touched his dead wifes face the end of the world was upon him he found nothing but nonfunctioning telephones nonfunctioning televisions and nonfunctioning people along the way he listened to a lot of nonfunctioning radio stations you like wyndham may be curious about the catastrophe that has befallen everyone in the world around him you may even be wondering why wyndham has survived endoftheworld tales typically make a big deal about such things but wyndhams curiosity will never be satisfied unfortunately neither will yours shit happens its the end of the world after all the dinosaurs never discovered what caused their extinction either at this writing however most scientists agree that the dinosaurs met their fate when an asteroid nine miles wide ploughed into the earth just south of the yucatan peninsula triggering gigantic tsunamis hurricaneforce winds worldwide forest fires and a flurry of volcanic activity the crater is still there its miles wide and more than a mile deepbut the dinosaurs along with of the other species then alive are gone many of them died in the impact vaporized in the explosion those that survived the initial cataclysm would have perished soon after as acid rain poisoned the worlds water and dust obscured the sun plunging the planet into a yearslong winter for what its worth this impact was merely the most dramatic in a long series of mass extinctions they occur in the fossil record at roughly millionyear intervals some scientists have linked these intervals to the solar systems periodic journey through the galactic plane which dislodges millions of comets from the oort cloud beyond pluto raining them down on earth this theory still contested is called the shiva hypothesis in honour of the hindu god of destruction the inhabitants of lisbon would have appreciated the allusion on november when the city was struck by an earthquake measuring on the richter scale the tremor levelled more than homes and ignited a fire that burned for six days more than people perished this event inspired voltaire to write candide in which dr pangloss advises us that this is the best of all possible worlds wyndham could have filled the gas tank in his truck there were gas stations at just about every exit along the highway and they seemed to be functioning well enough he didnt bother though when the truck ran out of gas he just pulled to the side of the road hopped down and struck off across the fields when it started getting darkthis was before he had launched himself on the study of just how it is night fallshe took shelter in the nearest house it was a nice place a twostory brick house set well back from the country road he was by then walking on it had some big trees in the front yard in the back a shaded lawn sloped down to the kind of woods you see in movies but not often in real life enormous old trees with generous leafcarpeted avenues it was the kind of place his wife would have loved and he regretted having to break a window to get inside but there it was it was the end of the world and he had to have a place to sleep what else could he do wyndham hadnt planned to stay there but when he woke up the next morning he couldnt think of anywhere to go he found two nonfunctional old people in one upstairs bedroom and he tried to do for them what he had not been able to do for his wife and daughter using a spade from the garage he started digging a grave in the front yard after an hour or so his hands began to blister and crack his musclessoft from sitting behind the wheel of a ups truck for all those yearsrebelled he rested for a while and then he loaded the old people into the car he found parked in the garagea slateblue volvo station wagon with miles on the odometer he drove them a mile or two down the road pulled over and laid them out sidebyside in a grove of beech trees he tried to say some words over them before he lefthis wife would have wanted him tobut he couldnt think of anything appropriate so he finally gave it up and went back to the house it wouldnt have made much difference though wyndham didnt know it the old people were lapsed jews according to the faith wyndham shared with his wife they were doomed to burn in hell for all eternity anyway both of them were firstgeneration immigrants most of their families had already been burned up in ovens at dachau and buchenwald burning wouldnt have been anything new for them speaking of fires the triangle shirt waist factory in new york city burned on march one hundred and fortysix people died many of them might have survived but the factorys owners had locked the exits to prevent theft rome burned too it is said that nero fiddled back at the house wyndham washed up and made himself a drink from the liquor cabinet he found in the kitchen hed never been much of a drinker before the world ended but he didnt see any reason not to give it a try now his experiment proved such a success that he began sitting out on the porch nights drinking gin and watching the sky one night he thought he saw a plane lights blinking as it arced high overhead later sober he concluded that it must have been a satellite still whipping around the planet beaming down telemetry to empty listening stations and abandoned command posts a day or two later the power went out and a few days after that wyndham ran out of liquor using the volvo he set off in search of a town characters in endoftheworld stories commonly drive vehicles of two types the jaded sophisticates tend to drive souped up sports cars often racing them along the australian coast line because what else do they have to live for everyone else drives rugged suvs since the persian gulf warin which some people died most of them iraqi conscripts killed by american smart bombsmilitarystyle humvees have been especially coveted wyndham however found the volvo entirely adequate to his needs no one shot at him he was not assaulted by a roving pack of feral dogs he found a town after only fifteen minutes on the road he didnt see any evidence of looting everybody was too dead to loot thats the way it is at the end of the world on the way wyndham passed a sporting goods store where he did not stop to stock up on weapons or survival equipment he passed numerous abandoned vehicles but he did not stop to siphon off some gas he did stop at the liquor store where he smashed a window with a rock and helped himself to several cases of gin whiskey and vodka he also stopped at the grocery store where he found the reeking bodies of the night crew sprawled out beside carts of supplies that would never make it onto the shelves holding a handkerchief over his nose wyndham loaded up on tonic water and a variety of other mixers he also got some canned goods though he didnt feel any imperative to stock up beyond his immediate needs he ignored the bottled water in the book section he did pick up a bartenders guide some endoftheworld stories present us with two postapocalypse survivors one male and one female these two survivors take it upon themselves to repopulate the earth part of their larger effort to reestablish western civilization without the bad old ways their names are always artfully withheld until the end of the story at which point they are invariably revealed to be adam and eve the truth is almost all endoftheworld stories are at some level adamandeve stories that may be why they enjoy such popularity in the interests of total disclosure i will admit that in fallow periods of my own sexual lifeand alas these periods have been more frequent than id care to admitive often found adamandeve postholocaust fantasies strangely comforting being the only man alive significantly reduces the potential for rejection in my view and it cuts performance anxiety practically to nothing theres a woman in this story too dont get your hopes up by this time wyndham has been living in the brick house for almost two weeks he sleeps in the old couples bedroom and he sleeps pretty well but maybe thats the gin some mornings he wakes up disoriented wondering where his wife is and how he came to be in a strange place other mornings he wakes up feeling like he dreamed everything else and this has always been his bedroom one day though he wakes up early to gray predawn light someone is moving around downstairs wyndhams curious but hes not afraid he doesnt wish hed stopped at the sporting goods store and gotten a gun wyndham has never shot a gun in his life if he did shoot someoneeven a postapocalyptic punk with cannibalism on his mindhed probably have a breakdown wyndham doesnt try to disguise his presence as he goes downstairs theres a woman in the living room shes not bad looking this woman blonde in a washedout kind of way trim and young twentyfive thirty at the most she doesnt look extremely clean and she doesnt smell much better but hygiene hasnt been uppermost on wyndhams mind lately either who is he to judge i was looking for a place to sleep the woman says theres a spare bedroom upstairs wyndham tells her the next morningits really almost noon but wyndham has gotten into the habit of sleeping latethey eat breakfast together a pop tart for the woman a bowl of dry cheerios for wyndham they compare notes but we dont need to get into that its the end of the world and the woman doesnt know how it happened any more than wyndham does or you do or anybody ever does she does most of the talking though wyndhams never been much of a talker even at the best of times he doesnt ask her to stay he doesnt ask her to leave he doesnt ask her much of anything thats how it goes all day sometimes the whole sex thing causes the end of the world in fact if youll permit me to reference adam and eve just one more time sex and death have been connected to the end of the world ever sincewell the beginning of the world eve despite warnings to the contrary eats of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and realizes shes nakedthat is a sexual being then she introduces adam to the idea by giving him a bite of the fruit god punishes adam and eve for their transgression by kicking them out of paradise and introducing death into the world and there you have it the first apocalypse eros and thanatos all tied up in one neat little bundle and its all eves fault no wonder feminists dont like that story its a pretty corrosive view of female sexuality when you think about it coincidentally perhaps one of my favourite endoftheworld stories involves some astronauts who fall into a time warp when they get out they learn that all the men are dead the women have done pretty well for themselves in the meantime they no longer need men to reproduce and theyve set up a society that seems to work okay without menbetter in fact than our messy twosex societies ever have but do the men stay out of it they do not theyre men after all and theyre driven by their need for sexual dominance its genetically encoded so to speak and its not long before theyre trying to turn this eden into another fallen world its sex that does it violent male sexrape actually in other words sex thats more about the violence than the sex and certainly nothing to do with love which when you think about it is a pretty corrosive view of male sexuality the more things change the more they stay the same i guess wyndham though wyndham heads out on the porch around three hes got some tonic hes got some gin its what he does now he doesnt know where the woman is doesnt have strong feelings on the issue either way hes been sitting there for hours when she joins him wyndham doesnt know what time it is but the air has that hazy underwater quality that comes around twilight darkness is starting to pool under the trees the crickets are tuning up and its so peaceful that for a moment wyndham can almost forget that its the end of the world then the screen door claps shut behind the woman wyndham can tell right away that shes done something to herself though he couldnt tell you for sure what it is that magic women do he guesses his wife used to do it too she always looked good to him but sometimes she looked just flatout amazing some powder a little blush lipstick you know and he appreciates the effort he does hes flattered even shes an attractive woman intelligent too the truth is though hes just not interested she sits beside him and all the time shes talking and though she doesnt say it in so many words what shes talking about is repopulating the world and reestablishing western civilization shes talking about duty shes talking about it because thats what youre supposed to talk about at times like this but underneath that is sex and underneath that way down is lonelinessand he has some sympathy for that wyndham does after a while she touches wyndham but hes got nothing he might as well be dead down there whats wrong with you she says wyndham doesnt know how to answer her he doesnt know how to tell her that the end of the world isnt about any of that stuff the end of the world is about something else he doesnt have a word for it so anyway wyndhams wife she has another book on her night stand too she doesnt read it every night only on sundays but the week before the end of the world the story she was reading was the story of job you know the story right it goes like this god and satanthe adversary anyway thats probably the better translationmake a wager they want to see just how much shit gods most faithful servant will eat before he renounces his faith the servants name is job so they make the wager and god starts feeding job shit takes his riches takes his cattle takes his health deprives him of his friends on and on finallyand this is the part that always got to wyndhamgod takes jobs children let me clarify in this context takes should be read as kills you with me on this like krakatoa a volcanic island that used to exist between java and sumatra on august krakatoa exploded spewing ash fifty miles into the sky and vomiting up five cubic miles of rock the concussion was heard miles away it created tsunamis towering feet in the air imagine all that water crashing down on the flimsy villages that lined the shores of java and sumatra thirty thousand people died every single one of them had a name jobs kids dead just like nameless javanese as for job he keeps shovelling down the shit he will not renounce god he keeps the faith and hes rewarded god gives him back his riches his cattle god restores his health and sends him friends god replaces his kids pay attention word choice is important in an endoftheworld story i said replaces not restores the other kids they stay dead gone nonfunctioning erased forever from the earth just like the dinosaurs and the million undesirables incinerated by the nazis and the slaughtered in rwanda and the million murdered in cambodia and the million immolated in the middle passage that merry prankster god that jokester thats what the end of the world is about wyndham wants to say the rest is just details by this point the woman you want her to have a name she deserves one dont you think has started to weep softly wyndham gets to his feet and goes into the dark kitchen for another glass then he comes back out to the porch and makes a gin and tonic he sits beside her and presses the cool glass upon her its all he knows to do here he says drink this itll help song before sunset by david grigga david grigg is the author of just a handful of stories which were published between and this story the first he ever had accepted for publication first appeared in the anthology beyond tomorrow which saw him sharing a table of contents with no less than six sfwa grand masters in it was performed as an audiobook by alex wilson of telltale weekly httpwwwalexwilsoncomtelltaleaudiobooksdavidrowlandgriggasongbeforesunsetphp and is included in griggs story collection islands which is available for free download on his website wwwrightwordcomau httpwwwrightwordcomau grigg has been nominated for the australian ditmar awards several times once in the short fiction category twice as a fan writer and once for editing the fanzine the fanarchist grigg says that the seed of the story was a line in chekhovs three sisters where tuzenbach says of one of the sisters fancy being able to play so exquisitely and yet having nobody nobody at all to appreciate it it was this sad irony of wasted talent that started grigg thinking about how the very talented might copeor not copeonce our civilization was no more if as grigg says culture is an epiphenomenon of civilization without civilization would culture be entirely irrelevant it took him three weeks to find the sledgehammer he was hunting rats among the broken concrete and rusted metal of an ancient supermarket the sun was beginning to descend over the jagged horizons of the city casting shadows like giant gravestones onto the nearer buildings an edge of blackness had begun to creep across the rubble that was all that remained of the store he picked his way carefully from one piece of concrete to another skirting the twisted metal looking for a hole or a cover that might make a suitable nest for a brood of rats here and there using his stick to turn over a loose chunk in the vain hope of finding a can of food undiscovered after years of looting at his waist hung three large rats their heads squashed and bloody from his stick rats were still fat and slow enough these days to be caught by surprise with a blow to the head which was fortunate for his eye and his skill with the slingshot he carried were not as they had once been he rested a while sniffing at the cold wind there would be a frost tonight and his bones knew fear of the cold he was getting old he was sixtyfive and the years had starved him the flesh of his youth had loosened and sagged leaving his frame thinly draped and his eyes staring from his bony head like some curious troll he was sixtyfive and his hair gray many years ago now raised a white halo about his leathercolored face that he had survived so long was a wonder to him for his earlier years had not prepared him for this present world but somehow he had learned to fight and kill and run and all else that had been necessary in the long years since the city had died the days now however were not so foul and desperate as they had once been now it was seldom that he feared he would starve to death but in the bad days like many others he had eaten human flesh his name was parnell and he had gone on living the sun was sinking fast and he turned about to go back before the dark could overtake him it was as he turned that he caught the dull shine of metal in the corner of his eye he peered more closely put out his hand and heaved a sledgehammer up from the rubble he swung its mass experimentally weighed it in his hands and felt its movement after a moment he was forced to put it down again as his arms began to tremble with unaccustomed strain but no matter given enough time he knew this was the tool to realize the hope he had been hugging to himself for three weeks he tied the hammer awkwardly to his belt and began to hurry home fleeing the shadow of the city it was almost dark when he reached his home a weatherstained stone house hedged around with the tangled jungle of an overgrown garden inside he carefully lit each of the smoky candles in the living room calling up a cancerous light that spread relentlessly into the corners his door was locked and barred and at last he sat in peace before the woodwormed piano in the main room he sighed a little as his fingers tapped at the yellowed and splitting keys and felt an accustomed sorrow as the fractured notes ascended this piano had perhaps been a good learners instrument in its day but time had not been kind to it even if he had not feared attracting the attention of the dwellers in the dark outside the effort of playing was more agony than pleasure music had once been his life now his greatest aim was only to quiet the rumbling of his belly then he rememberedhis eyes drifted to the hammer he had found in the rubble that dayand his hope came alive again as it had weeks ago but there was no time to daydream no time for hoping there was time before he slept only to clean and skin the rats he had caught tomorrow he was to go trading with the tumbledown woman the tumbledown woman and her mate lived in the midst of a hundred decrepit trams in an old depot why they chose to live there was a puzzle none who traded with her had ever managed to solve here she stayed and here she traded her store counter was a solitary tram left on the rails a few meters outside the depot its paint peeling away but still bearing pathetic advertisements of a lost age while the outside of the tram offered faraway holidays and better deodorants the tumbledown woman inside traded garbage as the luxuries of a world which had died inside arrayed along the wooden seats or hung from the ceiling were tin cans with makeshift handgrips greasy homemade candles racks of suspect vegetables grown no one knew where rows of dead rats cats rabbits and the occasional dog plastic spoons bottles coats of ratskin and all sorts of items salvaged from the debris of oftlooted shops the tumbledown woman was old and she was black and she was ugly and she cackled when she saw parnell approaching slowly in the chill morning she had survived better than many men through the crisis by being more ruthless and more cruel than they had ever managed to be to her in the years before she rubbed her hands together with a dry dry sound and greeted parnell with a faded leer two rats tumbledown woman fresh killed yesterday he opened without hesitation i give you something good for them mr piano player she said then that will be the first time ever what a genuine diamond ring twentyfour carat gold see and she held the flashing gem to the sun parnell didnt bother to smile at her taunt give me food and be done with your mocking she sneered and offered him a cabbage and two carrots nodding he handed her the skinned corpses lodged the food in his bag and turned to go but he was carrying the sledgehammer at his side and she stopped him with a yell hey piano player man that hammer i give you good fur coat for it genuine rabbit he turned and saw that she was not mocking him this time when ive finished with it maybe then well see his reply seemed to make her pleased for she grinned and yelled again hey piano man you hear the news about ol man edmonds them vandalmen come an kill him burn down that book place ol man edmonds live in parnell gasped in shock the library they burnt the library down thats right my god he stood silent and bewildered for a long minute as the tumbledown woman grinned at him then unable to speak further in his anger he clamped his hands together in bitter frustration and walked off the sledgehammer was an awkward thing to carry slipped into his belt with the metal head at his waist the wooden handle beat at his legs as he walked if he carried it in his arms his muscles protested after no more than a few minutes and he was forced to rest he was getting old and he knew it the slide to death was beginning to steepen and he was not he thought very far from its end in slow weary stages he walked the distance into the heart of the corpse that was the city long ago its pulse had stopped he walked past the rusty hulks of cars and along the dustfilled tramtracks through streets of shattered buildings standing in rows like jagged reefs long ago the lungs of the city had expired their last breath the tall chimneys were fallen casting scattered bricks across the road before him he came at last to the centre and faced again the strongly barred and sealed doors of the old city hall half buried in the rubble of its longcrumbled entranceway even if he had been able to break open the bars of the door he would have needed to clear away the rubble to allow the doors to open such was beyond him but at the side of the building the skeleton of a truck lay crazily against the wall mounted on the pavement and nuzzled face to face with a tree that now made a leafy wilderness of the cab parnell climbed onto the truck and carefully ascended until he perched with little comfort on a branch of the tree close to a barred window three weeks ago he had cleaned away the grime on the glass to see the dusty corridors inside on the far wall of the corridor was a direction sign faded and yellowed but still bearing the words concert hall once again looking at that dim sign he was filled to overflowing with memories of concerts he had given his hands followed a memory of their own on the keys the music spiralled and after the almost invisible audience in the darkened hall applauded again and again his memories vanished as he swung the sledgehammer from his shoulder jarring it into the bars of the window dust showered and cement crumbled the task looked easier than he had at first thought which was fortunate for the one stroke had weakened him terribly he swung again and the bars moved and bent somehow he found the strength for another swing and the bars buckled and came loose and smashed through the glass into the corridor beyond triumph came to him in a cloud of weakness leaving him gasping and his arms weak and trembling he sat for a long moment on the branch gaining strength and hope to venture within at last he swung his legs over the edge and dropped onto the corridor floor glass crackled he reached into his bag and brought out a small candle and some precious matches the box of usable matches had cost him ten rat skins at the tumbledown womans tram two weeks ago he lit the candle and yellow light flooded into the dusty corridor he walked along it making footprints in the virgin dust a memory floated back to him of telecasts of moon explorers placing footprint after footprint in ageold lunar dust and he smiled a grim smile eventually he came to a set of double doors barred and padlocked here he was forced to rest again before he could smash the lock with his hammer and step into the spacelike blackness beyond after his eyes had adjusted to the light of the candle dimmed by the open space he saw row upon row of once plush seats somewhere a rat scurried and above he could hear the soft rustle and squeaks of what might be a brood of bats on the high ceiling the aisle stretched before him sloping slightly downwards parnell walked forward slowly kicking up dust in the dark immensity of the hall his candle was just a spark illuminating only a tight circle around him and filtering through puffs of dust stirred by his passage on the stage metal gleamed back images of the candle flame from scattered corners around him were the music stands and music sheets of a full orchestra filmed with years of dust here was a halfopened instrument case and in it the stillshining brass of a french horn abandoned by some longgone performer in forgotten haste and shrouded in white topped by a tarnished candelabra stood the grand piano parnells heart began a heavier more rapid beat as he brushed dust from the sheet covering the piano with an anxious hand he lit the candelabra with his own meagre candle and lifted it high as the light swelled across the stage he could see other instruments now long lost by their players here a violin there an oboe cast aside by a time that had made their possession unimportant placing the light on the floor he carefully eased the sheet from the piano yellow light danced on the black surface of polished wood and sparkled in the brass for a long long time his aged hands could do no more than caress the instrument with a growing affection finally he sat on the piano stool realizing perhaps for the first time how tired he was the key he saw with relief was still in the lock no doubt he could have forced it but it would have broken his heart to have damaged that perfect form turning the key in the lock he lifted the cover and ran his hand softly over the white and black of the piano keys he sat back and with a selfconsciously wry gesture flipped his ragged coat away from his seat and turned to face the hall a full house tonight mr parnell all of london queues to hear you the radio stations are paying fortunes to broadcast your concert the audience is quiet expectant can you hear them breathe out there not a cough not a sneeze not a mutter as they wait hushed to hear the first notes drop from your fingertips the music trembles in your hands waiting to beginnow discords shattered the empty hall and the bats disturbed flew in a twittering crowd above the deserted rotting seats parnell let out his breath in a painful sigh the instrument would have to be painstakingly retuned note by note his goal had yet to be reached but now at last he could reach out and touch it now one by one he began to realize the difficulties that remained he felt his hunger and saw the candles burning fast he could probably find pitch pipes in the hall but he would need some kind of tool to tighten the strings of the piano and he would have to support himself somehow while he spent his time in here and was unable to hunt or forage he would have to go back to the tumbledown woman and see what she would offer him in trade for the sledgehammer it was no fur coat he would be getting he knew outside again he opened his bag and took out the food he had brought with him he sat on the truck eating pieces of roasted rat and raw cabbage pondering whether there was some way he could net and kill some of the brood of bats within the hall no doubt they would make curious eating and perhaps their leathery wings might have a use but all these schemes were impractical and he dismissed them in the distance over the broken buildings a thin trail of black smoke was rising leisurely toward the sky the day had become bright and cloudless and the smoke was a smear against the blue puzzled parnell wondered what was burning the trail was too contained to be a forest fire unless some building had spontaneously ignited after all these years it had to be the work of men unable to arrive at any more satisfactory a conclusion he turned away thrusting the question from his mind after bundling away the remnants of the food he loosely replaced the bars of the window to make his entry less obvious to any passing wanderer heaving up the sledgehammer he began the long walk away from his hearts desire the tumbledown woman had turned sour in the late afternoon like a fat black toad basking in the last rays of the sun she sat on the runningboard of the tram greeted parnell with little enthusiasm her withered husband now sat atop the tram and glared menacingly at the horizon an ancient shotgun beneath his arm ignoring his wife and parnell equally parnell sat and bickered with the woman for nearly an hour she would still offer him the fur coat but he wanted an adjustable wrench candles matches and food in exchange for the sledgehammer and these were expensive items in the end parnell gave in and accepted her final offer which was everything he wanted except the food the tumbledown woman hung the sledgehammer in a prominent position within the tram and gave him the items he wanted she turned and looked at him with a bitter eye you crazy piano player man you know that parnell leaning wearily in the doorway of the tram cradling his candles was moved to agree with her i suppose youre right sure im right she answered nodding her head vigorously you a crazy coot must be crazy to come and trade with you he said but the woman just glared at him then he remembered there was a lot of smoke in the south this morning do you know what it was the tumbledown woman grinned and winked at him sure i know didnt i tell you this morning about them vandalmen them vandalmen coming all over this town now last week burn down ol man edmonds and his books now its that picture place sure crazy them vandalmen and she puttered around the tram arranging and rearranging her goods parnells heart sank a little more the art gallery yeah thats what i hear limpin jack he been south this morning he told me them vandalmen dont like them books or them pictures no way parnells anger warmed within him only to turn into bitter frustration for the lack of an object most of the things he treasured had been destroyed during the crisis now those that were left were going the same way in senseless destruction what do they do it for he protested sitting down in an empty seat to stop himself shaking what point is there in what they do who cares said the woman cant eat them books cant keep warm in them pictures them vandalmen crazy to burn them sure but who cares all right said parnell all right the answers he felt within him would mean nothing to the tumbledown woman all he could do was smother his loss and sorrow hide it away he clenched his jaws and wearily picked up his trades placed them in his bag and stepped out of the tram the tumbledown woman watched him go with a tired disgust her husband sat above glaring glaring at the darkening horizon his gun beneath his arm parnell spent the morning of the next day hunting rats again in the rows of timeshattered houses that still stood in uniform lines to the west of the city after a few hours of vain search he was lucky and found a rabbit warren riddling the soft earth in an overgrown and enclosed back yard he caught two surprised rabbits before the others ran for safety he spent the rest of the morning cleaning and roasting the rabbits and salting their skins in the afternoon he was again within the dark hall beginning the long task of tuning each string of the piano to a perfect pitch had he been a professional tuner he would have been able to proceed with greater speed but he was forced to go at a frustrating creep making trialanderror decisions as he listened to each string hearing it in relation to the others he had tuned listening to the pitch pipes then tightening the string again with his rusty wrench he measured time by the rate at which the smoky candles burned and left again before darkness fell days passed in this way until he could hardly trust his hearing and had to leave off for hours at a time before he could resume every time he emerged from the hall to eat or to let his eyes and ears repair there was smoke somewhere on the horizon there came a day when he was finished when he had tested the piano with scales and simple exercises and was sure the tuning was perfect he knew then that he was afraid to begin afraid to sit down and play a real piece of music on the piano his hands still remembered his favourite pieces but there was a hollow fear in his heart that he would fumble and distort the music in some way he had kept his hands strong and his fingers limber by fighting the aged monster of a piano in his house for all these years but he could not tell whether or not he still retained his skill it had been a long time parnell made his way outside the hall and sat despondent and trembling on the rusty overgrown truck it was early afternoon and for the first time in days there was no smoke to be seen in the sky he ate the last of the rabbit and realized he would have to go hunting the following day he laughed at himself for an old fool gulped water from his bottle lit his candle and hurried back inside the hall trailed by clouds of dust on the stage he had cleared the music stands to one side leaving the grand piano alone and uncluttered now he dusted the polished surface one more time buffed the brass lettering raised the lid lit the candelabra and sat before the keyboard the bats twittered tumultuous applause he bowed his head slightly toward the motheaten velvet of the empty seats and began to play he began with ii beethoven piano sonata opus it flowed it swelled it poured from the strings of that magnificent piano as his hands moved and fell remembering what his brain was unsure of and he knew listening that he had not lost his skill that somehow it had been kept somewhere safe within him sleeping through the years of torment he wove a web of music cast motion and light and harmony into the darkness wrapped himself within its sound and played on and as he played he wept the piece ended he began another and another beethoven mozart and chopin were resurrected the music expanded through the hours a torrent of joy of sorrow and of yearning he was blind and insensate and deaf to all but his music insulated from the outside world by the castle of sound he was building around himself at last parnell stopped his hands throbbing and aching and raised his eyes above the level of the piano standing before him was a vandal in his arms he cradled the sledgehammer parnell had traded to the tumbledown woman there was blood on its head the vandal stood and regarded him contemptuously all the time stroking stroking the shaft of the hammer he carried he was dressed in roughly cured leather and rusted metal around his neck he wore a dozen metal necklaces and chains that dangled on his bare and hairy chestcrosses and swastikas peace symbols and fishes clinking gently against each other he was dirty his hair was greasy and awry and on his forehead was burned a vshaped scar he stank parnell was unable to speak fear had made stone of him and his heart flopped around inside him like a grounded fish the vandal uttered a hoarse giggle enjoying the shock on parnells face hey old man you play real pretty tell me now music man how well do you sing parnells voice was a rustle in his throat i cant the vandal shook his head in mock sorrow thats too bad music man but i tell you youre gonna sing real good when im finished with you real good and loud he shifted the sledgehammer to bring out a long knife it cast fiery gleams about the stage as its edge caught the candlelight parnell felt as though he was about to be sick but insanely his old anger grew in him even in the face of his fear why he asked his voice trembling why do you want to kill me what harm am i doing you the eyes of the vandal narrowed in concentration and fierce humour why why not and the knife flashed yellow at parnells eyes all that you do destroying all the beautiful things the books the pictures parnell was becoming excited in spite of his fear those things are all we have left of our heritage our culture of civilization of mans greatness dont you see youre no more than barbarians killing and burning he stopped as the vandal waved the knife toward him his face losing its mirth youre pretty with your music and pretty with your words but you talk a lot of shit you know what youre pretty culture gave us gave us dirt and fighting and eating each other man youre nice and old pretty man you were old when the murdering and the hunger started me and mine we were just kids then you know how it was for us we had to run and hide so as not to be food for grownups we had to eat dirt and scum to live man thats what your pretty heritage was for us pretty man so dont bullshit me about how great man was cause he aint the vandal was leaning over parnell breathing his foul breath hard into the old mans face parnell grew silent as the vandal drew back and glared and you sitting here in the dark playing that nice musicall you wish is that it was back the way it was well me and mine are making sure that it aint never back that way again now you tell me man what good did that music that culture ever do hey parnells thoughts were tumbling at last he said simply it gave people pleasure thats all the vandal regained his sneer okay music man killing you is gonna give me lots of pleasure but first man its gonna give me real kicks to smash up this pretty music thing in front of you just so you can enjoy it too how about that and turning the vandal hefted the sledgehammer and raised it high above the strings of the grand piano something snapped within parnell he leapt up and grasped at the vandals arms surprised he let the hammer drop parnell clawed at his face the vandal swung out a hairy fist catching parnell a jarring blow on the jaw and almost striking him to the ground but parnells hands were about the vandals throat parnells hands were the only part of him that was not weak and tremblinghands made ironfirm by decades of exercise on the keyboardand his thumbs were digging into the vandals windpipe the youth began to choke and tried vainly to tear parnells hands away but the gnarled fingers were locked in a murderous grip they tightened with hysterical energy for a seemingly endless moment the two hung together in a bizarre embrace then the vandal crumpled to the stage with parnell on top of him throttling the life from him until the vandal was dead parnell let out a choking cry and retched violently over the edge of the stage he crouched on his knees for some time transformed by reaction and horror into a mindless animal eventually he turned around and stared with strange emotion at the body of the vandal outside the hall very faintly he could hear the yells and shouts of the rest of the pack of new barbarians as they burned and looted inside there was only the quiet of death and the soft twittering of the bats he crawled toward the piano where the sledgehammer lay he stood using the hammer as a prop for his trembling legs then took it into his arms with one anguished swing he brought the sledgehammer crashing down into the piano strings the shock jarred his whole body the strings snapped with violent twangs and wood splintered filling the air with jagged sound the candelabra toppling plunged to the floor and went out spilling darkness

the end of the world as we know it after three days and nights on the run during which they slept in thirty sixty and ninetyminute snatches in the backs of large cars and suvs in a hotel lobby in a sporting goods store at one end of a mall they managed to pull ahead of the pack who had been too close from the start and drawn closer than that despite waynes traps all of which were clever and a few ingenious and the least of which thinned the pack by two or three until wayne succeeded in luring them onto the walkway between the foodcourt and the malls front entrance where he detonated something that not only dropped the floor out from beneath the pack but brought the roof down too raining shards of glass like so many economysized guillotinesjackie had wanted to stay and finish the survivors but wayne had declared it was still too dangerous and hauled her out the door cross the bridge too congested with cars for them to take the jeep cherokee wayne had navigated up the surprisingly empty stretch of route between the mall and the midhudson bridge which had made them debate the pros and cons of continuing north along this side of the hudson until they reached the next bridge which might be clear or might not for once wayne couldnt make up his mind until jackie insisted they might as well cross here as cross anywhere there would be plenty of cars on the other side and if they didnt do something they were going to squander their lead and face the pack on their terms which aside from that first terrible introduction theyd succeeded in avoidingso they abandoned the jeep shouldered the backpacks heavy as ever so much for having rested and the bridge shifting underfoot in the wind that hummed through its cables like a choir warming up wound their way through a labyrinth of vehicles jammed it seemed into every possible configuration their interiors choked with the oversized thickstemmed purple flowers jackie and wayne had found inside the vast majority of vehicles theyd encountered thus far wound around steering wheels gearshifts and pedals the windows talced with violet pollen which made operating the cars a problem they had neither tools or time to solvethere was a pickup whose cab was empty but it was boxed against the railing by a trio of smaller cars as if theyd brought it to bay there set up camp on the other shore on a ledge overlooking the spot where the bridge slotted into the steep hills on the western shore of the hudsonwayne had noticed the shelf of rock as they followed the road up and to the right past another cluster of cars full of purple flowers pointing it out to jackiewhen they reached a place where the ledge was accessible from the road up a steep path blocked by a gate wayne was certain he could open he had steered them towards it even though jackies legs trembled at the prospect of more and harder climbing urging her on murmuring encouragements praise until they had gained the top of the path and wayne had sprung the lock on the gate let them through and snapped the lock closed again behind themjackie had followed him as he picked his way across the rocks littering the shelf no more than fifteen feet at its widest she guesstimated the bridge returning to view and then wayne had held up his hand as if he were some kind of native guide signaling the rest of the safari and said that this would do and were preparing an ambush wayne starting back along the ledge almost as soon as theyd shucked their backpacks taking with him only the bulky black canvas bag that jackie thought of sometimes as his bag of tricks and sometimes as his utility belt and one of the pistols leaving the other guns with her the rifle whose name she couldnt remember but which wayne had been very excited to find in the sporting goods store and the two remaining pistols one of which had come from waynes fathers safe the other from an empty police cruiseryou dont have to cover me hed said but pay attention and she had sitting with her bag propped against the backpacks the rifle resting against the dome of her belly as wayne retraced their route down the hill to the bridge and then out onto it to set up some trap that had occurred to him maybe two if there were time till he was lost to view obscured by the lean of the hill opposite her jackie jacqueline marie disalvo twenty years old five foot six tall as her most likely dead father she didnt know how many pounds anymore since stepping on scales hadnt been at the top of her list of priorities for some time now her hair dark brown long enough not to look short her eyes brown as well her features carefully proportioned once her dead father had described them to her as prim which she hadnt been sure how to take her skin less tanned than she would have expected considering all the time theyd spent outdoors this past month much of it at night true and there had been almost a solid week of rain in the middle of it but still wearing an extralarge mens white cotton tshirt gray sweatpants white cotton athletic socks and knockoff birkenstocks that were comfortable but growing too tight again shoe shopping not a priority when you were running or waddling in her case for your lifefive weeks ago she had been thirtyfive days less pregnant six and a half instead of nearly eight months along her most likely dead doctors favorite euphemism for pregnancy as if carrying a child were an exotic vacation a difference that meant practically speaking a smaller stomach smaller breasts smaller everything smaller her who didnt tire quite so quickly who didnt feel so out of breath all the time who didnt sleep well but better than lately when comfort had taken the last train out who didnt need to stop to pee all the time while wayne stood guard his gun out his eyes sweeping whatever landscape they were in for the inevitable reappearance of the pack sat waiting for wayne wayne anthony miller twenty years old two days younger than jackie in fact she born on the third of july he the fifth six foot three maybe one hundred and seventy pounds not yet grown out of adolescent gangliness his most likely dead mothers term which hed overheard her use at a new years party and which hed confessed to jackie left him feeling betrayed in some fundamental way his hands and feet large hung from long skinny arms and legs that attached to a long skinny torso his hair grown long a light brown that had been blond until his teens framing a broad square face with a small nose narrow eyes and generous mouth he was wearing the same pair of jeans that had seen him through the last month and which were little worse for wear what an ad campaign levis well get you through the end of civilization rated number one in postapocalyptic scenarios with a red plaid shirt open over a gray tshirt emblazoned with batmans black bat emblem and doc martensfive weeks ago he had been working at the barnes and noble just south of the bridge on the other side of the river and spending more of each paycheck than he should have at the comic book store in the plaza there his associates degree in liberal arts from dutchess county community college completed the previous semester his future which revolved around dreams of writing one of the batman titles still as he liked to put it a workinprogress this back when the future had extended further forward than the next twelve hours and been somewhat more complex yet also somewhat simpler than trying to locate food and defensible shelter the sun was hot roasting was a better word for it although there was a substantial breeze blowing up from the riverjackie supposed that the exposed rock around her a grayish sharp stuff that she should have been able to name but whose identity apparently lay in that part of her memory marked no longer useful amplified the heat which wasnt completely oppressive soon it would be she would be panting like a dog with it most likely feel the urge to strip down to her underwear but for the moment it radiated through her pleasantly later the better part of two hours what had he been doing out there wayne returned waving to her as he walked off the bridge she waved back long enough to pick up some rope digging it out of his backpack a hefty coil that looked like something a mountain climber might use and that he had been happy to find in a hardware store two weeks ago which jackie hadnt understood since the rope looked pretty heavy and she didnt see the point in either of them taking on any more weight than was absolutely necessaryalready wayne was carrying more than his fair share to compensate for her she didnt want him exhausting himself because of an inability to pass on everything that might prove useful somedayshe hadnt said anything out loud though and the addition of the rope seemed to have made no significant difference to him and return to the bridge where he strung the rope across the road running it back and forth and back and forth between a pair of the bridges support cables weaving a kind of improvised web that jackie thought would slow down the weakest members of the pack for about half a second and that the leader and its hers his companions would be through in no time at all when he was done with his final trap which didnt look any more impressive once it was finished than it had when jackie had realized what it was although there was more of it than she had expected a dozen maybe fifteen strands that wayne had layered according to a design she couldnt discern so that some strands ran a foot or more behind the othersshe hadnt exactly dozed while hed constructed it shed kept her eyes open throughout the process but her mind had wandered as it had so often in the last day and a half to the baby which had gone from what she referred to as its daily calisthenics to complete stillness not moving at all that she could feel and at this stage she could feel a lot for roughly thirtysix hours now which might have been entirely normal for all she knew there was a rather dramatic lack of obstetricians in these parts ha ha and while wayne knew a surprising amount about all sorts of things his expertise tended towards the ultraviolent and not so much the whole miracleoflife end of the spectrumthe best he could do was hear her concerns shrug and tell her not to worry about it advice shed already given herself and that was growing impossible to followshe could feel panic gathering inside her coalescing into a storm that would wash her away in a torrent of tears and screaming because the child inside her was dead she was carrying a dead babyall right to be honest her mind hadnt wandered so much as gone directly to her anxiety and watched it growingthe point was she wasnt sure if wayne had rigged his web with any of the explosives proper and improvised that stuffed his bag of tricks or if he had other plans for his oversized cats cradle he came back and a good thing too because the sun had dipped behind the hill to her back and though the sky overhead was still blue it was that darker blue that would spend the next couple of hours shading steadily darker into that indigo that a month of looking up at the night sky had shown her was the actual color against which the stars shone and while the pack had more than proved their ability to appear at any time of day there was no doubting they preferred to move after the sun was down and although jackie had trained with the pistols had opened up on one of the pack at terrifyingly close range it had scampered off unhurt shed had a single lesson with the rifle whose name was on the tip of her mind with it unloaded and had no faith in her ability to get off more than a single shot if that which was not saying anything about her ability to kill or even hit her target so when wayne tied the final knot in his rope barrier and started up the road relief suffused her and built a fire using wood he collected from the trees along the path up to the ledge a heavy armload that he arranged into a larger fire than she would have thought wise an almost inexplicable lapse of waynes partunless he wanted to be visible if so it was a new strategy for him his previous traps had depended on misdirection on leading the pack into thinking the two of them were someplace they were safely away from which had become increasingly difficult as the pack adapted to waynes tacticsfrankly jackie had been shocked that the mall trap had succeeded as well as it had because it had been so obvious as obvious as any of his early efforts so much so that the pack must have assumed if you could apply such a word to them though they evidently had some process of cognition it couldnt possibly be a setup and so had walked right into the middle of itstrictly speaking there was no need for a fire not yet heat poured up from the ledge and would do so well into the night while the bridges lights a row of flameshaped bulbs tracing the arc of each of the suspension cables had blinked on as the daylight ebbed one of those intermittent events that indexed the random status of what she already was referring to herself as the old worlds machineries their bright glow traversing the spectrum from blue to red and back down to blue again their light sufficient for jackie to read her battered copy of what to expect when youre expecting if she wanted to she didnt she felt vaguely guilty about it but she was too tired andtell the truthafraid of what the book might tell her about the babys stillnesswhen you came right down to it the fire was a beacon and a goad waynes way of thumbing his nose at whatever members of the pack might have survived the mall and guiding them across the bridgeas she reclined against her backpack and accepted the peanut butter bagel wayne passed her jackie thought this really is it our last stand after four weeks were making our stand they ate dinner in silence the way they did practically everything in silence the last week or soformerly wayne had been a talker of epic proportions the kind of person you dont start a conversation with unless youve got say three days to spare which jackie had found mostly charming because a lot of what he had to say was funny and interesting and if she rolled her eyes it was only when he started talking about whatever comic book he was currently infatuated with which he could and would do in microscopic mindnumbing detailcomics never had interested her the secret exploits of men playing dressup in what was essentially a consequencefree arena just hadnt appealed although the length and depth of description and analysis wayne lavished on them prompted her to secondguess herself once in a while now she wished she had read some of the titles wayne had rhapsodized about the dark knight returns and batman year one but not the dark knight strikes again that was so much overpriced crap and the sandman and johnny the homicidal maniac whose title she wished she found funnier or at least paid better attention to his lectures on them because they might have helped her understand what had happened to wayne in the last month since the bottom had dropped out of the world the least manifestation of which was the drying up of the torrent of words that poured from his mouth and the most dramatic example of which was was crazy then cleaned the guns one at a time wayne stripping each of the pistols in turn while jackie trained the rifle on the rope barrier then the rifle as jackie aimed the policemans automaticshe could have broken each of the weapons down cleaned and greased them herself wayne had insisted she learn in case anything happened to him which was a joke did he really imagine that at this stage big and awkward as she was shed get anywhere without him it was almost funny the hugely pregnant woman a smoking gun in either hand fighting off the pack but the thick smell of the grease nauseated her so she stood reclined actually guard and let wayne do things the way he notsosecretly wanted to and settled down for the night to wait and sleep him taking the first watch her the secondafter shed unrolled her sleeping bag and used her feet to push off her sandals she looked at wayne sitting on the other side of the fire to which hed added even more wood keeping it hot and bright and asked when will they be here to which wayne answered hard to tell if were lucky late morning early afternoon which surprised her ambush or not last stand or not she would have expected that if the pack hadnt put in an appearance by first light maybe a little later the two of them would abandon their position which for all its advantages in terms of height control the high ground how often had wayne repeated that was a deadend if the pack made it through whatever wayne had prepared for them on the bridge not to mention his improvised web and surged up the road till they reached the path to the ledge she and wayne would be trapped violating another of his mantras always have a way out better she thought to keep their options open and retreat trust waynes ingenuity to thin the pack furtherall of which she said to him and none of which made a difference this is our best chance he said and while she argued appealing to her mantra he who fights and runs away lives to fight another day wayne was unmovable and anyway her eyelids were sliding down so she abandoned her argument until daylight and slid into her sleeping bag jackies sleep was light troubled because sleeping soundly was impossible at this stage of pregnancy not on a rock shelf in a sleeping bag at least and because her dreams were vivid and disturbing no surprise so what to expect assured her pregnant women were subject to all kinds of anxiety dreams a tendency compounded on her part by the last months events the long struggle to keep on the move and ahead of the pack which had given her unconscious a whole new vocabulary of unease and terror she was on that stretch of route where all the cars two three dozen had come to a halt pretty much simultaneously with the exception of a black suv that had crumpled the trunk of the red sedan in front of itshe and wayne peering through the cars windows at their interiors every one crowded by purple flowers anywhere from one to four per vehicle stalks thick and twisting as snakes blossoms the size of sunflowers a kind of plant shed never seen and while she was no expert botany was a hobbyeach flower an accumulation of overlapping petals vaguely roselike except that each petal was four to six inches long edges ragged almost serrated and a uniform eggplant hue the flowers centers obscured by clusters of closed petals that suggested mouths pursed for a kiss an effect she found sufficiently unsettling to drop her eyes to the stems parsleygreen woody covered in coarse hairs fanshaped leaves tiny almost vestigialjackie had studied the plants looped around steering wheels gearshifts headrests door handles pedals one another through windows dusted with violet pollen each car a separate terrarium thinking that none of this made any sense there was no way for this size of plant to survive in this kind of environment deprived as far as she could see of food and waterbefore wayne could stop her she had grabbed the door handle of the car she was standing next to so she could open it and take a cutting from the flower whose blossom pressed against the window like a childs face peering out but the stem held the door closed with surprising force so that the best she could manage was opening the door a crack not enough to reach the plant just sufficient for a small cloud of pollen to puff outthen wayne was there pulling her back from the car onto the shoulder though not before shed inhaled some of the pollen filling her nose with the astringent smell of lavender which lingered for the rest of the day despite the fit of violent sneezing it precipitatedshe had been annoyed at wayne not only for being so patronizing but for reminding her that there wasnt much point in her taking a cuttingwhat was she going to do with it she could put it under a microscope if they could find one and then what she was a college junior majoring in biology and minoring in psych about the best shed be able to do if she could study a slide of a purple flower would be to identify it as a plantit wasnt as if shed be able to offer any insight into their situationshe had stalked away from him as best she could and answered his regular questions of how she was feeling with the same monosyllable fine which was pretty much true except for the lavender smell but that night shed had dreams in which she was driving and her skin which was incredibly itchy so much so that she was finding it difficult to concentrate on the road began to crumble beneath her fingertips becoming powdery dusty and suddenly all of her was on the verge of coming apartfor a moment she was aware of her entire body drying loosening streams of dust pouring from her hands her chin her fingers raining down over the steering wheel her body dissolving against the seat her feet reducing to powder in her shoesshe had time for the panicked thought that she couldnt breathe then that didnt matter anymore and she collapsedand woke with heart pounding the baby kicking in response to her excitement but that was fine fine because it meant she was still here still in her bodyfor a good half hour she ran her hands back and forth over her skin reassuring herself with every pimple every blemish every strand of unwashed hair that she was whole not coming apartwayne must have noticed but he remained silent and another week would elapse before jackie had gained sufficient distance from the dream and its sensations to narrate it to himbut to her surprise he didnt have an interpretation ready just grunted and didnt refer to it again that dream sliding into one in which she was in her parents den with glenn who was drunk again still hed brought the bottle of gin and the bottle of tonic out beside the couch so he wouldnt have to travel so far to refill his glass along with a bucket of ice from which he scooped halfmelted cubes to deposit in his drink when it became too warmthe end of the world or something close and hed spent pretty much all of it submerged in alcohol because who was going to tell him not to her parents hadnt returned from the trip to shop rite that shouldnt have taken them more than two hours three at most and that theyd left for twentytwo no twentyfour hours before kissing her and ignoring glenn as they had ever since theyd learned the news of her pregnancy promising to be back soon a promise something had prevented them from keeping which had her nervous but not as upset as she should have been she wasnt done thinking they might yet appear despite what the tv had shown before the channels started blinking off whatever horror theyd been covering replaced by the tranquility of an electric blue screenwhen jackie climbed the stairs to the living room and looked out its picture window all she saw was their slice of neighborhood the same as ever no fires no riots no people dying from whatever it was was boiling the flesh off their bones which had spread faster than the pundits ability to hypothesize explanations for it a new strain of bird flu had given way to a bioweapon some kind of mutated smallpox which was more plausible given its unbelievable virulence but if so whoever had released it had miscalculated because it had taken the planet in its grip in all of three daysterrorism had been supplemented by other more fanciful explanations rampant nanotech set free during the mishap at that plant in albany the week before an alien virus imported by one of the meteors that had streaked across the sky a few nights ago and of course the wrath of god and never mind that global events bore little to no resemblance to what was described in the book of revelation the preachers who insisted on this answer had been so practiced at adapting biblical texts to their own ends it was no surprise they should be able to do the same in this case and what about those other pictures she and glenn had seen almost lost in the rush of things falling apart that couldnt have been the shadow of something walking falling across that building in chicago could it the thought was absurd it would have had to be impossibly tallbut what had collided with air force one those hadnt been wings had they equally ridiculous you couldnt have a bird that sizeshe gazed out the window and saw movement a car speeding up the roadfor a second she was sure it was her parents back from their trip at last then she realized it wasnt their subaru but a smaller car a white geo metro waynes car which none of them ever stopped teasing him about its engine straining as it raced along and as she watched it she was aware of something hovering over her some badness preparing to fall on her and take her into its jagged gullet and there was the opportunity for her to think stay away keep driving before tires screaming wayne turned the car into her driveway fishtailing halfonto the lawn spraying chunks of dirt and grassleaving the car running he fell out of it and sprinted to the front door hammering on it with both hands shouting her name from a throat already worn hoarseshe remained where she was hoping wayne would race back to his undersized car and take away whatever catastrophe attended him until she heard glenns slurred insistence that he was coming for christs sake keep your shirt on so she crossed to the door which wayne had not stopped pounding on fully intending to tell him to leave whatever it was it wasnt their problem amazing to think that she could so completely turn her back on wayne whom shed described as her best guy friend after glenn of course for years but the instant she turned the lock the door leapt open and wayne was inside the house shouting that she had to leave now there was no timejackie registered his smell first a heavy blend of copper and alkali blood and fear she realized as she took in his clothes plastered and clotted with blood and other things was that a piece of bone that pink clumpthis was already bad and finally his words resolved themselves into sense and she placed her hand on his arm wincing at the blood still fresh to the touch what had happened to him telling him to relax calm down it was all right but none of her reassurances reached him he kept insisting they had to go and grabbed her by the arm which was when glenn found the top of the stairs and who knew what he saw the guy hed never stopped worrying about the source of his anxieties about their relationship come to carry jackie away at lastshe should have anticipated what came next but despite his macho posturing glenn always had seemed to her fundamentally gentle peaceful still there was nothing like a quart of ginandtonic to put you in touch with your inner linebacker which he proved by barreling across the room catching wayne around the middle and slamming him into the wall with sufficient force to drop them both to the floorwayne kept hold of jackie as long as he could tumbling her backwards onto the couchnow glenn was covered in gore too and raising his fist to pummel wayne who managed to wedge a leg between the two of them and kick glenn off him almost to the top of the stairsjackie her hands pressed over her stomach was shouting for the two of them to stop it this was ridiculous but wayne hadnt liked glenn any more than glenn had him jealous she knew although shed done her best to ignore the reasons fueling that jealousythe two of them rushed together and went down in a tangle of arms and legs grunting and cursing each other and jackie thought great watch mom and dad come home nowthen the picture window exploded inwards and a massive snarling shape was standing in the living room shaking glass off itself the way a dog might shake off watershe screamed feet kicking her away from it right up onto the couchthere was an instant for her to register the sheer size of the thing its bulk it had to stand four feet at the shoulder with a hump that arched its back another foot over that its head big as a thanksgiving turkey its feet the size of diner plates and to think simultaneously whats a hyena doing in upstate new york and this is no hyenabefore it pounced on glenn who had paused arm upraised when the window blew inthe thing caught his extended arm in its blunt jaws and tore it off at the shoulder the crack and snap of bone and rip of sinew combining with the jet of blood and the scream from glenns throat and the growl from the things a bass roar with the shriek of a violin on top of itthe thing held glenns arm dangling from its mouth like a puppy with a chew toy then tossed the arm to one side with a flick of its head and lunged at him while wayne scrambled out of the way his face blank with terror and jackie joined her scream to glenns as the thing bulled him back against the wall and seized his head between its teeth his voice climbing registers she wouldnt have thought possible surely his vocal cords would have to give outshe didnt know how much more she could bearthe thing brought its jaws together there was a pop and crunch like an egg surrendering to the pressure of a hand and glenns scream stopped although jackies continued pouring out her horror at what she was watching at the top of her lungseven when wayne found his feet stumbled across the living room to her right past where the thing was busy feeding almost slipped on a large piece of glass took her hand and started pulling her to the front door which was still open only to stop as a new sound flooded the air a highpitched cacophony like an orchestra out of tune and dark shapes who knew how many twenty thirty more galloped up the road almost to the end of her drivewaywaynes hand trembled in hers as if he were being electrocuted later she would understand that his mind had been on the point of breaking some fundamental motor about to snap its belt and seize upshe was taking in breath for another scream because it was hard to take in enough air for a long scream when you were six and a half months pregnant courtesy of a bottle of jack daniels and the love of her life who had just ended his life at the teeth of of when waynes hand stilled she glanced at his face and what she saw reflected there a change from vacanteyed terror to something else stopped her voicecome on he said pulling her away from the front door across the living room the thing growling and snapping at them and oh my god glenn into the kitchen and the cellar door down the stairs and across the cellar to the oil tank with a stop at her fathers workbench to grab a rag and the box of long wooden matches dad had had on his workbench for as long as she could rememberoverhead the floor thumped and creaked more of the things springing into the housewayne consulted the gauge on top of the oil tank and began unscrewing itthe gauge turned once twice then stuckhe ran back to the workbench for a wrench while above the things whined and growled their claws skittering on the hardwood floorglenn she thought theyre fighting over him over whats left of himwayne had the gauge off a thick petroleum odor filled her nostrils and was dipping the rag into the tank first one half then the otherhe left the rag hanging out of the tank and slid open the box of matchesgo to the outside doors and open them he said selecting three matches but not all the way just enough to scope out the situation in the backyard she did as he instructed unlatching and shouldering up the metal doors that led out of the cellarthe arc of yard she could see was green and tranquilgood wayne said when i say now throw open the doors and run for your neighbors house the yellow one and before she could ask him how he expected someone six and a half months pregnant to do anything that might remotely resemble running he was scraping the first match along the side of the boxit popped into flame and without pause he touched it to the end of the raga tongue of fire licked the rag and she was ten feet across the yard before wayne shouted now behind her her belly and breasts swinging heavily painfully her legs protesting threatening to cramp already her lungs burning not looking back because she didnt want to see the thing that killed her she just prayed it would do so quickly and wayne was beside her slowing his frantic pace to match hers and they were at the edge of the yard when the oil tank blew gutting the house in a yelloworange boom that sent wood and glass spinning across the yard and triggered the gas tank beneath the window and from the sound of it waynes carshe could feel the heat from where she was see the carcasses of she couldnt tell how many of the things sprawled around the houses wreckageglenn she said but wayne was urging her on once she woke saw wayne sitting at the fire and went back to sleep and more dreams they were inside the walkin urgentcare building on route which jackie had insisted they stop at for medical supplies and because they needed to attend to the slash zigzagging up waynes forearm which shed bound to the best of her ability but was worried was becoming septic the skin around the black scab was yellow going to green and the wound gave off a sweet smell that made her want to gagat the very least she wanted to locate a blisterpack of zithromax for him at most if she could locate proper tools debride it the advantage of having had a nurse mother who was a frustrated doctorwayne protested that he was fine but went ahead of her through the building a gun held in either hand arms outstretchedjackie had not yet decided she should be carrying a firearm too so she held the oversized flashlight theyd taken from her neighbors house like a club there was sufficient light in the corridors for her not to waste the batteries although the fluorescent lights overhead were dark the ceiling opened into skylights at regular intervals which leaked in enough of the gray rainy day outside to permit her and wayne their searchshe wasnt sure what if anything they would encounter in the urgent cares dim interiorshe was reasonably certain they had gained sufficient ground on what she had started referring to as the pack following waynes lead the name no doubt a comic book reference she wasnt plugged into for them not to have to worry about coming facetosnout with one of its snarling constituentsone or more of the strange purple flowers seemed more likely almost all the cars theyd seen on their trek up route had been full of the plants although that was the only place theyd seen them the various stores theyd entered for food clothing and assorted other supplies had been empty shed thought she had caught movement from the corners of her eyes but when shed looked there had been nothingmost likely her nerves tricking herdespite which wayne refused to abandon caution leaping through every open door with both guns pointed ahead then sweeping them to either side as he glanced around the room before calling clear to jackie who found his performance amusing in a way she knew she shouldnt have caution was warranted and wayne had proven his ability a number of times from turning her house into a bomb which had reduced the packs ranks by at minimum a half maybe sixty percent to the previous day when hed lured one of the packs outriders into the walkin freezer at a mcdonalds and trapped it thereit was just there was an element of the performative to waynes actions as if he were seeing himself doing whatever he was doing in the panels of a comic illustrated by one of his favorite artiststhe last week and a halfs events had damaged wayne in ways you didnt need a degree in psych to notice although you would need a postdoc to plumb their depthsshe might be overreacting to the changes hed displayed in his behavior a ruthless fiendishly inventive violence directed principally at their pursuers or she might be misreading his response to the extremity of the past eleven days but she was uncomfortably certain wayne had developed a split in his personality possibly a rough reorganization of his psyche that allowed him access to areas of his self previously roadblocked by norms of upbringing society and religion possibly an entirely separate identityit was as if he were living out one of the scenarios hed read about for years which might be the reason for her impression that unimaginable psychic trauma and continuing horror and anxiety aside on some level wayne was enjoying this the world reshuffled into an arrangement he could deal with more competently and confidently than his previous existence of minimumwage labor and career stagnation each days priorities food sleep and movementin the second exam room they entered they found a locked cabinet that wayne broke open it was stacked with blister packs and bottles of antibiotics and other medications which jackie swept into the plastic shopping bag shed taken from the stopnshop in great handfulsin the third room they found a steel box like an oversized pencil case that was full of scalpels probes and tweezers as well as a dozen bottles of saline and an assortment of gauze bandages and rolls of surgical tapejackpot she said which had been her dead fathers nickname for her until shed turned twelve and refused to answer to it anymore wiping her eyes she choked down nostalgiashe positioned wayne with his arm on the edge of the rooms sink for the blood and had him hold the flashlight with his free handhe wasnt happy about having to put down the guns but in the absence of any better source of light there was no skylight in this room there was no other option he settled for balancing the pistols on the opposite side of the sink and instructing her to duck if anything came through the door which she assured him would not be a problemshe rinsed the scab on his arm with saline to moisten and loosen it and went to work with the scalpel and probe flaking away the crusted blood easing the scalpel under more stubborn patches and levering them off wayne gasping as they tore away once the wound was exposed she used half a bottle of saline to irrigate it washing out assorted pieces of debris in the process and had wayne bring the flashlight in close so that she could study the cut testing it as gently as she could with the probe which made the light quiver abandoning the probe for a pair of needling tweezers she used to pop a pocket of pus and lift a piece of something out of it which she thought was a fragment of one of the packs teeth and which she would have loved the chance to examine in greater detail but which she didnt mention to wayne since hed only remind her that she was a biology student not a worldrenowned scientist who might be able to learn something helpful from the sample after which she rinsed the pus out surveyed the arm one more time was satisfied squeezed a heavy stream of antibiotic cream over the wound and began bandaging itjackie had done her best not to look at waynes face as she was working not wanting her focus to be compromised by the pain she knew shed find twisting its features but with his arm cleaned and tended to the best of her ability not to mention enough drugs to knock out any lingering infection she relaxed and glanced at him smilingto leap back with a shriek at what she saw waynes face gone from the mouth up shrouded in heavy oily blackness as if someone had dumped a can of black paint over his head except that instead of running down his skin this was staying in placejackie backpedaled out of the room into the hall colliding with one of the walls wayne following saying what what is it pointing the flashlight at her then up and down the hall then back to her the glare dazzling reducing him to a silhouette despite which she could see something behind and above him a cloud of blackness billowing out like a cape or a pair of wingsshe held one hand over her stomach the other over her eyes as wayne finally lowered the flashlight beam to the ground still asking what it was what was wrong and when she risked a look at his face it was clear of whatever shed witnessed if it had been there to begin with nor was there anything behind himshe dropped her hands waving his continuing questions away with sorryi just freaked out a response she knew didnt satisfy him but that he was willing to let stand in the interest of maintaining their lead on the packso far as she could tell he didnt suspect shed seen what she hadwhatever it was in the early morning three thirty wayne woke her for the second watch which jackie spent sitting close to the fire died to a heap of embers wrapped in her sleeping bag because the night had turned colder than shed expected colder than any recently forecast of an early winter the rifle whose name she had meant to ask wayne to satisfy her curiosity on the ground beside her although every fifteen minutes or so shed pick it up and sweep the end of the bridge with the telescopic sight waynes rope trap jumping into focus but all she saw were the couple of cars beyond the trap on the bridge whose lights continued their climb up and down the spectrum blue to red to blue againshe checked wayne too asleep so far as she could tell in his sleeping bagher dreaming still clinging to her jackie found herself not for the first time trying to imagine what had happened to him speculating on the tectonic shifts in his psychic geographyhe had refused to narrate what had taken place before he fled to her house whose blood and gore had been spattered over him but she knew that his mother stayed at home and chances were good that his father and younger sister would have been there with her since he wouldnt answer her questions about any of them it seemed likely that they were dead that the pack had burst in on wayne and his family and torn them to pieces in front of himwhich begged the question how had he escaped not to mention where had the pack come from in the first placeshe suspected the answer was some variety of chance dumb luck maybe the pack had come in through the back of waynes house allowing him to run out the front door maybe hed fallen down the basement stairs and been able to sneak out the garage it was possible his father or mother had created a diversion sacrificed themselves to allow him to reach his carkind of trauma combined with another close brush with the pack in the form of the one that had killed glenn must have inaugurated some compensatory process juryrigged the freshly fractured fragments of his mind into an arrangement that would let him survive and yes she was aware that she was describing the unplot of any number of superheroes origins the grievous psychic wound that gives rise to the costumed alterego both answer to and continuing symptom of the trauma but perhaps wayne had reached for that template to keep what was left of his consciousness from flying off in all directionshow she wished shed taken that class in abnormal psych this past semester instead of putting it off for a future that hadnt come although would anything she would have covered in an undergraduate class have equipped her for this and more to the point what was she looking for to understand wayne or to try to cure him which would consist of what exactly returning him to the calm talkative guy shed known half a million years agocould she afford that would that wayne be able to help keep her and her baby safe the way this wayne whom she thought of sometimes as batman and sometimes as the shadow although she mentioned neither name to him who apparently remembered every trick and trap hed read in soldier of fortune and the getting even books had proven he couldthe question was rhetorical though how much safer was she with someone whose personality continued to drift in darker directions or whose secondary personality seemed to be subsuming his first someone who what was the right word possessed was possessed by whatever the oily shadow that had masked his face stretched behind him like a cloak was because however much shed done her best to convince herself that shed undergone some variety of hallucination she knew that wasnt the case she had seen what shed seen which she thought might have been drawn out from wherever it hid by his pain by the stress of having to hold the flashlight on the wound jackie had reopened and picked throughin the two and a half weeks since shed kept on the lookout for it but the closest shed come to seeing it again had been last week when shed awakened from yet another dream of glenns dying scream to see wayne leaning against the wall opposite her an enormous shadow sprawling behind himshed sat up heart jolting only to discover it was a trick of the light she thoughtso far wayne hadnt shown the slightest sign that he knew that she knew although how could she be sure and she wondered if he were even aware of the darkness shadowing himit was funny you would have thought that here now in the country of fundamental things she would have been able to turn to wayne and ask him what was going on and he would be able to answer her as directly but no she couldnt risk alienating him making him feel shed discovered a secret he wished to keep concealed because what would she do if he abandoned herit was like when shed learned definitely that she was pregnant a pale blue plus confirming what her stomach had been telling her for weeks you would have expected the gravity of the situation to have compelled her and glenn her and her parents to talk about what mattered but the opposite had been the case glenn hadnt been able to bring himself to say anything as if he were afraid that putting words to their situation would be an irretrievable admission on his part and so had retreated behind vague assurances and trying to have sex even more since there was no point in worrying about protection now which she had gone along with even if they were in his car in the parking lot of the community college because at least it was contactas for her parents they had refused to follow their initial expressions of dismay and reluctant support with anythingironically it had been glenns father who had gone up one side of them and down the other leaving the two of them in tears before ordering them the hell out of his house and who had called at least once a week demanding to know what was going on who seemed in retrospect the most honest of them all the best able to express his feelingsno the pressure of events didnt make conversation any easier if anything it made significant communication almost exponentially more impossibleall jackie could say with any surety was that waynes shadow was connected to everything else to the plagues the purple flowers the pack which to answer that other begged question she had no explanation for what they were let alone where theyd come from how theyd arrived in upstate new york pretty much overnightin too many ways to count they didnt make sense she had watched enough specials on nature and nova to know that predators this size and activity would require an enormous amount of food which as far as she could tell was not available she and wayne had encountered only a handful of bodies in their travels everyone else she assumed consumed by the virus shed seen melting peoples faces on cnn which must have continued its work right down to the bones although that was another problem hardly enough to sustain even the packs reduced numbers and they certainly didnt appear to have much interest in vegetation though it was possible she supposednor was there much sense in them pursuing her and wayne for as long as they had neither of them would make much of a meal for the pack and surely the animals should have learned to associate following them with pain and deathit was like being caught in one of those zgrade science fiction movies where spectacle and suspense trumped logic and consistency last stand against the pack or somesuch all of them pieces to a jigsaw theyd lost the box toduring the second to last day of the week of rain when the sky had delivered itself with such force it had been impossible to see anything out of the windows of the house theyd sought shelter in whose driveway was occupied by a minivan filled with the largest example of the purple flowers theyd encountered yet and the roof had creaked ominously with each gust of the wind she and wayne had diverted themselves by inventing explanations for what had befallen the world the more fanciful the better god had decided that the apocalypse proposed in revelation wasnt sufficiently au courant and so had pillaged paperback thrillers for something with more panache monsters had broken through from the other side of the mirror alices lookingglass land on acid this world had intersected some other dimension another earth or even series of earths each of them radically different and everything had become tangled wayne had coined the term quantum rupture for this scenario the collective unconscious the spiritus mundi had burst disgorging nightmares by the scoreat one point excited by what had felt like the resurgence of the old wayne the one with whom she could talk about anything jackie had tried to verbalize the feeling that had refused to abandon her since the catastrophes had begun that somehow all of this was contingent none of the changes that had contorted the world permanent not yetthe best she could manage to explain the sensation was to compare it to the way shed felt after her best girlfriend elaine brown had been killed by a drunk driver on her way home from her job at dunkin donuts the year before for about a day after her parents had sat her down at the kitchen table to tell her jackie had been absolutely convinced that elaines death was not yet set in stone that there was some way for her to change things if only she could figure out what it wasshed been in shock yes but it was as if that blow to her system had brought her temporarily closer to the machinery of the world allowed her to feel the peeling away of this course of events from other possibilitiesthe sensation she had now was different mostly in terms of magnitude and duration when elaine had been killed it had been like standing next to a small motor a motorcycle say for twentyfour hours or so this was like standing beside railroad tracks while a threeengine freight train rumbled past night and day for weekswayne had named the feeling quantum divergence an awful lot of quanta flying around that day which sounded impressive but didnt really mean what he wanted it toit was jackie said like being able to feel the fates changing the weave of the worldwhatever name you gave her awareness whether it was anything more than a peculiar effect of profound shock a milder version of the transformations that were altering wayne for all she knew it was a welldocumented response to trauma the problem with her conviction of the freight train of events rattling away from alternate scenarios was its utter uselessness after all what could she do about it it wasnt as if she had the ability to reverse events to cause the fates to loosen what theyd woven and start again though secretly she wondered if somewhere there might be a door that would open back to the world shed knownhis attempt at naming it aside wayne hadnt known what to say to her sensation and the conversation had moved on to other topics to the baby and how much longer till jackie was due and what were they going to do when she was ready to give birthat the time shed hoped theyd be able to use the facilities at vassar hospital at which at the rate they were going she projected theyd arrive around the time the baby was about to come and if the pack had been defeated killed by then there would be no reason they couldnt set up camp in it there was a lot to be said for staying in a hospitalbut they had fled up route faster than shed anticipated the pack had proven more wily and evermoredifficult to kill and now they would have to try one of the hospitals in kingston if there were any point to it if the baby were still alive if her body didnt go into labor before then and deliver a stillborn childenough she thought one hand rubbing her stomach in broad circles as if it were a lamp and she summoning the genie be all right she told the baby be all rightfunny how much you could want something that intimidated the hell out of you that you hadnt wanted in the first place but had felt powerless to refuse thank you twelve years of catholic school that had wrenched the wheel from your hands and turned your life onto an unexpected unpaved road talk about quantum divergenceshe remembered the first time shed felt the baby move the first time shed been sure a flutter that had simultaneously freaked her out and thrilled her and which had grown into kicks and jabs and using her bladder as a personal trampolinethe emotion that had grown up in response to her pregnancy had been different than what shed expected there had been none of the treacly sentimentality shed been sure would ooze through her instead what had sprouted in her had been more basic primitive even a deep connection to the child pushing out her belly as if she could feel the umbilicus tying them togetherthe emotion had been supplemented by others anxiety mostly and teary pathos and occasionally profound contentment as solid and heavy as a stonebe all right she told the baby be all right just before dawn the sky filling with light indigo paling to dark blue the faintest stars fading out the pack came their arrival heralded by the blat of a car alarm which she realized wayne must have rigged for exactly this purposein an instant she had hefted the rifle to her cheek and one of the pack leapt into focus she moved the gun back and forth and saw two behind that one and one more bringing up the rear the four of them about ten feet behind the rope barrier making their way slowly placing each platesized foot with care stopping to sniff the road in front of them pausing to study the bridges support cablesthere was enough time for jackie to verify her initial count a second a third time and once she was certain that the four things she saw were the pack that was it there were no others padding along behind them her heart lifted with a fierce joy and she thought four there are four of them we can do this wayne was right we can be free of them finallythey were in rough shape these four it looked as if theyd pulled themselves from the wreckage of the trap at the mall their hides were decorated with cuts slashes burns patches of hair had been torn and scraped away flaps of skin hung down like streamers the one shed focused on first appeared to have something wrong with its left eye which was crusted with dark blood while the one bringing up the rear was trailing its left back leg behind itthat they had survived made them the fittest yes thank you mr darwin but watching their cautious advance jackie was reminded of her grandmothers dog a poodle that had been old when she was a child and had grown steadily more gray more infirm more trembling and tentative each year and if her heart wasnt moved to pity the last four weeks had insured the impossibility of that the association tempered her joyits time to end this she thought and turned to wake wayne who was of course already up and jamming pistols into his jeans slipping the strap of his bagoftricks over his head his face stillhe crouched beside her holding a third pistol out to her in case one of them makes it past me he said as she took it checked the safety and set it on the rock beside herhe reached for her backpack dragged it around for her to lean on take the one to the rear he said and any others that try to escape and before she could answer he was running away from her heading back along the ledgeholding the rifle aloft with her right hand jackie eased herself up and down until she was lying against the backpack then brought the rifle into position fitting the stock against her shoulder anchoring it against the meat to take the kick which wayne had assured her wasnt that badshe looked through the sight and there were the pack stopped in their tracks their hackles raised she could hear them a deep bass note like a viol whose strings were frayed out of true and she curled her finger around the trigger ready for them to panic and flee reminding herself to squeeze not pull and wondering if she would be able to hit let alone stop any of themwayne was running down the road toward the bridge his hands empty and when the pack saw him the note they were holding rose to a ragged shriek drowning out whatever wayne was shouting at them taunting them no doubt urging them on and a part of her wondered why that should work why animals would respond to insult and she wondered if they werent animals but wasnt sure what such a question implied because she couldnt imagine machines being bothered by waynes provocations which left what people which was ridiculous it was over quickly or so jackie would think afterwardswhile everything was taking place it seemed to occur with agonizing slowness almost a series of tableaux that shifted with each change in the bridges lights violet and wayne was in midrun his mouth open his hands out to either side of him the leader of the packs jaws tightening into a snarl that was strangely close to a grin the others stepping forward blue and wayne was stopped no more than twenty feet from the rope barrier which seen against the pack drawing closer to it seemed fanciful a childs approximation of a more substantial arrangement green and the leader was crouching to jump waynes hands were still empty the rear member of the pack had ceased moving forward and appeared to be considering retreat jackie had its shortened head in the crosshairs yellow and the leader was in the air waynes hands were full of the pistols he was pointing not at the thing hanging suspended before him but the pair behind it the rearguard had turned to bolt jerking its head out of the target showing jackie its neck orange and the leader had struck the web and been caught in it the ropes sagging but holding it up the ends of waynes pistols were flaring white as he emptied them into the middle two members of the pack which lurched forward even as he blew their heads to pieces the remaining thing was in the process of swinging itself around to flee exposing the back of its head to jackies aim and she squeezed the trigger the rifle flashing and cracking and slamming back into her shoulder almost tearing itself out of her hands red and she was struggling the sight back to her face trying to find the last member of the pack before it was too far away hoping for one more shot maybe she could wound it cripple it and wayne could finish it but she couldnt see it it was gone and she swept the sight back and forth and there it was its legs splayed out the front of its head gone shattered and for a moment she was so happy she wanted to shout out loud and then she thought of wayne and searched for him her finger hovering over the trigger orange again and she saw that wayne had abandoned the pistols cast them to either side and was walking towards the last member of the pack which had not succeeded in disentangling itself from waynes rope trap and which twisted and writhed biting the air in its frustration she thought what the hell and aimed for the things chest but yellow and something was wrong the sight was dark she drew back from it blinked and looked through it again green and she saw that wayne was wearing a cape that he was trailed by a length of blackness that billowed behind and to either side of him across which the green light rippled and shimmered blue and wayne was standing in front of the thing his head covered by the same blackness except for his mouth which was saying something to the thing that scrambled to get at him and jackie should have been able to read his lips she had always been good at that but she couldnt believe what she was seeing violet and wayne had reached out arms coated in black seized the last member of the packs jaws and torn its head apart the thing convulsing as blood as dark as whatever it was enshrouded wayne geysered from its neckwithout thinking jackie centered the crosshairs on waynes chest on the darkness that she could swear was undulating across it that god help her was twitching towards the blood misting the air and time became a room she could walk around in sorting out the multitude of voices screaming in her head one of them shouting what the fuck and another what are you doing and a third how are you going to survive without him a fourth you owe him and a fifth what is heher finger light on the trigger if she were going to do this it had to be now in another second wayne would notice what she was doingthen the lights went out on the bridge plunging her view into shadow and the baby chose that moment to kick hard a blow that made her say oof and release the trigger and then whatever wayne had set up on the bridge detonated in a burst of light and sound a brilliant white crump that had her ducking behind the backpack hands over her head the rifle dropped forgottenthe air around her convulsed with the force of it the rock behind her shuddered as the surface of the bridge fell away to the river below support wires snapping like overtightened guitar strings shreds of metal shards of pavement a steering wheel raining around her as the bridge groanedjackie risked a glance and saw it sagging inwards its back broken the forces it had balanced unleashed upon itthe suspension cables trembled the towers leaned towards each other and she was sure the entire structure was going to twist itself asunderthe baby kicked again a onetwo combination and she took what shelter she could behind the backpack while the ledge continued to vibrate and the moan of thousands of tons of metal protesting its end echoed off the hills above her making the baby squirm and she covered her stomach with her hands curling around it as best she could saying it was all right everything was all right and after jackie set out north past another trio of cars offering their floral inhabitants the same view day in day out she was accompanied by wayne who had reappeared while the bridge was not done complaining though it didnt fall its towers canted crazily its cables were too taut at the ends and too slack in the middle and there was no way it was passable but it still joined one shore to the other and who was free of his black what would you call it costumeshe settled for accompaniment awkward but accuratein response to her question he answered that yes that was the end of them but they had better get a move on kingston was a long way off and who knew what this side of the hudson would be likeif he knew that jackie had held him in her sights cradling his life as she cradled the life of the baby who hadnt stopped reminding her of its presence these last hours which meant that maybe she could relax about it or if he suspected the questions that balanced at the very limit of her tongue threatening to burst forth with the slightest provocation or if he guessed that she walked with one hand jammed into the sweat jacket shed tugged on because shed hidden the third pistol there telling him it must have been carried off the ledge by the force of the explosion wayne gave no sign of it by nightfall they had traveled far
