jk rowling the casual vacancy to neil part one a casual vacancy is deemed to have occurred a when a local councillor fails to make his declaration of acceptance of office within the proper time or b when his notice of resignation is received or c on the day of his death charles arnoldbaker local council administration seventh edition sunday barry fairbrother did not want to go out to dinner he had endured a thumping headache for most of the weekend and was struggling to make a deadline for the local newspaper however his wife had been a little stiff and uncommunicative over lunch and barry deduced that his anniversary card had not mitigated the crime of shutting himself away in the study all morning it did not help that he had been writing about krystal whom mary disliked although she pretended otherwise mary i want to take you out to dinner he had lied to break the frost nineteen years kids nineteen years and your mothers never looked lovelier mary had softened and smiled so barry had telephoned the golf club because it was nearby and they were sure of getting a table he tried to give his wife pleasure in little ways because he had come to realize after nearly two decades together how often he disappointed her in the big things it was never intentional they simply had very different notions of what ought to take up most space in life barry and marys four children were past the age of needing a babysitter they were watching television when he said goodbye to them for the last time and only declan the youngest turned to look at him and raised his hand in farewell barrys headache continued to thump behind his ear as he reversed out of the drive and set off through the pretty little town of pagford where they had lived as long as they had been married they drove down church row the steeply sloping street where the most expensive houses stood in all their victorian extravagance and solidity around the corner by the mockgothic church where he had once watched his twin girls perform joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat and across the square where they had a clear view of the dark skeleton of the ruined abbey that dominated the towns skyline set high on a hill melding with the violet sky all barry could think of as he twiddled the steering wheel navigating the familiar turns were the mistakes he was sure he had made rushing to finish the article he had just emailed to the yarvil and district gazette garrulous and engaging in person he found it difficult to carry his personality onto paper the golf club lay a mere four minutes away from the square a little beyond the point where the town petered out in a final wheeze of old cottages barry parked the peoplecarrier outside the club restaurant the birdie and stood for a moment beside the car while mary reapplied her lipstick the cool evening air was pleasant on his face as he watched the contours of the golf course disintegrating into the dusk barry wondered why he kept up his membership he was a bad golfer his swing was erratic and his handicap was high he had so many other calls on his time his head throbbed worse than ever mary switched off the mirror light and closed the passenger side door barry pressed the autolock on the keyring in his hand his wifes high heels clacked on the tarmac the cars locking system beeped and barry wondered whether his nausea might abate once he had eaten then pain such as he had never experienced sliced through his brain like a demolition ball he barely noticed the smarting of his knees as they smacked onto the cold tarmac his skull was awash with fire and blood the agony was excruciating beyond endurance except that endure it he must for oblivion was still a minute away mary screamed and kept screaming several men came running from the bar one of them sprinted back inside the building to see whether either of the clubs retired doctors was present a married couple acquaintances of barry and marys heard the commotion from the restaurant abandoned their starters and hurried outside to see what they could do the husband called on his mobile the ambulance had to come from the neighbouring city of yarvil and it took twentyfive minutes to reach them by the time the pulsing blue light slid over the scene barry was lying motionless and unresponsive on the ground in a pool of his own vomit mary was crouching beside him the knees of her tights ripped clutching his hand sobbing and whispering his name monday i brace yourself said miles mollison standing in the kitchen of one of the big houses in church row he had waited until halfpast six in the morning to make the call it had been a bad night full of long stretches of wakefulness punctuated by snatches of restless sleep at four in the morning he had realized that his wife was awake too and they had talked quietly for a while in the darkness even as they discussed what they had been forced to witness each trying to drive out vague feelings of fright and shock feathery little ripples of excitement had tickled miles insides at the thought of delivering the news to his father he had intended to wait until seven but fear that somebody else might beat him to it had propelled him to the telephone early whats happened boomed howards voice with a slightly tinny edge miles had put him on speakerphone for samanthas benefit mahogany brown in her pale pink dressing gown she had taken advantage of their early waking to apply another handful of selfsun to her fading natural tan the kitchen was full of the mingled smells of instant coffee and synthetic coconut fairbrothers dead collapsed at the golf club last night sam and i were having dinner at the birdie fairbrothers dead roared howard the inflection implied that he had been expecting some dramatic change in the status of barry fairbrother but that even he had not anticipated actual death collapsed in the car park repeated miles good god said howard he wasnt much past forty was he good god miles and samantha listened to howard breathing like a blown horse he was always short of breath in the mornings what was it heart something in his brain they think we went with mary to the hospital and but howard was not paying attention miles and samantha heard him speaking away from his mouthpiece barry fairbrother dead its miles sam and i went in the ambulance miles enunciated clearly with mary and the body samantha noticed how miles second version emphasized what you might call the more commercial aspect of the story samantha did not blame him their reward for enduring the awful experience was the right to tell people about it she did not think she would ever forget it mary wailing barrys eyes still half open above the muzzlelike mask she and miles trying to read the paramedics expression the cramped jolting the dark windows the terror good god said howard for the third time ignoring shirleys soft background questioning his attention all miles he just dropped down dead in the car park yep said miles moment i saw him it was pretty obvious there was nothing to be done it was his first lie and he turned his eyes away from his wife as he told it she remembered his big protective arm around marys shaking shoulders hell be ok hell be ok but after all thought samantha giving miles his due how were you supposed to know one way or the other when they were strapping on masks and shoving in needles it had seemed as though they were trying to save barry and none of them had known for certain that it was no good until the young doctor had walked towards mary at the hospital samantha could still see with awful clarity marys naked petrified face and the expression of the bespectacled sleekhaired young woman in the white coat composed yet a little wary they showed that sort of thing on television dramas all the time but when it actually happened not at all miles was saying gavin was only playing squash with him on thursday and he seemed all right then oh yeah thrashed gavin good god just goes to show you doesnt it just goes to show hang on mum wants a word a clunk and a clatter and shirleys soft voice came on the line what a dreadful shock miles she said are you all right samantha took a clumsy mouthful of coffee it trickled from the corners of her mouth down the sides of her chin and she mopped her face and chest with her sleeve miles had adopted the voice he often used when speaking to his mother deeper than usual a takecommand nothingfazesme voice punchy and nononsense sometimes especially when drunk samantha would imitate miles and shirleys conversations not to worry mummy miles here your little soldier darling you are wonderful so big and brave and clever once or twice lately samantha had done this in front of other people leaving miles cross and defensive though pretending to laugh there had been a row last time in the car going home you went all the way to the hospital with her shirley was saying from the speakerphone no thought samantha we got bored halfway there and asked to be let out least we could do wish we could have done more samantha got up and walked over to the toaster im sure mary was very grateful said shirley samantha crashed the lid of the bread bin and rammed four pieces of bread into the slots miles voice became more natural yeah well once the doctors had told confirmed that he was dead mary wanted colin and tessa wall sam phoned them we waited until they arrived and then we left well it was very lucky for mary that you were there said shirley dad wants another word miles ill put him on speak later speak later samantha mouthed at the kettle waggling her head her distorted reflection was puffy after their sleepless night her chestnutbrown eyes bloodshot in her haste to witness the telling of howard samantha had carelessly rubbed fake tanning lotion into the rims why dont you and sam come over this evening howard was booming no hang on mums reminded me were playing bridge with the bulgens come over tomorrow for dinner bout seven maybe said miles glancing at samantha ill have to see what sams got on she did not indicate whether or not she wanted to go a strange sense of anticlimax filled the kitchen as miles hung up they cant believe it he said as if she hadnt heard everything they ate their toast and drank fresh mugs of coffee in silence some of samanthas irritability lifted as she chewed she remembered how she had woken with a jerk in their dark bedroom in the early hours and had been absurdly relieved and grateful to feel miles beside her big and paunchy smelling of vetiver and old sweat then she imagined telling customers at the shop about how a man had dropped dead in front of her and about the mercy dash to hospital she thought of ways to describe various aspects of the journey and of the climactic scene with the doctor the youth of that selfpossessed woman had made the whole thing seem worse they ought to give the job of breaking the news to someone older then with a further lift of her spirits she recollected that she had an appointment with the champêtre sales rep tomorrow he had been pleasantly flirty on the telephone id better get moving said miles and he drained his coffee mug his eyes on the brightening sky beyond the window he heaved a deep sigh and patted his wife on her shoulder as he passed on the way to the dishwasher with his empty plate and mug christ it puts everything in perspective though doesnt it eh shaking his closecropped greying head he left the kitchen samantha sometimes found miles absurd and increasingly dull every now and then though she enjoyed his pomposity in precisely the same spirit as she liked on formal occasions to wear a hat it was appropriate after all to be solemn and a little worthy this morning she finished her toast and cleared away her breakfast things mentally refining the story she planned to tell her assistant ii barry fairbrothers dead panted ruth price she had almost run up the chilly garden path so as to have a few more minutes with her husband before he left for work she didnt stop in the porch to take off her coat but still muffled and gloved burst into the kitchen where simon and their teenage sons were eating breakfast her husband froze a piece of toast halfway to his lips then lowered it with theatrical slowness the two boys both in school uniform looked from one parent to the other mildly interested an aneurysm they think said ruth still a little breathless as she tweaked off her gloves finger by finger unwinding her scarf and unbuttoning her coat a thin dark woman with heavy mournful eyes the stark blue nurses uniform suited her he collapsed at the golf club sam and miles mollison brought him in and then colin and tessa wall came she darted out to the porch to hang up her things and was back in time to answer simons shouted question whats ananeurysm an aneurysm a burst artery in the brain she flitted over to the kettle switched it on then began to sweep crumbs from the work surface around the toaster talking all the while hell have had a massive cerebral haemorrhage his poor poor wife shes absolutely devastated momentarily stricken ruth gazed out of her kitchen window over the crisp whiteness of her frostcrusted lawn at the abbey across the valley stark and skeletal against the pale pink and grey sky and the panoramic view that was the glory of hilltop house pagford which by night was no more than a cluster of twinkling lights in a dark hollow far below was emerging into chilly sunlight ruth saw none of it her mind was still at the hospital watching mary emerge from the room where barry lay all futile aids to life removed ruth prices pity flowed most freely and sincerely for those whom she believed to be like herself no no no no mary had moaned and that instinctive denial had reverberated inside ruth because she had been afforded a glimpse of herself in an identical situation hardly able to bear the thought she turned to look at simon his lightbrown hair was still thick his frame was almost as wiry as it had been in his twenties and the crinkles at the corners of his eyes were merely attractive but ruths return to nursing after a long break had confronted her anew with the million and one ways the human body could malfunction she had had more detachment when she was young now she realized how lucky they all were to be alive couldnt they do anything for him asked simon couldnt they plug it up he sounded frustrated as though the medical profession had yet again bungled the business by refusing to do the simple and obvious thing andrew thrilled with savage pleasure he had noticed lately that his father had developed a habit of countering his mothers use of medical terms with crude ignorant suggestions cerebral haemorrhage plug it up his mother didnt realize what his father was up to she never did andrew ate his weetabix and burned with hatred it was too late to do anything by the time they got him out to us said ruth dropping teabags into the pot he died in the ambulance right before they arrived bloody hell said simon what was he forty but ruth was distracted paul your hairs completely matted at the back have you brushed it at all she pulled a hairbrush from her handbag and pushed it into her younger sons hand no warning signs or anything asked simon as paul dragged the brush through the thick mop of his hair hed had a bad headache for a couple of days apparently ah said simon chewing toast and he ignored it oh yes he didnt think anything of it simon swallowed goes to show doesnt it he said portentously got to watch yourself thats wise thought andrew with furious contempt thats profound so it was barry fairbrothers own fault his brain had burst open you selfsatisfied fucker andrew told his father loudly inside his own head simon pointed his knife at his elder son and said oh and by the way hes going to be getting a job old pizza face there startled ruth turned from her husband to her son andrews acne stood out livid and shiny from his empurpling cheek as he stared down into his bowl of beige mush yeah said simon lazy little shits going to start earning some money if he wants to smoke he can pay for it out of his own wages no more pocket money andrew wailed ruth you havent been oh yes he has i caught him in the woodshed said simon his expression a distillation of spite andrew no more money from us you want fags you buy em said simon but we said whimpered ruth we said with his exams coming judging by the way he fucked up his mocks well be lucky if he gets any qualifications he can get himself out to mcdonalds early get some experience said simon standing up and pushing in his chair relishing the sight of andrews hanging head the dark pimpled edge of his face because were not supporting you through any resits pal its now or never oh simon said ruth reproachfully what simon took two stamping steps towards his wife ruth shrank back against the sink the pink plastic brush fell out of pauls hand im not going to fund the little fuckers filthy habit fucking cheek of him puffing away in my fucking shed simon hit himself on the chest on the word my the dull thunk made ruth wince i was bringing home a salary when i was that spotty little shits age if he wants fags he can pay for them himself all right all right he had thrust his face to within six inches of ruths yes simon she said very quietly andrews bowels seemed to have become liquid he had made a vow to himself not ten days previously had the moment arrived so soon but his father stepped away from his mother and marched out of the kitchen towards the porch ruth andrew and paul remained quite still they might have promised not to move in his absence did you fill up the tank simon shouted as he always did when she had been working a night shift yes ruth called back striving for brightness for normality the front door rattled and slammed ruth busied herself with the teapot waiting for the billowing atmosphere to shrink back to its usual proportions only when andrew was about to leave the room to clean his teeth did she speak he worries about you andrew about your health like fuck he does the cunt inside his head andrew matched simon obscenity for obscenity inside his head he could take simon in a fair fight aloud to his mother he said yeah right iii evertree crescent was a sickle moon of s bungalows which lay two minutes from pagfords main square in number thirtysix a house tenanted longer than any other in the street shirley mollison sat propped up against her pillows sipping the tea that her husband had brought her the reflection facing her in the mirrored doors of the builtin wardrobe had a misty quality due partly to the fact that she was not wearing glasses and partly to the soft glow cast over the room by her rosepatterned curtains in this flattering hazy light the dimpled pink and white face beneath the short silver hair was cherubic the bedroom was just large enough to accommodate shirleys single bed and howards double crammed together nonidentical twins howards mattress which still bore his prodigious imprint was empty the soft purr and hiss of the shower was audible from where shirley and her rosy reflection sat facing each other savouring the news that seemed still to effervesce in the atmosphere like bubbling champagne barry fairbrother was dead snuffed out cut down no event of national importance no war no stockmarket collapse no terrorist attack could have sparked in shirley the awe the avid interest and feverish speculation that currently consumed her she had hated barry fairbrother shirley and her husband usually as one in all their friendships and enmities had been a little out of step in this howard had sometimes confessed himself entertained by the bearded little man who opposed him so relentlessly across the long scratched tables in pagford church hall but shirley made no distinction between the political and the personal barry had opposed howard in the central quest of his life and this made barry fairbrother her bitter enemy loyalty to her husband was the main but not the only reason for shirleys passionate dislike her instincts about people were finely honed in one direction only like a dog that has been trained to sniff out narcotics she was perennially aquiver to detect condescension and had long detected its reek in the attitudes of barry fairbrother and his cronies on the parish council the fairbrothers of the world assumed that their university education made them better than people like her and howard that their views counted for more well their arrogance had received a nasty blow today fairbrothers sudden death bolstered shirley in the longheld belief that whatever he and his followers might have thought he had been of a lower and weaker order than her husband who in addition to all his other virtues had managed to survive a heart attack seven years previously never for an instant had shirley believed that her howard would die even while he was in the operating theatre howards presence on earth was to shirley a given like sunlight and oxygen she had said as much afterwards when friends and neighbours had spoken of miraculous escapes and how lucky that they had the cardiac unit so nearby in yarvil and how dreadfully worried she must have been i always knew hed pull through shirley had said unruffled and serene i never doubted it and here he was as good as ever and there was fairbrother in the morgue it only went to show in the elation of this early morning shirley was reminded of the day after her son miles had been born she had sat up in bed all those years ago exactly like this with sunlight streaming through the ward window a cup of tea that somebody else had made her in her hands waiting for them to bring in her beautiful new baby boy for feeding birth and death there was the same consciousness of heightened existence and of her own elevated importance the news of barry fairbrothers sudden demise lay in her lap like a fat new baby to be gloated over by all her acquaintances and she would be the fount the source for she was first or nearly so to receive the news none of the delight frothing and fizzing inside shirley had been apparent while howard had been in the room they had merely exchanged the comments proper to sudden death before he had taken himself off to the shower naturally shirley had known as they slid stock words and phrases back and forth between them like beads on an abacus that howard must be as brimful of ecstasy as she was but to express these feelings out loud when the news of the death was still fresh in the air would have been tantamount to dancing naked and shrieking obscenities and howard and shirley were clothed always in an invisible layer of decorum that they never laid aside another happy thought came to shirley she set down her cup and saucer on the bedside table slipped out of bed pulled on her candlewick dressing gown and her glasses and padded down the hall to tap on the bathroom door howard an interrogative noise answered over the steady patter of the shower do you think i should put something on the website about fairbrother good idea he called through the door after a moments consideration excellent idea so she bustled along to the study it had previously been the smallest bedroom in the bungalow long since vacated by their daughter patricia who had gone to london and was rarely mentioned shirley was immensely proud of her skill on the internet she had been to evening classes in yarvil ten years previously where she had been one of the oldest students and the slowest nevertheless she had persevered determined to be the administrator of pagford parish councils exciting new website she logged herself in and brought up the parish councils homepage the brief statement flowed so easily that it was as if her fingers themselves were composing it councillor barry fairbrother it is with great regret that we announce the death of councillor barry fairbrother our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time she read this through carefully hit return and watched the message appear on the message board the queen had lowered the flag on buckingham palace when princess diana had died her majesty occupied a very special position in shirleys interior life contemplating the message on the website she was satisfied and happy that she had done the right thing learning from the best she navigated away from the parish council message board and dropped into her favourite medical website where she painstakingly entered the words brain and death in the search box the suggestions were endless shirley scrolled through the possibilities her mild eyes rolling up and down wondering to which of these deadly conditions some of them unpronounceable she owed her present happiness shirley was a hospital volunteer she had developed quite a little interest in matters medical since starting work at south west general and occasionally offered diagnoses to her friends but there was no concentrating on long words and symptoms this morning her thoughts skittered away to the further dissemination of the news already she was mentally assembling and reshuffling a list of telephone numbers she wondered whether aubrey and julia knew and what they would say and whether howard would let her tell maureen or reserve that pleasure for himself it was all immensely exciting iv andrew price closed the front door of the small white house and followed his younger brother down the steep garden path crunchy with frost that led to the icy metal gate in the hedge and the lane beyond neither boy spared a glance for the familiar view spread out below them the tiny town of pagford cupped in a hollow between three hills one of which was crested with the remains of the twelfthcentury abbey a thin river snaked around the edge of the hill and through town straddled by a toy stone bridge the scene was dull as a flatpainted backdrop to the brothers andrew despised the way that on the rare occasions when the family had guests his father seemed to take credit for it as though he had designed and built the whole thing andrew had lately decided that he would prefer an outlook of asphalt broken windows and graffiti he dreamed of london and of a life that mattered the brothers marched to the end of the lane ambling to a halt on the corner where they met the wider road andrew reached into the hedge groped around for a while then drew out a halffull packet of benson hedges and a slightly damp box of matches after several false starts the heads of the matches crumbling against the strike he succeeded in lighting up two or three deep drags and then the grumbling engine of the school bus broke the stillness andrew carefully knocked out the glowing head of his cigarette and stowed the rest back in the packet the bus was always twothirds full by the time it reached the turning for hilltop house because it had already skirted outlying farms and houses the brothers sat apart as usual each of them taking a double seat and turning to stare out of the window as the bus rumbled and lurched on down into pagford at the foot of their hill was a house that stood in a wedgeshaped garden the four fairbrother children usually waited outside the front gate but there was nobody there today the curtains were all closed andrew wondered whether you usually sat in the dark when somebody died a few weeks previously andrew had got off with niamh fairbrother one of barrys twin daughters at a disco in the school drama hall she had shown a distasteful tendency to shadow his movements for a while afterwards andrews parents were barely acquainted with the fairbrothers simon and ruth had hardly any friends but they seemed to have had a tepid liking for barry who had managed the minuscule branch of the only bank still present in pagford fairbrothers name had cropped up a lot in connection with such things as the parish council town hall theatricals and the church fun run these were things in which andrew had no interest and from which his parents held themselves aloof excepting the occasional sponsorship form or raffle ticket as the bus turned left and trundled down church row past the spacious victorian houses ranged in descending tiers andrew indulged in a little fantasy in which his father dropped dead gunned down by an invisible sniper andrew visualized himself patting his sobbing mother on the back while he telephoned the undertaker he had a cigarette in his mouth as he ordered the cheapest coffin the three jawandas jaswant sukhvinder and rajpal got on the bus at the bottom of church row andrew had carefully chosen a seat with an empty place in front of it and he willed sukhvinder to sit in front of him not for her own sake andrews best friend fats referred to her as tnt short for tits n tash but because she so often chose to sit beside sukhvinder and whether because his telepathic promptings were particularly powerful this morning or not sukhvinder did indeed choose the seat in front jubilant andrew stared unseeing at the grimy window and clutched his school bag more closely to him to conceal the erection brought on by the heavy vibration of the bus anticipation mounted with every fresh pitch and heave as the cumbersome vehicle edged its way through the narrow streets around the tight corner into the village square and towards the corner of her road andrew had never experienced this intensity of interest in any girl she was newly arrived an odd time to change schools the spring term of the gcse year her name was gaia and that was fitting because he had never heard it before and she was something entirely new she had walked onto the bus one morning like a simple statement of the sublime heights to which nature could reach and sat herself down two seats in front of him while he sat transfixed by the perfection of her shoulders and the back of her head she would be here any minute and if she sat beside square and sulky sukhvinder as she so often did she would be close enough to smell the nicotine on him he liked to see inanimate objects react to her body liked to see the bus seat give a little as she dropped her weight into it and that coppergold mass of hair curve against the steel bar at the top the bus driver slowed and andrew turned his face away from the door pretending to be lost in contemplation he would look around when she got on as if he had only just realized that they had stopped he would make eye contact possibly nod he waited to hear the doors open but the soft throb of the engine was not interrupted by the familiar grind and thump andrew glanced around and saw nothing but short shabby little hope street two lines of small terraced houses the bus driver was leaning over to make sure she was not coming andrew wanted to tell him to wait because only the previous week she had burst from one of those little houses and come running up the pavement it had been acceptable to watch because everyone had been watching and the sight of her running had been enough to occupy his thoughts for hours but the driver hauled at the big wheel and the bus set off again andrew returned to his contemplation of the dirty window with an ache in his heart and in his balls v the small terraces in hope street had once been labourers houses gavin hughes was shaving slowly and with unnecessary care in the bathroom of number ten he was so fair and his beard so sparse that the job really only needed to be done twice weekly but the chilly slightly grubby bathroom was the only place of sanctuary if he dawdled in here until eight he could plausibly say he needed to leave for work immediately he dreaded having to talk to kay he had only managed to head off discussion the previous evening by initiating the most prolonged and inventive coupling they had enjoyed since the very earliest days of their relationship kay had responded immediately and with unnerving enthusiasm flicking herself from position to position drawing up her strong stocky legs for him contorting like the slavic acrobat she so closely resembled with her olive skin and very short dark hair too late he had realized that she was taking this uncharacteristic act of assertion as a tacit confession of those things he was determined to avoid saying she had kissed him greedily he had found her wet intrusive kisses erotic when the affair began now he found them vaguely repellent he took a long time to climax his horror at what he had started constantly threatening to deflate his erection even this worked against him she seemed to take his unusual stamina as a display of virtuosity when at last it was over she had cuddled close to him in the darkness and stroked his hair for a while miserably he stared into the void aware that after all his vague plans for loosening the ties he had involuntarily tightened them after she had fallen asleep he had lain with one arm trapped underneath her the damp sheet adhering unpleasantly to his thigh on a mattress lumpy with old springs and wished for the courage to be a bastard to slip away and never return kays bathroom smelt of mould and damp sponges a number of hairs were stuck to the side of the small bath paint was peeling off the walls it needs some work kay had said gavin had been careful not to volunteer any help the things he had not said to her were his talisman and safeguard he strung them together in his mind and checked them off like beads on a rosary he had never said love he had never talked about marriage he had never asked her to move to pagford and yet here she was and somehow she made him feel responsible his face stared back at him from out of the tarnished mirror there were purple shadows under his eyes and his thinning blond hair was wispy and dry the naked bulb overhead lit the weak goaty face with forensic cruelty thirtyfour he thought and i look at least forty he lifted the razor and delicately strafed off those two thick blond hairs that grew either side of his prominent adams apple fists pummelled the bathroom door gavins hand slipped and blood dripped from his thin neck to speckle his clean white shirt your boyfriend came a furious female scream is still in the bathroom and i am going to be late ive finished he shouted the gash stung but what did that matter here was his excuse readymade look what your daughter made me do ill have to go home and change my shirt before work with an almost light heart he grabbed the tie and jacket he had hung over the hook on the back of the door and unlocked it gaia pushed past slammed the door behind her and rammed the lock home out on the tiny landing which was thick with an unpleasant smell of burnt rubber gavin remembered the headboard banging against the wall last night the creaking of the cheap pine bed kays groans and yelps it was easy to forget sometimes that her daughter was in the house he jogged down the carpetless stairs kay had told him of her plans to sand and polish them but he doubted that she would ever do it her flat in london had been shabby and in poor repair in any case he was convinced that she was expecting to move in with him quite soon but he would not allow it that was the final bastion and there if forced he would make his stand what have you done to yourself kay squealed catching sight of the blood on his shirt she was wearing the cheap scarlet kimono that he did not like but which suited her so well gaia banged on the door and made me jump im going to have to go home and change oh but ive made you breakfast she said quickly he realized that the smell of burning rubber was actually scrambled eggs they looked anaemic and overcooked i cant kay ive got to change this shirt ive got an early she was already spooning the congealed mass onto plates five minutes surely you can stay five the mobile phone in his jacket pocket buzzed loudly and he pulled it out wondering whether he would have the nerve to pretend that it was an urgent summons jesus christ he said in unfeigned horror whats the matter barry barry fairbrother hes fuck hes hes dead its from miles jesus christ jesus fucking christ she laid down the wooden spoon whos barry fairbrother i play squash with him hes only fortyfour jesus christ he read the text message again kay watched him confused she knew that miles was gavins partner at the solicitors but had never been introduced to him barry fairbrother was no more than a name to her there came a thunderous banging from the stairs gaia was stamping as she ran eggs she stated at the kitchen door like you make me every morning not and thanks to him with a venomous look at the back of gavins head ive probably missed the bloody bus well if you hadnt spent so long doing your hair kay shouted at the figure of her retreating daughter who did not respond but stormed down the hall her bag bouncing off the walls and slammed the front door behind her kay ive got to go said gavin but look ive got it all ready you could have it before ive got to change my shirt and shit i did barrys will for him ill need to look it out no im sorry ive got to go i cant believe it he added rereading miles text i cant believe it we only played squash on thursday i cant jesus a man had died there was nothing she could say not without putting herself in the wrong he kissed her briefly on her unresponsive mouth and then walked away up the dark narrow hall will i see you ill call you later he shouted over her pretending not to hear gavin hurried across the road to his car gulping the crisp cold air holding the fact of barrys death in his mind like a phial of volatile liquid that he dare not agitate as he turned the key in the ignition he imagined barrys twin daughters crying face down in their bunk beds he had seen them lying like that one above the other each playing on a nintendo ds when he passed the door of their bedroom the very last time he had gone round for dinner the fairbrothers had been the most devoted couple he knew he would never eat at their house again he used to tell barry how lucky he was not so lucky after all someone was coming down the pavement towards him in a panic that it was gaia coming to shout at him or to demand a lift he reversed too hard and hit the car behind him kays old vauxhall corsa the passerby drew level with his window and was revealed to be an emaciated hobbling old woman in carpet slippers sweating gavin swung his steering wheel around and squeezed out of the space as he accelerated he glanced in the rearview mirror and saw gaia letting herself back into kays house he was having difficulty getting enough air into his lungs there was a tight knot in his chest only now did he realize that barry fairbrother had been his best friend vi the school bus had reached the fields the sprawling estate that lay on the outskirts of the city of yarvil dirty grey houses some of them spraypainted with initials and obscenities the occasional boarded window satellite dishes and overgrown grass none of it was any more worthy of andrews sustained attention than the ruined abbey of pagford glittering with frost andrew had once been intrigued and intimidated by the fields but familiarity had long since rendered it all commonplace the pavements swarmed with children and teenagers walking towards school many of them in tshirts despite the cold andrew spotted krystal weedon byword and dirty joke she was bouncing along laughing uproariously in the middle of a mixed group of teenagers multiple earrings swung from each ear and the string of her thong was clearly visible above her lowslung tracksuit bottoms andrew had known her since primary school and she featured in many of the most highly coloured memories of his extreme youth they had jeered at her name but instead of crying as most of the little girls would have done fiveyearold krystal had caught on cackled and shrieked weedon krystal weedon and she had pulled down her pants in the middle of class and pretended to do it he retained a vivid memory of her bare pink vulva it was as though father christmas had popped up in their midst and he remembered miss oates bright red in the face marching krystal from the room by the age of twelve transposed to the comprehensive krystal had become the most welldeveloped girl in their year and had lingered at the back of the class where they were supposed to take their maths worksheets when they had finished and swap them for the next in the series how it had been initiated andrew among the last to finish his maths as ever had no idea but he had reached the plastic boxes of worksheets neatly lined up on top of the cupboards at the back to find rob calder and mark richards taking it in turns to cup and squeeze krystals breasts most of the other boys were looking on electrified their faces hidden from the teacher by their upstanding textbooks while the girls many of them flushed scarlet were pretending not to have seen andrew had realized that half the boys had already had their turn and that he was expected to take his he had both wanted and not wanted to it was not her breasts he feared but the bold challenging look on her face he had been frightened of doing it wrong when the oblivious and ineffectual mr simmonds had looked up at last and said youve been up there for ever krystal get a worksheet and sit down andrew had been almost entirely relieved though they had long since been separated into different sets they were still in the same registration class so andrew knew that krystal was sometimes present often not and that she was in almost constant trouble she knew no fear like the boys who came to school with tattoos they had inked themselves with split lips and cigarettes and stories of clashes with the police of drug taking and easy sex winterdown comprehensive lay just inside yarvil a large ugly triplestoreyed building whose outer shell consisted of windows interspersed with turquoisepainted panels when the bus doors creaked open andrew joined the swelling masses blackblazered and sweatered that were milling across the car park towards the schools two front entrances as he was about to join the bottleneck cramming itself through the double doors he noticed a nissan micra pulling up and detached himself to wait for his best friend tubby tubs tubster flubber wally wallah fatboy fats stuart wall was the most nicknamed boy in school his loping walk his skinniness his thin sallow face overlarge ears and permanently pained expression were distinctive enough but it was his trenchant humour his detachment and poise that set him apart somehow he managed to disassociate himself from everything that might have defined a less resilient character shrugging off the embarrassment of being the son of a ridiculed and unpopular deputy head of having a frumpy overweight guidance teacher as a mother he was preeminently and uniquely himself fats school notable and landmark and even the fielders laughed at his jokes and rarely bothered so coolly and cruelly did he return jibes to laugh at his unfortunate connections fats selfpossession remained total this morning when in full view of the parentfree hordes streaming past he had to struggle out of the nissan alongside not only his mother but his father too who usually travelled to school separately andrew thought again of krystal weedon and her exposed thong as fats loped towards him all right arf said fats fats they moved together into the crowd their school bags slung over their shoulders buffeting the shorter kids in the face creating a small space in their slipstream cubbys been crying said fats as they walked up the teeming stairs say what barry fairbrother dropped dead last night oh yeah i heard said andrew fats gave andrew the sly quizzical look he used when others overreached themselves pretended to know more than they did pretended to be more than they were my mum was at the hospital when they brought him in said andrew nettled she works there remember oh yeah said fats and the slyness was gone well you know how him and cubby were bum chums and cubbys going to announce it not good arf they parted at the top of the stairs for their respective registration rooms most of andrews class was already in their room sitting on desks swinging their legs leaning up against the cupboards at the sides bags lay under chairs talk was always louder and freer than usual on monday mornings because assembly meant an openair walk to the sports hall their registration teacher sat at her desk marking people present as they came in she never bothered to call the register formally it was one of the many small ways in which she attempted to ingratiate herself with them and the class despised her for it krystal arrived as the bell rang for assembly she shouted im here miss from the doorway and swung herself back out again everyone else followed her still talking andrew and fats were reunited at the top of the stairs and were borne by the general flow out of the back doors and across the wide grey tarmacked yard the sports hall smelt of sweat and trainers the din of twelve hundred voraciously talking teenagers echoed off its bleak whitewashed walls a hard industrialgrey and muchstained carpet covered the floor inset with different coloured lines marking out badminton and tennis courts hockey and football pitches the stuff gave vicious burns if you fell on it barelegged but was easier on the backside than bare wood for those who had to sit on it for the duration of wholeschool assembly andrew and fats had attained the dignity of tubularlegged plasticbacked chairs ranged at the rear of the hall for the fifth and sixth years an old wooden lectern stood at the front facing the pupils and beside it sat the headmistress mrs shawcross fats father colin cubby wall walked over to take his place beside her very tall he had a high balding forehead and an immensely imitable walk his arms held rigid by his side bobbing up and down more than was necessary for forward locomotion everyone called him cubby because of his infamous obsession with keeping the cubbyholes on the wall outside his school office in good order the registers went into some of them after they had been marked while others were assigned to specific departments be sure and put it in the right cubbyhole ailsa dont leave it hanging out like that itll fall out of the cubbyhole kevin dont walk over it girl pick it up give it here its meant to be in a cubbyhole all the other teachers called them pigeonholes it was widely assumed that they did this to set themselves apart from cubby move along move along said mr meacher the woodwork teacher to andrew and fats who had left an empty seat between themselves and kevin cooper cubby took his place behind the lectern the pupils did not settle as quickly as they would have done for the headmistress at the precise moment that the last voice died away one of the double doors in the middle of the righthand wall opened and gaia walked in she glanced around the hall andrew permitted himself to watch because half the hall was watching her she was late and unfamiliar and beautiful and it was only cubby talking and walked quickly but not unduly so because she had fats gift of selfpossession around the back of the students andrews head could not revolve to keep watching her but it struck him with a force that made his ears ring that in moving along with fats he had left an empty seat beside him he heard light rapid footsteps coming closer and then she was there she had sat down right next to him she nudged his chair her body moving his his nostrils caught a whisper of perfume the whole of the left side of his body was burning with awareness of her and he was grateful that the cheek nearest her was much less acneridden than the right he had never been this close to her and wondered whether he dared look at her make some sign of recognition but immediately decided he had been paralysed too long and that it was too late to do so naturally scratching his left temple to screen his face he swivelled his eyeballs to glance down at her hands clasped loosely on her lap the nails were short clean and unvarnished there was a plain silver ring on one little finger fats moved his elbow discreetly to put pressure on andrews side lastly cubby said and andrew realized that he had already heard cubby say the word twice and that the quietness in the hall had solidified into silence as all fidgeting ceased and the air became stiff with curiosity glee and unease lastly said cubby again and his voice wobbled out of control i have a very i have a very sad announcement to make mr barry fairbrother who has coached our extremely socksess success successful girls rowing team for the past two years has he choked and passed a hand in front of his eyes died cubby wall was crying in front of everybody his knobbly bald head drooped onto his chest a simultaneous gasp and giggle rolled across the watching crowd and many faces turned towards fats who sat looking sublimely unconcerned a little quizzical but otherwise unmoved died sobbed cubby and the headmistress stood up looking cross died last night a loud squawk rose from somewhere in the middle of the lines of chairs at the back of the hall who laughed roared cubby and the air crackled with delicious tension how dare you what girl laughed who was it mr meacher was already on his feet gesticulating furiously at somebody in the middle of the row just behind andrew and fats andrews chair was buffeted again because gaia had twisted in her seat to watch like everyone else andrews entire body seemed to have become supersensory he could feel the way gaias body was arched towards his if he turned in the opposite direction they would be breast to chest who laughed repeated cubby raising himself absurdly on tiptoe as if he might be able to make out the culprit from where he was standing meacher was mouthing and beckoning feverishly at the person he had singled out for blame who is it mr meacher shouted cubby meacher appeared unwilling to say he was still having difficulty in persuading the guilty party to leave her seat but as cubby began to show alarming signs of leaving the lectern to investigate personally krystal weedon shot to her feet scarlet in the face and started pushing her way along the row you will see me in my office immediately after assembly shouted cubby absolutely disgraceful total lack of respect get out of my sight but krystal stopped at the end of the row stuck up her middle finger at cubby and screamed i din do nothin you prick there was an eruption of excited chatter and laughter the teachers made ineffectual attempts to quell the noise and one or two left their chairs to try and intimidate their own registration classes back into order the double doors swung shut behind krystal and mr meacher settle down shouted the headmistress and a precarious quiet rife with fidgeting and whispers spread over the hall again fats was staring straight ahead and there was for once a forced air to his indifference and a darker tinge to his skin andrew felt gaia fall back into her chair he screwed up his courage glanced left and grinned she smiled right back vii though pagfords delicatessen would not open until nine thirty howard mollison had arrived early he was an extravagantly obese man of sixtyfour a great apron of stomach fell so far down in front of his thighs that most people thought instantly of his penis when they first clapped eyes on him wondering when he had last seen it how he washed it how he managed to perform any of the acts for which a penis is designed partly because his physique set off these trains of thought and partly because of his fine line in banter howard managed to discomfort and disarm in almost equal measure so that customers almost always bought more than they meant to on a first visit to the shop he kept up the patter while he worked one shortfingered hand sliding the meatslicer smoothly backwards and forwards silkyfine slices of ham rippling onto the cellophane held below a wink ever ready in his round blue eyes his chins wobbling with easy laughter howard had devised a costume to wear to work white shirtsleeves a stiff darkgreen canvas apron corduroy trousers and a deerstalker into which he had inserted a number of fishermans flies if the deerstalker had ever been a joke it had long since ceased to be every workday morning he positioned it with unsmiling exactitude on his dense grey curls aided by a small mirror in the staff lavatory it was howards constant pleasure to open up in the mornings he loved moving around the shop while the only sound was that of the softly humming chill cabinets relished bringing it all back to life flicking on the lights pulling up the blinds lifting lids to uncover the treasures of the chilled counter the pale greygreen artichokes the onyxblack olives the dried tomatoes curled like ruby seahorses in their herbflecked oil this morning however his enjoyment was laced with impatience his business partner maureen was already late and like miles earlier howard was afraid that somebody might beat him to the telling of the sensational news because she did not have a mobile phone he paused beside the newly hewn archway in the wall between the delicatessen and the old shoe shop soon to become pagfords newest café and checked the industrialstrength clear plastic that prevented dust from settling in the delicatessen they were planning to have the café open before easter in time to pull in the tourists to the west country for whom howard filled the windows annually with local cider cheese and corn dollies the bell tinkled behind him and he turned his patched and reinforced heart pumping fast from excitement maureen was a slight roundshouldered woman of sixtytwo and the widow of howards original partnerheard the news she frowned at him interrogatively barry fairbrothers dead her mouth fell open no how howard tapped the side of his head something went up here miles was there saw it all happen golf club car park no she said again stone dead said howard as though there were degrees of deadness and the kind that barry fairbrother had contracted was particularly sordid maureens brightly lipsticked mouth hung slackly as she crossed herself her catholicism always added a picturesque touch to such moments miles was there she croaked he heard the yearning for every detail in her deep exsmokers voice dyou want to put on the kettle mo he could at least prolong her agony for a few minutes she slopped boiling tea over her hand in her haste to return to him they sat together behind the counter on the high wooden stools howard had placed there for slack periods and maureen cooled her burnt hand on a fistful of ice scraped from around the olives together they rattled through the conventional aspects of the tragedy the widow shell be lost she lived for barry the children four teenagers what a burden without a father the relative youth of the dead man he wasnt much older than miles was he and then at last they reached the real point of departure beside which all else was aimless meandering whatll happen maureen asked howard greedily ah said howard well now thats the question isnt it weve got ourselves a casual vacancy mo and it could make all the difference weve got a asked maureen frightened that she might have missed something crucial casual vacancy repeated howard what you call it when a council seat becomes vacant through a death proper term he said pedagogically howard was the chair of the parish council and first citizen of pagford the position came with a gilt and enamel chain of office now reposing in the tiny safe that he and shirley had had installed at the bottom of their fitted wardrobes if only pagford district had been granted borough status he would have been able to call himself mayor but even so to all intents and purposes that was what he was shirley had made this perfectly clear on the homepage of the council website where beneath a beaming and florid photograph of howard in his first citizens chain it was stated that he welcomed invitations to attend local civic and business functions just a few weeks previously he had handed out the cycling proficiency certificates at the local primary school howard sipped his tea and said with a smile to take off the sting fairbrother was a bugger mind mo he could be a real bugger oh i know she said i know id have had to have it out with him if hed lived ask shirley he could be an underhand bugger oh i know well well see well see this should be the end of it mind i certainly didnt want to win like this he added with a deep sigh but speaking for the sake of pagford for the community its not all bad howard checked his watch thats nearly halfpast mo they were never late opening up never early closing the business was run with the ritual and regularity of a temple maureen teetered over to unlock the door and pull up the blinds the square was revealed in jerky increments as the blinds went up picturesque and well kept due in large part to the coordinated efforts of those proprietors whose properties faced onto it windowboxes hanging baskets and flower tubs were dotted about planted in mutually agreed colours each year the black canon one of the oldest pubs in england faced mollison and lowe across the square howard strode in and out of the back room fetching long rectangular dishes containing fresh pâtés and laying them with their jewelbright adornments of glistening citrus segments and berries neatly beneath the glass counter puffing a little from exertion coming on top of so much early morning conversation howard set the last of the pâtés down and stood for a little while looking out at the war memorial in the middle of the square pagford was as lovely as ever this morning and howard knew a sublime moment of exultation in the existence both of himself and of the town to which he belonged as he saw it like a pulsing heart he was here to drink it all in the glossy black benches the red and purple flowers the sunlight gilding the top of the stone cross and barry fairbrother was gone it was difficult not to sense a greater design in this sudden rearrangement of what howard saw as the battlefield across which he and barry had faced each other for so long howard said maureen sharply howard a woman was striding across the square a thin blackhaired brownskinned woman in a trench coat who was scowling at her booted feet as she walked dyou think she has she heard whispered maureen i dont know said howard maureen who had still not found time to change into her dr scholls nearly turned an ankle as she backed away from the windows in haste and hurried behind the counter howard walked slowly majestically to occupy the space behind the till like a gunner moving to his post the bell tinkled and dr parminder jawanda pushed open the door of the delicatessen still frowning she did not acknowledge howard or maureen but made her way directly to the shelf of oils maureens eyes followed her with the rapt and unblinking attention of a hawk watching a field mouse morning said howard when parminder approached the counter with a bottle in her hand morning dr jawanda rarely looked him in the eye either at parish council meetings or when they met outside the church hall howard was always amused by her inability to dissemble her dislike it made him jovial extravagantly gallant and courteous not at work today no said parminder rummaging in her purse maureen could not contain herself dreadful news she said in her hoarse cracked voice about barry fairbrother mm said parminder but then what about barry fairbrother repeated maureen what about him parminders birmingham accent was still strong after sixteen years in pagford a deep vertical groove between her eyebrows gave her a perennially intense look sometimes of crossness sometimes of concentration he died said maureen gazing hungrily into the scowling face last night howards just been telling me parminder remained quite still with her hand in her purse then her eyes slid sideways to howard collapsed and died in the golf club car park howard said miles was there saw it happen more seconds passed is this a joke demanded parminder her voice hard and highpitched of course its not a joke said maureen savouring her own outrage whod make a joke like that parminder set down the oil with a bang on the glasstopped counter and walked out of the shop well said maureen in an ecstasy of disapproval is this a joke charming shock said howard wisely watching parminder hurrying back across the square her trench coat flapping behind her shell be as upset as the widow that one mind you itll be interesting he added scratching idly at the overfold of his belly which was often itchy to see what she he left the sentence unfinished but it did not matter maureen knew exactly what he meant both as they watched councillor jawanda disappear around a corner were contemplating the casual vacancy and they saw it not as an empty space but as a magicians pocket full of possibilities viii the old vicarage was the last and grandest of the victorian houses in church row it stood at the very bottom in a big corner garden facing st michael and all saints across the road parminder who had run the last few yards down the street fumbled with the stiff lock on the front door and let herself inside she would not believe it until she heard it from somebody else anybody else but the telephone was already ringing ominously in the kitchen yes its vikram parminders husband was a cardiac surgeon he worked at the south west general hospital in yarvil and he never usually called from work parminder gripped the receiver so tightly that her fingers hurt i only heard by accident it sounds like an aneurysm ive asked huw jeffries to move the pm up the list better for mary to know what it was they could be doing him now right whispered parminder tessa wall was there he told her call tessa yes said parminder all right but when she had hung up she sank down into one of the kitchen chairs and stared out of the window into the back garden without seeing it her fingers pressed to her mouth everything had shattered the fact that it was all still there the walls and the chairs and the childrens pictures on the walls meant nothing every atom of it had been blasted apart and reconstituted in an instant and its appearance of permanence and solidity was laughable it would dissolve at a touch for everything was suddenly tissuethin and friable she had no control over her thoughts they had broken apart too and random fragments of memory surfaced and spun out of sight again dancing with barry at the walls new years party and the silly conversation they had had walking back from the last meeting of the parish council youve got a cowfaced house she had told him cowfaced what does that mean she couldnt settle through the hall then back into the kitchen where she seized the telephone and called tessa wall who did not pick up she must be at work parminder returned trembling to the kitchen chair her grief was so big and wild it terrified her like an evil beast that had erupted from under the floorboards barry little bearded barry her friend her ally it was exactly the way her father had died she had been fifteen and they had come back from town to find him lying facedown on the lawn with the mower beside him the sun hot on the back of his head parminder hated sudden death the long wasting away that so many people feared was a comforting prospect to her time to arrange and organize time to say goodbye her hands were still pressed tightly over her mouth she stared at the grave sweet visage of guru nanak pinned to the cork board vikram did not like the picture whats that doing there i like it she had said defiantly barry dead she tamped down the awful urge to cry with a fierceness that her mother had always deplored especially in the wake of her fathers death when her other daughters and the aunts and cousins were all wailing and beating their breasts and you were his favourite too but parminder kept her unwept tears locked tightly inside where they seemed to undergo an alchemical transformation returning to the outer world as lava slides of rage disgorged periodically at her children and the receptionists at work she could still see howard and maureen behind the counter the one immense the other scrawny and in her minds eye they were looking down at her from a height as they told her that her friend was dead with an almost welcome gush of fury and hatred she thought theyre glad they think theyll win now she jumped up again strode back into the sitting room and took down from the top shelf one volume of the sainchis her brandnew holy book opening it at random she read with no surprise but rather a sense of looking at her own devastated face in a mirror o mind the world is a deep dark pit on every side death casts forward his net ix the room set aside for the guidance department at winterdown comprehensive opened off the school library it had no windows and was lit by a single strip light tessa wall head of guidance and wife of the deputy headmaster entered the room at halfpast ten numb with fatigue and carrying a cup of strong instant coffee that she had brought up from the staff room she was a short stout woman with a plain wide face who cut her own greying hair the blunt fringe was often a little lopsided wore clothes of a homespun crafty variety and liked jewellery of beads and wood todays long skirt might have been made of hessian and she had teamed it with a thick lumpy cardigan in peagreen tessa hardly ever looked at herself in fulllength mirrors and boycotted shops where this was unavoidable she had attempted to soften the guidance rooms resemblance to a cell by pinning up a nepalese hanging she had owned since her student days a rainbow sheet with a bright yellow sun and moon that emitted stylised wavy rays the rest of the bare painted surfaces were covered with a variety of posters that either gave helpful tips on boosting selfesteem or telephone numbers to call for anonymous help on a variety of health and emotional issues the headmistress had made a slightly sarcastic remark about these the last time she had visited the guidance room and if all else fails they call childline i see she had said pointing to the most prominent poster tessa sank into her chair with a low groan took off her wristwatch which pinched and placed it on the desk beside various printed sheets and notes she doubted that progress along the prearranged lines would be possible today she doubted even whether krystal weedon would turn up krystal frequently walked out of school when upset angry or bored she was sometimes apprehended before she reached the gates and frogmarched back inside swearing and shouting at other times she successfully evaded capture and escaped into days of truancy ten forty arrived the bell sounded and tessa waited krystal burst in through the door at ten fiftyone and slammed it behind her she slumped down in front of tessa with her arms folded across her ample bosom her cheap earrings swinging you can tell your usband she said her voice trembling that i never fuckin laughed all right dont swear at me please krystal said tessa i never laughed all right screamed krystal a group of sixthformers carrying folders had arrived in the library they glanced through the glass pane in the door one of them grinned at the sight of the back of krystals head tessa got up and let down the rollerblind over the window then returned to her seat in front of the moon and sun all right krystal why dont you tell me what happened your usband said sumthin abou mister fairbrother right an i couldnt hear what he was saying right so nikki tole me and i couldnt fucking krystal couldnt believe it right an i shouted but i never laughed i never fuck krystal i never laughed all right shouted krystal arms tight across her chest legs twisted together all right krystal tessa was used to the anger of students she saw most often in guidance many of them were devoid of workaday morals they lied misbehaved and cheated routinely and yet their fury when wrongly accused was limitless and genuine tessa thought she recognized this as authentic outrage as opposed to the synthetic kind that krystal was adept at producing in any case the squawk tessa had heard during assembly had struck her at the time as one of shock and dismay rather than amusement tessa had been filled with dread when colin had publicly identified it as laughter i seen cubby krystal i tole your fuckin usband krystal for the last time please do not swear at me i told im i never laughed i told im an hes still gave me fucking detention tears of fury gleamed in the girls heavily pencilled eyes blood had flowed into her face peony pink she glared at tessa poised to run to swear to give tessa the finger too nearly two years of gossamerfine trust laboriously spun between them was stretching on the point of tearing i believe you krystal i believe you didnt laugh but please do not swear at me suddenly stubby fingers were rubbing the smeary eyes tessa pulled a wad of tissues from out of her desk drawer and handed them across to krystal who grabbed them without thanks pressed them to each eye and blew her nose krystals hands were the most touching part of her the fingernails were short and broad untidily painted and all her hand movements were as naive and direct as a small childs tessa waited until krystals snorting breaths had slowed down then she said i can tell youre upset that mr fairbrother has died yer i am said krystal with considerable aggression so tessa had a sudden mental image of barry listening in to this conversation she could see his rueful smile she heard him quite clearly saying bless her heart tessa closed her stinging eyes unable to speak she heard krystal fidget counted slowly to ten and opened her eyes again krystal was staring at her arms still folded flushed and defiantlooking im very sorry about mr fairbrother too said tessa he was an old friend of ours actually thats the reason mr wall is a bit i told im i never krystal please let me finish mr wall is very upset today and thats probably why he why he misinterpreted what you did ill speak to him he wont change his fuck krystal well he won krystal banged the leg of tessas desk with her foot beating out a rapid rhythm tessa removed her elbows from the desk so as not to feel the vibration and said ill speak to mr wall she adopted what she believed was a neutral expression and waited patiently for krystal to come to her krystal sat in truculent silence kicking the table leg swallowing regularly what was wrong with mr fairbrother she said at last they think an artery burst in his brain said tessa why did it he was born with a weakness he didnt know about said tessa tessa knew that krystals familiarity with sudden death was greater than her own people in krystals mothers circle died prematurely with such frequency that they might have been involved in some secret war of which the rest of the world knew nothing krystal had told tessa how when she was six years old she had found the corpse of an unknown young man in her mothers bathroom it had been the catalyst for one of her many removals into the care of her nana cath nana cath loomed large in many of krystals stories about her childhood a strange mixture of saviour and scourge our crewll be fucked now said krystal no it wont said tessa and dont swear krystal please it will said krystal tessa wanted to contradict her but the impulse was squashed by exhaustion krystal was right anyway said a disconnected rational part of tessas brain the rowing eight would be finished nobody except barry could have brought krystal weedon into any group and kept her there she would leave tessa knew it probably krystal knew it herself they sat for a while without speaking and tessa was too tired to find words that might have changed the atmosphere between them she felt shivery exposed skinned to the bone she had been awake for over twentyfour hours samantha mollison had telephoned from the hospital at ten oclock just as tessa was emerging from a long soak in the bath to watch the bbc news she had scrambled back into her clothes while colin made inarticulate noises and blundered into the furniture they had called upstairs to tell their son where they were going then run out to the car colin had driven far too fast into yarvil as though he might bring barry back if he could do the journey in record time outstrip reality and trick it into rearranging itself if you ain gonna talk to me ill go said krystal dont be rude please krystal said tessa im very tired this morning mr wall and i were at the hospital last night with mr fairbrothers wife theyre good friends of ours mary had unravelled completely when she had seen tessa flinging her arms around her burying her face in tessas neck with a dreadful wailing shriek even as tessas own tears began to splatter down marys narrow back she thought quite distinctly that the noise mary was making was called keening the body that tessa had so often envied slim and petite had quaked in her arms barely able to contain the grief it was being asked to bear tessa could not remember miles and samantha leaving she did not know them very well she supposed that they had been glad to go i seen is wife said krystal blonde woman she come to see us race yes said tessa krystal was chewing on the tips of her fingers he were gonna get me talkin to the paper she said abruptly whats that asked tessa confused mr fairbrother wuz he wuz gonna get me interviewed on me own there had once been a piece in the local paper about the winterdown rowing eight coming first in the regional finals krystal whose reading was poor had brought a copy of the paper in to show tessa and tessa had read the article aloud inserting exclamations of delight and admiration it had been the happiest guidance session she had ever known were they going to interview you because of rowing asked tessa the crew again no said krystal other stuff then whens his funeral we dont know yet said tessa krystal gnawed at her nails and tessa could not summon the energy to break the silence that solidified around them x the announcement of barrys death on the parish council website sank with barely a ripple a tiny pebble into the teeming ocean all the same the telephone lines in pagford were busier than usual this monday and little knots of pedestrians kept congregating on the narrow pavements to check in shocked tones the exactness of their information as the news travelled an odd transmutation took place it happened to the signature dotting the files in barrys office and to the emails littering inboxes of his enormous acquaintance which began to take on the pathos of the crumb trail of a lost boy in a forest these rapid scribbles the pixels arranged by fingers henceforth forever still acquired the macabre aspect of husks gavin was already a little repelled by the sight of his dead friends texts on his phone and one of the girls from the rowing eight still crying as she walked back from assembly found a form that barry had signed in her school bag and became almost hysterical the twentythreeyearold journalist at the yarvil and district gazette had no idea that barrys once busy brain was now a heavy handful of spongy tissue on a metal tray in south west general she read through what he had emailed her an hour before his death then called his mobile number but nobody answered barrys phone which he had turned off at marys request before they left for the golf club was sitting silently beside the microwave in the kitchen along with the rest of his personal effects that the hospital had given her to take home nobody had touched them these familiar objects his key fob his phone his worn old wallet seemed like pieces of the dead man himself they might have been his fingers his lungs onwards and outwards the news of barrys death spread radiating halolike from those who had been at the hospital onwards and outwards as far as yarvil reaching those who knew barry only by sight or reputation or by name gradually the facts lost form and focus in some cases they became distorted in places barry himself was lost behind the nature of his ending and he became no more than an eruption of vomit and piss a twitching pile of catastrophe and it seemed incongruous even grotesquely comical that a man should have died so messily at the smug little golf club so it was that simon price who had been one of the first to hear about barrys death in his house on top of the hill overlooking pagford met a rebounding version at the harcourtwalsh printworks in yarvil where he had worked ever since leaving school it was borne to him on the lips of a young gumchewing forklift driver whom simon found skulking beside his office door after a lateafternoon return from the bathroom the boy had not come in the first place to discuss barry at all that thing you said you migh be intrested in he mumbled when he had followed simon into the office and simon had closed the door i cud do it for yeh wednesday if yeh still fancied it yeah said simon sitting himself down at his desk i thought you said it was all ready to go tis but i cant fix up collection till wednesday how much did you say again eighty notes fer cash the boy chewed vigorously simon could hear his saliva working gumchewing was one of simons many pet hates its the proper thing though is it simon demanded not some knockoff piece of crap come straight from the warehouse said the boy shifting his feet and his shoulders real thing still boxed up all right then said simon bring it in wednesday what here the boy rolled his eyes nah not to work mate where dyou live pagford said simon wherebouts in pagford simons aversion to naming his home bordered on the superstitious he not only disliked visitors invaders of his privacy and possible despoilers of his property but he saw hilltop house as inviolate immaculate a world apart from yarvil and the crashing grinding printworks ill come and pick it up after work said simon ignoring the question where are you keeping it the boy did not look happy simon glared at him well id need the cash upfront the forklift driver temporized you get the money when ive got the goods dun work like that mate simon thought he might be developing a headache he could not dislodge the horrible idea implanted by his careless wife that morning that a tiny bomb might tick undetected for ages inside a mans brain the steady clatter and rumble of the printing press beyond the door was surely not good for him its relentless battery might have been thinning his artery walls for years all right he grunted and rolled over in his chair to extract his wallet from his back pocket the boy stepped up to the desk his hand out dyeh live anywhere near pagford golf course he asked as simon counted out tenners into his palm mate o mine was up there las night an saw a bloke drop dead jus fuckin puked an keeled over an died in the car park yeah i heard said simon massaging the last note between his fingers before he passed it over to make sure there were not two stuck together bent councillor he was the bloke who died he was takin backhanders grays was paying him to keep them on as contractors yeah said simon but he was immensely interested barry fairbrother whod have thought it ill get back ter yeh then said the boy shoving the eighty pounds deep into his back pocket and well go an get it wednesday the office door closed simon forgot his headache which was really no more than a twinge in his fascination at the revelation of barry fairbrothers crookedness barry fairbrother so busy and sociable so popular and cheerful and all the time trousering bribes from grays the news did not rock simon as it would have done nearly everybody else who had known barry nor did it diminish barry in his eyes on the contrary he felt an increased respect for the dead man anyone with any brains was working constantly and covertly to grab as much as they could simon knew that he gazed unseeingly at the spreadsheet on his computer screen deaf once more to the grinding of the printworks beyond his dusty window there was no choice but to work from nine to five if you had a family but simon had always known that there were other better ways that a life of ease and plenty dangled over his head like a great bulging piñata which he might smash open if only he had a stick big enough and the knowledge of when to strike simon had the childs belief that the rest of the world exists as staging for their personal drama that destiny hung over him casting clues and signs in his path and he could not help feeling that he had been vouchsafed a sign a celestial wink supernatural tipoffs had accounted for several apparently quixotic decisions in simons past years previously when still a lowly apprentice at the printworks with a mortgage he could barely afford and a newly pregnant wife he had bet one hundred pounds on a wellfavoured grand national runner called ruthies baby which had fallen at the second last shortly after they had bought hilltop house simon had sunk twelve hundred pounds which ruth had been hoping to use for curtains and carpets into a timeshare scheme run by a flash fiddling old acquaintance from yarvil simons investment had vanished with the company director but although he had raged and sworn and kicked his younger son halfway down the stairs for getting in his way he had not contacted the police he had known about certain irregularities in the way the company operated before he put his money there and he foresaw awkward questions set against these calamities though were strokes of luck dodges that worked hunches that paid off and simon gave great weight to these when totalling his score they were the reason that he kept faith with his stars that reinforced him in his belief that the universe had more in store for him than the mugs game of working for a modest salary until he retired or died scams and shortcuts legups and backscratches everyone was at it even as it turned out little barry fairbrother there in his poky office simon price gazed covetously on a vacancy among the ranks of insiders to a place where cash was now trickling down onto an empty chair with no lap waiting to catch it olden days trespassers as against trespassers who in principle must take other peoples premises and their occupiers as they find them charles arnoldbaker local council administration seventh edition i pagford parish council was for its size an impressive force it met once a month in a pretty victorian church hall and attempts to cut its budget annex any of its powers or absorb it into some newfangled unitary authority had been strenuously and successfully resisted for decades of all the local councils under the higher authority of yarvil district council pagford prided itself on being the most obstreperous the most vocal and the most independent until sunday evening it had comprised sixteen local men and women as the towns electorate tended to assume that a wish to serve on the parish council implied competence to do so all sixteen councillors had gained their seats unopposed yet this amicably appointed body was currently in a state of civil war an issue that had been causing fury and resentment in pagford for sixtyodd years had reached a definitive phase and factions had rallied behind two charismatic leaders to grasp fully the cause of the dispute it was necessary to comprehend the precise depth of pagfords dislike and mistrust of the city of yarvil which lay to its north yarvils shops businesses factories and the south west general hospital provided the bulk of the employment in pagford the small towns youths generally spent their saturday nights in yarvils cinemas and nightclubs the city had a cathedral several parks and two enormous shopping centres and these things were pleasant enough to visit if you had sated yourself on pagfords superior charms even so to true pagfordians yarvil was little more than a necessary evil their attitude was symbolized by the high hill topped by pargetter abbey which blocked yarvil from pagfords sight and allowed the townspeople the happy illusion that the city was many miles further away than it truly was ii it so happened that pargetter hill also obscured from the towns view another place but one that pagford had always considered particularly its own this was sweetlove house an exquisite honeycoloured queen anne manor set in many acres of park and farmland it lay within pagford parish halfway between the town and yarvil for nearly two hundred years the house had passed smoothly from generation to generation of aristocratic sweetloves until finally in the early s the family had died out all that remained these days of the sweetloves long association with pagford was the grandest tomb in the churchyard of st michael and all saints and a smattering of crests and initials over local records and buildings like the footprints and coprolites of extinct creatures after the death of the last of the sweetloves the manor house had changed hands with alarming rapidity there were constant fears in pagford that some developer would buy and mutilate the beloved landmark then in the s a man called aubrey fawley purchased the place fawley was soon known to be possessed of substantial private wealth which he supplemented in mysterious ways in the city he had four children and a desire to settle permanently pagfords approval was raised to still giddier heights by the swiftly circulated intelligence that fawley was descended through a collateral line from the sweetloves he was clearly half a local already a man whose natural allegiance would be to pagford and not to yarvil old pagford believed that the advent of aubrey fawley meant the return of a charmed era he would be a fairy godfather to the town like his ancestors before him showering grace and glamour over their cobbled streets howard mollison could still remember his mother bursting into their tiny kitchen in hope street with the news that aubrey had been invited to judge the local flower show her runner beans had taken the vegetable prize three years in a row and she yearned to accept the silverplated rose bowl from a man who was already to her a figure of oldworld romance iii but then so local legend told came the sudden darkness that attends the appearance of the wicked fairy even as pagford was rejoicing that sweetlove house had fallen into such safe hands yarvil was busily constructing a swath of council houses to its south the new streets pagford learned with unease were consuming some of the land that lay between the city and the town everybody knew that there had been an increasing demand for cheap housing since the war but the little town momentarily distracted by aubrey fawleys arrival began to buzz with mistrust of yarvils intentions the natural barriers of river and hill that had once been guarantors of pagfords sovereignty seemed diminished by the speed with which the redbrick houses multiplied yarvil filled every inch of the land at its disposal and stopped at the northern border of pagford parish the town sighed with a relief that was soon revealed to be premature the cantermill estate was immediately judged insufficient to meet the populations needs and the city cast about for more land to colonize it was then that aubrey fawley still more myth than man to the people of pagford made the decision that triggered a festering sixtyyear grudge having no use for the few scrubby fields that lay beyond the new development he sold the land to yarvil council for a good price and used the cash to restore the warped panelling in the hall of sweetlove house pagfords fury was unconfined the sweetlove fields had been an important part of its buttress against the encroaching city now the ancient border of the parish was to be compromised by an overspill of needy yarvilians rowdy town hall meetings seething letters to the newspaper and yarvil council personal remonstrance with those in charge nothing succeeded in reversing the tide the council houses began to advance again but with one difference in the brief hiatus following completion of the first estate the council had realized that it could build more cheaply the fresh eruption was not of red brick but of concrete in steel frames this second estate was known locally as the fields after the land on which it had been built and was marked as distinct from the cantermill estate by its inferior materials and design it was in one of the fields concrete and steel houses already cracking and warping by the late s that barry fairbrother was born iv in spite of yarvil councils bland assurances that maintenance of the new estate would be its own responsibility pagford as the furious townsfolk had predicted from the first was soon landed with new bills while the provision of most services to the fields and the upkeep of its houses fell to yarvil council there remained matters that the city in its lofty way delegated to the parish the maintenance of public footpaths of lighting and public seating of bus shelters and common land graffiti blossomed on the bridges spanning the pagford to yarvil road fields bus shelters were vandalized fields teenagers strewed the play park with beer bottles and threw rocks at the street lamps a local footpath much favoured by tourists and ramblers became a popular spot for fields youths to congregate and worse as howard mollisons mother put it darkly it fell to pagford parish council to clean to repair and to replace and the funds dispersed by yarvil were felt from the first to be inadequate for the time and expense required no part of pagfords unwanted burden caused more fury or bitterness than the fact that fields children now fell inside the catchment area of st thomass church of england primary school young fielders had the right to don the coveted blue and white uniform to play in the yard beside the foundation stone laid by lady charlotte sweetlove and to deafen the tiny classrooms with their strident yarvil accents it swiftly became common lore in pagford that houses in the fields had become the prize and goal of every benefitsupported yarvil family with schoolage children that there was a great ongoing scramble across the boundary line from the cantermill estate much as mexicans streamed into texas their beautiful st thomass a magnet for professional commuters to yarvil who were attracted by the tiny classes the rolltop desks the aged stone building and the lush green playing field would be overrun and swamped by the offspring of scroungers addicts and mothers whose children had all been fathered by different men this nightmarish scenario had never been fully realized because while there were undoubtedly advantages to st thomass there were also drawbacks the need to buy the uniform or else to fill in all the forms required to qualify for assistance for the same the necessity of attaining bus passes and of getting up earlier to ensure that the children arrived at school on time some households in the fields found these onerous obstacles and their children were absorbed instead by the large plainclothes primary school that had been built to serve the cantermill estate most of the fields pupils who came to st thomass blended in well with their peers in pagford some indeed were admitted to be perfectly nice children thus barry fairbrother had moved up through the school a popular and clever class clown only occasionally noticing that the smile of a pagford parent stiffened when he mentioned the place where he lived nevertheless st thomass was sometimes forced to take in a fields pupil of undeniably disruptive nature krystal weedon had been living with her greatgrandmother in hope street when the time came for her to start school so that there was really no way of stopping her coming even though when she moved back to the fields with her mother at the age of eight there were high hopes locally that she would leave st thomass for good krystals slow passage up the school had resembled the passage of a goat through the body of a boa constrictor being highly visible and uncomfortable for both parties concerned not that krystal was always in class for much of her career at st thomass she had been taught oneonone by a special teacher by a malign stroke of fate krystal had been in the same class as howard and shirleys eldest granddaughter lexie krystal had once hit lexie mollison so hard in the face that she had knocked out two of her teeth that they had already been wobbly was not felt by lexies parents and grandparents to be much of an extenuation it was the conviction that whole classes of krystals would be waiting for their daughters at winterdown comprehensive that finally decided miles and samantha mollison on removing both their daughters to st annes the private girls school in yarvil where they had become weekly boarders the fact that his granddaughters had been driven out of their rightful places by krystal weedon swiftly became one of howards favourite conversational examples of the estates nefarious influence on pagford life v the first effusion of pagfords outrage had annealed into a quieter but no less powerful sense of grievance the fields polluted and corrupted a place of peace and beauty and the smouldering townsfolk remained determined to cut the estate adrift yet boundary reviews had come and gone and reforms in local government had swept the area without effecting any change the fields remained part of pagford newcomers to the town learned quickly that abhorrence of the estate was a necessary passport to the goodwill of that hard core of pagfordians who ran everything but now at long last over sixty years after old aubrey fawley had handed yarvil that fatal parcel of land after decades of patient work of strategizing and petitioning of collating information and haranguing subcommittees the antifielders of pagford found themselves at last on the trembling threshold of victory the recession was forcing local authorities to streamline cut and reorganize there were those on the higher body of yarvil district council who foresaw an advantage to their electoral fortunes if the crumbling little estate likely to fare poorly under the austerity measures imposed by the national government were to be scooped up and its disgruntled inhabitants joined to their own voters pagford had its own representative in yarvil district councillor aubrey fawley this was not the man who had enabled the construction of the fields but his son young aubrey who had inherited sweetlove house and who worked through the week as a merchant banker in london there was a whiff of penance in aubreys involvement in local affairs a sense that he ought to make right the wrong that his father had so carelessly done to the little town he and his wife julia donated and gave out prizes at the agricultural show sat on any number of local committees and threw an annual christmas party to which invitations were much coveted it was howards pride and delight to think that he and aubrey were such close allies in the continuing quest to reassign the fields to yarvil because aubrey moved in a higher sphere of commerce that commanded howards fascinated respect every evening after the delicatessen closed howard removed the tray of his oldfashioned till and counted up coins and dirty notes before placing them in a safe aubrey on the other hand never touched money during his office hours and yet he caused it to move in unimaginable quantities across continents he managed it and multiplied it and when the portents were less propitious he watched magisterially as it vanished to howard aubrey had a mystique that not even a worldwide financial crash could dent the delicatessenowner was impatient of anyone who blamed the likes of aubrey for the mess in which the country found itself nobody had complained when things were going well was howards oftrepeated view and he accorded aubrey the respect due to a general injured in an unpopular war meanwhile as a district councillor aubrey was privy to all kinds of interesting statistics and in a position to share a good deal of information with howard about pagfords troublesome satellite the two men knew exactly how much of the districts resources were poured without return or apparent improvement into the fields dilapidated streets that nobody owned their own house in the fields whereas the redbrick houses of the cantermill estate were almost all in private hands these days they had been prettified almost beyond recognition with windowboxes and porches and neat front lawns that nearly twothirds of fieldsdwellers lived entirely off the state and that a sizeable proportion passed through the doors of the bellchapel addiction clinic vi howard carried the mental image of the fields with him always like a memory of a nightmare boarded windows daubed with obscenities smoking teenagers loitering in the perennially defaced bus shelters satellite dishes everywhere turned to the skies like the denuded ovules of grim metal flowers he often asked rhetorically why they could not have organized and made the place over what was stopping the residents from pooling their meagre resources and buying a lawnmower between the lot of them but it never happened the fields waited for the councils district and parish to clean to repair to maintain to give and give and give again howard would then recall the hope street of his boyhood with its tiny back gardens each hardly more than tableclothsized squares of earth but most including his mothers bristling with runner beans and potatoes there was nothing as far as howard could see to stop the fielders growing fresh vegetables nothing to stop them disciplining their sinister hooded spraypainting offspring nothing to stop them pulling themselves together as a community and tackling the dirt and the shabbiness nothing to stop them cleaning themselves up and taking jobs nothing at all so howard was forced to draw the conclusion that they were choosing of their own free will to live the way they lived and that the estates air of slightly threatening degradation was nothing more than a physical manifestation of ignorance and indolence pagford by contrast shone with a kind of moral radiance in howards mind as though the collective soul of the community was made manifest in its cobbled streets its hills its picturesque houses to howard his birthplace was much more than a collection of old buildings and a fastflowing treefringed river the majestic silhouette of the abbey above or the hanging baskets in the square for him the town was an ideal a way of being a microcivilization that stood firmly against a national decline im a pagford man he would tell summertime tourists born and bred in so saying he was giving himself a profound compliment disguised as a commonplace he had been born in pagford and he would die there and he had never dreamed of leaving nor itched for more change of scene than could be had from watching the seasons transform the surrounding woods and river from watching the square blossom in spring or sparkle at christmas barry fairbrother had known all this indeed he had said it he had laughed right across the table in the church hall laughed right in howards face you know howard you are pagford to me and howard not discomposed in the slightest for he had always met barry joke for joke had said ill take that as a great compliment barry however it was intended he could afford to laugh the one remaining ambition of howards life was within touching distance the return of the fields to yarvil seemed imminent and certain then two days before barry fairbrother had dropped dead in a car park howard had learned from an unimpeachable source that his opponent had broken all known rules of engagement and had gone to the local paper with a story about the blessing it had been for krystal weedon to be educated at st thomass the idea of krystal weedon being paraded in front of the reading public as an example of the successful integration of the fields and pagford might so howard said have been funny had it not been so serious doubtless fairbrother would have coached the girl and the truth about her foul mouth the endlessly interrupted classes the other children in tears the constant removals and reintegrations would be lost in lies howard trusted the good sense of his fellow townsfolk but he feared journalistic spin and the interference of ignorant dogooders his objection was both principled and personal he had not yet forgotten how his granddaughter had sobbed in his arms with bloody sockets where her teeth had been while he tried to soothe her with a promise of triple prizes from the tooth fairy tuesday i two mornings after her husbands death mary fairbrother woke at five oclock she had slept in the marital bed with her twelveyearold declan who had crawled in sobbing shortly after midnight he was sound asleep now so mary crept out of the room and went down into the kitchen to cry more freely every hour that passed added to her grief because it bore her further away from the living man and because it was a tiny foretaste of the eternity she would have to spend without him again and again she found herself forgetting for the space of a heartbeat that he was gone for ever and that she could not turn to him for comfort when her sister and brotherinlaw came through to make breakfast mary took barrys phone and withdrew into the study where she started looking for the numbers of some of barrys huge acquaintance she had only been at it a matter of minutes when the mobile in her hands rang yes she murmured oh hello im looking for barry fairbrother alison jenkins from the yarvil and district gazette the young womans jaunty voice was as loud and horrible in marys ear as a triumphal fanfare the blast of it obliterated the sense of the words sorry alison jenkins from the yarvil and district gazette i want to speak to barry fairbrother its about his article on the fields oh said mary yes he hasnt attached details of this girl he talks about were supposed to interview her krystal weedon each word felt to mary like a slap perversely she sat still and silent in barrys old swivel chair and let the blows rain upon her can you hear me yes said mary her voice cracking i can hear you i know mr fairbrother was very keen to be present when we interview krystal but times running he wont be able to be present said mary her voice eliding into a screech he wont be able to talk about the bloody fields any more or about anything ever again what said the girl on the end of the line my husband is dead all right hes dead so the fields will have to get on without him wont they marys hands were shaking so much that the mobile slipped through her fingers and for the few moments before she managed to cut the call she knew that the journalist heard her ragged sobs then she remembered that most of barrys last day on earth and their wedding anniversary had been given over to his obsession with the fields and krystal weedon fury erupted and she threw the mobile so hard across the room that it hit a framed picture of their four children knocking it to the floor she began to scream and cry at once and her sister and brotherinlaw both came running upstairs and burst into the room all they could get out of her at first was the fields the bloody bloody fields its where me and barry grew up her brotherinlaw muttered but he explained no further for fear of inflaming marys hysteria ii social worker kay bawden and her daughter gaia had moved from london only four weeks previously and were pagfords very newest inhabitants kay was unfamiliar with the contentious history of the fields it was simply the estate where many of her clients lived all she knew about barry fairbrother was that his death had precipitated the miserable scene in her kitchen when her lover gavin had fled from her and her scrambled eggs and so dashed all the hopes his lovemaking had roused in her kay spent tuesday lunchtime in a layby between pagford and yarvil eating a sandwich in her car and reading a large stack of notes one of her colleagues had been signed off work due to stress with the immediate result that kay had been lumbered with a third of her cases shortly before one oclock she set off for the fields she had already visited the estate several times but she was not yet familiar with the warrenlike streets at last she found foley road and identified from a distance the house that she thought must belong to the weedons the file had made it clear what she was likely to meet and her first glimpse of the house met her expectations a pile of refuse was heaped against the front wall carrier bags bulging with filth jumbled together with old clothes and unbagged soiled nappies bits of the rubbish had tumbled or been scattered over the scrubby patch of lawn but the bulk of it remained piled beneath one of the two downstairs windows a bald old tyre sat in the middle of the lawn it had been shifted some time recently because a foot away there was a flattened yellowishbrown circle of dead grass after ringing the doorbell kay noticed a used condom glistening in the grass beside her feet like the gossamer cocoon of some huge grub she was experiencing that slight apprehension that she had never quite overcome although it was nothing compared to the nerves with which she had faced unknown doors in the early days then in spite of all her training in spite of the fact that a colleague usually accompanied her she had on occasion been truly afraid dangerous dogs men brandishing knives children with grotesque injuries she had found them all and worse in her years of entering strangers houses nobody came in answer to the bell but she could hear a small child grizzling through the groundfloor window on her left which was ajar she tried rapping on the door instead and a tiny flake of peeling cream paint fell off and landed on the toe of her shoe it reminded her of the state of her own new home it would have been nice if gavin had offered to help with some of her redecorating but he had said not a word sometimes kay counted over the things that he had not said or done like a miser looking through ious and felt bitter and angry and determined to extract repayment she knocked again sooner than she would have done if she had not wanted to distract herself from her own thoughts and this time a distant voice said im fuckin comin the door swung open to reveal a woman who appeared simultaneously childlike and ancient dressed in a dirty paleblue tshirt and a pair of mens pyjama bottoms she was the same height as kay but shrunken the bones of her face and sternum showed sharply through the thin white skin her hair which was homedyed coarse and very red looked like a wig on top of a skull her pupils were minuscule and her chest virtually breastless hello are you terri im kay bawden from social services im covering for mattie knox there were silvery pockmarks all over the womans fragile greywhite arms and an angry red open sore on the inside of one forearm a wide area of scar tissue on her right arm and lower neck gave the skin a shiny plastic appearance kay had known an addict in london who had accidentally set fire to her house and realized too late what was happening yeah righ said terri after an overlong pause when she spoke she seemed much older several of her teeth were missing she turned her back on kay and took a few unsteady steps down the dark hallway kay followed the house smelt of stale food of sweat of unshifted filth terri led kay through the first door on the left into a tiny sitting room there were no books no pictures no photographs no television nothing except a pair of filthy old armchairs and a broken set of shelves debris littered the floor a pile of brandnew cardboard boxes piled against the wall struck an incongruous note a barelegged little boy was standing in the middle of the floor dressed in a tshirt and a bulging pullup nappy kay knew from the file that he was three and a half his whining seemed unconscious and unmotivated a sort of engine noise to signal that he was there he was clutching a miniature cereal packet so this must be robbie said kay the boy looked at her when she said his name but kept grizzling terri shoved aside a scratched old biscuit tin which had been sitting on one of the dirty frayed armchairs and curled herself into the seat watching kay from beneath drooping eyelids kay took the other chair on the arm of which was perched an overflowing ashtray cigarette ends had fallen into the seat of kays chair she could feel them beneath her thighs hello robbie said kay opening terris file the little boy continued to whine shaking the cereal packet something inside it rattled what have you got in there kay asked he did not answer but shook the packet more vigorously a small plastic figure flew out of it soared in an arc and fell down behind the cardboard boxes robbie began to wail kay watched terri who was staring at her son blankfaced eventually terri murmured sup robbie shall we see if we can get it out said kay quite glad of a reason to stand up and brush down the back of her legs lets have a look she put her head close to the wall to look into the gap behind the boxes the little figure was wedged near the top she forced her hand into the gap the boxes were heavy and difficult to move kay managed to grasp the model which once she had it in her hand she saw to be a squat fat buddhalike man bright purple all over here you are she said robbies wailing ceased he took the figure and put it back inside the cereal packet which he started to shake again kay glanced around two small toy cars lay upside down under the broken shelves do you like cars kay asked robbie pointing at them he did not follow the direction of her finger but squinted at her with a mixture of calculation and curiosity then he trotted off and picked up a car and held it up for her to see broom he said ca thats right said kay very good car broom broom she sat back down and took her notepad out of her bag so terri how have things been going there was a pause before terri said all righ just to explain mattie has been signed off sick so im covering for her ill need to go over some of the information shes left me to check that nothings changed since she saw you last week all right so lets see robbie is in nursery now isnt he four mornings a week and two afternoons kays voice seemed to reach terri only distantly it was like talking to somebody sitting at the bottom of a well yeah she said after a pause hows that going is he enjoying it robbie crammed the matchbox car into the cereal box he picked up one of the cigarette butts that had fallen off kays trousers and squashed it on top of the car and the purple buddha yeah said terri drowsily but kay was poring over the last of the untidy notes mattie had left before she had been signed off shouldnt he be there today terri isnt tuesday one of the days he goes terri seemed to be fighting a desire to sleep once or twice her head rocked a little on her shoulders finally she said krystal was sposed to drop him and she never krystal is your daughter isnt she how old is she fourteen said terri dreamily na half kay could see from her notes that krystal was sixteen there was a long pause two chipped mugs stood at the foot of terris armchair the dirty liquid in one of them had a bloody look terris arms were folded across her flat breast i had him dressed said terri dragging the words from deep in her consciousness sorry terri but ive got to ask said kay have you used this morning terri passed a birds claw hand over her mouth nah wantashit said robbie and he scurried towards the door does he need help kay asked as robbie vanished from sight and they heard him scampering upstairs nah e can doot alone slurred terri she propped her drooping head on her fist her elbow on the armchair robbie let out a shout from the landing door door they heard him thumping wood terri did not move shall i help him kay suggested yeah said terri kay climbed the stairs and operated the stiff handle on the door for robbie the room smelled rank the bath was grey with successive brown tidemarks around it and the toilet had not been flushed kay did this before allowing robbie to scramble onto the seat he screwed up his face and strained loudly indifferent to her presence there was a loud splash and a noisome new note was added to the already putrid air he got down and pulled up his bulging nappy without wiping kay made him come back and tried to persuade him to do it for himself but the action seemed quite foreign to him in the end she did it for him his bottom was sore crusty red and irritated the nappy stank of ammonia she tried to remove it but he yelped lashed out at her then pulled away scampering back down to the sitting room with his nappy sagging kay wanted to wash her hands but there was no soap trying not to inhale she closed the bathroom door behind her she glanced into the bedrooms before returning downstairs the contents of all three spilt out onto the cluttered landing they were all sleeping on mattresses robbie seemed to be sharing a room with his mother a couple of toys lay among the dirty clothes strewn all over the floor cheap plastic and too young for him to kays surprise the duvet and pillows both had covers on them back in the sitting room robbie was whining again banging his fist against the stack of cardboard boxes terri was watching from beneath halfclosed eyelids kay brushed off the seat of her chair before sitting back down terri youre on the methadone programme at the bellchapel clinic isnt that right mm said terri drowsily and hows that going terri pen poised kay waited pretending that the answer was not sitting in front of her are you still going to the clinic terri las week friday i goes robbie pounded the boxes with his fists can you tell me how much methadone youre on hundred and fifteen mils said terri it did not surprise kay that terri could remember this but not the age of her daughter mattie says here that your mother has been helping with robbie and krystal is that still the case robbie flung his hard compact little body against the pile of boxes which swayed be careful robbie said kay and terri said leave em with the closest thing to alertness kay had heard in her dead voice robbie returned to beating the boxes with his fists for the pleasure apparently of listening to the hollow drumbeat terri is your mother still helping to look after robbie not mmother gran robbies gran my gran innit she dun she aint well kay glanced over at robbie again her pen at the ready he was not underweight she knew that from the feel and look of him halfnaked as she had wiped his backside his tshirt was dirty but his hair when she had bent over him had smelled surprisingly of shampoo there were no bruises on his milkwhite arms and legs but there was the sodden bagging nappy he was three and a half mungry he shouted giving the box a final futile whack mungry you cnave a biscuit slurred terri but not moving robbies yells turned to noisy sobs and screams terri made no attempt to leave her chair it was impossible to talk over the din shall i get him one shouted kay yeah robbie ran past kay into the kitchen it was almost as dirty as the bathroom other than the fridge cooker and washing machine there were no gadgets the counters carried only dirty plates another overflowing ashtray carrier bags mouldy bread the lino was tacky and stuck to the soles of kays shoes rubbish had overflowed the bin on top of which sat a pizza box precariously balanced n there said robbie jabbing a finger at the wall unit without looking at kay n there more food than kay had expected was stacked in the cupboard tins a packet of biscuits a jar of instant coffee she took two biscuits from the packet and handed them to him he snatched them and ran away again back to his mother so do you like going to the nursery robbie she asked him as he sat scoffing the biscuits on the floor he did not answer yeah e likes it said terri slightly more awake don you robbie e likes it when was he last there terri las time yesterday yesterday was monday he couldnt have been there then said kay making notes that isnt one of the days he goes wha im asking about nursery robbies supposed to be there today i need to know when he was last there i told you din i las time her eyes were more fully open than kay had yet seen them the timbre of her voice was still flat but antagonism was struggling to the surface are you a dyke she asked no said kay still writing you look like a dyke said terri kay continued to write juice robbie shouted chocolate smeared over his chin this time kay did not move after another long pause terri lurched out of her chair and wove her way into the hall kay leaned forward and shifted the loose lid of the biscuit tin terri had displaced when she sat down inside was a syringe a bit of grubby cotton wool a rustylooking spoon and a dusty polythene bag kay snapped the lid back on firmly while robbie watched her terri returned after some distant clattering carrying a cup of juice which she shoved at the little boy there she said more to kay than to her son and she sat back down again she missed the seat and collided with the arm of the chair on her first attempt kay heard the bone collide with wood but terri seemed to feel no pain she settled herself back into the sagging cushions and surveyed the social worker with bleary indifference kay had read the file from cover to cover she knew that nearly everything of value in terri weedons life had been sucked into the black hole of her addiction that it had cost her two children that she barely clung to two more that she prostituted herself to pay for heroin that she had been involved in every sort of petty crime and that she was currently attempting rehab for the umpteenth time but not to feel not to care right now kay thought shes happier than i am iii at the start of the second postlunch period stuart fats wall walked out of school his experiment in truancy was undertaken in no rash spirit he had decided the previous night that he would miss the double period of computing that finished the afternoon he might have chosen to skip any lesson but it so happened that his best friend andrew price known to fats as arf was in a different set in computing and fats in spite of his best efforts had not succeeded in being demoted to join him fats and andrew were perhaps equally aware that the admiration in their relationship flowed mostly from andrew to fats but fats alone suspected that he needed andrew more than andrew needed him lately fats had started to regard this dependency in the light of a weakness but he reasoned that while his liking for andrews company lingered he might as well miss a double period where he had to do without it anyway fats had been told by a reliable informant that the one failsafe way of quitting the winterdown grounds without being spotted from a window was to climb over the side wall by the bike shed this therefore he did dropping down by his fingertips into the narrow lane on the other side he landed without mishap strode off along the narrow path and turned left onto the busy dirty main road safely on his way he lit a cigarette and proceeded past the rundown little shops five blocks along fats turned left again into the first of the streets that made up the fields he loosened his school tie with one hand as he walked but did not remove it he did not care that he was conspicuously a schoolboy fats had never even attempted to customize his uniform in any way to pin badges on his lapels or adjust his tie knot to suit fashion he wore his school clothes with the disdain of a convict he had decided that he possessed traits that were authentic which ought therefore to be encouraged and cultivated but also that some of his habits of thought were the unnatural product of his unfortunate upbringing and consequently inauthentic and to be purged lately he had been experimenting with acting on what he thought were his authentic impulses and ignoring or suppressing the guilt and fear inauthentic that such actions seemed to engender undoubtedly this was becoming easier with practice he wanted to toughen up inside to become invulnerable to be free of the fear of consequences to rid himself of spurious notions of goodness and badness one of the things that had begun to irritate him about his own dependence on andrew was that the latters presence sometimes curbed and limited the full expression of fats authentic self somewhere in andrew was a selfdrawn map of what constituted fair play and lately fats had caught looks of displeasure confusion and disappointment poorly disguised on his old friends face andrew pulled up short at extremes of baiting and derision fats did not hold this against andrew it would have been inauthentic for andrew to join in unless that was what he really truly wanted the trouble was that andrew was displaying an attachment to the kind of morality against which fats was waging an increasingly determined war fats suspected that the right thing to do the correctly unsentimental act in pursuit of full authenticity would have been to cut andrew adrift and yet he still preferred andrews company to anybody elses fats was convinced that he knew himself particularly well he explored the nooks and crevices of his own psyche with an attention he had recently ceased to give to anything else he spent hours interrogating himself about his own impulses desires and fears attempting to discriminate between those that were truly his and those that he had been taught to feel he examined his own attachments nobody else he knew he was sure was ever this honest with themselves they drifted half asleep through life and his conclusion had been that andrew whom he had known since he was five was the person for whom he felt the most straightforward affection that even though he was now old enough to see through her he retained an attachment to his mother that was not his own fault and that he actively despised cubby who represented the acme and pinnacle of inauthenticity on the facebook page that fats curated with a care he devoted to almost nothing else he had highlighted a quotation he had found on his parents bookshelves i do not want believers i think i am too malicious to believe in myself i have a terrible fear i shall one day be pronounced holy i do not want to be a saint rather even a buffoon perhaps i am a buffoon andrew liked it very much and fats liked how impressed he was in the time it took him to pass the bookmakers mere seconds fats thoughts lit on his fathers dead friend barry fairbrother three long loping strides past the racehorses printed on posters behind the grubby glass and fats saw barrys joking bearded face and heard cubbys booming excuse of a laugh which had often rung out almost before barry had made one of his feeble jokes in the mere excitement of his presence fats did not wish to examine these memories any further he did not interrogate himself on the reasons for his instinctive inner flinch he did not ask himself whether the dead man had been authentic or inauthentic he dismissed the idea of barry fairbrother and his fathers ludicrous distress and pressed on fats was curiously joyless these days even though he made everybody else laugh as much as ever his quest to rid himself of restrictive morality was an attempt to regain something he was sure had been stifled in him something that he had lost as he had left childhood what fats wanted to recover was a kind of innocence and the route he had chosen back to it was through all the things that were supposed to be bad for you but which paradoxically seemed to fats to be the one true way to authenticity to a kind of purity it was curious how often everything was back to front the inverse of what they told you fats was starting to think that if you flipped every bit of received wisdom on its head you would have the truth he wanted to journey through dark labyrinths and wrestle with the strangeness that lurked within he wanted to crack open piety and expose hypocrisy he wanted to break taboos and squeeze wisdom from their bloody hearts he wanted to achieve a state of amoral grace and be baptized backwards into ignorance and simplicity and so he decided to break one of the few school rules he had not yet contravened and walked away into the fields it was not merely that the crude pulse of reality seemed nearer here than in any other place he knew he also had a vague hope of stumbling across certain notorious people about whom he was curious and though he barely acknowledged it to himself because it was one of the few yearnings for which he did not have words he sought an open door and a dawning recognition and a welcome to a home he did not know he had moving past the puttycoloured houses on foot rather than in his mothers car he noticed that many of them were free of graffiti and debris and that some imitated as he saw it the gentility of pagford with net curtains and ornaments on the windowsills these details were less readily apparent from a moving vehicle where fats eye was irresistibly drawn from boarded window to debrisstrewn lawn the neater houses held no interest for fats what drew him on were the places where chaos or lawlessness was in evidence even if only of the puerile spraycanned variety somewhere near here he did not know exactly where lived dane tully tullys family was infamous his two older brothers and his father spent a lot of time in prison there was a rumour that the last time dane had had a fight with a nineteenyearold so the story went from the cantermill estate his father had escorted him to the rendezvous and had stayed to fight danes opponents older brothers tully had turned up at school with his face cut his lip swollen and his eye blacked everyone agreed that he had put in one of his infrequent appearances simply to show off his injuries fats was quite sure that he would have played it differently to care what anyone else thought of your smashed face was inauthentic fats would have liked to fight and then to go about his normal life and if anyone knew it would be because they had glimpsed him by chance fats had never been hit despite offering increasing provocation he thought often these days about how it would feel to get into a fight he suspected that the state of authenticity he sought would include violence or at least would not preclude violence to be prepared to hit and to take a hit seemed to him to be a form of courage to which he ought to aspire he had never needed his fists his tongue had sufficed but the emergent fats was starting to despise his own articulacy and to admire authentic brutality the matter of knives fats debated with himself more gingerly to buy a blade now and let it be known he was carrying it would be an act of crashing inauthenticity a pitiful aping of the likes of dane tully fats insides crawled at the thought of it if ever the time came when he needed to carry a knife that would be different fats did not rule out the possibility that such a time would come though he admitted to himself that the idea was frightening fats was scared of things that pierced flesh of needles and blades he had been the only one to faint when they had had their meningitis vaccinations back at st thomass one of the few ways that andrew had found to discompose fats was to unsheath his epipen around him the adrenalinfilled needle that andrew was supposed to carry with him at all times because of his dangerous nut allergy it made fats feel sick when andrew brandished it at him or pretended to jab him with it wandering without any particular destination fats caught sight of the sign to foley road that was where krystal weedon lived he was unsure whether she was in school today and it was not his intention to make her think that he had come looking for her they had an agreement to meet on friday evening fats had told his parents that he was going to andrews because they were collaborating on an english project krystal seemed to understand what they were going to do she seemed up for it she had so far allowed him to insert two fingers inside her hot and firm and slippery he had unhooked her bra and been permitted to place his hands on her warm heavy breasts he had sought her out deliberately at the christmas disco led her out of the hall under andrews and the others incredulous gazes round the back of the drama hall she had seemed quite as surprised as anybody else but had offered as he had hoped and expected virtually no resistance his targeting of krystal had been a deliberate act and he had had his cool and brazen retort ready when it had come to facing down his mates jeers and taunts if you want chips you dont go to a fucking salad bar he had thought out that analogy in advance but he had still had to spell it out for them you boys keep wanking i want a shag that had wiped the smiles off their faces he could tell that all of them andrew included were forced to choke down their jeers at his choice in admiration of his unabashed pursuit of the one the only true goal fats had undoubtedly chosen the most direct route to get there none of them could argue with his commonsense practicality and fats could tell that every single one of them was asking himself why he had not had the guts to consider this means to a most satisfactory end do me a favour and dont mention this to my mother all right fats had muttered to krystal coming up for air in between long wet explorations of each others mouths while his thumbs had rubbed backwards and forwards over her nipples she had half sniggered then kissed him with more aggression she had not asked him why he had picked her had not asked him anything really she seemed like him to be pleased by the reactions of their entirely separate tribes to glory in the watchers confusion even in his friends pantomime of disgust he and krystal had barely spoken to each other during three further bouts of carnal exploration and experimentation fats had engineered all of them but she had made herself more readily available than usual choosing to hang about in places he might find her easily friday night was the first time they would meet by prearrangement he had bought condoms the prospect of finally going all the way had something to do with him truanting today and coming to the fields although he had not thought of krystal herself as opposed to her splendid breasts and that miraculously unguarded vagina until he saw the name of her street fats doubled back lighting another cigarette something about seeing the name of foley road had given him a strange sense that his timing was wrong the fields today were banal and inscrutable and that which he sought the thing he hoped to recognize when he found it was curled up somewhere out of sight and so he walked back to school iv nobody was answering their telephone back in the child protection teams room kay had been punching in numbers on and off for nearly two hours leaving messages asking everyone to call her back the weedons health visitor their family doctor the cantermill nursery and the bellchapel addiction clinic terri weedons file lay open on the desk in front of her bulging and battered using again is she said alex one of the women with whom kay shared an office bellchapelll kick her out for good this time she claims shes terrified robbiell be taken off her but she cant keep off the smack its the third time shes been through bellchapel said una on the basis of what she had seen that afternoon kay thought the time was right for a case review to pull together those professionals who shared responsibility for individual fragments of terri weedons life she continued to press redial between dealing with other work while in the corner of the office their own telephone rang repeatedly and clicked immediately onto the answering machine the child protection teams room was cramped and cluttered and it smelt of spoilt milk because alex and una had a habit of emptying the dregs of their coffee cups into the pot of a depressedlooking yucca plant in the corner matties most recent notes were untidy and chaotic peppered with crossings out misdated and partial several key documents were missing from the file including a letter sent by the addiction clinic a fortnight previously it was quicker to ask alex and una for information last case review woulda been said alex frowning at the yucca plant over a year ago i reckon and they thought robbie was ok to stay with her then obviously said kay the receiver pressed between ear and shoulder as she tried and failed to find the notes of the review in the bulging folder it wasnt a case of him staying with her it was whether he was going to go back to her or not he was put out to a foster mother because terri was beaten up by a client and ended up in hospital she got clean got out and was mad to get robbie back she went back on the bellchapel programme she was off the game and makin a proper effort her mother was saying shed help so she got him home and a few months later shed started shooting up again its not terris mother who helps though is it said kay whose head was starting to ache as she tried to decipher matties big untidy writing its her grandmother the kids greatgrandmother so she must be knocking on and terri said something about her being ill this morning if terris the only carer now the daughters sixteen said una she mostly takes care of robbie well shes not doing a great job said kay he was in a pretty bad state when i got there this morning but she had seen far worse welts and sores gashes and burns tarblack bruises scabies and nits babies lying on carpets covered in dog shit kids crawling on broken bones and once she dreamed of it still a child who had been locked in a cupboard for five days by his psychotic stepfather that one had made the national news the most immediate danger to robbie weedons safety had been the pile of heavy boxes in his mothers sitting room which he had attempted to climb when he realized that it attracted kays full attention kay had carefully restacked them into two lower piles before leaving terri had not liked her touching the boxes nor had she liked kay telling her that she ought to take off robbies sodden nappy terri had been roused in fact to foulmouthed though still slightly hazy fury and had told kay to fuck off and stay away kays mobile rang and she picked it up it was terris key drug worker ive been trying to get you for days said the woman crossly it took several minutes for kay to explain that she was not mattie but this did not much reduce the womans antagonism yeah were still seeing her but she tested positive last week if she uses again shes out weve got twenty people right now who could take her place on the programme and maybe get some benefit from it this is the third time shes been through kay did not say she knew that terri had used that morning have either of you got any paracetamol kay asked alex and una once the drug worker had given her full details of terris attendance and lack of progress at the clinic and rung off kay took her painkillers with tepid tea lacking the energy to get up and go to the water cooler in the corridor the office was stuffy the radiator cranked up high as the daylight faded from the sky outside the striplighting over her desk intensified it turned her multitude of papers a bright yellowwhite buzzing black words marched in endless lines theyre going to close down bellchapel clinic you watch said una who was working at her pc with her back to kay got to make cuts council funds one of the drug workers pagford parish owns the building i heard theyre planning to tart it up and try and rent to a betterpaying client theyve had it in for that clinic for years kays temple throbbed the name of her new hometown made her feel sad without pausing to think she did the thing that she had vowed not to do after he had failed to call the previous evening she picked up her mobile and keyed in gavins office number edward collins and co said a womans voice after the third ring they answered your calls immediately out in the private sector when money might depend on it could i speak to gavin hughes please said kay staring down at terris file whos speaking please kay bawden said kay she did not look up she did not want to catch either alexs or unas eyes the pause seemed interminable they had met in london at gavins brothers birthday party kay had not known anyone there except for the friend who had dragged her along for support gavin had just split up with lisa he had been a little drunk but had seemed decent reliable and conventional not at all the kind of man that kay usually went for he had poured out the story of his broken relationship and then gone home with her to the flat in hackney he had been keen while the affair remained longdistance visiting at weekends and telephoning her regularly but when by a miracle she had got the job in yarvil for less money and put her flat in hackney on the market he had seemed to take fright his lines still busy would you like to hold yes please said kay miserably if she and gavin did not work out but they had to work out she had moved for him changed jobs for him uprooted her daughter for him he would never have let that happen surely unless his intentions were serious he must have thought through the consequences if they split up how awful and awkward it would be running across each other constantly in a tiny town like pagford putting you through said the secretary and kays hopes soared hi said gavin how are you fine lied kay because alex and una were listening are you having a good day busy said gavin you yes she waited the phoned pressed tightly against her ear pretending that he was speaking to her listening to the silence i wondered whether you wanted to meet up tonight she asked finally feeling sick er i dont think i can he said how can you not know what have you got on i might have to do something its mary barrys wife she wants me to be a pallbearer so i might have to i think ive got to find out what that involves and everything sometimes if she simply remained quiet and let the inadequacy of his excuses reverberate on the air he became ashamed and backtracked i dont suppose thatll take all evening though he said we could meet up later if you wanted all right then do you want to come over to mine as its a school night er yeah ok what time she asked wanting him to make one decision i dunno nineish after he had rung off kay kept the phone pressed tightly to her ear for a few moments then said for the benefit of alex and una i do too see you later babe v as guidance teacher tessas hours varied more than her husbands she usually waited until the end of the school day to take their son home in her nissan leaving colin whom tessa although she knew what the rest of the world called him including nearly all the parents who had caught the habit from their children never addressed as cubby to follow them an hour or two later in his toyota today though colin met tessa in the car park at twentypast four while the schoolchildren were still swarming out of the front gates into parental cars or onto their free buses the sky was a cold irongrey like the underside of a shield a sharp breeze lifted the hems of skirts and rattled the leaves on the immature trees a spiteful chill wind that sought out your weakest places the nape of your neck and your knees and which denied you the comfort of dreaming of retreating a little from reality even after she had closed the car door on it tessa felt ruffled and put out as she would have been by somebody crashing into her without apology beside her in the passenger seat his knees absurdly high in the cramped confines of her car colin told tessa what the computing teacher had come to his office to tell him twenty minutes previously not there didnt turn up for the whole double period said he thought hed better come straight and tell me so thatll be all over the staff room tomorrow exactly what he wants said colin furiously and tessa knew that they were not talking about the computing teacher any more hes just sticking two fingers up at me as usual her husband was pale with exhaustion with shadows beneath his reddened eyes and his hands were twitching slightly on the handle of his briefcase fine hands with big knuckles and long slender fingers they were not altogether dissimilar from their sons tessa had pointed this out to her husband and son recently neither had evinced the smallest pleasure at the thought that there was some faint physical resemblance between them i dont think hes began tessa but colin was talking again so hell get detention like everyone else and ill damn well punish him at home too well see how he likes that shall we well see whether thats a laughing matter we can start by grounding him for a week well see how funny that is biting back her response tessa scanned the sea of blackclad students walking with heads down shivering drawing their thin coats close their hair blown into their mouths a chubbycheeked and slightly bewilderedlooking first year was looking all around for a lift that had not arrived the crowd parted and there was fats loping along with arf price as usual the wind blowing his hair off his gaunt face sometimes at certain angles in certain lights it was easy to see what fats would look like as an old man for an instant from the depths of her tiredness he seemed a complete stranger and tessa thought how extraordinary it was that he was turning away to walk towards her car and that she would have to go back out into that horrible hyperreal breeze to let him in but when he reached them and gave her his small grimace of a smile he reconstituted himself immediately into the boy she loved in spite of it all and she got out again and stood stoically in the knifesharp wind while he folded himself into the car with his father who had not offered to move they pulled out of the car park ahead of the free buses and set off through yarvil past the ugly brokendown houses of the fields towards the bypass that would speed them back to pagford tessa watched fats in the rearview mirror he was slumped in the back gazing out of the window as though his parents were two people who had picked him up hitchhiking connected to him merely by chance and proximity colin waited until they reached the bypass then he asked where were you when you should have been in computing this afternoon tessa glanced irresistibly into the mirror again she saw her son yawn sometimes even though she denied it endlessly to colin tessa wondered whether fats really was waging a dirty personal war on his father with the whole school as audience she knew things about her son she would not have known if she had not worked in guidance students told her things sometimes innocently sometimes slyly miss do you mind fats smoking dyou let him do it at home she locked away this small repository of illicit booty obtained unintentionally and brought it to neither her husbands nor her sons attention even though it dragged at her weighed on her went for a walk fats said calmly thought id stretch the old legs colin twisted in his seat to look at fats straining against his seat belt as he shouted his gestures further restricted and hampered by his overcoat and briefcase when he lost control colins voice rose higher and higher so that he was shouting almost in falsetto through it all fats sat in silence an insolent halfsmile curving his thin mouth until his father was screaming insults at him insults that were blunted by colins innate dislike of swearing his selfconsciousness when he did it you cocky selfcentred little little shit he screamed and tessa whose eyes were so full of tears that she could barely see the road was sure that fats would be duplicating colins timid falsetto swearing for the benefit of andrew price tomorrow morning fats does a great imitation of cubbys walk miss have you seen it how dare you talk to me like that how dare you skip classes colin screamed and raged and tessa had to blink the tears out of her eyes as she took the turning to pagford and drove through the square past mollison and lowe the war memorial and the black canon she turned left at st michael and all saints into church row and at last into the driveway of their house by which time colin had shouted himself into squeaky hoarseness and tessas cheeks were glazed and salty when they all got out fats whose expression had not altered a whit during his fathers long diatribe let himself in through the front door with his own key and proceeded upstairs at a leisurely pace without looking back colin threw his briefcase down in the dark hall and rounded on tessa the only illumination came from the stainedglass panel over the front door which cast strange colours over his agitated domed and balding head half bloody half ghostly blue dyou see he cried waving his long arms dyou see what im dealing with yes she said taking a handful of tissues from the box on the hall table and mopping her face blowing her nose yes i do not a thought in his head for what were going through said colin and he started to sob big whooping dry sobs like a child with croup tessa hurried forward and put her arms around colins chest a little above his waist for short and stout as she was that was the highest bit she could reach he stooped clinging to her she could feel his trembling and the heaving of his rib cage under his coat after a few minutes she gently disengaged herself led him into the kitchen and made him a pot of tea im going to take a casserole up to marys said tessa after she had sat for a while stroking his hand shes got half the family there well get an early night once im back he nodded and sniffed and she kissed him on the side of his head before heading out to the freezer when she came back carrying the heavy icy dish he was sitting at the table cradling his mug in his big hands his eyes closed tessa set down the casserole wrapped in a polythene bag on the tiles beside the front door she pulled on the lumpy green cardigan she often wore instead of a jacket but did not put on her shoes instead she tiptoed upstairs to the landing and then taking less trouble to be quiet up the second flight to the loft conversion a swift burst of ratlike activity greeted her approach to the door she knocked giving fats time to hide whatever it was he had been looking at online or perhaps the cigarettes he did not know she knew about yeah she pushed open the door her son was crouching stagily over his school bag did you have to play truant today of all days fats straightened up long and stringy he towered over his mother i was there i came in late bennett didnt notice hes useless stuart please please she wanted to shout at the kids at work sometimes too she wanted to scream you must accept the reality of other people you think that reality is up for negotiation that we think its whatever you say it is you must accept that we are as real as you are you must accept that you are not god your fathers very upset stu because of barry cant you understand that yes said fats i mean its like arf dying would be to you he did not respond nor did his expression alter much yet she sensed his disdain his amusement i know you think you and arf are very different orders of being to the likes of your father and barry no said fats but only she knew in the hope of ending the conversation im going to take some food over to marys house i am begging you stuart not to do anything else to upset your father while im gone please stu fine he said with half a laugh half a shrug she felt his attention swooping swallowlike back to his own concerns even before she had closed the door vi the spiteful wind blew away the lowhanging cloud of late afternoon and at sunset died out three houses along from the walls samantha mollison sat facing her lamplit reflection in the dressingtable mirror and found the silence and the stillness depressing it had been a disappointing couple of days she had sold virtually nothing the sales rep from champêtre had turned out to be a jowly man with an abrasive manner and a holdall full of ugly bras apparently he reserved his charm for the preliminaries for in person he was all business patronizing her criticizing her stock pushing for an order she had been imagining somebody younger taller and sexier she had wanted to get him and his garish underwear out of her little shop as quickly as possible she had bought a with deepest sympathy card for mary fairbrother that lunchtime but could not think what to write in it because after their nightmare journey to the hospital together a simple signature did not seem enough their relationship had never been close you bumped up against each other all the time in a place as small as pagford but she and miles had not really known barry and mary if anything it might have been said that they were in opposing camps what with howard and barrys endless clashes about the fields not that she samantha gave a damn one way or another she held herself above the smallness of local politics tired out of sorts and bloated after a day of indiscriminate snacking she wished that she and miles were not going to dinner at her parentsinlaws watching herself in the mirror she put her hands flat against the sides of her face and pulled the skin gently back towards her ears a younger samantha emerged by millimetres turning her face slowly from side to side she examined this taut mask better much better she wondered what it would cost how much it would hurt whether she would dare she tried to imagine what her motherinlaw would say if she appeared with a firm new face shirley and howard were as shirley frequently reminded them helping to pay for their granddaughters education miles entered the bedroom samantha released her skin and picked up her undereye concealer tilting her head back as she always did when applying makeup it pulled the slightly sagging skin at her jaw taut and minimized the pouches under her eyes there were short needledeep lines at the edges of her lips these could be filled she had read with a synthetic injectable compound she wondered how much difference that would make it would surely be cheaper than a facelift and perhaps shirley would not notice in the mirror over her shoulder she saw miles pulling off his tie and shirt his big belly spilling over his work trousers werent you meeting someone today some rep he asked idly he scratched his hairy navel staring into the wardrobe yes but it wasnt any good said samantha crappy stuff miles enjoyed what she did he had grown up in a home where retail was the only business that mattered and he had never lost the respect for commerce that howard had instilled in him then there were all the opportunities for jokes and for other less subtly disguised forms of selfcongratulation that her line of trade afforded miles never seemed to tire of making the same old quips or the same sly allusions bad fit he enquired knowledgeably bad design horrible colours samantha brushed and tied back her thick dry brown hair watching miles in the mirror as he changed into chinos and a polo shirt she was on edge feeling that she might snap or cry at the smallest provocation evertree crescent was only a few minutes away but church row was steep so they drove darkness was falling properly and at the top of the road they passed a shadowy man with barry fairbrothers silhouette and gait it gave samantha a shock and she glanced back at him wondering who he could be miles car turned left at the top of the road then barely a minute later right into the halfmoon of s bungalows howard and shirleys house a low widewindowed building of red brick boasted generous sweeps of green lawn at the front and back which were mown into stripes during the summer by miles during the long years of their occupancy howard and shirley had added carriage lamps a white wroughtiron gate and terracotta pots full of geraniums on either side of the front door they had also put up a sign beside the doorbell a round polished piece of wood on which was written in old gothic black lettering complete with quotation marks ambleside samantha was sometimes cruelly witty at the expense of her parentsinlaws house miles tolerated her jibes accepting the implication that he and samantha with their strippedback floors and doors their rugs on bare boards their framed art prints and their stylish uncomfortable sofa had the better taste but in his secret soul he preferred the bungalow in which he had grown up nearly every surface was covered with something plushy and soft there were no draughts and the reclining chairs were deliciously comfortable after he mowed the lawn in the summer shirley would bring him a cool beer while he lay back in one of them watching the cricket on the widescreen tv sometimes one of his daughters would come with him and sit beside him eating ice cream with chocolate sauce especially made for her granddaughters by shirley hello darling said shirley when she opened the door her short compact shape suggested a neat little pepper pot in its sprigged apron she stood on tiptoe for her tall son to kiss her then said hello sam and turned away immediately dinners nearly ready howard miles and sam are here the house smelt of furniture polish and good food howard emerged from the kitchen a bottle of wine in one hand a corkscrew in the other in a practised move shirley backed smoothly into the dining room enabling howard who took up almost the entire width of the hall to pass before she trotted into the kitchen here they are the good samaritans boomed howard and hows the brassière business sammy breasting the recession all right business is surprisingly bouncy actually howard said samantha howard roared with laughter and samantha was sure that he would have patted her on the bottom if he had not been holding the corkscrew and bottle she tolerated all of her fatherinlaws little squeezes and slaps as the harmless exhibitionism of a man grown too fat and old to do anything more in any case it annoyed shirley which always pleased samantha shirley never showed her displeasure openly her smile did not flicker nor did her tone of sweet reasonableness falter but within a short time of any of howards mild lewdnesses she always tossed a dart hidden in a feathery flourish at her daughterinlaw mention of the girls escalating school fees solicitous enquiries about samanthas diet asking miles whether he did not think mary fairbrother had an awfully pretty figure samantha endured it all smiling and punished miles for it later hello mo said miles preceding samantha into what howard and shirley called the lounge didnt know you were going to be here hello handsome said maureen in her deep gravelly voice give me a kiss howards business partner was sitting in a corner of the sofa clutching a tiny glass of sherry she was wearing a fuchsia pink dress with dark stockings and high patentleather heels her jetblack hair was heavily lacquered into a bouffant beneath which her face was pale and monkeyish with a thick smear of shocking pink lipstick that puckered as miles bent low to kiss her cheek been talking business plans for the new café hello sam sweetheart maureen added patting the sofa beside her oh you are lovely and tanned is that still from ibiza come sit down by me what a shock for you at the golf club it must have been ghastly yes it was said samantha and for the first time she found herself telling somebody the story of barrys death while miles hovered looking for a chance to interrupt howard handed out large glasses of pinot grigio paying close attention to samanthas account gradually in the glow of howard and maureens interest with the alcohol kindling a comforting fire inside her the tension samantha had carried with her for two days seemed to drain away and a fragile sense of wellbeing blossomed the room was warm and spotless shelving units on either side of the gas fire displayed an array of ornamental china nearly all of it commemorating some royal landmark or anniversary of the reign of elizabeth ii a small bookcase in the corner contained a mixture of royal biographies and the glossy cookbooks that had overrun the kitchen photographs adorned the shelves and walls miles and his younger sister patricia beamed from a twin frame in matching school uniforms miles and samanthas two daughters lexie and libby were represented over and again from babyhood to teens samantha figured only once in the family gallery though in one of the largest and most prominent pictures it showed her and miles wedding day sixteen years before miles was young and handsome piercing blue eyes crinkled at the photographer whereas samanthas eyes were closed in a half blink her face was turned sideways her chin was doubled by her smile at a different lens the white satin of her dress strained across breasts already swollen with her early pregnancy making her look huge one of maureens thin clawlike hands was playing with the chain she always wore around her neck on which hung a crucifix and her late husbands wedding ring when samantha reached the point in her story where the doctor told mary that there was nothing they could do maureen put her free hand on samanthas knee and squeezed dishing up called shirley though she had not wanted to come samantha felt better than she had in two days maureen and howard were treating her like a mixture of heroine and invalid and both of them patted her gently on the back as she passed them on her way into the dining room shirley had turned down the dimmer switch and lit long pink candles to match the wallpaper and the best napkins the steam rising from their soup plates in the gloom made even howards wide florid face look otherworldly having drunk almost to the bottom of her big wine glass samantha thought how funny it would be if howard announced that they were about to hold a séance to ask barry for his own account of the events at the golf club well said howard in a deep voice i think we ought to raise our glasses to barry fairbrother samantha tipped back her glass quickly to stop shirley seeing that she had already downed most of its contents it was almost certainly an aneurysm announced miles the instant the glasses had landed back on the tablecloth he had withheld this information even from samantha and he was glad because she might have squandered it just now while talking to maureen and howard gavin phoned mary to give the firms condolences and touch base about the will and mary confirmed it basically an artery in his head swelled up and burst he had looked up the term on the internet once he had found out how to spell it back in his office after speaking to gavin could have happened at any time some sort of inborn weakness ghastly said howard but then he noticed that samanthas glass was empty and heaved himself out of his chair to top it up shirley drank soup for a while with her eyebrows hovering near her hairline samantha slugged down more wine in defiance dyou know what she said her tongue slightly unwieldy i thought i saw him on the way here in the dark barry i expect it was one of his brothers said shirley dismissively theyre all alike but maureen croaked over shirley drowning her out i thought i saw ken the evening after he died clear as day standing in the garden looking up at me through the kitchen window in the middle of his roses nobody responded they had heard the story before a minute passed full of nothing but soft slurps then maureen spoke again with her ravens caw gavins quite friendly with the fairbrothers isnt he miles doesnt he play squash with barry didnt he i should say yeah barry thrashed him once a week gavin must be a lousy player barry had ten years on him near identical expressions of complacent amusement touched the candlelit faces of the three women around the table if nothing else they had in common a slightly perverse interest in miles stringy young business partner in maureens case this was merely a manifestation of her inexhaustible appetite for all the gossip of pagford and the goingson of a young bachelor were prime meat shirley took a particular pleasure in hearing all about gavins inferiorities and insecurities because these threw into delicious contrast the achievements and selfassertion of the twin gods of her life howard and miles but in the case of samantha gavins passivity and caution awoke a feline cruelty she had a powerful desire to see him slapped awake pulled into line or otherwise mauled by a feminine surrogate she bullied him a little in person whenever they met taking pleasure in the conviction that he found her overwhelming hard to handle so how are things going these days asked maureen with his lady friend from london shes not in london any more mo shes moved into hope street said miles and if you ask me hes regretting he ever went near her you know gavin born with cold feet miles had been a few years above gavin at school and there was forever a trace of the sixthform prefect in the way he spoke about his business partner dark girl very short hair thats her said miles social worker flat shoes then weve had her in the deli havent we how said maureen excitedly i wouldnt have had her down as much of a cook though not by the look of her roast loin of pork followed the soup with the connivance of howard samantha was sliding gently towards contented drunkenness but something in her was making forlorn protests like a man swept out to sea she attempted to drown it in more wine a pause rolled out across the table like a fresh tablecloth pristine and expectant and this time everybody seemed to know that it was for howard to set out the new topic he ate for a while big mouthfuls washed down with wine apparently oblivious to their eyes upon him finally having cleared half his plate he dabbed at his mouth with his napkin and spoke yes it will be interesting to see what happens on council now he was forced to pause to suppress a powerful burp for a moment he looked as if he might be sick he thumped his chest pardon me yes itll be very interesting indeed with fairbrother gone businesslike howard reverted to the form of the name he habitually used i cant see his article for the paper coming off unless bendsyourear takes it on obviously he added howard had dubbed parminder jawanda bendsyourear bhutto after her first attendance as a parish councillor it was a popular joke among the antifielders the look on her face said maureen addressing shirley the look on her face when we told her well i always thought you know samantha pricked up her ears but maureens insinuation was surely laughable parminder was married to the most gorgeous man in pagford vikram tall and well made with an aquiline nose eyes fringed with thick black lashes and a lazy knowing smile for years samantha had tossed back her hair and laughed more often than necessary whenever she paused in the street to pass the time of day with vikram who had the same kind of body miles had had before he had given up rugby and become soft and paunchy samantha had heard somewhere not long after they had become her neighbours that vikram and parminder had had an arranged marriage she had found this idea unspeakably erotic imagine being ordered to marry vikram having to do it she had wrought a little fantasy in which she was veiled and shown into a room a virgin condemned to her fate imagine looking up and knowing you were getting that not to mention the additional frisson of his job that much responsibility would have given a much uglier man sex appeal vikram had performed howards quadruple bypass seven years previously in consequence vikram could not enter mollison and lowe without being subjected to a barrage of jocular banter to the head of the queue please mr jawanda move aside please ladies no mr jawanda i insist this man saved my life patched up the old ticker what will it be mr jawanda sir howard always insisted that vikram take free samples and a little extra of everything he bought in consequence samantha suspected of these antics vikram almost never entered the delicatessen any more she had lost the thread of the conversation but it did not matter the others were still droning on about something that barry fairbrother had written to the local paper was going to have to talk to him about it boomed howard it was a very underhand way of doing things well well thats water under the bridge now what we should be thinking about is whos going to replace fairbrother we shouldnt underestimate bendsyourear however upset she might be that would be a great mistake shes probably trying to rustle up somebody already so we ought to be thinking about a decent replacement ourselves sooner rather than later simple matter of good governance what will that mean exactly miles asked an election possibly said howard with a judicious air but i doubt it its only a casual vacancy if there isnt enough interest in an election though as i say we must not underestimate bendsyourear but if she cant raise nine people to propose a public vote itll be a simple question of coopting a new councillor in that case wed need nine members votes to get the cooption ratified nines the quorum three years of fairbrothers term of office left to run worth it could swing the whole thing putting one of our side in instead of fairbrother howard drummed his thick fingers against the bowl of his wine glass looking at his son across the table both shirley and maureen were watching miles too and miles samantha thought was looking back at his father like a big fat labrador quivering in expectation of a treat a beat later than she would have done if she had been sober samantha realized what this was all about and why a strangely celebratory air hung over the table her intoxication had been liberating but all of a sudden it was restrictive for she was not sure that her tongue would be wholly biddable after more than a bottle of wine and a long stretch of silence she therefore thought the words rather than speaking them aloud youd better bloody well tell them youll need to discuss it with me first miles vii tessa wall had not meant to stay long at marys she was never comfortable about leaving her husband and fats alone in the house together but somehow her visit had stretched to a couple of hours the fairbrothers house was overflowing with camp beds and sleeping bags their extended family had closed in around the gaping vacuum left by death but no amount of noise and activity could mask the chasm into which barry had vanished alone with her thoughts for the first time since their friend had died tessa retraced her steps down church row in the darkness her feet aching her cardigan inadequate protection against the cold the only noise was the clicking of the wooden beads around her neck and the dim sounds of television sets in the houses she was passing quite suddenly tessa thought i wonder whether barry knew it had never occurred to her before that her husband might have told barry the great secret of her life the rotten thing that lay buried at the heart of her marriage she and colin never even discussed it though a whiff of it tainted many a conversation particularly lately tonight though tessa had thought she caught half a glance from mary at the mention of fats youre exhausted and youre imagining things tessa told herself firmly colins habits of secrecy were so strong so deeply entrenched that he would never have told not even barry whom he idolized tessa hated to think that barry might have known that his kindness towards colin had been actuated by pity for what she tessa had done when she entered the sitting room she found her husband sitting in front of the television wearing his glasses the news on in the background he had a sheaf of printed papers in his lap and a pen in his hand to tessas relief there was no sign of fats how is she colin asked well you know not great said tessa she sank into one of the old armchairs with a little moan of relief and pulled off her worndown shoes but barrys brothers being marvellous in what way well you know helping she closed her eyes and massaged the bridge of her nose and her eyelids with her thumb and forefinger i always thought he seemed a bit unreliable said colins voice really said tessa from the depths of her voluntary darkness yes remember when he said hed come and referee for that game against paxton high and he cancelled with about half an hours notice and bateman had to do it instead tessa fought down an impulse to snap colin had a habit of making sweeping judgements based on first impressions on single actions he never seemed to grasp the immense mutability of human nature nor to appreciate that behind every nondescript face lay a wild and unique hinterland like his own well hes being lovely with the kids said tessa carefully ive got to go to bed she did not move but sat concentrating on the separate aches in different parts of her body in her feet her lower back her shoulders tess ive been thinking hmm glasses shrank colins eyes to molelike proportions so that the high balding knobbly forehead seemed even more pronounced everything barry was trying to do on the parish council everything he was fighting for the fields the addiction clinic ive been thinking about it all day he drew a deep inward breath ive pretty much decided that im going to take over for him misgivings crashed over tessa pinning her to her chair rendering her momentarily speechless she struggled to keep her expression professionally neutral im sure its what barry would have wanted said colin his strange excitement was tinged with defensiveness never said tessas most honest self never for a second would barry have wanted you to do this he would have known you are the very last person who ought to do it gosh she said well i know barry was very but it would be a huge commitment colin and its not as though parminders gone shes still there and shell still be trying to do everything barry wanted i should have phoned parminder thought tessa as she said it with a guilty bump in her stomach oh god why didnt i think to call parminder but shell need support shell never be able to stand up to them all on her own said colin and i guarantee howard mollison will be lining up some puppet to replace barry right now hes probably already oh colin i bet he has you know what hes like the papers in colins lap fell disregarded in a smooth white waterfall onto the floor i want to do this for barry ill take over where he left off ill make sure everything he worked for doesnt go up in smoke i know the arguments he always said he got opportunities hed never have had otherwise and look how much he gave back to the community im definitely going to stand im going to look into what ive got to do tomorrow all right said tessa years of experience had taught her that colin ought not to be opposed in the first throes of his enthusiasm or it would simply entrench him in his determination to proceed those same years had taught colin that tessa often pretended to agree before raising objections these kinds of exchanges were always infused with their mutual unexpressed remembrance of that longburied secret tessa felt that she owed him he felt that he was owed this is something i really want to do tessa i understand that colin she pulled herself out of the chair wondering whether she would have the energy to get upstairs are you coming to bed in a minute i want to finish looking through these first he was gathering up the printed sheets he had let fall his reckless new project seemed to be giving him a feverish energy tessa undressed slowly in their bedroom gravity seemed to have become more powerful it was such an effort to lift her limbs to force her recalcitrant zip to do as she wished she pulled on her dressing gown and went into the bathroom where she could hear fats moving around overhead she often felt lonely and drained these days shuttling between her husband and son who seemed to exist entirely independently as alien to each other as landlord and lodger tessa went to take off her wristwatch then realized that she had mislaid it yesterday so tired she kept losing things and how could she have forgotten to call parminder tearful worried and tense she shuffled off to bed wednesday i krystal weedon had spent monday and tuesday nights on her friend nikkis bedroom floor after an especially bad fight with her mother this had started when krystal arrived home from hanging out with her mates at the precinct and found terri talking to obbo on the doorstep everyone in the fields knew obbo with his bland puffy face and his gaptoothed grin his bottlebottom glasses and his filthy old leather jacket jus keep em ere fer us ter fer a coupla days few quid in it for yeh whas she keepin krystal had demanded robbie scrambled out from between terris legs to cling tightly to krystals knees robbie did not like men coming to the house he had good reason nuthin compuers don krystal had said to terri she did not want her mother to have spare cash she would not have put it past obbo to cut out the middle step and pay her for the favour with a bag of smack don take em but terri had said yes all krystals life her mother had said yes to everything and everyone agreeing accepting forever acquiescing yeah all righ go on then ere yeh go no problem krystal had gone to hang out at the swings under a darkening sky with her friends she felt strained and irritable she could not seem to grasp the fact of mr fairbrothers death but kept experiencing punches to the stomach that made her want to lash out at somebody she was also unsettled and guilty about having stolen tessa walls watch but why had the silly bitch put it there in front of krystal and closed her eyes what did she expect being with the others did not help jemma kept needling her about fats wall finally krystal exploded and lunged at her nikki and leanne had to hold krystal back so krystal stormed home to find that obbos computers had arrived robbie was trying to climb the stacked boxes in the front room while terri sat there in dazed oblivion her works lying out on the floor as krystal had feared obbo had paid terri with a bag of heroin you stupid fuckin junkie bitch theyll kick yer ou the fuckin clinic again but heroin took krystals mother where she was beyond reach though she responded by calling krystal a little bitch and a whore it was with vacant detachment krystal slapped terri across the face terri told her to fuck off and die you fuckin look after him fer a fuckin change then you useless fuckin smackhead cow krystal screamed robbie ran howling up the hall after her but she slammed the front door on him krystal liked nikkis house better than any other it was not as tidy as her nana caths but it was friendlier comfortingly loud and busy nikki had two brothers and a sister so krystal slept on a foldedup duvet between the sisters beds the walls were covered with pictures cut out of magazines arranged as a collage of desirable boys and beautiful girls it had never occurred to krystal to embellish her own bedroom walls but guilt was clawing at her insides she kept remembering robbies terrified face as she slammed the door on him so on wednesday morning she came home in any case nikkis family was not keen on her staying more than two nights in a row nikki had once told her with characteristic forthrightness that it was all right with her mum if it didnt happen too often but that krystal was to stop using them as a hostel and especially to stop turning up past midnight terri seemed as glad as she ever was to see krystal back she talked about the new social workers visit and krystal wondered nervously what the stranger had thought of the house which lately had sunk even further below its usual filthy tidemark krystal was especially worried that kay had found robbie at home when he ought to have been at nursery because terris commitment to keeping robbie in preschool which he had begun while with his foster mother had been a key condition of his negotiated return to the family home the previous year she was also furious that the social worker had caught robbie wearing a nappy after all the work krystal had put in to persuade him to use the toilet so whaddid she say krystal demanded of terri tole me she wuz gonna come back said terri krystal had a bad feeling about this their usual social worker seemed content to let the weedon family get along without much interference vague and haphazard often getting their names wrong and confusing their circumstances with those of other clients she turned up every two weeks with no apparent aim except to check that robbie was still alive the new menace worsened krystals mood when straight terri was cowed by her daughters anger and let krystal boss her around making the most of her temporary authority krystal ordered terri to put on some proper clothes forced robbie back into clean pants reminded him he couldnt piss in this kind and marched him off to nursery he bawled when she made to leave at first she got ratty with him but finally she crouched down and promised him that she would come back and pick him up at one and he let her go then krystal truanted even though wednesday was the day she liked best at school because she had both pe and guidance and set to work to clean up the house a bit sloshing pinescented disinfectant over the kitchen scraping all the old food and cigarette butts into bin liners she hid the biscuit tin holding terris works and heaved the remaining computers three had already been collected into the hall cupboard all the time she was chiselling food off the plates krystals thoughts kept returning to the rowing team she would have had training the following night if mr fairbrother had still been alive he usually gave her a lift both ways in the peoplecarrier because she had no other means of getting over to the canal in yarvil his twin daughters niamh and siobhan and sukhvinder jawanda came in the car too krystal had no regular contact with these three girls during school hours but since becoming a team they had always said all right when they passed each other in the corridors krystal had expected them to look down their noses at her but they were ok once you got to know them they laughed at her jokes they had adopted some of her favourite phrases she was in some sense the crews leader nobody in krystals family had ever owned a car if she concentrated she could smell the interior of the peoplecarrier even over the stink of terris kitchen she loved its warm plasticky scent she would never be in that car again there had been trips on a hired minibus too with mr fairbrother driving the whole team and sometimes they had stayed overnight when they competed against farflung schools the team had sung rihannas umbrella in the back of the bus it had become their lucky ritual their theme tune with krystal doing jayzs rap solo at the start mr fairbrother had nearly pissed himself the first time he heard her do it uh huh uh huh rihanna good girl gone bad take three action no clouds in my storms let it rain i hydroplane into fame comin down with the dow jones krystal had never understood the words cubby wall had sent round a letter to them all saying that the team would not be meeting until they could find a new coach but they would never find a new coach so that was a pile of shit they all knew that it had been mr fairbrothers team his pet project krystal had taken a load of abuse from nikki and the others for joining their sneering had hidden incredulity and later on admiration because the team had won medals krystal kept hers in a box she had stolen from nikkis house krystal was much given to sneaking things into her pockets that belonged to people she liked this box was plastic and decorated with roses a childs jewellery box really tessas watch was curled up inside it now the best time of all had been when theyd beaten those snotty little bitches from st annes that day had been the very best of krystals life the headmistress had called the team up in front of the whole school at the next assembly krystal had been a bit mortified nikki and leanne had been laughing at her but then everyone had applauded them it had meant something that winterdown had hammered st annes but it was all finished all over the trips in the car and the rowing and the talking to the local newspaper she had liked the idea of being in the newspaper again mr fairbrother had said he was going to be there with her when it happened just the two of them what will they wanna talk to me abou like your life theyre interested in your life like a celebrity krystal had no money for magazines but she saw them in nikkis house and at the doctors if she took robbie this would have been even better than being in the paper with the team she had burst with excitement at the prospect but somehow she had managed to keep her mouth shut and had not even boasted about it to nikki or leanne she had wanted to surprise them it was as well she had not said anything she would never be in the paper again there was a hollowness in krystals stomach she tried not to think any more about mr fairbrother as she moved around the house cleaning inexpertly but doggedly while her mother sat in the kitchen smoking and staring out of the back window shortly before midday a woman pulled up outside the house in an old blue vauxhall krystal caught sight of her from robbies bedroom window the visitor had very short dark hair and was wearing black trousers a beaded ethnic sort of necklace and carrying a large tote bag over her shoulder that seemed to be full of files krystal ran downstairs i think its er she called to terri who was in the kitchen the social the woman knocked and krystal opened the door hello im kay im covering for mattie you must be krystal yeah said krystal not bothering to return kays smile she showed her into the sitting room and saw her take in its new ramshackle tidiness the emptied ashtray and most of the stuff that had been lying around was crammed onto the broken shelves the carpet was still filthy because the hoover did not work and the towel and the zinc ointment were lying on the floor with one of robbies matchbox cars perched on top of the plastic tub krystal had tried to distract robbie with the car while she scraped his bottom clean robbies at nursery krystal told kay ive took im ive put im back in pants she keeps puttin im back in pullups ive told er not to i put cream on his bum itll be all right its ony nappy rash kay smiled at her again krystal peered around the doorway and shouted mum terri joined them from the kitchen she was wearing a dirty old sweatshirt and jeans and looked better for being more covered up hello terri said kay all righ said terri taking a deep drag from her cigarette siddown krystal instructed her mother who obeyed curling up in the same chair as before dyer wanna cup of tea or summat krystal asked kay thatd be great said kay sitting down and opening her folder thanks krystal hurried out of the room she was listening carefully trying to make out what kay was saying to her mother you probably werent expecting to see me again this soon terri she heard kay say she had a strange accent it sounded like a london one like the posh new bitch at school half the boys had stiffies for but i was quite concerned about robbie yesterday hes back at nursery today krystal says yeah said terri she took im she come back this morning shes come back where has she been i jus bin at a jus slep over at a friends said krystal hurrying back to the sitting room to speak for herself yeah bu she come back this morning said terri krystal went back to the kettle it made such a racket as it came to the boil that she could not make out any of what her mother and the social worker were saying to each other she sloshed milk into the mugs with the teabags trying to be as quick as possible then carried the three redhot mugs through to the sitting room in time to hear kay say spoke to mrs harper at the nursery yesterday tha bitch said terri there yare krystal told kay setting the teas on the floor and turning one of the mugs so that its handle faced her thanks very much kay said terri mrs harper told me that robbie has been absent a lot over the last three months he hasnt had a full week for a while has he wha said terri no e ain yeah e as e only jus mist yesterday an when e had his sore throat when was that wha monf go monfna alf bout krystal sat down on the arm of her mothers chair she glared down at kay from her position of height energetically chewing gum her arms folded like her mothers kay had a thick open folder on her lap krystal hated folders all the stuff they wrote about you and kept and used against you afterwards i takes robbie to the nursry she said on my way to school well according to mrs harper robbies attendance has fallen off quite a bit said kay looking down the notes she had made of her conversation with the nursery manager the thing is terri you did commit to keeping robbie in preschool when he was returned to you last year i ain fuckin terri began no shurrup righ krystal said loudly to her mother she addressed kay he were ill righ his tonsils were all up i got im antibiotics off the doctor and when was that tha was bout free weeks anyway righ when i was here yesterday kay said addressing robbies mother again krystal was chewing vigorously her arms making a double barrier around her ribs you seemed to be finding it very difficult to respond to robbies needs terri krystal glanced down at her mother her spreading thigh was twice as thick as terris i din i never terri changed her mind es fine a suspicion darkened krystals mind like the shadow of some circling vulture terri youd used when i arrived yesterday hadnt you no i fuckin hadn thas a fuckin youre fuckin i ain used all righ a weight was pressing on krystals lungs and her ears were ringing obbo must have given her mother not a single bag but a bundle the social worker had seen her blasted terri would test positive at bellchapel next time and they would chuck her out again and without methadone they would return again to that nightmare place where terri became feral when she would again start opening her brokentoothed mouth for strangers dicks so she could feed her veins and robbie would be taken away again and this time he might not come back in a little red plastic heart hanging from the keyring in krystals pocket was a picture of robbie aged one krystals real heart had started pounding the way it did when she rowed full stretch pulling pulling through the water her muscles singing watching the other crew slide backwards you fuckin she shouted but nobody heard her because terri was still bawling at kay who sat with her mug held in her hands looking unmoved i ain fuckin used you ain go no proof you fuckin stupid said krystal louder i ain fuckin used thas a fuckin lie screamed terri an animal snared in a net thrashing around tangling herself tighter i never fuckin did righ i never theyll kick you out the fuckin clinic again you stupid fuckin bitch don you dare fuckin talk ter me like tha all right said kay loudly over the din putting her mug back on the floor and standing up scared at what she had unleashed then she shouted terri in real alarm as terri hoisted herself up in the chair to half crouch on its other arm facing her daughter like two gargoyles they were almost nose to nose screaming krystal cried kay as krystal raised her fist krystal flung herself violently off the chair away from her mother she was surprised to feel warm liquid flowing down her cheeks and thought confusedly of blood but it was tears only tears clear and shining on her fingertips when she wiped them away all right said kay unnerved lets calm down please you fuckin calm down krystal said shaking she wiped her face with her forearm then marched back over to her mothers chair terri flinched but krystal merely snatched up the cigarette packet slid out the last cigarette and a lighter and lit up puffing on the cigarette she walked away from her mother to the window and turned her back trying to press away more tears before they fell ok said kay still standing if we can talk about this calmly oh fuck off said terri dully this is about robbie kay said she was still on her feet scared to relax thats what im here for to make sure that robbie is all right so e missed fuckin nursery said krystal from the window thas norra fuckin crime norra fuckin crime agreed terri in a dim echo this isnt only about nursery said kay robbie was uncomfortable and sore when i saw him yesterday hes much too old to be wearing a nappy i took im outta the fuckin nappy es in pants now i toldja said krystal furiously im sorry terri said kay but you werent in any fit condition to have sole charge of a small child i never you can keep telling me you havent used kay said and krystal heard something real and human in kays voice for the first time exasperation irritation but youre going to be tested at the clinic we both know youre going to test positive theyre saying its your last chance that theyll throw you out again terri wiped her mouth with the back of her hand look i can see neither of you wants to lose robbie don fuckin take him away then shouted krystal its not as simple as that said kay she sat down again and lifted the heavy folder back onto her lap from the floor where it had fallen when robbie came back to you last year terri you were off the heroin you made a big commitment to staying clean and going through the programme and you agreed to certain other things like keeping robbie in nursery yeh an i took im for a bit said kay for a bit you did but terri a token effort isnt enough after what i found when i called here yesterday and after talking to your key drug worker and to mrs harper im afraid i think we need to have another look at how things are working whats that mean said krystal another fuckin case review is it whydjer need one though whydjer need one hes all righ im lookin after fuckin shurrup she screamed at terri who was trying to shout along from her chair she ain im lookin after im all righ she bellowed at kay pink in the face her heavily kohled eyes brimming with tears of anger jabbing a finger at her own chest krystal had visited robbie regularly at his foster parents during the month he had been away from them he had clung to her wanted her to stay for tea cried when she left it had been like having half your guts cut out of you and held hostage krystal had wanted robbie to go to nana caths the way she had gone all those times in her childhood whenever terri had fallen apart but nana cath was old and frail now and she had no time for robbie i understand that you love your brother and that youre doing your best for him krystal kay said but youre not robbies legal why ain i im his fuckin sister ain i all right said kay firmly terri i think we need to face facts here bellchapel will definitely throw you off the programme if you turn up claim you havent used and then test positive your drug worker made that perfectly clear to me on the phone shrunken in the armchair a strange hybrid of old lady and child with her missing teeth terris gaze was vacant and inconsolable i think the only way you can possibly avoid being thrown out kay went on is to admit up front that youve used take responsibility for the lapse and show your commitment to turning over a new leaf terri simply stared lying was the only way terri knew to meet her many accusers yeah all righ go on then give it ere and then no i never no i ain i never fuckin did was there any particular reason you used heroin this week when youre already on a big dose of methadone kay asked yeah said krystal yeah because obbo turned up an she never fuckin says no to im shurrup said terri but without heat she seemed to be trying to take in what kay had said to her this bizarre dangerous advice about telling the truth obbo repeated kay whos obbo fuckin tosser said krystal your dealer asked kay shurrup terri advised krystal again why didn yeh jus tell im fuckin no krystal shouted at her mother all right said kay again terri im going to call your drug worker back im going to try and persuade her that i think there would be a benefit to the family from your staying on the programme will yeh asked krystal astonished she had been thinking of kay as a huge bitch a bigger bitch even than that foster mother with her spotless kitchen and the way she had of speaking kindly to krystal which made krystal feel like a piece of shit yes said kay i will but terri as far as were concerned i mean the child protection team this is serious we are going to have to monitor robbies home situation closely we need to see a change terri all righ yeah said terri agreeing as she agreed to everything to everyone but krystal said you will yeah she will ill help er she will ii shirley mollison spent wednesdays at south west general in yarvil here she and a dozen fellow volunteers performed nonmedical jobs such as pushing the library trolley around the beds looking after patients flowers and making trips to the shop in the lobby for those who were bedridden and without visitors shirleys favourite activity was going from bed to bed taking orders for meals once carrying her clipboard and wearing her laminated pass she had been mistaken by a passing doctor for a hospital administrator the idea of volunteering had come to shirley during her longest ever conversation with julia fawley during one of the wonderful christmas parties at sweetlove house here she had learned that julia was involved in fundraising for the paediatric wing of the local hospital what we really need is a royal visit julia had said her eyes straying to the door over shirleys shoulder im going to get aubrey to have a quiet word with norman bailey excuse me i must say hello to lawrence shirley was left standing there beside the grand piano saying oh of course of course to thin air she had no idea who norman bailey was but she felt quite lightheaded the very next day without even telling howard what she was up to she telephoned south west general and asked about volunteer work ascertaining that nothing was required but a blameless character a sound mind and strong legs she had demanded an application form volunteer work had opened a whole new glorious world to shirley this was the dream that julia fawley had inadvertently handed her beside the grand piano that of herself standing with her hands clasped demurely in front of her her laminated pass around her neck while the queen moved slowly down a line of beaming helpers she saw herself dropping a perfect curtsy the queens attention caught she stopped to chat she congratulated shirley on generously giving her free time a flash and a photograph and the newspapers next day the queen chats to hospital volunteer mrs shirley mollison sometimes when shirley really concentrated on this imaginary scene an almost holy feeling came over her volunteering at the hospital had given shirley a glittering new weapon with which to whittle down maureens pretentions when kens widow had been transformed cinderellalike from shopgirl to business partner she had taken on airs that shirley though enduring it all with a pussycat smile found infuriating but shirley had retaken the higher ground she worked not for profit but out of the goodness of her heart it was classy to volunteer it was what women did who had no need of extra cash women like herself and julia fawley what was more the hospital gave shirley access to a vast mine of gossip to drown out maureens tedious prattling about the new café this morning shirley stated her preference for ward twentyeight in a firm voice to the volunteer supervisor and was duly sent off to the oncology department she had made her only friend among the nursing staff on ward twentyeight some of the young nurses could be curt and patronizing to the volunteers but ruth price who had recently returned to nursing after a break of sixteen years had been charming from the first they were both as shirley put it pagford women which made a bond though as it happened shirley was not pagfordborn she and her younger sister had grown up with their mother in a cramped and untidy flat in yarvil shirleys mother had drunk a lot she had never divorced the girls father whom they did not see local men had all seemed to know shirleys mothers name and smirked when they said it but that was a long time ago and shirley took the view that the past disintegrated if you never mentioned it she refused to remember shirley and ruth greeted each other with delight but it was a busy morning and there was no time for anything but the most rudimentary exchange about barry fairbrothers sudden death they agreed to meet for lunch at halfpast twelve and shirley strode off to fetch the library trolley she was in a wonderful mood she could see the future as clearly as if it had already happened howard miles and aubrey fawley were going to unite to cut the fields adrift for ever and this would be the occasion for a celebratory dinner at sweetlove house shirley found the place dazzling the enormous garden with its sundial its topiary hedges and its ponds the wide panelled hallway the silverframed photograph on the grand piano showing the owner sharing a joke with the princess royal she detected no condescension whatsoever in the fawleys attitude towards her or her husband but then there were so many distracting scents competing for her attention whenever she came within the fawleys orbit she could just imagine the five of them sitting down to a private dinner in one of those delicious little side rooms howard sitting next to julia she on aubreys right hand and miles in between them in shirleys fantasy samantha was unavoidably detained elsewhere shirley and ruth found each other by the yoghurts at halfpast twelve the clattering hospital canteen was not yet as crowded as it would be by one and the nurse and the volunteer found without too much difficulty a sticky crumbstrewn table for two against the wall hows simon how are the boys asked shirley when ruth had wiped down the table and they had decanted the contents of their trays and sat facing each other ready for chat sis fine thanks fine bringing home our new computer today the boys cant wait you can imagine this was quite untrue andrew and paul both possessed cheap laptops the pc sat in the corner of the tiny sitting room and neither boy touched it preferring to do nothing that took them within the vicinity of their father ruth often spoke of her sons to shirley as though they were much younger than they were portable tractable easily amused perhaps she sought to make herself younger to emphasize the age difference between herself and shirley which stood at nearly two decades to make them even more like mother and daughter ruths mother had died ten years previously she missed having an older woman in her life and shirleys relationship with her own daughter was she had hinted to ruth not all it could have been miles and i have always been very close patricia though she was always rather a difficult character shes up in london now ruth longed to probe but a quality that she and shirley shared and admired in each other was a genteel reticence a pride in presenting an unruffled surface to the world ruth laid her piqued curiosity aside therefore though not without a private hope that she would find out in due course what made patricia so difficult shirley and ruths instant liking for each other had been rooted in their mutual recognition that the other was a woman like herself a woman whose deepest pride lay in having captured and retained the affection of her husband like freemasons they shared a fundamental code and were therefore secure in each others company in a way that they were not with other women their complicity was still more enjoyable for being spiced by a sense of superiority because each secretly pitied the other for her choice of husband to ruth howard was physically grotesque and she was puzzled to understand how her friend who retained a plump yet delicate prettiness could ever have agreed to marry him to shirley who could not remember ever setting eyes on simon who had never heard him mentioned in connection with the higher workings of pagford and who understood ruth to lack even a rudimentary social life ruths husband sounded a reclusive inadequate so i saw miles and samantha bringing barry in ruth said launching into the main subject without preamble she had much less conversational finesse than shirley finding it difficult to disguise her greed for pagford gossip of which she was deprived stuck high on the hill above town isolated by simons unsociability did they actually see it happen oh yes said shirley they were having dinner at the golf club sunday night you know the girls were back at school and sam prefers eating out shes not much of a cook bit by bit over their shared coffee breaks ruth had learned some of the inside story of miles and samanthas marriage shirley had told her how her son had been obliged to marry samantha because samantha had fallen pregnant with lexie theyve made the best of it shirley sighed brightly brave miles did the right thing i wouldnt have had it any other way the girls are lovely its a pity miles didnt have a son he would have been wonderful with a boy but sam didnt want a third ruth treasured up every veiled criticism shirley made of her daughterinlaw she had taken an immediate dislike to samantha years before when she had accompanied fouryearold andrew to the nursery class at st thomass and there met samantha and her daughter lexie with her loud laugh and her boundless cleavage and a fine line in risqué jokes for the schoolyard mothers samantha had struck ruth as dangerously predatory for years ruth had watched scornfully as samantha stuck out her massive chest while talking to vikram jawanda at parents evenings and steered simon around the edge of classrooms to avoid having to talk to her shirley was still recounting the secondhand tale of barrys final journey giving all possible weight to miles quick thinking in calling the ambulance to his support of mary fairbrother to his insistence on remaining with her at the hospital until the walls arrived ruth listened attentively though with a slight impatience shirley was much more entertaining when she was enumerating the inadequacies of samantha than when extolling the virtues of miles what was more ruth was bursting with something thrilling that she wished to tell shirley so theres an empty seat on the parish council ruth said the moment that shirley reached the point in the story where miles and samantha ceded the stage to colin and tessa wall we call it a casual vacancy said shirley kindly ruth took a deep breath simon she said excited at the mere telling of it is thinking of standing shirley smiled automatically raised her eyebrows in polite surprise and took a sip of tea to hide her face ruth was completely unaware that she had said anything to discompose her friend she had assumed that shirley would be delighted to think of their husbands sitting on the parish council together and had a vague notion that shirley might be helpful in bringing this about he told me last night ruth went on importantly hes been thinking about it for a while certain other things that simon had said about the possibility of taking over bribes from grays to keep them on as council contractors ruth had pushed out of her mind as she pushed out all of simons little dodges his petty criminalities i had no idea simon was interested in getting involved in local government said shirley her tone light and pleasant oh yes said ruth who had had no idea either hes very keen has he been talking to dr jawanda asked shirley sipping her tea again did she suggest standing to him ruth was thrown by this and her genuine puzzlement showed no i simon hasnt been to the doctor in ages i mean hes very healthy shirley smiled if he was acting alone without the support of the jawanda faction then the threat posed by simon was surely negligible she even pitied ruth who was in for a nasty surprise she shirley who knew everybody who counted in pagford would have been hardpressed to recognize ruths husband if he came into the delicatessen who on earth did poor ruth think would vote for him on the other hand shirley knew that there was one question that howard and aubrey would want her to ask as a matter of routine simons always lived in pagford hasnt he no he was born in the fields said ruth ah said shirley she peeled back the foil lid of her yoghurt picked up her spoon and took a thoughtful mouthful the fact that simon was likely to have a profields bias was whatever his electoral prospects worth knowing will it be on the website how you put your name forward ruth asked still hoping for a late gush of helpfulness and enthusiasm oh yes said shirley vaguely i expect so iii andrew fats and twentyseven others spent the last period on wednesday afternoon in what fats called spazmatics this was the secondfrombottom maths set taken by the departments most incompetent teacher a blotchyfaced young woman fresh from teacher training who was incapable of keeping good order and who often seemed to be on the verge of tears fats who had set himself on a course of determined underachievement over the previous year had been demoted to spazmatics from the top set andrew who had struggled with numbers all his life lived in fear that he would be relegated to the very bottom set along with krystal weedon and her cousin dane tully andrew and fats sat at the back of the room together occasionally when he had tired of entertaining the class or whipping it into further disruption fats would show andrew how to do a sum the level of noise was deafening miss harvey shouted over the top of them all begging for quiet worksheets were defaced by obscenities people got up constantly to visit each others desks scraping their chair legs across the floor small missiles flew across the room whenever miss harvey looked away sometimes fats made excuses to walk up and down the room imitating cubbys bouncy upanddown stiffarmed walk fats humour was at its broadest here in english where he and andrew were both in the top set he did not bother to use cubby for material sukhvinder jawanda was sitting directly in front of andrew long ago in primary school andrew fats and the other boys had pulled sukhvinders long blueblack plait it was the easiest thing to catch hold of when playing tag and it had once presented an irresistible temptation when dangling like now down her back hidden from the teacher but andrew no longer had any desire to tug it nor to touch any part of sukhvinder she was one of the few girls over whom his eyes glided without the slightest interest since fats had pointed it out he had noticed the soft dark down on her upper lip sukhvinders older sister jaswant had a lithe curvy figure a tiny waist and a face that prior to the advent of gaia had seemed beautiful to andrew with its high cheekbones smooth golden skin and almondshaped liquidbrown eyes naturally jaswant had always been completely beyond his reach two years older and the cleverest girl in the sixth form with an aura of being aware to the last hardon of her own attractions sukhvinder was the only person in the room who was making absolutely no noise with her back hunched and her head bent low over her work she appeared to be cocooned in concentration she had pulled the left sleeve of her jumper down so that it completely covered her hand enclosing the cuff to make a woolly fist her total stillness was almost ostentatious the great hermaphrodite sits quiet and still murmured fats his eyes fixed on the back of sukhvinders head moustachioed yet largemammaried scientists remain baffled by the contradictions of the hairy manwoman andrew sniggered yet he was not entirely at his ease he would have enjoyed himself more if he knew that sukhvinder could not hear what fats was saying the last time that he had been over at fats house fats had shown him the messages he was sending regularly to sukhvinders facebook page he had been scouring the internet for information and pictures about hirsutism and was sending a quotation or an image a day it was sort of funny but it made andrew uncomfortable strictly speaking sukhvinder was not asking for it she seemed a very easy target andrew liked it best when fats directed his savage tongue towards figures of authority the pretentious or the selfsatisfied separated from its bearded brawearing herd said fats it sits lost in thought wondering whether it would suit a goatee andrew laughed then felt guilty but fats lost interest and turned his attention to transforming every zero on his worksheet into a puckered anus andrew reverted to trying to guess where the decimal point should go and contemplating the prospect of the school bus home and gaia it was always much more difficult to find a seat where he might keep her in his eyeline on the schooltohome trip because she was frequently boxed in before he got there or too far away their shared amusement in monday mornings assembly had led nowhere she had not made eye contact with him on the bus either morning since nor in any other way demonstrated that she knew he existed in the four weeks of his infatuation andrew had never actually spoken to gaia he attempted to formulate opening lines while the din of spazmatics crashed around him that was funny monday in assembly sukhvinder are you all right miss harvey who had bent down over sukhvinders work to mark it was gawping into the girls face andrew watched sukhvinder nod and draw in her hands obscuring her face still hunched up over her work wallah stagewhispered kevin cooper from two rows in front wallah peanut he was trying to draw their attention to what they already knew that sukhvinder judging by the gentle quivering of her shoulders was crying and that miss harvey was making hopeless harried attempts to find out what was wrong the class detecting a further lapse in their teachers vigilance raged louder than ever peanut wallah andrew could never decide whether kevin cooper irritated intentionally or accidentally but he had an infallible knack for grating on people the nickname peanut was a very old one which had clung to andrew in primary school he had always hated it fats had forced the name out of fashion by never using it fats had always been the final arbiter in such matters cooper was even getting fats name wrong wallah had enjoyed only a brief popularity last year peanut wallah fuck off cooper you glansheaded moron said fats under his breath cooper was hanging over the back of his seat staring at sukhvinder who had curled over her face almost touching the desk while miss harvey crouched beside her her hands fluttering comically forbidden to touch her and unable to elicit any explanation for her distress a few more people had noticed this unusual disturbance and were staring but at the front of the room several boys continued to rampage oblivious to everything but their own amusement one of them seized the woodbacked board rubber from miss harveys vacated desk he threw it the rubber soared right across the room and crashed into the clock on the back wall which plummeted to the ground and shattered shards of plastic and metal innards flew everywhere and several girls including miss harvey shrieked in shock the door of the classroom flew open and bounced with a bang off the wall the class fell quiet cubby was standing there flushed and furious what is going on in this room what is all this noise miss harvey shot up like a jackinabox beside sukhvinders desk looking guilty and frightened miss harvey your class is making an almighty racket whats going on miss harvey seemed struck dumb kevin cooper hung over the back of his chair grinning looking from miss harvey to cubby to fats and back again fats spoke well to be perfectly frank father weve been running rings around this poor woman laughter exploded miss harveys neck was disfigured by a rising maroon rash fats balanced himself nonchalantly on the rear legs of his chair his face perfectly straight looking at cubby with challenging detachment thats enough said cubby if i hear any more noise like that from this class ill put the whole lot of you in detention do you understand all of you he shut the door on their laughter you heard the deputy headmaster cried miss harvey scurrying to the front of the room be quiet i want quiet you andrew and you stuart you can clear up that mess pick up all those bits of clock they set up a routine cry of injustice at this supported shrilly by a couple of the girls the actual perpetrators of the destruction of whom everybody knew miss harvey was afraid sat smirking at their desks as there were only five minutes remaining until the end of the school day andrew and fats set about stringing out the clearing up until they would be able to abandon it unfinished while fats garnered further laughs by bouncing hither and thither stiffarmed doing the cubby walk sukhvinder wiped her eyes surreptitiously with her woolcovered hand and sank back into obscurity when the bell rang miss harvey made no attempt to control or contain the thunderous clamour or rush for the door andrew and fats kicked various bits of clock under the cupboards at the back of the room and swung their school bags over their shoulders again wallah wallah called kevin cooper hurrying to catch up with andrew and fats as they headed down the corridor do you call cubby father at home seriously do you he thought he had something on fats he thought he had got him youre a dickhead cooper said fats wearily and andrew laughed iv dr jawandas running about fifteen minutes late the receptionist told tessa oh thats fine said tessa im in no hurry it was early evening and the waitingroom windows made patches of clear royal blue against the walls there were only two other people there a misshapen wheezing old woman wearing carpet slippers and a young mother who was reading a magazine while her toddler rummaged in the toy box in the corner tessa took a battered old heat magazine from the table in the middle sat down and flicked through the pages looking at the pictures the delay gave her more time to think about what she was going to say to parminder they had spoken briefly on the telephone this morning tessa had been full of contrition that she had not called at once to let parminder know about barry parminder had said it was fine for tessa not to be silly that she was not upset at all but tessa with her lengthy experience of the thinskinned and fragile could tell that parminder beneath her prickly carapace was wounded she had tried to explain that she had been utterly exhausted the last couple of days and that she had had to deal with mary colin fats krystal weedon that she had felt overwhelmed lost and incapable of thinking of more than the immediate problems that had been thrown at her but parminder had cut her off in the middle of her rambling excuses and said calmly that she would see her later at the surgery dr crawford emerged whitehaired and bearlike from his room gave tessa a cheery wave and said maisie lawford the young mother had some difficulty in persuading her daughter to abandon the old toy telephone on wheels that the latter had found in the toy box while being pulled gently by the hand after dr crawford the little girl gazed longingly over her shoulder at the telephone whose secrets she would never now discover when the door closed on them tessa realized that she was smiling fatuously and hastily rearranged her own features she was going to become one of those awful old ladies who cooed indiscriminately over small children and frightened them she would have loved a chubby little blonde daughter to go with her skinny dark boy how awful it was thought tessa remembering fats the toddler the way tiny ghosts of your living children haunted your heart they could never know and would hate it if they did how their growing was a constant bereavement parminders door opened tessa looked up mrs weedon said parminder her eyes met tessas and she gave a smile that was no smile at all but a mere tightening of the mouth the little old lady in carpet slippers got up with difficulty and hobbled away around the partition wall after parminder tessa heard parminders surgery door snap shut she read the captions to a series of photographs showing a footballers wife in all the different outfits she had worn over the previous five days studying the young womans long thin legs tessa wondered how different her life would have been if she had had legs like that she could not help but suspect that it would have been almost entirely different tessas legs were thick shapeless and short she would have hidden them perpetually in boots only it was difficult to find many that would zip up over her calves she remembered telling a sturdy little girl in guidance that looks did not matter that personality was much more important what rubbish we tell children thought tessa turning the page of her magazine an outofsight door opened with a bang somebody was shouting in a cracked voice youre makin me bloody worse this int right ive come to you for help its your job its your tessa and the receptionist locked eyes then turned towards the sound of the shouting tessa heard parminders voice its brummie accent still discernible after all these years in pagford mrs weedon youre still smoking which affects the dose i have to prescribe you if youd give up your cigarettes smokers metabolize theophylline more quickly so the cigarettes are not only worsening your emphysema but actually affecting the ability of the drug to don you shout at me ive ad enough of you ill report you youve gave me the wrong fuckin pills i wanna see someone else i wanna see dr crawford the old lady appeared around the wall wobbling wheezing her face scarlet shell be the death of me that paki cow don you go near er she shouted at tessa shell fuckin kill yer with her drugs the paki bitch she tottered towards the exit spindleshanked unsteady on her slippered feet her breath rattling swearing as loudly as her beleaguered lungs would permit the door swung shut behind her the receptionist exchanged another look with tessa they heard parminders surgery door close again it was five minutes before parminder reappeared the receptionist stared ostentatiously at her screen mrs wall said parminder with another tight nonsmile what was that about tessa asked when she had taken a seat at the end of parminders desk mrs weedons new pills are upsetting her stomach said parminder calmly so were doing your bloods today arent we yes said tessa both intimidated and hurt by parminders cold professional demeanour how are you doing minda me said parminder im fine why well barry i know what he meant to you and what you meant to him tears welled in parminders eyes and she tried to blink them away but too late tessa had seen them minda she said laying her plump hand on parminders thin one but parminder whipped it away as if tessa had stung her then betrayed by her own reflex she began to cry in earnest unable to hide in the tiny room though she had turned her back as nearly as she could in her swivel chair i felt sick when i realized i hadnt phoned you tessa said over parminders furious attempts to quell her own sobs i wanted to curl up and die i meant to call she lied but we hadnt slept we spent almost the whole night at the hospital then we had to go straight out to work colin broke down at assembly when he announced it then he caused a bloody awful scene with krystal weedon in front of everyone and then stuart decided to play truant and marys falling apart but im so sorry minda i shouldve called iculous said parminder thickly her face hidden behind a tissue she had pulled out from her sleeve mary most important you would have been one of the very first people barry called said tessa sadly and to her horror she burst into tears too minda im so sorry she sobbed but i was having to deal with colin and all the rest of them dont be silly said parminder gulping as she dabbed at her thin face were being silly no were not oh let go for once parminder but the doctor squared her thin shoulders blew her nose and sat up straight again did vikram tell you asked tessa timidly tweaking a handful of tissues from the box on parminders desk no said parminder howard mollison in the deli oh god minda im so sorry dont be silly its fine crying had made parminder feel slightly better friendlier towards tessa who was wiping her own plain kind face this was a relief for now that barry was gone tessa was parminders only real friend in pagford she always said in pagford to herself pretending that somewhere beyond the little town she had a hundred loyal friends she never quite admitted to herself that these consisted only of the memories of her gang of school mates back in birmingham from whom the tide of life had long since separated her and the medical colleagues with whom she had studied and trained who still sent christmas cards but who never came to see her and whom she never visited hows colin tessa moaned oh minda oh god he says hes going to run for barrys seat on the parish council the pronounced vertical furrow between parminders thick dark brows deepened can you imagine colin running for election tessa asked her sodden tissues crumpled tightly in her fist coping with the likes of aubrey fawley and howard mollison trying to fill barrys shoes telling himself hes got to win the battle for barry all the responsibility colin copes with a lot of responsibility at work said parminder barely said tessa without thinking she felt instantly disloyal and started to cry again it was so strange she had entered the surgery thinking that she would offer comfort to parminder but instead here she was pouring out her own troubles instead you know what colins like he takes everything to heart so much he takes everything so personally he copes very well you know all things considered said parminder oh i know he does said tessa wearily the fight seemed to go out of her i know colin was almost the only person towards whom stern selfcontained parminder showed ready compassion in return colin would never hear a word against her he was her dogged champion in pagford an excellent gp he would snap at anyone who dared to criticize her in his hearing best ive ever had parminder did not have many defenders she was unpopular with the pagford old guard having a reputation for being grudging with antibiotics and repeat prescriptions if howard mollison gets his way there wont be an election at all said parminder what dyou mean hes sent round an email it came in half an hour ago parminder turned to her computer monitor typed in a password and brought up her inbox she angled the monitor so that tessa could read howards message the first paragraph expressed regret at barrys death the next suggested that in view of the fact that a year of barrys term had already expired coopting a replacement might be preferable to going through the onerous process of a full election hes lined someone up already said parminder hes trying to crowbar in some crony before anyone can stop him i wouldnt be surprised if it was miles oh surely not said tessa instantly miles was at the hospital with barry no he was very upset by it youre so damn naive tessa said parminder and tessa was shocked by the savagery in her friends voice you dont understand what howard mollisons like hes a vile man vile you didnt hear him when he found out that barry had written to the paper about the fields you dont know what hes trying to do with the methadone clinic you wait youll see her hand was trembling so much that it took her a few attempts to close down mollisons email youll see she repeated all right wed better get on laura needs to go in a minute ill check your blood pressure first parminder was doing tessa a favour seeing her late like this after school the practice nurse who lived in yarvil was going to drop off tessas blood sample to the hospital lab on her way home feeling nervous and oddly vulnerable tessa rolled up the sleeve of the old green cardigan the doctor wound the velcro cuff around her upper arm at close quarters parminders strong resemblance to her second daughter was revealed for their different builds parminder being wiry and sukhvinder buxom became indiscernible and the similarity of their facial features emerged the hawkish nose the wide mouth with its full lower lip and the large round dark eyes the cuff tightened painfully around tessas flabby upper arm while parminder watched the gauge one sixtyfive over eightyeight said parminder frowning thats high tessa too high deft and skilful in all her movements she stripped the wrapping from a sterile syringe straightened out tessas pale molestrewn arm and slid the needle into the crook im taking stuart into yarvil tomorrow night tessa said looking up at the ceiling to get him a suit for the funeral i cant stand the scene therell be if he tries to go in jeans colinll go berserk she was trying to divert her own thoughts from the dark mysterious liquid flowing up into the little plastic tube she was afraid that it would betray her that she had not been as good as she should have been that all the chocolate bars and muffins she had eaten would show up as traitorous glucose then she thought bitterly that it would be much easier to resist chocolate if her life were less stressful given that she spent nearly all her time trying to help other people it was hard to see muffins as so very naughty as she watched parminder labelling vials of her blood she found herself hoping though her husband and friend might think it heresy that howard mollison would triumph and prevent an election happening at all v simon price left the printworks on the stroke of five every day without fail he had put in his hours and that was that home was waiting clean and cool high on the hill a world away from the perpetual clank and whirr of the yarvil plant to linger in the factory after clockingoff time though now a manager simon had never ceased to think in the terms of his apprenticeship would constitute a fatal admission that your home life was lacking or worse that you were trying to brownnose senior management today though simon needed to make a detour before going home he met up with the gumchewing forklift driver in the car park and together they drove through the darkening streets with the boy giving directions into the fields actually passing the house in which simon had grown up he had not been past the place for years his mother was dead and he had not seen his father since he was fourteen and did not know where he was it unsettled and depressed simon to see his old home with one window boarded over and the grass ankledeep his late mother had been house proud the youth told simon to park at the end of foley road then got out leaving simon behind and headed towards a house of particularly squalid appearance from what simon could see by the light of the nearest streetlamp it seemed to have a pile of filth heaped beneath a downstairs window it was only now that simon asked himself how sensible it had been to come and pick up the stolen computer in his own car these days surely they would have cctv on the estate to keep an eye on all the little thugs and hoodies he glanced around but he could not see any cameras nobody seemed to be looking at him except a fat woman who was openly staring through one of the small square institutionallooking windows simon scowled at her but she continued to watch him as she smoked her cigarette so he screened his face with his hand glaring through the windscreen his passenger was already emerging from the house straddling a little as he walked back towards the car carrying the boxed computer behind him in the doorway of the house he had left simon saw an adolescent girl with a small boy at her feet who stepped out of sight as he watched dragging the child with her simon turned the key in the ignition revving the engine as the gumchewer came nearer careful said simon leaning across to unlock the passenger door just put it down here the boy set the box down on the stillwarm passenger seat simon had intended to open it and check that it was what he had paid for but a growing sense of his own imprudence overrode the desire he contented himself with giving the box a shove it was too heavy to move easily he wanted to get going you all right if i leave you here he called loudly to the boy as if he was already speeding away from him in the car can you give us a lift up to the crannock hotel sorry mate im going the other way said simon cheers simon accelerated in his rearview mirror he saw the boy standing there looking outraged saw his lips form the words fuck you but simon didnt care if he cleared out quickly he might avoid his number plate being captured on one of those grainy black and white films they played back on the news he reached the bypass ten minutes later but even after he had left yarvil behind quitted the dual carriageway and driven up the hill towards the ruined abbey he was ruffled and tense and experienced none of the satisfaction that was usually his when he crested the peak in the evenings and caught the first glimpse of his own house far across the hollow where pagford lay a tiny white handkerchief on the opposite hillside though she had been home barely ten minutes ruth already had dinner on and was laying the table when simon carried the computer inside they kept early hours in hilltop house as was simons preference ruths exclamations of excitement at the sight of the box irritated her husband she did not understand what he had been through she never understood that there were risks involved in getting stuff cheap for her part ruth sensed at once that simon was in one of the tightly wound moods that often presaged an explosion and coped the only way she knew how by jabbering brightly about her day in the hope that the mood would dissolve once he had food inside him and as long as nothing else happened to irritate him promptly at six oclock by which time simon had unboxed the computer and discovered that there was no instruction manual the family sat down to eat andrew could tell that his mother was on edge because she was making random conversation with a familiar artificially cheery note in her voice she seemed to think despite years of contrary experience that if she made the atmosphere polite enough his father would not dare shatter it andrew helped himself to shepherds pie made by ruth and defrosted on work nights and avoided eye contact with simon he had more interesting things to think about than his parents gaia bawden had said hi to him when he had come face to face with her outside the biology lab said it automatically and casually but had not looked at him once all lesson andrew wished he knew more about girls he had never got to know one well enough to fathom how their minds worked the yawning gap in his knowledge had not mattered much until gaia had walked onto the school bus for the first time and provoked in him a lasersharp interest focused on her as an individual a quite different feeling to the wide and impersonal fascination that had been intensifying in him over several years concerned with the sprouting of breasts and the appearance of bra straps through white school shirts and his slightly squeamish interest in what menstruation actually entailed fats had girl cousins who sometimes came to visit once going into the walls bathroom right after the prettiest of them had used it andrew had found a transparent lillets wrapper lying beside the bathroom bin this actual physical evidence that a girl in his vicinity was having a period there and then was to thirteenyearold andrew akin to the sighting of a rare comet he had had enough sense not to tell fats what he had seen or found or how exciting a discovery it had been instead he had picked up the wrapper between his fingernails dropped it quickly into the bin then washed his hands more vigorously than he had ever washed them in his life andrew spent a lot of time staring at gaias facebook page on his laptop it was almost more intimidating than she was in person he spent hours poring over photographs of the people that she had left behind in the capital she came from a different world she had black friends asian friends friends with names he could never have pronounced there was a photograph of her in a swimsuit that was burnt into his brain and another of her leaning up against a filthily goodlooking coffeeskinned boy he had no spots and actual stubble by a process of careful examination of all her messages andrew had concluded that this was an eighteenyearold called marco de luca andrew stared at marcos and gaias communications with the concentration of a codebreaker unable to decide whether they indicated a continuing relationship or not his facebook browsing was often tinged with anxiety because simon whose understanding of how the internet worked was limited and who instinctively mistrusted it as the only area of his sons life where they were freer and more at ease than he would sometimes erupt unexpectedly into their bedrooms to check what they were viewing simon claimed that he was making sure that they were not running up huge bills but andrew knew it to be one more manifestation of his fathers need to exert control and the cursor hovered constantly over the box that would shut the page whenever he was perusing gaias details online ruth was still rattling from topic to topic in a fruitless attempt to make simon produce more than surly monosyllables ooooh she said suddenly i forgot i spoke to shirley today simon about you maybe standing for the parish council the words hit andrew like a punch youre standing for the council he blurted simon slowly raised his eyebrows one of the muscles in his jaw was twitching is that a problem he asked in a voice that throbbed with aggression no lied andrew youve got to be fucking joking you standing for election oh fuck no it sounds like youve got a problem with it said simon still staring straight into andrews eyes no said andrew again dropping his gaze to his shepherds pie whats wrong with me standing for the council simon continued he was not about to let it go he wanted to vent his tension in a cathartic outburst of rage nothings wrong i was surprised thats all should i have consulted you first said simon no oh thank you said simon his lower jaw was protruding as it often did when he was working up to losing control have you found a job yet you skiving sponging little shit no simon glared at andrew not eating but holding a cooling forkful of shepherds pie in midair andrew switched his attention back to his food determined not to offer further provocation the air pressure within the kitchen seemed to have increased pauls knife rattled against his plate shirley says ruth piped up again her voice highpitched determined to pretend all was well until this became impossible that itll be on the council website simon about how you put your name forward simon did not respond her last best attempt thwarted ruth fell silent too she was afraid that she might know what was at the root of simons bad mood anxiety gnawed at her she was a worrier she always had been she couldnt help it she knew that it drove simon mad when she begged him for reassurance she must not say anything si what its all right isnt it about the computer she was a dreadful actress she tried to make her voice casual and calm but it was brittle and highpitched this was not the first time stolen goods had entered their home simon had found a way of fiddling the electricity meter too and did small jobs on the side at the printworks for cash all of it gave her little pains in the stomach kept her awake at night but simon was contemptuous of people who did not dare take the shortcuts and part of what she had loved about him from the beginning was that this rough and wild boy who was contemptuous rude and aggressive to nearly everyone had taken the trouble to attract her that he who was so difficult to please had selected her alone as worthy what are you talking about simon asked quietly the full focus of his attention shifted from andrew to ruth and was expressed by the same unblinking venomous stare well there wont be any any trouble about it will there simon was seized with a brutal urge to punish her for intuiting his own fears and for stoking them with her anxiety yeah well i wasnt going to say anything he said speaking slowly giving himself time to make up a story but there was a bit of trouble when they were nicked as it turns out andrew and paul paused in their eating and stared some security guard got beaten up i didnt know anything about it till it was too late i only hope theres no comeback ruth could barely breathe she could not believe the evenness of his tone the calmness with which he spoke of violent robbery this explained his mood when he had come home this explained everything thats why its essential nobody mentions weve got it said simon he subjected each of them to a fierce glare to impress the dangers on them by sheer force of personality we wont ruth breathed her rapid imagination was already showing her the police at the door the computer examined simon arrested wrongly accused of aggravated assault jailed did you hear dad she said to her sons in a voice barely louder than a whisper you mustnt tell anybody weve got a new computer it should be all right said simon it should be fine as long as everyone keeps their traps shut he turned his attention back to his shepherds pie ruths eyes flittered from simon to her sons and back again paul was pushing food around his plate silent frightened but andrew had not believed a word his father said youre a lying fucking bastard you just like scaring her when the meal was finished simon got up and said well lets see whether the bloody thing works at least you he pointed at paul go and get it out of the box and put it carefully carefully on the stand you he pointed at andrew you do computing dont you you can tell me what to do simon led the way into the sitting room andrew knew that he was trying to catch them out that he wanted them to mess up paul who was small and nervous might drop the computer and he andrew was sure to blunder behind them in the kitchen ruth was clattering around clearing away the dinner things she at least was out of the immediate line of fire andrew went to assist paul as he lifted the hard drive he can do it hes not that much of a pussy snapped simon by a miracle paul his arms trembling set it down on the stand without mishap then waited with his arms dangling limply at his sides blocking simons access to the machine get out of my way you stupid little prick simon shouted paul scurried off to watch from behind the sofa simon picked up a lead at random and addressed andrew where do i put this up your arse you bastard if you give it to me im asking where i fucking put it roared simon you do computing tell me where it goes andrew leaned around the back of the computer he instructed simon wrong at first but then by chance got the right socket they had nearly finished by the time ruth joined them in the sitting room andrew could tell from one fleeting look at her that she did not want the thing to work that she wanted simon to dump it somewhere and never mind the eighty quid simon sat down in front of the monitor after several fruitless attempts he realized that the cordless mouse had no batteries in it paul was sent sprinting from the room to fetch some from the kitchen when he held them out to his father on his return simon snatched them out of his hand as if paul might try and whip them away his tongue down between his lower teeth and his lip so that his chin bulged out stupidly simon made an exaggerated overfiddling business of inserting the batteries he always pulled this mad brutish face as a warning that he was reaching the end of his tether descending into the place where he could not be held accountable for his actions andrew imagined walking out and leaving his father to it depriving him of the audience he preferred when working himself up he could almost feel the mouse hitting him behind the ear as in his imagination he turned his back get fucking in simon began to emit the low animal noise unique to him that matched his aggressively wadded face uhhlll uhhlll cunting thing you fucking do it you youve got pissy little girls fingers simon slammed the control and the batteries into pauls chest pauls hands shook as he fitted the little metal tubes into place he snapped the plastic cover shut and held the controls back out to his father thank you pauline simons chin was still jutting like a neanderthals he habitually acted as though inanimate objects were conspiring to irritate him once again he placed the mouse on the mat let it work a small white arrow appeared on screen and swooped cheerily around at simons command a tourniquet of fear was released relief gushed through three of the watchers simon stopped pulling his neanderthal face andrew visualized a line of japanese men and woman in white coats the people who had assembled this flawless machine all of them with delicate dextrous fingers like pauls they were bowing to him sweetly civilized and gentle silently andrew blessed them and their families they would never know how much had hung on this particular machine working ruth andrew and paul waited attentively while simon put the computer through its paces he brought up menus had difficulty getting rid of them clicked icons whose functions he did not understand and was confused by the outcomes but he had descended from the plateau of dangerous rage having blundered his way back to the desktop he said looking up at ruth seems all right doesnt it its great she said at once forcing a smile as though the last halfhour had not happened he had bought the machine at dixons and connected it without the threat of violence its faster simon much faster than the last one he hasnt opened the internet yet you silly woman yeah i thought that too he glared at his two sons this is brand new and expensive so you two treat it with respect you understand and dont tell anyone weve got it simon added and a gust of renewed malice chilled the room all right do you understand me they nodded again pauls face was tight and pinched unseen by his father he traced a figure of eight on the outside of his leg with his slender forefinger and one of you draw the bloody curtains why are they still open because weve all been standing here watching you behave like a prick andrew pulled the curtains shut and left the room even after he had reached his bedroom and lain back down on his bed andrew was unable to resume his pleasurable meditations on the person of gaia bawden the prospect of his father standing for the council had loomed out of nowhere like some gigantic iceberg casting its shadow over everything even gaia for all of andrews life simon had been a contented prisoner of his own contempt for other people making his house a fortress against the world where his will was law and where his mood constituted the familys daily weather as he had grown older andrew had become aware that his familys almost total isolation was not typical and become slightly embarrassed by it friends parents would ask him where he lived unable to place his family they would ask casual questions about whether his mother or father intended to come to social events or fundraisers sometimes they remembered ruth from the primary school years when mothers mixed in the playground she was much more sociable than simon perhaps if she had not married such an antisocial man she would have been more like fats mother meeting friends for lunch or dinner busily connected to the town on the very rare occasions that simon came face to face with a person whom he felt it worth courting he adopted a saltoftheearth bluff persona that made andrew cringe simon would talk over them crack clumsy jokes and often stepped unwittingly on all kinds of sensitivities because he neither knew anything nor cared much about the people with whom he was forced to converse lately andrew had asked himself whether simon even saw other humans as real why his father had been seized with the aspiration to perform on a wider stage andrew could not fathom but calamity was surely inevitable andrew knew other parents the sort who did sponsored cycle rides to raise money for the squares new christmas lights or ran the brownies or set up book clubs simon did nothing that required collaboration and had never evinced the smallest interest in anything that did not benefit him directly awful visions surged in andrews churning mind simon making a speech larded with the transparent lies that his wife swallowed whole simon pulling his neanderthal face in an attempt to intimidate an opponent simon losing control and starting to spew all his favourite swearwords into a microphone cunting fucking pissy shit andrew pulled his laptop towards him but pushed it away again almost at once he made no move to touch the mobile on his desk this magnitude of anxiety and shame could not be contained in an instant message or a text he was alone with it and even fats would not understand and he did not know what to do friday barry fairbrothers body had been moved to the undertakers the deep black cuts in the white scalp like the grooves of skates on ice were hidden by his forest of thick hair cold waxen and empty the body lay redressed in barrys anniversary dinner shirt and trousers in a dimly lit viewing room where soft music played touches of discreet makeup had returned a lifelike glow to his skin it was almost as though he slept but not quite barrys two brothers his widow and his four children went to bid the body goodbye on the eve of the burial mary had been undecided almost until the minute of departure as to whether she should allow all of the children to see their fathers remains declan was a sensitive boy prone to nightmares it was while she was still in a fever pitch of indecision on friday afternoon that there was an upset colin cubby wall had decided that he wanted to go and say goodbye to barrys body too mary usually compliant and agreeable had found this excessive her voice had grown shrill on the telephone to tessa then she had begun to cry again and said that it was just that she had not planned a large procession past barry that this was really a family affair dreadfully apologetic tessa said that she quite understood and was then left to explain to colin who retreated into a mortified wounded silence he had simply wanted to stand alone beside barrys body and pay silent homage to a man who had occupied a unique place in his life colin had poured truths and secrets he had confided to no other friend into barrys ears and barrys small brown eyes robin bright had never ceased to regard him with warmth and kindness barry had been colins closest ever friend giving him an experience of male comradeship he had never known before moving to pagford and was sure he would never have again that he colin who felt himself to be perpetually the outsider and the oddball for whom life was a matter of daily struggle had managed to forge a friendship with the cheerful popular and eternally optimistic barry had always seemed a small miracle colin clutched what was left of his dignity to him resolved never to hold this against mary and spent the rest of the day meditating on how surprised and hurt barry would have been surely at his widows attitude three miles outside pagford in an attractive cottage called the smithy gavin hughes was trying to fight off an intensifying gloom mary had called earlier in a voice that trembled with the weight of tears she had explained how the children had all contributed ideas for tomorrows funeral service siobhan had grown a sunflower from seed and was going to cut it and put it on top of the coffin all four kids had written letters to put inside the casket with their father mary had composed one too and was going to put it in barrys shirt pocket over his heart gavin put down the receiver sickened he did not want to know about the childrens letters nor about the longnurtured sunflower yet his mind kept returning to these things as he ate lasagne alone at his kitchen table though he would have done anything to avoid reading it he kept trying to imagine what mary had written in her letter a black suit was hanging in drycleaners polythene in his bedroom like an unwelcome guest his appreciation of the honour mary had done him in publicly acknowledging him as one of those closest to the popular barry had long since been overwhelmed by dread by the time he was washing up his plate and cutlery at the sink gavin would have gladly missed the funeral altogether as for the idea of viewing his dead friends body it had not and would never have occurred to him he and kay had had a nasty row the previous evening and had not spoken since it had all been triggered by kay asking gavin if he would like her to go with him to the funeral christ no gavin had said before he could stop himself he had seen her expression and knew instantly that she had heard christ no people will think were a couple christ no why would i want you and although these were precisely his feelings he had attempted to bluff his way through i mean you didnt know him did you itd be a bit weird wouldnt it but kay had let rip tried to corner him to make him tell her what he really felt what he wanted what future he envisioned for the two of them he had fought back with every weapon in his arsenal being alternately obtuse evasive and pedantic for it was wonderful how you could obscure an emotional issue by appearing to seek precision at last she had told him to get out of her house he had obeyed but he knew that it was not over that would be way too much to hope for gavins reflection in the kitchen window was drawn and miserable barrys stolen future seemed to hang over his own life like a looming cliff he felt inadequate and guilty but he still wished that kay would move back to london night drew in over pagford and in the old vicarage parminder jawanda perused her wardrobe wondering what to wear to say goodbye to barry she had several dark dresses and suits any one of which would be appropriate and yet still she looked backwards and forwards along the rail of clothes mired in indecision wear a sari itll upset shirley mollison go on wear a sari it was so stupid to think that mad and wrong and even worse to think it in barrys voice barry was dead she had endured nearly five days of deep grief for him and tomorrow they would bury him in the earth the prospect was unpleasant to parminder she had always hated the idea of interment of a body lying whole under the ground slowly rotting away riddled with maggots and flies the sikh way was to cremate and to scatter the ashes in running water she let her eyes wander up and down the hanging garments but her saris worn to family weddings and gettogethers back in birmingham seemed to call to her what was this strange urge to don one it felt uncharacteristically exhibitionist she reached out to touch the folds of her favourite dark blue and gold she had last worn it to the fairbrothers new years party when barry had attempted to teach her to jive it had been a most unsuccessful experiment mainly because he did not know what he was doing himself but she could remember laughing as she almost never laughed uncontrollably madly the way she had seen drunk women laugh the sari was elegant and feminine forgiving of middleaged spread parminders mother who was eightytwo wore it daily parminder herself had no need of its camouflaging properties she was as slim as she had been at twenty yet she pulled out the long dark length of soft material and held it up against her dressing gown letting it fall to caress her bare feet looking down its length at its subtle embroidery to wear it would feel like a private joke between herself and barry like the cowfaced house and all the funny things barry had said about howard as they walked away from interminable illhumoured council meetings there was a terrible weight on parminders chest but did not the guru granth sahib exhort friends and relatives of the dead not to show grief but to celebrate their loved ones reunion with god in an effort to keep traitorous tears at bay parminder silently intoned the nighttime prayer the kirtan sohila my friend i urge you that this is the opportune time to serve the saints earn divine profit in this world and live in peace and comfort in the next life is shortening day and night o mind meet the guru and set right your affairs lying on her bed in her dark room sukhvinder could hear what every member of her family was doing there was the distant murmur of the television directly below her punctuated by the muffled laughter of her brother and her father who were watching a fridaynight comedy show she could make out her elder sisters voice across the landing talking on her mobile to one of her many friends nearest of all was her mother clunking and scraping in the builtin wardrobe on the other side of the wall sukhvinder had drawn the curtains over her window and placed a draught excluder shaped like a long sausage dog along the bottom of her door in the absence of a lock the dog impeded the doors progress it gave her warning she was sure that nobody would come in though she was where she ought to be doing what she ought to be doing or so they thought she had just performed one of her dreadful daily rituals the opening of her facebook page and the removal of another post from a sender she did not know as often as she blocked the person bombarding her with these messages they changed their profile and sent more she never knew when one would appear todays had been a black and white image a copy of a nineteenthcentury circus poster la véritable femme à barbe miss anne jones elliot it showed the photograph of a woman in a lacy dress with long dark hair and a luxuriant beard and moustache she was convinced that it was fats wall who was sending them although it might have been somebody else dane tully and his friends for instance who made soft grunting apelike noises whenever she spoke in english they would have done it to anybody of her colour there were hardly any brown faces at winterdown it made her feel humiliated and stupid especially as mr garry never told them off he affected not to hear them or else to hear only background chatter perhaps he too thought that sukhvinder kaur jawanda was an ape a hairy ape sukhvinder lay on her back on top of her covers and wished with all of her being that she was dead if she could have achieved suicide simply by willing it she would have done it without hesitation death had come to mr fairbrother why could it not happen to her better yet why could they not swap places niamh and siobhan could have their father back and she sukhvinder could simply slip into nonbeing wiped out wiped clean her selfdisgust was like a nettle suit every part of her prickled and burnt with it she had to will herself moment by moment to endure to remain stationary not to rush to do the one and only thing that helped the whole family had to be in bed before she acted but it was agony to lie like this listening to her own breathing conscious of the useless weight of her own ugly and disgusting body on the bed she liked to think of drowning of sinking down into cool green water and feeling herself slowly pressed into nothingness the great hermaphrodite sits quiet and still shame ran down her body like a burning rash as she lay in the darkness she had never heard the word before fats wall spoke it in maths on wednesday she would not have been able to look it up she was dyslexic but he had been kind enough to explain what it meant so there was no need the hairy manwoman he was worse than dane tully whose taunts had no variety fats walls evil tongue fashioned a fresh tailormade torture every time he saw her and she could not shut her ears his every insult and jibe was branded on sukhvinders memory sticking there as no useful fact had ever done if she could have been examined on the things he had called her she would have achieved the first a grade of her life tash n tits hermaphrodite the bearded dumbbell hairy heavy and stupid plain and clumsy lazy according to her mother whose criticism and exasperation rained down upon her daily a bit slow according to her father who said it with an affection that did not mitigate his lack of interest he could afford to be nice about her bad grades he had jaswant and rajpal both top of every class they took poor old jolly vikram would say carelessly after glancing through her report but her fathers indifference was preferable to her mothers anger parminder did not seem able to comprehend or accept that she had produced a child who was not gifted if any of the subject teachers made the slightest hint that sukhvinder might try harder parminder seized upon it in triumph sukhvinder is easily discouraged and needs to have more faith in her abilities there you see your teacher is saying you dont try hard enough sukhvinder of the only class in which sukhvinder had reached the second set computing fats wall was not there so she sometimes dared put up her hand to answer questions parminder said dismissively the amount of time you children spend on the internet im surprised youre not in set one never would it have occurred to sukhvinder to tell either of her parents about the ape grunts or about stuart walls endless stream of malice it would mean confessing that people beyond the family also saw her as substandard and worthless in any case parminder was friends with stuart walls mother sukhvinder sometimes wondered why stuart wall did not worry about their mothers connection but concluded that he knew that she would not give him away he saw through her he saw her cowardice as he knew her every worst thought about herself and was able to articulate it for the amusement of andrew price she had fancied andrew price once before she realized that she was utterly unfit to fancy anyone before she realized that she was laughable and strange sukhvinder heard her fathers voice and rajpals growing louder as they came up the stairs rajpals laughter reached a crescendo right outside her door its late she heard her mother call from her bedroom vikram he should be in bed vikrams voice came through sukhvinders door close by loud and warm are you asleep already jolly it was her childhood nickname bestowed in irony jaswant had been jazzy and sukhvinder a grizzling unhappy baby rarely smiling had become jolly no sukhvinder called back ive only just gone to bed well it might interest you to know that your brother here but what rajpal had done was lost in his shouting protests his laughter she heard vikram moving away still teasing rajpal sukhvinder waited for the house to fall silent she clung to the prospect of her only consolation as she would have hugged a lifebelt waiting waiting for them all to go to bed and as she waited she remembered that evening not long ago at the end of rowing training when they had been walking through the darkness towards the car park by the canal you were so tired after rowing your arms and your stomach muscles ached but it was a good clean pain she always slept properly after rowing and then krystal bringing up the rear of the group with sukhvinder had called her a silly paki bitch it had come out of nowhere they had all been messing around with mr fairbrother krystal thought she was being funny she used fucking interchangeably with very and seemed to see no difference between them now she said paki as she would have said dozy or dim sukhvinder was conscious of her face falling and experienced the familiar sliding scalding sensation in her stomach what did you say mr fairbrother had wheeled around to face krystal none of them had ever heard him properly angry before i din mean nuthin said krystal half taken aback half defiant i was ony jokin she knows i was jus jokin don yeh she demanded of sukhvinder who muttered cravenly that she knew it was a joke i never want to hear you use that word again they all knew how much he liked krystal they all knew he had paid for her to go on a couple of their trips out of his own pocket nobody laughed louder than mr fairbrother at krystals jokes she could be very funny they walked on and everybody was embarrassed sukhvinder was afraid to look at krystal she felt guilty as she always did they were approaching the peoplecarrier when krystal said so quietly that even mr fairbrother did not hear it i wuz jokin and sukhvinder said quickly i know yeah well sry it came out as a mangled monosyllable and sukhvinder thought it tactful not to acknowledge it nevertheless it cleaned her out it restored her dignity on the way back to pagford she initiated for the first time ever the singing of the teams lucky song asking krystal to start with jayzs rap slowly very slowly her family seemed to be putting themselves to bed at last jaswant spent a long time in the bathroom clinking and crashing around sukhvinder waited until jaz had finished primping herself until her parents had stopped talking in their room for the house to fall silent then at last it was safe she sat up and pulled the razor blade out from a hole in the ear of her old cuddly rabbit she had stolen the blade from vikrams store in the bathroom cabinet she got off the bed and groped for the torch on her shelf and a handful of tissues then moved into the furthest part of her room into the little round turret in the corner here she knew the torchs light would be confined and would not show around the edges of the door she sat down with her back against the wall pushed up the sleeve of her nightshirt and examined by torchlight the marks left by her last session still visible crisscrossed and dark on her arm but healing with a slight shiver of fear that was a blessed relief in its narrow immediate focus she placed the blade halfway up her forearm and sliced into her own flesh sharp hot pain and the blood came at once when she had cut herself right up to her elbow she pressed the wad of tissues onto the long wound making sure nothing leaked onto her nightshirt or the carpet after a minute or two she cut again horizontally across the first incision making a ladder pausing to press and to mop as she went the blade drew the pain away from her screaming thoughts and transmuted it into animal burning of nerves and skin relief and release in every cut at last she wiped the blade clean and surveyed the mess she had made the wounds intersecting bleeding hurting so much that tears were rolling down her face she might sleep if the pain did not keep her awake but she must wait for ten or twenty minutes until the fresh cuts had clotted over she sat with her knees drawn up closed her wet eyes and leaned against the wall beneath the window some of her selfhatred had oozed out with the blood her mind drifted away to gaia bawden the new girl who had taken such an unaccountable fancy to her gaia could have hung out with anyone with her looks and that london accent yet she kept seeking out sukhvinder at lunchtimes and on the bus sukhvinder did not understand it she almost wanted to ask gaia what she thought she was playing at day by day she expected the new girl to realize that she sukhvinder was hairy and apelike slow and stupid someone to be despised and grunted at and insulted no doubt she would recognize her mistake soon and sukhvinder would be left as usual to the bored pity of her oldest friends the fairbrother twins saturday i every parking space in church row was taken by nine oclock in the morning darkly clothed mourners moved singly in pairs and in groups up and down the street converging like a stream of iron filings drawn to a magnet on st michael and all saints the path leading to the church doors became crowded then overflowed those who were displaced fanned out among the graves seeking safe spots to stand between the headstones fearful of trampling on the dead yet unwilling to move too far from the church entrance it was clear to everyone that there would not be enough pews for all the people who had come to say goodbye to barry fairbrother his coworkers from the bank who were grouped around the most extravagant of the sweetlove tombs wished that the august representative from head office would move on and take his inane smalltalk and his clumsy jokes with him lauren holly and jennifer from the rowing team had separated from their parents to huddle together in the shade of a mossyfingered yew parish councillors a motley bunch talked solemnly in the middle of the path a clutch of balding heads and thicklensed glasses a smattering of black straw hats and cultured pearls men from the squash and golf clubs hailed each other in subdued fashion old friends from university recognized each other from afar and edged together and in between milled what seemed to be most of pagford in their smartest and most sombrehued clothes the air droned with quiet conversations faces flickered watching and waiting tessa walls best coat which was of grey wool was cut so tightly around the armholes that she could not raise her arms above chest height standing beside her son on one side of the church path she was exchanging sad little smiles and waves with acquaintances while continuing to argue with fats through lips she was trying not to move too obviously for gods sake stu he was your fathers best friend just this once show some consideration no one told me it was going to go on this bloody long you told me itd be over by halfpast eleven dont swear i said wed leave st michaels at about halfpast eleven so i thought itd be over didnt i so i arranged to meet arf but youve got to come to the burial your fathers a pallbearer ring arf and tell him itll have to be tomorrow instead he cant do tomorrow anyway i havent got my mobile on me cubby told me not to bring it to church dont call your father cubby you can ring arf on mine said tessa burrowing in her pocket i dont know his number by heart lied fats coldly she and colin had eaten dinner without fats the previous evening because he had cycled up to andrews place where they were working on their english project together that at any rate was the story fats had given his mother and tessa had pretended to believe it it suited her too well to have fats out of the way incapable of upsetting colin at least he was wearing the new suit that tessa had bought for him in yarvil she had lost her temper at him in the third shop because he had looked like a scarecrow in everything he had tried on gawky and graceless and she had thought angrily that he was doing it on purpose that he could have inflated the suit with a sense of fitness if he chose shh said tessa preemptively fats was not speaking but colin was approaching them leading the jawandas he seemed in his overwrought state to be confusing the role of pallbearer with that of usher hovering by the gates welcoming people parminder looked grim and gaunt in her sari with her children trailing behind her vikram in his dark suit looked like a film star a few yards from the church doors samantha mollison was waiting beside her husband looking up at the bright offwhite sky and musing on all the wasted sunshine beating down on top of the high ceiling of cloud she was refusing to be dislodged from the hardsurfaced path no matter how many old ladies had to cool their ankles in the grass her patentleather high heels might sink into the soft earth and become dirty and clogged when acquaintances hailed them miles and samantha responded pleasantly but they were not speaking to each other they had had a row the previous evening a few people had asked after lexie and libby who usually came home at weekends but both girls were staying over at friends houses samantha knew that miles regretted their absence he loved playing paterfamilias in public perhaps she thought with a most pleasurable leap of fury he would ask her and the girls to pose with him for a picture on his election leaflets she would enjoy telling him what she thought of that idea she could tell that he was surprised by the turnout no doubt he was regretting that he did not have a starring role in the forthcoming service it would have been an ideal opportunity to begin a surreptitious campaign for barrys seat on the council with this big audience of captive voters samantha made a mental note to drop a sarcastic allusion to the missed opportunity when a suitable occasion arose gavin called miles at the sight of a familiar fair and narrow head oh hi miles hi sam gavins new black tie shone against his white shirt there were violet bags under his light eyes samantha leaned in on tiptoes so that he could not decently avoid kissing her on the cheek and inhaling her musky perfume big turnout isnt it gavin said gazing around gavins a pallbearer miles told his wife in precisely the way that he would have announced that a small and unpromising child had been awarded a book token for effort in truth he had been a little surprised when gavin had told him he had been accorded this honour miles had vaguely imagined that he and samantha would be privileged guests surrounded by a certain aura of mystery and importance having been at the deathbed it might have been a nice gesture if mary or somebody close to mary had asked him miles to read a lesson or say a few words to acknowledge the important part he had played in barrys final moments samantha was deliberately unsurprised that gavin had been singled out you and barry were quite close werent you gav gavin nodded he felt jittery and a little sick he had had a very bad nights sleep waking in the early hours from horrible dreams in which first he had dropped the coffin so that barrys body spilt out onto the church floor and secondly he had overslept missed the funeral and arrived at st michael and all saints to find mary alone in the graveyard whitefaced and furious screaming at him that he had ruined the whole thing im not sure where i ought to be he said looking around ive never done this before nothing to it mate said miles theres only one requirement really dont drop anything hehehe miles girlish laugh contrasted oddly with his deep speaking voice neither gavin nor samantha smiled colin wall loomed out of the mass of bodies big and awkwardlooking with his high knobbly forehead he always made samantha think of frankensteins monster gavin he said there you are i think we should probably stand out on the pavement theyll be here in a few minutes rightho said gavin relieved to be ordered around colin said miles with a nod yes hello said colin flustered before turning away and forcing his way back through the mass of mourners then came another small flurry of movement and samantha heard howards loud voice excuse me so sorry trying to join our family the crowd parted to avoid his belly and howard was revealed immense in a velvetfaced overcoat shirley and maureen bobbed in his wake shirley neat and composed in navy blue maureen scrawny as a carrion bird in a hat with a small black veil hello hello said howard kissing samantha firmly on both cheeks and hows sammy her answer was swallowed up in a widespread awkward shuffling as everybody began retreating backwards off the path there was a certain discreet jockeying for position nobody wanted to relinquish their claim to a place near the church entrance with this cleaving in two of the crowd familiar individuals were revealed like separate pips along the break samantha spotted the jawandas coffeebrown faces among all the whey vikram absurdly handsome in his dark suit parminder dressed in a sari why did she do it didnt she know she was playing right into the likes of howard and shirleys hands and beside her dumpy little tessa wall in a grey coat which was straining at the buttons mary fairbrother and the children were walking slowly up the path to the church mary was terribly pale and appeared pounds thinner could she have lost so much weight in six days she was holding one of the twins hands with her other arm around the shoulders of her younger son and the eldest fergus marching behind she walked with her eyes fixed straight ahead her soft mouth pursed tight other family members followed mary and the children the procession moved over the threshold and was swallowed up in the dingy interior of the church everyone else moved towards the doors at once which resulted in an undignified jam the mollisons found themselves shunted together with the jawandas after you mr jawanda sir after you boomed howard holding out an arm to let the surgeon walk in first but howard made sure to use his bulk to prevent anybody else taking precedence over him and followed vikram immediately through the entrance leaving their families to follow on a royalblue carpet ran the length of the aisle of st michael and all saints golden stars glimmered on the vaulted ceiling brass plaques reflected the glow of the hanging lamps the stainedglass windows were elaborate and gorgeously hued halfway down the nave on the epistle side st michael himself stared down from the largest window clad in silver armour skyblue wings curved out of his shoulders in one hand he held aloft a sword in the other a pair of golden scales a sandalled foot rested on the back of a writhing batwinged satan who was dark grey in colour and attempting to raise himself the saints expression was serene howard stopped level with st michael and indicated that his party should file into the pew on the left vikram turned right into the opposite one while the remaining mollisons and maureen filed past him into the pew howard remained planted on the royalblue carpet and addressed parminder as she passed him dreadful this barry awful shock yes she said loathing him i always think those frocks look comfy are they he added nodding at her sari she did not answer but took her place beside jaswant howard sat down too making of himself a prodigious plug at the end of the pew that would seal it off to newcomers shirleys eyes were fixed respectfully on her knees and her hands were clasped apparently in prayer but she was really mulling over howard and parminders little exchange about the sari shirley belonged to a section of pagford that quietly lamented the fact that the old vicarage which had been built long ago to house a high church vicar with muttonchop whiskers and a starchedaproned staff was now home to a family of hindus shirley had never quite grasped what religion the jawandas were she thought that if she and howard went to the temple or the mosque or wherever it was the jawandas worshipped they would doubtless be required to cover their heads and remove their shoes and who knew what else otherwise there would be outcry yet it was acceptable for parminder to flaunt her sari in church it was not as though parminder did not have normal clothes for she wore them to work every day the double standard of it all was what rankled not a thought for the disrespect it showed to their religion and by extension to barry fairbrother himself of whom she was supposed to have been so fond shirley unclasped her hands raised her head and gave her attention over to the outfits of people who were passing and of the size and number of barrys floral tributes some of these had been heaped up against the communion rail shirley spotted the offering from the council for which she and howard had organized the collection it was a large round traditional wreath of white and blue flowers which were the colours of pagfords arms their flowers and all the other wreaths were overshadowed by the lifesized oar made of bronze chrysanthemums which the girls rowing team had given sukhvinder turned in her pew to look for lauren whose florist mother had made the oar she wanted to mime that she had seen it and liked it but the crowd was dense and she could not spot lauren anywhere sukhvinder was mournfully proud that they had done it especially when she saw that people were pointing it out to each other as they settled themselves in their seats five of the eight girls on the team had stumped up money for the oar lauren had told sukhvinder how she had tracked down krystal weedon at lunchtime and exposed herself to the pisstaking of krystals friends who were sitting smoking on a low wall by the newsagents lauren had asked krystal if she wanted to chip in yeah i will all righ krystal had said but she had not so her name was not on the card nor as far as sukhvinder could see had krystal come to the funeral sukhvinders insides were like lead but the ache of her left forearm coupled with the sharp twinges of pain when she moved it was a counterirritant and at least fats wall glowering in his black suit was nowhere near her he had not made eye contact with her when their two families had met briefly in the churchyard he was restrained by the presence of their parents as he was sometimes restrained by the presence of andrew price late the previous evening her anonymous cybertorturer had sent her a black and white picture of a naked victorian child covered in soft dark hair she had seen it and deleted it while dressing for the funeral when had she last been happy she knew that in a different life long before anyone had grunted at her she had sat in this church and been quite content for years she had sung hymns with gusto at christmas easter and harvest festival she had always liked st michael with his pretty feminine preraphaelite face his curly golden hair but this morning for the first time she saw him differently with his foot resting almost casually on that writhing dark devil she found his untroubled expression sinister and arrogant the pews were packed muffled clunks echoing footsteps and quiet rustlings animated the dusty air as the unlucky ones continued to file in at the back of the church and took up standing room along the lefthand wall some hopeful souls tiptoed down the aisle in case of an overlooked place in the crammed pews howard remained immovable and firm until shirley tapped his shoulder and whispered aubrey and julia at which howard turned massively and waved the service sheet to attract the fawleys attention they came briskly down the carpeted aisle aubrey tall thin and balding in his dark suit julia with her lightred hair pulled back into a chignon they smiled their thanks as howard moved along shunting the others up making sure that the fawleys had plenty of room samantha was jammed so tightly between miles and maureen that she could feel maureens sharp hip joint pressing into her flesh on one side and the keys in miles pocket on the other furious she attempted to secure herself a centimetre or so more room but neither miles nor maureen had anywhere else to go so she stared straight ahead and turned her thoughts vengefully to vikram who had lost none of his appeal in the month or so since she had last seen him he was so conspicuously irrefutably goodlooking it was silly it made you want to laugh with his long legs and his broad shoulders and the flatness of his belly where his shirt tucked into his trousers and those dark eyes with the thick black lashes he looked like a god compared to other pagford men who were so slack and pallid and porky as miles leaned forward to exchange whispered pleasantries with julia fawley his keys ground painfully into samanthas upper thigh and she imagined vikram ripping open the navy wrap dress she was wearing and in her fantasy she had omitted to put on the matching camisole that concealed her deep canyon of cleavage the organ stops creaked and silence fell except for a soft persistent rustle heads turned the coffin was coming up the aisle the pallbearers were almost comically mismatched barrys brothers were both five foot six and colin wall at the rear six foot two so that the back end of the coffin was considerably higher than the front the coffin itself was not made of polished mahogany but of wickerwork its a bloody picnic basket thought howard outraged looks of surprise flitted across many faces as the willow box passed them but some had known all about the coffin in advance mary had told tessa who had told parminder how the choice of material had been made by fergus barrys eldest son who wanted willow because it was a sustainable quickgrowing material and therefore environmentally friendly fergus was a passionate enthusiast for all things green and ecologically sound parminder liked the willow coffin better much better than the stout wooden box in which most english disposed of their dead her grandmother had always had a superstitious fear of the soul being trapped inside something heavy and solid deploring the way that british undertakers nailed down the lids the pallbearers lowered the coffin onto the brocadedraped bier and retreated barrys son brothers and brotherinlaw edged into the front pews and colin walked jerkily back to join his family for two quaking seconds gavin hesitated parminder could tell that he was unsure of where to go his only option to walk back down the aisle under the eyes of three hundred people but mary must have made a sign to him because he ducked blushing furiously into the front pew beside barrys mother parminder had only ever spoken to gavin when she had tested and treated him for chlamydia he had never met her gaze again i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die the vicar did not sound as if he were thinking about the sense of the words issuing from his mouth but only about his own delivery which was singsong and rhythmic parminder was familiar with his style she had attended carol services for years with all the other st thomass parents long acquaintance had not reconciled her to the whitefaced warrior saint staring down at her nor all the dark wood the hard pews the alien altar with its jewelled golden cross nor the dirgey hymns which she found chilly and unsettling so she withdrew her attention from the selfconscious drone of the vicar and thought again of her father she had seen him out of the kitchen window flat on his face while her radio continued to blare from on top of the rabbit hutch he had been lying there for two hours while she her mother and her sisters had been browsing in topshop she could still feel her fathers shoulder beneath his hot shirt as she had shaken it dadiii dadiiiii they had scattered darshans ashes in the sad little river rea in birmingham parminder could remember the dull clay look of its surface on an overcast day in june and the stream of tiny white and grey flakes floating away from her the organ clunked and wheezed into life and she got to her feet with everybody else she caught a glimpse of the backs of niamh and siobhans redgold heads they were exactly the age she had been when darshan had been taken from them parminder experienced a rush of tenderness and an awful ache and a confused desire to hold them and to tell them that she knew she knew she understood morning has broken like the first morning gavin could hear a shrill treble from along the row barrys younger sons voice had not yet broken he knew that declan had chosen the hymn that was another of the ghastly details of the service that mary had chosen to share with him he was finding the funeral an even worse ordeal than he had expected he thought it might have been better with a wooden coffin he had had an awful visceral awareness of barrys body inside that light wickerwork case the physical weight of him was shocking all those complacently staring people as he walked up the aisle did they not understand what he was actually carrying then had come the ghastly moment when he had realized that nobody had saved him a place and that he would have to walk all the way back again while everybody stared and hide among the standees at the back but instead he had been forced to sit in the first pew horribly exposed it was like being in the front seat of a rollercoaster bearing the brunt of every awful twist and lurch sitting there mere feet from siobhans sunflower its head as big as a saucepan lid in the middle of a big burst of yellow freesias and daylilies he actually wished that kay had come with him he could not believe it but there it was he would have been consoled by the presence of somebody who was on his side somebody simply to keep him a seat he had not considered what a sad bastard he might look turning up alone the hymn ended barrys older brother walked to the front to speak gavin did not know how he could bear to do it with barrys corpse lying right in front of him beneath the sunflower grown from seed over months nor how mary could sit so quietly with her head bowed apparently looking at the hands clasped in her lap gavin tried actively to provide his own interior interference so as to dilute the impact of the eulogy hes going to tell the story about barry meeting mary once hes got past this kid stuff happy childhood high jinks yeah yeah come on move it along they would have to put barry back in the car and drive all the way to yarvil to bury him in the cemetery there because the tiny graveyard of st michael and all saints had been declared full twenty years previously gavin imagined lowering the wickerwork coffin into the grave under the eyes of this crowd carrying it in and out of the church would be nothing compared to that one of the twins was crying out of the corner of his eye gavin saw mary reach out a hand to hold her daughters lets get on with it for fucks sake please i think its fair to say that barry always knew his own mind barrys brother was saying hoarsely he had got a few laughs with tales of barrys scrapes in childhood the strain in his voice was palpable he was twentyfour when we went off on my stag weekend to liverpool first night there we leave the campsite and go off to the pub and there behind the bar is the landlords student daughter a beautiful blonde helping out on a saturday night barry spent the whole night propping up the bar chatting her up getting her into trouble with her dad and pretending he didnt know who the rowdy lot in the corner were a weak laugh marys head was drooping both hands were clutching those of the child on either side he told me that night back in the tent that he was going to marry her i thought hang on im the one whos supposed to be drunk another little titter baz made us go back to the same pub the next night when we got home the first thing he did was buy her a postcard and send it to her telling her hed be back next weekend they were married a year to the day after they met and i think everyone who knew them would agree that barry knew a good thing when he saw it they went on to have four beautiful children fergus niamh siobhan and declan gavin breathed carefully in and out in and out trying not to listen and wondering what on earth his own brother would find to say about him under the same circumstances he had not had barrys luck his romantic life did not make a pretty story he had never walked into a pub and found the perfect wife standing there blonde smiling and ready to serve him a pint no he had had lisa who had never seemed to think him up to scratch seven years of escalating warfare had culminated in a dose of the clap and then with barely a break there had been kay clinging to him like an aggressive and threatening barnacle but all the same he would ring her later because he didnt think he would be able to stand going back to his empty cottage after this he would be honest and tell her how horrible and stressful the funeral had been and that he wished she had come with him that would surely deflect any lingering umbrage about their row he did not want to be alone tonight two pews back colin wall was sobbing with small but audible gasps into a large wet handkerchief tessas hand rested on his thigh exerting gentle pressure she was thinking about barry about how she had relied upon him to help her with colin of the consolation of shared laughter of barrys boundless generosity of spirit she could see him clearly short and ruddy jiving with parminder at their last party imitating howard mollisons strictures on the fields advising colin tactfully as only he could have done to accept fats behaviour as adolescent rather than sociopathic tessa was scared of what the loss of barry fairbrother would mean to the man beside her scared of how they would manage to accommodate this huge ragged absence scared that colin had made a vow to the dead that he could not keep and that he did not realize how little mary to whom he kept wanting to talk liked him and through all tessas anxiety and sorrow was threaded the usual worry like an itchy little worm fats and how she was going to avert an explosion how she would make him come with them to the burial or how she might hide from colin that he had not come which might after all be easier we are going to finish todays service with a song chosen by barrys daughters niamh and siobhan which meant a lot to them and their father said the vicar he managed by his tone to disassociate himself personally from what was about to happen the beat of the drum rang so loudly through hidden speakers that the congregation jumped a loud american voice was saying uh huh uh huh and jayz rapped good girl gone bad take three action no clouds in my storms let it rain i hydroplane into fame comin down with the dow jones some people thought that it was a mistake howard and shirley threw outraged glances at each other but nobody pressed stop or ran up the aisle apologizing then a powerful sexy female voice started to sing you had my heart and well never be worlds apart maybe in magazines but youll still be my star the pallbearers were carrying the wicker coffin back down the aisle and mary and the children were following now that its raining more than ever know that well still have each other you can stand under my umbuhrella you can stand under my umbuhrella the congregation filed slowly out of the church trying not to walk in time to the beat of the song ii andrew price took the handlebars of his fathers racing bicycle and walked it carefully out of the garage making sure that he did not scrape the car down the stone steps and through the metal gate he carried it then in the lane he put his foot on one pedal scooted a few yards and swung his other leg over the saddle he soared left onto the vertiginously sloping hillside road and sped without touching his brakes down towards pagford the hedgerows and sky blurred he imagined himself in a velodrome as the wind whipped his clean hair and his stinging face which he had just scrubbed clean level with the fairbrothers wedgeshaped garden he applied the brakes because some months previously he had taken this sharp turn too fast and fallen off and had had to return home immediately with his jeans ripped open and grazes all down one side of his face he freewheeled with only one hand on the bars into church row and enjoyed a second though lesser downhill burst of speed slightly checked when he saw that they were loading a coffin onto a hearse outside the church and that a darkclothed crowd was spilling out between the heavy wooden doors andrew pedalled furiously around the corner and out of sight he did not want to see fats emerging from church with a distraught cubby wearing the cheap suit and tie that he had described with comical disgust during yesterdays english lesson it would have been like interrupting his friend having a crap as andrew cycled slowly around the square he slicked his hair back off his face with one hand wondering what the cold air had done to his purplered acne and whether the antibacterial face wash had done anything to soothe the angry look of it and he told himself the cover story he had come from fats house which he might have done there was no reason why not which meant that hope street was as obvious a route down to the river as cutting through the first side street therefore there was no need for gaia bawden if she happened to be looking out of the window of her house and happened to see him and happened to recognize him to think that he had come this way because of her andrew did not anticipate having to explain to her his reason for cycling up her street but he still held the fake story in his mind because he believed it gave him an air of cool detachment he simply wanted to know which was her house twice already at weekends he had cycled along the short terraced street every nerve in his body tingling but he had been unable as yet to discover which house harboured the grail all he knew from his furtive glimpses through the dirty schoolbus windows was that she lived on the right hand evennumbered side as he turned the corner he tried to compose his features acting the part of a man cycling slowly towards the river by the most direct route lost in his own serious thoughts but ready to acknowledge a classmate should they show themselves she was there on the pavement andrews legs continued to pump though he could not feel the pedals and he was suddenly aware how thin the tyres were on which he balanced she was rummaging in her leather handbag her copperbrown hair hanging around her face number ten on the door ajar behind her and a black tshirt falling short of her waist a band of bare skin and a heavy belt and tight jeans when he was almost past her she closed the door and turned her hair fell back from her beautiful face and she said quite clearly in her london voice oh hi hi he said his legs kept pedalling six feet away twelve feet away why hadnt he stopped shock kept him moving he dared not look back he was at the end of her street already for fucks sake dont fall off he turned the corner too stunned to gauge whether he was more relieved or disappointed that he had left her behind holy shit he cycled on towards the wooded area at the base of pargetter hill where the river glinted intermittently through the trees but he could see nothing except gaia burned onto his retina like neon the narrow road turned into an earthy footpath and the gentle breeze off the water caressed his face which he did not think had turned red because it had all happened so quickly fucking hell he said aloud to the fresh air and the deserted path he raked excitedly through this magnificent unexpected treasure trove her perfect body revealed in tight denim and stretchy cotton number ten behind her on a chipped shabby blue door oh hi easily and naturally so his features were definitely logged somewhere in the mind that lived behind the astonishing face the bike jolted on the newly pebbly and rough ground elated andrew dismounted only when he began to overbalance he wheeled the bicycle on through the trees emerging onto the narrow riverbank where he slung the bicycle down on the ground among the wood anemones that had opened like tiny white stars since his last visit his father had said when he first started to borrow the bike you chain it up if youre going in a shop im warning you if that gets nicked but the chain was not long enough to go around any of the trees and in any case the further he rode from his father the less andrew feared him still thinking about the inches of flat bare midriff and gaias exquisite face andrew strode to the place where the bank met the eroded side of the hill which hung like an earthy rocky cliff in a sheer face above the fastflowing green water the narrowest lip of slippery crumbling bank ran along the bottom of the hillside the only way of navigating it if your feet had grown to be twice the length they had been when they had first made the trip was to edge along sideways pressed to the sheer face holding tight to roots and bits of protruding rock the mulchy green smell of the river and of wet soil was deeply familiar to andrew as was the sensation of this narrow ledge of earth and grass under his feet and the cracks and rocks he sought with his hands on the hillside he and fats had found the secret place when they were eleven years old they had known that what they were doing was forbidden and dangerous they had been warned about the river terrified but determined not to tell each other so they had sidled along this tricky ledge grabbing at anything that protruded from the rocky wall and at the very narrowest point clutching fistfuls of each others tshirts years of practice enabled andrew though his mind was barely on the job to move crabwise along the solid wall of earth and rock with the water gushing three feet beneath his trainers then with a deft duck and swing he was inside the fissure in the hillside that they had found so long ago back then it had seemed like a divine reward for their daring he could no longer stand up in it but slightly larger than a twoman tent it was big enough for two teenage boys to lie side by side with the river rushing past and the trees dappling their view of the sky framed by the triangular entrance the first time they had been here they had poked and dug at the back wall with sticks but they had not found a secret passageway leading to the abbey above so they gloried instead in the fact that they alone had discovered the hiding place and swore that it would be their secret in perpetuity andrew had a vague memory of a solemn oath spit and swearwords they had called it the cave when they had first discovered it but it was now and had been for some time past the cubby hole the little recess smelt earthy though the sloping ceiling was made of rock a dark green tidemark showed that it had flooded in the past not quite to the roof the floor was covered in their cigarette butts and cardboard roaches andrew sat down with his legs dangling over the sludgegreen water and pulled his cigarettes and lighter out of his jacket bought with the last of his birthday money now that his allowance had been stopped he lit up inhaled deeply and relived the glorious encounter with gaia bawden in as much detail as he could ring out of it narrow waist and curving hips creamy skin between leather and tshirt full wide mouth oh hi it was the first time he had seen her out of school uniform where was she going alone with her leather handbag what was there in pagford for her to do on a saturday morning was she perhaps catching the bus into yarvil what did she get up to when she was out of his sight what feminine mysteries absorbed her and he asked himself for the umpteenth time whether it was conceivable that flesh and bone wrought like that could contain a banal personality it was only gaia who had ever made him wonder this the idea of body and soul as separate entities had never once occurred to him until he had clapped eyes on her even while trying to imagine what her breasts would look and feel like judged by the visual evidence he had managed to gather through a slightly translucent school shirt and what he knew was a white bra he could not believe that the allure she held for him was exclusively physical she had a way of moving that moved him as much as music which was what moved him most of all surely the spirit animating that peerless body must be unusual too why would nature make a vessel like that if not to contain something still more valuable andrew knew what naked women looked like because there were no parental controls on the computer in fats conversion bedroom together they had explored as much online porn as they could access for free shaven vulvas pink labia pulled wide to show darkly gaping slits spread buttocks revealing the puckered buttons of anuses thickly lipsticked mouths dripping semen andrews excitement was underpinned always by the panicky awareness that you could only hear mrs wall approaching the room when she reached the creaking halfway stair sometimes they found weirdness that made them roar with laughter even when andrew was unsure whether he was more excited or repulsed whips and saddles harnesses ropes hoses and once at which even fats had not managed to laugh closeups of metalbolted contraptions and needles protruding from soft flesh and womens faces frozen screaming together he and fats had become connoisseurs of siliconeenhanced breasts enormous taut and round plastic one of them would point out matter of factly as they sat in front of the monitor with the door wedged shut against fats parents the onscreen blondes arms were raised as she sat astride some hairy man her big brownnippled breasts hanging off her narrow rib cage like bowling balls thin shiny purple lines under each of them showing where the silicone had been inserted you could almost tell how they would feel looking at them firm as if there were a football underneath the skin andrew could imagine nothing more erotic than a natural breast soft and spongy and perhaps a little springy and the nipples he hoped contrastingly hard and all of these images blurred in his mind late at night with the possibilities offered by real girls human girls and the little you managed to feel through clothes if you managed to move in close enough niamh was the less pretty of the fairbrother twins but she had been the more willing in the stuffy drama hall during the christmas disco half hidden by the musty stage curtain in a dark corner they had pressed against each other and andrew had put his tongue into her mouth his hands had inched as far as her bra strap and no further because she kept pulling away he had been driven chiefly by the knowledge that somewhere outside in the darkness fats was going further and now his brain teemed and throbbed with gaia she was both the sexiest girl he had ever seen and the source of another entirely inexplicable yearning certain chord changes certain beats made the very core of him shiver and so did something about gaia bawden he lit a new cigarette from the end of the first and threw the butt into the water below then he heard a familiar scuffling and leaned forward to see fats still wearing his funeral suit spreadeagled on the hill wall moving from handhold to handhold as he edged along the narrow lip of bank towards the opening where andrew sat fats arf andrew pulled in his legs to give fats room to climb into the cubby hole fucking hell said fats when he had clambered inside he was spiderlike in his awkwardness with his long limbs his skinniness emphasized by the black suit andrew handed him a cigarette fats always lit up as though he were in a high wind one hand cupped around the flame to shield it scowling slightly he inhaled blew a smoke ring out of the cubby hole and loosened the dark grey tie around his neck he appeared older and not after all so very foolish in the suit which bore traces of earth on the knees and cuffs from the journey to the cave youd think they were bum chums fats said after he had taken another powerful drag on his cigarette cubby upset was he upset hes having fucking hysterics hes given himself hiccups hes worse than the fucking widow andrew laughed fats blew another smoke ring and pulled at one of his overlarge ears i bowed out early they havent even buried him yet they smoked in silence for a minute both looking out at the sludgy river as he smoked andrew contemplated the words bowed out early and the amount of autonomy fats seemed to have compared to himself simon and his fury stood between andrew and too much freedom in hilltop house you sometimes copped for punishment simply because you were present andrews imagination had once been caught by a strange little module in their philosophy and religion class in which primitive gods had been discussed in all their arbitrary wrath and violence and the attempts of early civilizations to placate them he had thought then of the nature of justice as he had come to know it of his father as a pagan god and of his mother as the high priestess of the cult who attempted to interpret and intercede usually failing yet still insisting in the face of all the evidence that there was an underlying magnanimity and reasonableness to her deity fats rested his head against the stone side of the cubby hole and blew smoke rings at the ceiling he was thinking about what he wanted to tell andrew he had been mentally rehearsing the way he would start all through the funeral service while his father gulped and sobbed into his handkerchief fats was so excited by the prospect of telling that he was having difficulty containing himself but he was determined not to blurt it out the telling of it was to fats of almost equal importance to the doing of it he did not want andrew to think that he had hurried here to say it you know how fairbrother was on the parish council said andrew yeah said fats glad that andrew had initiated a spacefiller conversation sipies saying hes going to stand for his seat sipie is fats frowned at andrew what the fucks got into him he reckons fairbrother was getting backhanders from some contractor andrew had heard simon discussing it with ruth in the kitchen that morning it had explained everything he wants a bit of the action that wasnt barry fairbrother said fats laughing as he flicked ash onto the cave floor and that wasnt the parish council that was whatshisname frierly up in yarvil he was on the school board at winterdown cubby had a fucking fit local press calling him for a comment and all that frierly got done for it doesnt sipie read the yarvil and district gazette andrew stared at fats fucking typical he ground out his cigarette on the earthy floor embarrassed by his fathers idiocy simon had got the wrong end of the stick yet again he spurned the local community sneered at their concerns was proud of his isolation in his poxy little house on the hill then he got a bit of misinformation and decided to expose his family to humiliation on the basis of it crooked as fuck sipie isnt he said fats they called him sipie because that was ruths nickname for her husband fats had heard her use it once when he had been over for his tea and had never called simon anything else since yeah he is said andrew wondering whether he would be able to dissuade his father from standing by telling him he had the wrong man and the wrong council bit of a coincidence said fats because cubbys standing as well fats exhaled through his nostrils staring at the crevice wall over andrews head so will voters go for the cunt he said or the twat andrew laughed there was little he enjoyed more than hearing his father called a cunt by fats now have a shifty at this said fats jamming his cigarette between his lips and patting his hips even though he knew that the envelope was in the inside breast pocket here you go he said pulling it out and opening it to show andrew the contents brown peppercornsized pods in a powdery mix of shrivelled stalks and leaves sensimilla that is what is it tips and shoots of your basic unfertilized marijuana plant said fats specially prepared for your smoking pleasure whats the difference between that and the normal stuff asked andrew with whom fats had split several lumps of waxy black cannabis resin in the cubby hole just a different smoke isnt it said fats stubbing out his own cigarette he took a packet of rizlas from his pocket drew out three of the fragile papers and gummed them together did you get it off kirby asked andrew poking at and sniffing the contents of the envelope everyone knew skye kirby was the goto man for drugs he was a year above them in the lower sixth his grandfather was an old hippy who had been up in court several times for growing his own yeah mind theres a bloke called obbo said fats slitting cigarettes and emptying the tobacco onto the papers in the fields wholl get you anything fucking smack if you want it you dont want smack though said andrew watching fats face nah said fats taking the envelope back and sprinkling the sensimilla onto the tobacco he rolled the joint together licking the end of the papers to seal it poking the roach in more neatly twisting the end into a point nice he said happily he had planned to tell andrew his news after introducing the sensimilla as a kind of warmup act he held out his hand for andrews lighter inserted the cardboarded end between his own lips and lit up taking a deep contemplative drag blowing out the smoke in a long blue jet then repeating the process mmm he said holding the smoke in his lungs and imitating cubby whom tessa had given a wine course one christmas herby a strong aftertaste overtones of fuck he experienced a massive headrush even though he was sitting and exhaled laughing try that andrew leaned across and took the joint giggling in anticipation and at the beatific smile on fats face which was quite at odds with his usual constipated scowl andrew inhaled and felt the power of the drug radiate out from his lungs unwinding and loosening him another drag and he thought that it was like having your mind shaken out like a duvet so that it resettled without creases so that everything became smooth and simple and easy and good nice he echoed fats smiling at the sound of his own voice he passed the joint back into fats waiting fingers and savoured this sense of wellbeing so you wanna hear something interesting said fats grinning uncontrollably go on i fucked her last night andrew nearly said who before his befuddled brain remembered krystal weedon of course krystal weedon who else where he asked stupidly it was not what he wanted to know fats stretched out on his back in his funeral suit his feet towards the river wordlessly andrew stretched out beside him in the opposite direction they had slept like this top and tail when they had stayed overnight at each others houses as children andrew gazed up at the rocky ceiling where the blue smoke hung slowly furling and waited to hear everything i told cubby and tess i was at yours so you know said fats he passed the joint into andrews reaching fingers then linked his long hands on his chest and listened to himself telling then i got the bus to the fields met her outside oddbins by tescos asked andrew he did not know why he kept asking dumb questions yeah said fats we went to the rec theres trees in the corner behind the public bogs nice and private it was getting dark fats shifted position and andrew handed back the joint getting ins harder than i thought it would be said fats and andrew was mesmerized half inclined to laugh afraid of missing every unvarnished detail fats could give him she was wetter when i was fingering her a giggle rose like trapped gas in andrews chest but was stifled there lot of pushing to get in properly its tighter than i thought andrew saw a jet of smoke rise from the place where fats head must be i came in about ten seconds it feels fucking great once youre in andrew fought back laughter in case there was more i wore a johnny itd be better without he pushed the joint back into andrews hand andrew pulled on it thinking harder to get in than you thought over in ten seconds it didnt sound much yet what wouldnt he give he imagined gaia bawden flat on her back for him and without meaning to let out a small groan which fats did not seem to hear lost in a fug of erotic images pulling on the joint andrew lay with his erection on the patch of earth his body was warming and listened to the soft rush of the water a few feet from his head what matters arf asked fats after a long dreamy pause his head swimming pleasantly andrew answered sex yeah said fats delighted fucking thats what matters propogun propogating the species throw away the johnnies multiply yeah said andrew laughing and death said fats he had been taken aback by the reality of that coffin and how little material lay between all the watching vultures and an actual corpse he was not sorry that he had left before it disappeared into the ground gotta be hasnt it death yeah said andrew thinking of war and car crashes and dying in blazes of speed and glory yeah said fats fucking and dying thats it innit fucking and dying thats life trying to get a fuck and trying not to die or trying to die said fats some people risking it yeah risking it there was more silence and their hiding place was cool and hazy and music said andrew quietly watching the blue smoke hanging beneath the dark rock yeah said fats in the distance and music the river rushed on past the cubby hole part two fair comment fair comment on a matter of public interest is not actionable charles arnoldbaker local council administration seventh edition i it rained on barry fairbrothers grave the ink blurred on the cards siobhans chunky sunflower head defied the pelting drops but marys lilies and freesias crumpled then fell apart the chrysanthemum oar darkened as it decayed rain swelled the river made streams in the gutters and turned the steep roads into pagford glossy and treacherous the windows of the school bus were opaque with condensation the hanging baskets in the square became bedraggled and samantha mollison windscreen wipers on full tilt suffered a minor collision in the car on the way home from work in the city a copy of the yarvil and district gazette stuck out of mrs catherine weedons door in hope street for three days until it became sodden and illegible finally social worker kay bawden tugged it out of the letterbox peered in through the rusty flap and spotted the old lady spreadeagled at the foot of the stairs a policeman helped break down the front door and mrs weedon was taken away in an ambulance to south west general still the rain fell forcing the signpainter who had been hired to rename the old shoe shop to postpone the job it poured for days and into the nights and the square was full of hunchbacks in waterproofs and umbrellas collided on the narrow pavements howard mollison found the gentle patter against the dark window soothing he sat in the study that had once been his daughter patricias bedroom and contemplated the email that he had received from the local newspaper they had decided to run councillor fairbrothers article arguing that the fields ought to remain with pagford but in the interests of balance they hoped that another councillor might make the case for reassignment in the following issue backfired on you hasnt it fairbrother thought howard happily there you were thinking youd have it all your own way he closed the email and turned instead to the small pile of papers beside him these were the letters that had come trickling in requesting an election to fill barrys vacant seat the constitution stated that it required nine applications to enforce a public vote and he had received ten he read them over while his wifes and his business partners voices rose and fell in the kitchen stripping bare between them the meaty scandal of old mrs weedons collapse and belated discovery dont walk out on your doctor for nothing do you screaming at the top of her voice karen said saying shed been given the wrong drugs yes i know said shirley who considered that she had a monopoly on medical speculation given that she was a hospital volunteer theyll run tests up at the general i expect id be feeling very worried if i were dr jawanda shes probably hoping the weedons are too ignorant to sue but that wont matter if the general finds out it was the wrong medication shell be struck off said maureen with relish thats right said shirley and im afraid a lot of people will feel good riddance good riddance methodically howard sorted letters into piles miles completed application forms he set aside on their own the remaining communications were from fellow parish councillors there were no surprises here as soon as parminder had emailed him to tell him that she knew of somebody who was interested in standing for barrys seat he had expected these six to rally round her demanding an election together with bendsyourear herself they were the ones he dubbed the obstreperous faction whose leader had recently fallen onto this pile he placed the completed forms of colin wall their chosen candidate into a third pile he placed four more letters which were likewise from expected sources professional complainers of pagford known to howard as perennially dissatisfied and suspicious all prolific correspondents to the yarvil and district gazette each had their own obsessive interest in some esoteric local issue and considered themselves independent minded they would be the ones most likely to scream nepotism if miles had been coopted but they were among the most antifields people in town howard took the last two letters in each hand weighing them up one of them was from a woman whom he had never met who claimed howard took nothing for granted to work at the bellchapel addiction clinic the fact that she styled herself ms inclined him to believe her after some hesitation he placed this on top of cubby walls application forms the last letter unsigned and typed on a word processor demanded an election in intemperate terms it had an air of haste and carelessness and was littered with typos the letter extolled the virtues of barry fairbrother and named miles specifically as unfit to fill his sheos howard wondered whether miles had a disgruntled client out there who might prove to be an embarrassment it was good to be forewarned of such potential hazards however howard doubted whether the letter being anonymous counted as a vote for an election he therefore fed it into the little desktop shredder that shirley had given him for christmas ii edward collins co the pagford solicitors occupied the upper floor of a terraced brick house with an opticians on the ground floor edward collins was deceased and his firm comprised two men gavin hughes who was the salaried partner with one window in his office and miles mollison who was the equity partner with two windows they shared a secretary who was twentyeight single plain but with a good figure shona laughed too long at all miles jokes and treated gavin with a patronage that was almost offensive marys called theres a bit of a glitch with barrys life insurance she wants me to help her sort it right well you can handle that cant you ill be back at two anyway miles slipped on his overcoat jogged down the steep stairs and walked briskly up the rainswept little street that led to the square a momentary break in the clouds caused sunlight to flood the glistening war memorial and the hanging baskets miles experienced a rush of atavistic pride as he hurried across the square towards mollison and lowe that pagford institution that classiest of emporia a pride that familiarity had never blighted but rather deepened and ripened the bell tinkled at the door as miles pushed it open there was something of a lunchtime rush on a queue of eight waited at the counter and howard in his mercantile regalia fishermans flies glinting in his deerstalker was in full tongue and a quarter of black olives rosemary to you nothing else now nothing else for rosemary thatll be eight pounds sixtytwo pence well call it eight my love in light of our long and fruitful association giggles and gratitude the rattle and crash of the till and heres my lawyer come to check up on me boomed howard winking and chuckling over the heads of the queue at miles if youll wait for me in the back sir ill try not to say anything incriminating to mrs howson miles smiled at the middleaged ladies who beamed back tall with thick closecropped greying hair big round blue eyes his paunch disguised by his dark overcoat miles was a reasonably attractive addition to the handbaked biscuits and local cheeses he navigated his way carefully between the little tables piled high with delicacies and paused at the big arch hewn between delicatessen and the old shoe shop which was denuded of its protective plastic curtain for the first time maureen miles recognized the handwriting had put up a sign on a sandwich board in the middle of the arch no entry coming soon the copper kettle miles peered through into the clean spare space that would soon be pagfords newest and best café it was plastered and painted with freshly varnished black boards underfoot he sidled around the corner of the counter and edged past maureen who was operating the meat slicer affording her the opportunity for a gruff and ribald laugh then ducked through the door that led into the dingy little back room here was a formica table on which maureens daily mail lay folded howard and maureens coats hanging on hooks and a door leading to the lavatory which exuded a scent of artificial lavender miles hung up his overcoat and drew up an old chair to the table howard appeared a minute or two later bearing two heaped plates of delicatessen fare definitely decided on the copper kettle then asked miles well mo likes it said howard setting down a plate in front of his son he lumbered out returned with two bottles of ale and closed the door with his foot so that the room was enveloped in a windowless gloom relieved only by the dim pendant light howard sat down with a deep grunt he had been conspiratorial on the telephone midmorning and kept miles waiting a few moments longer while he flipped off the lid of one bottle walls sent his forms in he said at last handing over the beer ah said miles im going to set a deadline two weeks from today for everyone to declare fair enough said miles mum reckons this price bloke is still interested have you asked sam if she knows who he is yet no said miles howard scratched an underfold of the belly that rested close to his knees as he sat on the creaking chair everything all right with you and sam miles admired as always his fathers almost psychic intuition not great he would not have confessed it to his mother because he tried not to fuel the constant cold war between shirley and samantha in which he was both hostage and prize she doesnt like the idea of me standing miles elaborated howard raised his fair eyebrows his jowls wobbling as he chewed i dont bloody know whats got into her shes on one of her antipagford kicks howard took his time swallowing he dabbed at his mouth with a paper napkin and burped shell come round quickly enough once youre in he said the social side of it plenty for the wives functions at sweetlove house shell be in her element he took another swig of ale and scratched his belly again i cant picture this price said miles returning to the essential point but ive got a feeling he had a kid in lexies class at st thomass fieldsborn though thats the thing said howard fieldsborn which could work to our advantage split the profields vote between him and wall yeah said miles makes sense i havent heard of anyone else its possible once details hit the website someone elsell come forward but im confident about our chances im confident aubrey called howard added there was always a touch of additional portentousness in howards tone when he used aubrey fawleys christian name right behind you goes without saying hes back this evening hes been in town usually when a pagfordian said in town they meant in yarvil howard and shirley used the phrase in imitation of aubrey fawley to mean in london he mentioned something about us all getting together for a chat maybe tomorrow might even invite us over to the house samd like that miles had just taken a large bite of soda bread and liver pâté but he conveyed his agreement with an emphatic nod he liked the idea that aubrey fawley was right behind him samantha might jeer at his parents thraldom to the fawleys but miles noticed that on those rare occasions when samantha came face to face with either aubrey or julia her accent changed subtly and her demeanour became markedly more demure something else said howard scratching his belly again got an email from the yarvil and district gazette this morning asking for my views on the fields as chair of the parish council youre kidding i thought fairbrother had stitched that one up backfired didnt it said howard with immense satisfaction theyre going to run his article and they want someone to argue against the following week give them the other side of the story id appreciate a hand lawyers turn of phrase and all that no problem said miles we could talk about that bloody addiction clinic thatd make the point yes very good idea excellent in his enthusiasm he had swallowed too much at once and miles had to bang him on the back until his coughing had subsided at last dabbing his watering eyes with a napkin howard said breathlessly aubreys recommending the district cuts funding from their end and im going to put it to our lot that its time to terminate the lease on the building it wouldnt hurt to make the case in the press how much time and moneys gone into that bloody place with nothing to show for it ive got the figures howard burped sonorously bloody disgraceful pardon me iii gavin cooked for kay at his house that evening opening tins and crushing garlic with a sense of illusage after a row you had to say certain things to secure a truce those were the rules everyone knew that gavin had telephoned kay from his car on the way back from barrys burial and told her that he wished she had been there that the whole day had been horrible and that he hoped he could see her that night he considered these humble admissions no more or less than the price he had to pay for an evening of undemanding companionship but kay seemed to consider them more in the light of a down payment on a renegotiated contract you missed me you needed me when you were upset youre sorry we didnt go as a couple well lets not make that mistake again there had been a certain complacency about the way she had treated him since a briskness a sense of renewed expectation he was making spaghetti bolognese tonight he had deliberately omitted to buy a pudding or to lay the table in advance he was at pains to show her that he had not made much of an effort kay seemed oblivious even determined to take this casual attitude as a compliment she sat at his small kitchen table talking to him over the pitterpatter of rain on the skylight her eyes wandering over the fixtures and fittings she had not often been here i suppose lisa chose this yellow did she she was doing it again breaking taboos as though they had recently passed to a deeper level of intimacy gavin preferred not to talk about lisa if he could avoid it surely she knew that by now he shook oregano onto the mince in his frying pan and said no this was all the previous owner i havent got round to changing it yet oh she said sipping wine well its quite nice a bit bland this rankled with gavin as in his opinion the interior of the smithy was superior in every way to that of ten hope street he watched the pasta bubbling keeping his back to her guess what she said i met samantha mollison this afternoon gavin wheeled around how did kay even know what samantha mollison looked like just outside the deli in the square i was on my way in to get this said kay clinking the wine bottle beside her with a flick of her nail she asked me whether i was gavins girlfriend kay said it archly but actually she had been heartened by samanthas choice of words relieved to think that this was how gavin described her to his friends and what did you say i said i said yes her expression was crestfallen gavin had not meant to ask the question quite so aggressively he would have given a lot to prevent kay and samantha ever meeting anyway kay proceeded with a slight edge to her voice shes asked us for dinner next friday week today oh bloody hell said gavin crossly a lot of kays cheerfulness deserted her whats the problem nothing its nothing he said prodding the bubbling spaghetti its just that i see enough of miles during work hours to be honest it was what he had dreaded all along that she would worm her way in and they would become gavinandkay with a shared social circle so that it would become progressively more difficult to excise her from his life how had he let this happen why had he allowed her to move down here fury at himself mutated easily into anger with her why couldnt she realize how little he wanted her and take herself off without forcing him to do the dirty he drained the spaghetti in the sink swearing under his breath as he speckled himself with boiling water youd better call miles and samantha and tell them no then said kay her voice had hardened as was gavins deeply ingrained habit he sought to deflect an imminent conflict and hoped that the future would look after itself no no he said dabbing at his wet shirt with a tea towel well go its fine well go but in his undisguised lack of enthusiasm he sought to put down a marker to which he could refer retrospectively you knew i didnt want to go no i didnt enjoy it no i dont want it to happen again they ate for several minutes in silence gavin was afraid that there would be another row and that kay would force him to discuss underlying issues again he cast around for something to say and so started telling her about mary fairbrother and the life insurance company theyre being real bastards he said he was heavily insured but their lawyers are looking for a way not to pay out theyre trying to make out he didnt make a full disclosure in what way well an uncle died of an aneurysm too mary swears barry told the insurance agent that when he signed the policy but its nowhere in the notes presumably the bloke didnt realize it can be a genetic thing i dont know that barry did come to gavins voice broke horrified and embarrassed he bowed his flushing face over his plate there was a hard chunk of grief in his throat and he couldnt shift it kays chair legs scraped on the floor he hoped that she was off to the bathroom but then felt her arms around his shoulders drawing him to her without thinking he put a single arm around her too it was so good to be held if only their relationship could be distilled into simple wordless gestures of comfort why had humans ever learned to talk he had dribbled snot onto the back of her top sorry he said thickly wiping it away with his napkin he withdrew from her and blew his nose she dragged her chair to sit beside him and put a hand on his arm he liked her so much better when she was silent and her face was soft and concerned as it was now i still cant he was a good bloke he said barry he was a good bloke yes everyone says that about him said kay she had never been allowed to meet this famous barry fairbrother but she was intrigued by the show of emotion from gavin and by the person who had caused it was he funny she asked because she could imagine gavin in thrall to a comedian to a rowdy ringleader propping up the bar yeah i spose well not particularly normal he liked a laugh but he was just such a such a nice bloke he liked people you know she waited but gavin did not seem able to elucidate further on the niceness of barry and the kids and mary poor mary god youve got no idea kay continued to pat his arm gently but her sympathy had chilled a little no idea she thought what it was to be alone no idea how hard it was to be left in sole charge of a family where was his pity for her kay they were really happy said gavin in a cracked voice shes in pieces wordlessly kay stroked his arm reflecting that she had never been able to afford to go to pieces im all right he said wiping his nose on his napkin and picking up his fork by the smallest of twitches he indicated that she should remove her hand iv samanthas dinner invitation to kay had been motivated by a mixture of vengefulness and boredom she saw it as retaliation against miles who was always busy with schemes in which he gave her no say but with which he expected her to cooperate she wanted to see how he liked it when she arranged things without consulting him then she would be stealing a march on maureen and shirley those nosy old crones who were so fascinated by gavins private affairs but knew next to nothing about the relationship between him and his london girlfriend finally it would afford her another opportunity to sharpen her claws on gavin for being pusillanimous and indecisive about his love life she might talk about weddings in front of kay or say how nice it was to see gavin making a commitment at last however her plans for the discomfiture of others gave samantha less pleasure than she had hoped when on saturday morning she told miles what she had done he reacted with suspicious enthusiasm great yeah we havent had gavin round for ages and nice for you to get to know kay why well you always got on with lisa didnt you miles i hated lisa well ok maybe youll like kay better she glared at him wondering where all this good humour was coming from lexie and libby home for the weekend and cooped up in the house because of the rain were watching a music dvd in the sitting room a guitarladen ballad blared through to the kitchen where their parents stood talking listen said miles brandishing his mobile aubrey wants to have a talk with me about the council ive just called dad and the fawleys have invited us all to dinner tonight at sweetlove no thanks said samantha cutting him off she was suddenly full of a fury she could barely explain even to herself she walked out of the room they argued in low voices all over the house through the day trying not to spoil their daughters weekend samantha refused to change her mind or to discuss her reasons miles afraid of getting angry at her was alternately conciliatory and cold how do you think its going to look if you dont come he said at ten to eight that evening standing in the doorway of the sitting room ready to leave wearing a suit and tie its nothing to do with me miles samantha said youre the one running for office she liked watching him dither she knew that he was terrified of being late yet wondering whether he could still persuade her to go with him you know theyll be expecting both of us really nobody sent me an invitation oh come off it sam you know they meant they took it for granted more fool them then ive told you i dont fancy it youd better hurry you dont want to keep mummy and daddy waiting he left she listened to the car reversing out of the drive then went into the kitchen opened a bottle of wine and brought it back into the sitting room with a glass she kept picturing howard shirley and miles all having dinner together at sweetlove house it would surely be the first orgasm shirley had had in years her thoughts swerved irresistibly to what her accountant had said to her during the week profits were way down whatever she had pretended to howard the accountant had actually suggested closing the shop and concentrating on the online side of the business this would be an admission of failure that samantha was not prepared to make for one thing shirley would love it if the shop closed she had been a bitch about it from the start im sorry sam its not really my taste just a teeny bit over the top but samantha loved her little red and black shop in yarvil loved getting away from pagford every day chatting to customers gossiping with carly her assistant her world would be tiny without the shop she had nurtured for fourteen years it would contract in short to pagford pagford bloody pagford samantha had never meant to live here she and miles had planned a year out before starting work a roundtheworld trip they had their itinerary mapped out their visas ready samantha had dreamed about walking barefoot and hand in hand on long white australian beaches and then she had found out that she was pregnant she had come down to visit him at ambleside a day after she had taken the pregnancy test one week after their graduation they were supposed to be leaving for singapore in eight days time samantha had not wanted to tell miles in his parents house she was afraid that they would overhear shirley seemed to be behind every door samantha opened in the bungalow so she waited until they were sitting at a dark corner table in the black canon she remembered the rigid line of miles jaw when she told him he seemed in some indefinable way to become older as the news hit him he did not speak for several petrified seconds then he said right well get married he told her that he had already bought her a ring that he had been planning to propose somewhere good somewhere like the top of ayers rock sure enough when they got back to the bungalow he unearthed the little box from where he had already hidden it in his rucksack it was a small solitaire diamond from a jewellers in yarvil he had bought it with some of the money his grandmother had left him samantha had sat on the edge of miles bed and cried and cried they had married three months later alone with her bottle of wine samantha turned on the television it brought up the dvd lexie and libby had been watching a frozen image of four young men singing to her in tight tshirts they looked barely out of their teens she pressed play after the boys finished their song the dvd cut to an interview samantha slugged back her wine watching the band joking with each other then becoming earnest as they discussed how much they loved their fans she thought that she would have known them as americans even if the sound had been off their teeth were perfect it grew late she paused the dvd went upstairs and told the girls to leave the playstation and go to bed then she returned to the sitting room where she was threequarters of the way down the bottle of wine she had not turned on the lamps she pressed play and kept drinking when the dvd finished she put it back to the beginning and watched the bit she had missed one of the boys appeared significantly more mature than the other three he was broader across the shoulders biceps bulged beneath the short sleeves of his tshirt he had a thick strong neck and a square jaw samantha watched him undulating staring into the camera with a detached serious expression on his handsome face which was all planes and angles and winged black eyebrows she thought of sex with miles it had last happened three weeks previously his performance was as predictable as a masonic handshake one of his favourite sayings was if its not broke dont fix it samantha emptied the last of the bottle into her glass and imagined making love to the boy on the screen her breasts looked better in a bra these days they spilled everywhere when she lay down it made her feel flabby and awful she pictured herself forced back against a wall one leg propped up a dress pushed up to her waist and that strong dark boy with his jeans round his knees thrusting in and out of her with a lurch in the pit of her stomach that was almost like happiness she heard the car turning back into the drive and the beams of the headlights swung around the dark sitting room she fumbled with the controls to turn over to the news which took her much longer than it ought to have done she shoved the empty wine bottle under the sofa and clutched her almost empty glass as a prop the front door opened and closed miles entered the room behind her why are you sitting here in the dark he turned on a lamp and she glanced up at him he was as well groomed as he had been when he left except for the raindrops on the shoulders of his jacket how was dinner fine he said you were missed aubrey and julia were sorry you couldnt make it oh im sure and ill bet your mother cried with disappointment he sat down in an armchair at right angles to her staring at her she pushed her hair out of her eyes whats this all about sam if you dont know miles but she was not sure herself or at least she did not know how to condense this sprawling sense of illusage into a coherent accusation i cant see how me standing for the parish council oh for gods sake miles she shouted and was then slightly taken aback by how loud her voice was explain to me please he said what possible difference it can make to you she glared at him struggling to articulate it for his pedantic legal mind which was like a fiddling pair of tweezers in the way that it seized on poor choices of word yet so often failed to grasp the bigger picture what could she say that he would understand that she found howard and shirleys endless talk about the council boring as hell that he was quite tedious enough already with his endlessly retold anecdotes about the good old days back at the rugby club and his selfcongratulatory stories about work without adding pontifications about the fields well i was under the impression said samantha in their dimly lit sitting room that we had other plans like what said miles what are you talking about we said samantha articulated carefully over the rim of her trembling glass that once the girls were out of school wed go travelling we promised each other that remember the formless rage and misery that had consumed her since miles announced his intention to stand for the council had not once led her to mourn the years travelling she had missed but at this moment it seemed to her that that was the real problem or at least that it came closest to expressing both the antagonism and the yearning inside her miles seemed completely bewildered what are you talking about when i got pregnant with lexie samantha said loudly and we couldnt go travelling and your bloody mother made us get married in doublequick time and your father got you a job with edward collins you said we agreed that wed do it when the girls were grown up we said wed go away and do all the things we missed out on he shook his head slowly this is news to me he said where the hell has this come from miles we were in the black canon i told you i was pregnant and you said for christs sake miles i told you i was pregnant and you promised me you promised you want a holiday said miles is that it you want a holiday no miles i dont want a bloody holiday i want dont you remember we said wed take a year out and do it later when the kids were grown up fine then he seemed unnerved determined to brush her aside fine when libbys eighteen in four years time well talk about it again i dont see how me becoming a councillor affects any of this well apart from the bloody boredom of listening to you and your parents whining about the fields for the rest of our natural lives our natural lives he smirked as opposed to piss off she spat dont be such a bloody smartarse miles it might impress your mother well frankly i still dont see what the problem the problem she shouted is that this is about our future miles our future and i dont want to bloody talk about it in four years time i want to talk about it now i think youd better eat something said miles he got to his feet youve had enough to drink screw you miles sorry if youre going to be abusive he turned and walked out of the room she barely stopped herself throwing her wine glass after him the council if he got on it he would never get off he would never renounce his seat the chance to be a proper pagford big shot like howard he was committing himself anew to pagford retaking his vows to the town of his birth to a future quite different from the one he had promised his distraught new fiancée as she sat sobbing on his bed when had they last talked about travelling the world she was not sure years and years ago perhaps but tonight samantha decided that she at least had never changed her mind yes she had always expected that some day they would pack up and leave in search of heat and freedom half the globe away from pagford shirley mollison and lowe the rain the pettiness and the sameness perhaps she had not thought of the white sands of australia and singapore with longing for many years but she would rather be there even with her heavy thighs and her stretch marks than here trapped in pagford forced to watch as miles turned slowly into howard she slumped back down on the sofa groped for the controls and switched back to libbys dvd the band now in black and white was walking slowly along a long empty beach singing the broadshouldered boys shirt was flapping open in the breeze a fine trail of hair led from his navel down into his jeans v alison jenkins the journalist from the yarvil and district gazette had at last established which of the many weedon households in yarvil housed krystal it had been difficult nobody was registered to vote at the address and no landline number was listed for the property alison visited foley road in person on sunday but krystal was out and terri suspicious and antagonistic refused to say when she would be back or confirm that she lived there krystal arrived home a mere twenty minutes after the journalist had departed in her car and she and her mother had another row why dint ya tell her to wait she was gonna interview me abou the fields an stuff interview you fuck off wha the fuck for the argument escalated and krystal walked out again off to nikkis with terris mobile in her tracksuit bottoms she frequently made off with this phone many rows were triggered by her mother demanding it back and krystal pretending that she didnt know where it was dimly krystal hoped that the journalist might know the number somehow and call her directly she was in a crowded jangling café in the shopping centre telling nikki and leanne all about the journalist when the mobile rang oo are you the journalist like os at erri its krystal oos this m your nt other ister oo shouted krystal one finger in the ear not pressed against the phone she wove her way between the densely packed tables to reach a quieter place danielle said the woman loud and clear on the other end of the telephone im yer mums sister oh yeah said krystal disappointed fuckin snobby bitch terri always said when danielles name came up krystal was not sure that she had ever met danielle its abou your great gran oo nana cath said danielle impatiently krystal reached the balcony overlooking the shopping centre forecourt reception was strong here she stopped whas wrong with er said krystal it felt as though her stomach was flipping over the way it had done as a little girl turning somersaults on a railing like the one in front of her thirty feet below the crowds surged carrying plastic bags pushing buggies and dragging toddlers shes in south west general shes been there a week shes had a stroke shes bin there a week said krystal her stomach still swooping nobody told us yeah well she cant speak proply but shes said your name twice mine asked krystal clutching the mobile tightly yeah i think shed like to see yeh its serious theyre sayin she migh not recover wha ward is it asked krystal her mind buzzing twelve highdependency visiting hours are twelve till four six till eight all righ is it i gotta go i only wanted to let you know in case you want to see her bye the line went dead krystal lowered the mobile from her ear staring at the screen she pressed a button repeatedly with her thumb until she saw the word blocked her aunt had withheld her number krystal walked back to nikki and leanne they knew at once that something was wrong go an see er said nikki checking the time on her own mobile yehll ge there fer two ge the bus yeah said krystal blankly she thought of fetching her mother of taking her and robbie to go and see nana cath too but there had been a huge row a year before and her mother and nana cath had had no contact since krystal was sure that terri would take an immense amount of persuading to go to the hospital and was not sure that nana cath would be happy to see her its serious theyre saying she might not recover ave yeh gor enough cash said leanne rummaging in her pockets as the three of them walked up the road towards the bus stop yeah said krystal checking its ony a quid up the hospital innit they had time to share a cigarette before the number twentyseven arrived nikki and leanne waved her off as though she were going somewhere nice at the very last moment krystal felt scared and wanted to shout come with me but then the bus pulled away from the kerb and nikki and leanne were already turning away gossiping the seat was prickly covered in some old smelly fabric the bus trundled onto the road that ran by the precinct and turned right into one of the main thoroughfares that led through all the bigname shops fear fluttered inside krystals belly like a foetus she had known that nana cath was getting older and frailer but somehow vaguely she had expected her to regenerate to return to the heyday that had seemed to last so long for her hair to turn black again her spine to straighten and her memory to sharpen like her caustic tongue she had never thought about nana cath dying always associating her with toughness and invulnerability if she had considered them at all krystal would have thought of the deformity to nana caths chest and the innumerable wrinkles crisscrossing her face as honourable scars sustained during her successful battle to survive nobody close to krystal had ever died of old age death came to the young in her mothers circle sometimes even before their faces and bodies had become emaciated and ravaged the body that krystal had found in the bathroom when she was six had been of a handsome young man as white and lovely as a statue or that was how she remembered him but sometimes she found that memory confusing and doubted it it was hard to know what to believe she had often heard things as a child that adults later contradicted and denied she could have sworn that terri had said it was yer dad but then much later she had said don be so silly yer dads not dead es in bristol innee so krystal had had to try and reattach herself to the idea of banger which was what everybody called the man they said was her father but always in the background there had been nana cath she had escaped foster care because of nana cath ready and waiting in pagford a strong if uncomfortable safety net swearing and furious she had swooped equally aggressive to terri and to the social workers and taken her equally angry greatgranddaughter home krystal did not know whether she had loved or hated that little house in hope street it was dingy and it smelt of bleach it gave you a hemmedin feeling at the same time it was safe entirely safe nana cath would only let approved individuals in through the door there were oldfashioned bath cubes in a glass jar on the end of the bath what if there were other people at nana caths bedside when she got there she would not recognize half her own family and the idea that she might come across strangers tied to her by blood scared her terri had several halfsisters products of her fathers multiple liaisons whom even terri had never met but nana cath tried to keep up with them all doggedly maintaining contact with the large disconnected family her sons had produced occasionally over the years relatives krystal did not recognize had turned up at nana caths while she was there krystal thought that they eyed her askance and said things about her under their voices to nana cath she pretended not to notice and waited for them to leave so that she could have nana cath to herself again she especially disliked the idea that there were any other children in nana caths life oo are they krystal had asked nana cath when she was nine pointing jealously at a framed photograph of two boys in paxton high uniforms on nana caths sideboard thems two o my greatgrandsons said nana cath thas dan and thas ricky theyre your cousins krystal did not want them as cousins and she did not want them on nana caths sideboard an whos tha she demanded pointing at a little girl with curly golden hair thas my michaels little girl rhiannon when she were five beauiful werent she bu she wen an married some wog said nana cath there had never been a photograph of robbie on nana caths sideboard yeh dont even know who the father is do yeh yer whore im washin my ands of yeh ive ad enough terri ive ad it you can look after it yourself the bus trundled on through town past all the sunday afternoon shoppers when krystal had been small terri had taken her into the centre of yarvil nearly every weekend forcing her into a pushchair long past the age when krystal needed it because it was so much easier to hide nicked stuff with a pushchair push it down under the kids legs hide it under the bags in the basket under the seat sometimes terri would go on tandem shoplifting trips with the sister she spoke to cheryl who was married to shane tully cheryl and terri lived four streets away from each other in the fields and petrified the air with their language when they argued which was frequently krystal never knew whether she and her tully cousins were supposed to be on speaking terms or not and no longer bothered keeping track but she spoke to dane whenever she ran across him they had shagged once after splitting a bottle of cider out on the rec when they were fourteen neither of them had ever mentioned it afterwards krystal was hazy on whether or not it was legal doing your cousin something nikki had said had made her think that maybe it wasnt the bus rolled up the road that led to the main entrance of south west general and stopped twenty yards from an enormous long rectangular grey and glass building there were patches of neat grass a few small trees and a forest of signposts krystal followed two old ladies out of the bus and stood with her hands in her tracksuit pockets looking around she had already forgotten what kind of ward danielle had told her nana cath was on she recalled only the number twelve she approached the nearest signpost with a casual air squinting at it almost incidentally it bore line upon line of impenetrable print with words as long as krystals arm and arrows pointing left right diagonally krystal did not read well being confronted with large quantities of words made her feel intimidated and aggressive after several surreptitious glances at the arrows she decided that there were no numbers there at all so she followed the two old ladies towards the double glass doors at the front of the main building the foyer was crowded and more confusing than the signposts there was a bustling shop which was separated from the main hall by floor to ceiling windows there were rows of plastic chairs which seemed to be full of people eating sandwiches there was a packed café in the corner and a kind of hexagonal counter in the middle of the floor where women were answering enquiries as they checked their computers krystal headed there her hands still in her pockets wheres ward twelve krystal asked one of the women in a surly voice third floor said the woman matching her tone krystal did not want to ask anything else out of pride so she turned and walked away until she spotted lifts at the far end of the foyer and entered one going up it took her nearly fifteen minutes to find the ward why didnt they put up numbers and arrows not these stupid long words but then walking along a pale green corridor with her trainers squeaking on the linoleum floor someone called her name krystal it was her aunt cheryl big and broad in a denim skirt and tight white vest with bananayellow blackrooted hair she was tattooed from her knuckles to the tops of her thick arms and wore multiple gold hoops like curtain rings in each ear there was a can of coke in her hand she ain bothered then said cheryl her bare legs were planted firmly apart like a sentry guard oo terri she din wanna come she don know ye i ony jus eard danielle called an tole me cheryl ripped off the ringpull and slurped coke her tiny eyes sunken in a wide flat face that was mottled like corned beef scrutinizing krystal over the top of the can i tole danielle ter call yeh when it appened three days she were lyin in the ouse and no one fuckin found er the state of er fuckin ell krystal did not ask cheryl why she herself had not walked the short distance to foley road to tell terri the news evidently the sisters had fallen out again it was impossible to keep up where is she asked krystal cheryl led the way her flipflops making a slapping noise on the floor hey she said as they walked i ad a call frm a journalist about you didja she give me a number krystal would have asked more questions but they had entered a very quiet ward and she was suddenly frightened she did not like the smell nana cath was almost unrecognizable one side of her face was terribly twisted as though the muscles had been pulled with a wire her mouth dragged to one side even her eye seemed to droop there were tubes taped to her a needle in her arm lying down the deformity in her chest was much more obvious the sheet rose and fell in odd places as if the grotesque head on its scrawny neck protruded from a barrel when krystal sat down beside her nana cath made no movement she simply gazed one little hand trembled slightly she ain talkin bu she said yer name twice las nigh cheryl told her staring gloomily over the rim of her can there was a tightness in krystals chest she did not know whether it would hurt nana cath to hold her hand she edged her own fingers to within a few inches of nana caths but let them rest on the bedspread rhiannons bin in said cheryl an john an sue sues tryin ter get hold of annemarie krystals spirits leapt where is she she asked cheryl somewhere out frenchay way yknow shes got a baby now yeah i eard said krystal wha was it dunno said cheryl swigging coke someone at school had told her hey krystal your sisters up the duff she had been excited by the news she was going to be an auntie even if she never saw the baby all her life she had been in love with the idea of annemarie who had been taken away before krystal was born spirited into another dimension like a fairytale character as beautiful and mysterious as the dead man in terris bathroom nana caths lips moved wha said krystal bending low half scared half elated dyeh wan somethin nana cath asked cheryl so loudly that whispering guests at other beds stared over krystal could hear a wheezing rattling noise but nana cath seemed to be making a definite attempt to form a word cheryl was leaning over the other side one hand gripping the metal bars at the head of the bed oh mm said nana cath wha said krystal and cheryl together the eyes had moved millimetres rheumy filmy eyes looking at krystals smooth young face her open mouth as she leaned over her greatgrandmother puzzled eager and fearful owin said the cracked old voice she dunno wha shes sayin cheryl shouted over her shoulder at the timid couple visiting at the next bed three days lef on the fuckin floor snot surprisin is it but tears had blurred krystals eyes the ward with its high windows dissolved into white light and shadow she seemed to see a flash of bright sunlight on dark green water fragmented into brilliant shards by the splashing rise and fall of oars yeah she whispered to nana cath yeah i goes rowin nana but it was no longer true because mr fairbrother was dead vi the fuck have you done to your face come off the bike again asked fats no said andrew sipie hit me i was trying to tell the stupid cunt hed got it wrong about fairbrother he and his father had been in the woodshed filling the baskets that sat on either side of the woodburner in the sitting room simon had hit andrew around the head with a log knocking him into the pile of wood grazing his acnecovered cheek dyou think you know more about what goes on than i do you spotty little shit if i hear youve breathed a word of what goes on in this house i havent ill fucking skin you alive dyou hear me how do you know fairbrother wasnt on the fiddle too eh and the other fucker was the only one dumb enough to get caught and then whether out of pride or defiance or because his fantasies of easy money had taken too strong a hold on his imagination to become dislodged by facts simon had sent in his application forms humiliation for which the whole family would surely pay was a certainty sabotage andrew brooded on the word he wanted to bring his father crashing down from the heights to which his dreams of easy money had raised him and he wanted to do it if at all possible for he preferred glory without death in such a way that simon would never know whose manoeuvrings had brought his ambitions to rubble he confided in nobody not even fats he told fats nearly everything but the few omissions were the vast topics the ones that occupied nearly all his interior space it was one thing to sit in fats room with hardons and look up girlongirl action on the internet quite another to confess how obsessively he pondered ways of engaging gaia bawden in conversation likewise it was easy to sit in the cubby hole and call his father a cunt but never would he have told how simons rages turned his hands cold and his stomach queasy but then came the hour that changed everything it started with nothing more than a yearning for nicotine and beauty the rain had passed off at last and the pale spring sun shone brightly on the fishscale dirt on the schoolbus windows as it jerked and lurched through the narrow streets of pagford andrew was sitting near the back unable to see gaia who was hemmed in at the front by sukhvinder and the fatherless fairbrother girls newly returned to school he had barely seen gaia all day and faced a barren evening with only stale facebook pictures to console him as the bus approached hope street it struck andrew that neither of his parents was at home to notice his absence three cigarettes that fats had given him resided in his inside pocket and gaia was getting up holding tightly to the bar on the back of the seat readying herself to descend still talking to sukhvinder jawanda why not why not so he got up too swung his bag over his shoulder and when the bus stopped walked briskly up the aisle after the two girls as they got out see you at home he threw out to a startled paul as he passed he reached the sunny pavement and the bus rumbled away lighting up he watched gaia and sukhvinder over the top of his cupped hands they were not heading towards gaias house in hope street but ambling up towards the square smoking and scowling slightly in unconscious imitation of the most unselfconscious person he knew fats andrew followed them his eyes feasting on gaias copperbrown hair as it bounced on her shoulder blades the swing of her skirt as her hips swayed beneath it the two girls slowed down as they approached the square advancing towards mollison and lowe which had the most impressive façade of them all blue and gold lettering across the front and four hanging baskets andrew hung back the girls paused to examine a small white sign pasted to the window of the new café then disappeared into the delicatessen andrew walked once around the square past the black canon and the george hotel and stopped at the sign it was a handlettered advertisement for weekend staff hyperconscious of his acne which was particularly virulent at the moment he knocked out the end of his cigarette put the long stub back into his pocket and followed gaia and sukhvinder inside the girls were standing beside a little table piled high with boxed oatcakes and crackers watching the enormous man in the deerstalker behind the counter talking to an elderly customer gaia looked around when the bell over the door tinkled hi andrew said his mouth dry hi she replied blinded by his own daring andrew walked nearer and the school bag over his shoulder bumped into the revolving stand of guides to pagford and traditional west country cooking he seized the stand and steadied it then hastily lowered his bag you after a job gaia asked him quietly in her miraculous london accent yeah he said you she nodded flag it up on the suggestion page eddie howard was booming at the customer post it on the website and ill get it on the agenda for you pagford parish council all one word dot co dot uk slash suggestion page or follow the link pagford he reiterated slowly as the man pulled out paper and a pen with a quivering hand parish howards eyes flicked over the three teenagers waiting quietly beside the savoury biscuits they were wearing the halfhearted uniform of winterdown which permitted so much laxity and variation that it was barely a uniform at all unlike that of st annes which comprised a neat tartan skirt and a blazer for all that the white girl was stunning a precisioncut diamond set off by the plain jawanda daughter whose name howard did not know and a mousehaired boy with violently erupted skin the customer creaked out of the shop the bell tinkled can i help you howard asked his eyes on gaia yeah she said moving forwards um about the jobs she pointed at the small sign in the window ah yes said howard beaming his new weekend waiter had let him down a few days previously thrown over the café for yarvil and a supermarket job yes yes fancy waitressing do you were offering minimum wage nine to halfpast five saturdays twelve to halfpast five sundays opening two weeks from today training provided how old are you my love she was perfect perfect exactly what he had been imagining freshfaced and curvy he could just imagine her in a figurehugging black dress with a laceedged white apron he would teach her to use the till and show her around the stockroom there would be a bit of banter and perhaps a little bonus on days when the takings were up howard sidled out from behind the counter and ignoring sukhvinder and andrew took gaia by the upper arm and led her through the arch in the dividing wall there were no tables and chairs there yet but the counter had been installed and so had a tiled black and cream mural on the wall behind it which showed the square in yesteryear crinolined women and men in top hats swarmed everywhere a brougham carriage had drawn up outside a clearly marked mollison and lowe and beside it was the little café the copper kettle the artist had improvised an ornamental pump instead of the war memorial andrew and sukhvinder were left behind awkward and vaguely antagonistic to each other yes can i help you a stooping woman with a jetblack bouffant had emerged from out of a back room andrew and sukhvinder muttered that they were waiting and then howard and gaia reappeared in the archway when he saw maureen howard dropped gaias arm which he had been holding absentmindedly while he explained to her what a waitresss duties would be i might have found us some more help for the kettle mo he said oh yes said maureen switching her hungry gaze to gaia have you got experience but howard boomed over her telling gaia all about the delicatessen and how he liked to think it was a bit of a pagford institution a bit of a landmark thirtyfive years its been said howard with a majestic disdain of his own mural the young ladys new to town mo he added and you two are after jobs as well are you maureen asked sukhvinder and andrew sukhvinder shook her head andrew made an equivocal movement with his shoulders but gaia said with her eyes on the girl go on you said you might howard considered sukhvinder who would most certainly not appear to advantage in a tight black dress and frilly apron but his fertile and flexible mind was firing in all directions a compliment to her father something of a hold over her mother an unasked favour granted there were matters beyond the purely aesthetic that ought perhaps to be considered here well if we get the business were expecting we could probably do with two he said scratching his chins with his eyes on sukhvinder who had blushed unattractively i dont she said but gaia urged her go on together sukhvinder was flushed and her eyes were watering i go on whispered gaia i all right well give you a trial then miss jawanda said howard doused in fear sukhvinder could hardly breathe what would her mother say and i suppose youre wanting to be potboy are you howard boomed at andrew potboy its heavy lifting we need my friend said howard while andrew blinked at him nonplussed he had only read the large type at the top of the sign pallets into the stockroom crates of milk up from the cellar and rubbish bagged up at the back proper manual labour do you think you can handle that yeah said andrew would he be there when gaia was there that was all that mattered well need you early eight oclock probably well say eight till three and see how it goes trial period of two weeks yeah fine said andrew whats your name when howard heard it he raised his eyebrows is your father simon simon price yeah andrew was unnerved nobody knew who his father was usually howard told the two girls to come back on sunday afternoon when the till was to be delivered and he would be at liberty to instruct them then though he showed an inclination to keep gaia in conversation a customer entered and the teenagers took their chance to slip outside andrew could think of nothing to say once they found themselves on the other side of the tinkling glass door but before he could marshal his thoughts gaia threw him a careless bye and walked away with sukhvinder andrew lit up the second of fats three fags this was no time for a halfsmoked stub which gave him an excuse to remain stationary while he watched her walk away into the lengthening shadows why do they call him peanut that boy gaia asked sukhvinder once they were out of earshot of andrew hes allergic said sukhvinder she was horrified at the prospect of telling parminder what she had done her voice sounded like somebody elses he nearly died at st thomass somebody gave him one hidden in a marshmallow oh said gaia i thought it might be because he had a tiny dick she laughed and so did sukhvinder forcing herself as though jokes about penises were all she heard day in day out andrew saw them both glance back at him as they laughed and knew that they were talking about him the giggling might be a hopeful sign he knew that much about girls anyway grinning at nothing but the cooling air he walked off school bag over his shoulder cigarette in his hand across the square towards church row and thence to forty minutes of steep climbing up out of town to hilltop house the hedgerows were ghostly pale with white blossom in the dusk blackthorn blooming on either side of him celandine fringing the lane with tiny glossy heartshaped leaves the smell of the flowers the deep pleasure of the cigarette and the promise of weekends with gaia everything blended together into a glorious symphony of elation and beauty as andrew puffed up the hill the next time simon said got a job pizza face he would be able to say yes he was going to be gaia bawdens weekend workmate and to cap it all he knew at last exactly how he might plunge an anonymous dagger straight between his fathers shoulder blades vii once the first impulse of spite had worn off samantha bitterly regretted inviting gavin and kay to dinner she spent friday morning joking with her assistant about the dreadful evening she was bound to have but her mood plummeted once she had left carly in charge of over the shoulder boulder holders a name that had made howard laugh so hard the first time he had heard it that it had brought on an asthma attack and which made shirley scowl whenever it was spoken in her presence driving back to pagford ahead of the rush hour so that she could shop for ingredients and start cooking samantha tried to cheer herself up by thinking of nasty questions to ask gavin perhaps she might wonder aloud why kay had not moved in with him that would be a good one walking home from the square with bulging mollison and lowe carrier bags in each hand she came across mary fairbrother beside the cashpoint machine in the wall of barrys bank mary hi how are you mary was thin and pale with grey patches around her eyes their conversation was stilted and strange they had not spoken since the journey in the ambulance barring brief awkward condolences at the funeral ive been meaning to drop in mary said you were so kind and i wanted to thank miles no need samantha said awkwardly oh but id like oh but then please do after mary had walked away samantha had the awful feeling that she might have given the impression that that evening would be a perfect time for mary to come round once home she dropped the bags in the hall and telephoned miles at work to tell him what she had done but he displayed an infuriating equanimity about the prospect of adding a newly widowed woman to their foursome i cant see what the problem is really he said nice for mary to get out but i didnt say we were having gavin and kay over mary likes gav said miles i wouldnt worry about it he was samantha thought being deliberately obtuse no doubt in retaliation for her refusal to go to sweetlove house after she had hung up she wondered whether to call mary to tell her not to come that evening but she was afraid of sounding rude and settled for hoping that mary would find herself unequal to calling in after all stalking into the sitting room she put on libbys boy band dvd at full volume so that she would be able to hear it in the kitchen then carried the bags through and set to work preparing a casserole and her fallback pudding mississippi mud pie she would have liked to buy one of mollison and lowes large gateaux to save herself some work but it would have got straight back to shirley who frequently intimated that samantha was overreliant on frozen food and ready meals samantha knew the boy band dvd so well by now that she was able to visualize the images matching the music blaring through to the kitchen several times that week while miles was upstairs in his home study or on the telephone to howard she had watched it again when she heard the opening bars of the track where the muscular boy walked with his shirt flapping open along the beach she went through to watch in her apron absentmindedly sucking her chocolatey fingers she had planned on having a long shower while miles laid the table forgetting that he would be late home because he had to drive into yarvil to pick up the girls from st annes when samantha realized why he had not returned and that their daughters would be with him when he did she had to fly around to organize the dining room herself then find something to feed lexie and libby before the guests arrived miles found his wife in her work clothes at halfpast seven sweaty cross and inclined to blame him for what had been her own idea fourteenyearold libby marched into the sitting room without greeting samantha and removed the disc from the dvd player oh good i was wondering what id done with that she said whys the tv on have you been playing it sometimes samantha thought that her younger daughter had a look of shirley about her i was watching the news libby i havent got time to watch dvds come through your pizzas ready weve got people coming round frozen pizza again miles i need to change can you mash the potatoes for me miles but he had disappeared upstairs so samantha pounded the potatoes herself while her daughters ate at the island in the middle of the kitchen libby had propped the dvd cover against her glass of diet pepsi and was ogling it mikeys so lush she said with a carnal groan that took samantha aback but the muscular boy was called jake samantha was glad they did not like the same one loud and confident lexie was jabbering about school a machinegun torrent of information about girls whom samantha did not know with whose antics and feuds and regroupings she could not keep up all right you two ive got to change clear away when youre done all right she turned down the heat under the casserole and hurried upstairs miles was buttoning up his shirt in the bedroom watching himself in the wardrobe mirror the whole room smelt of soap and aftershave everything under control hon yes thanks so glad youve had time to shower spat samantha pulling out her favourite long skirt and top slamming the wardrobe door you could have one now theyll be here in ten minutes i wont have time to dry my hair and put on makeup she kicked off her shoes one of them hit the radiator with a loud clang when youve finished preening could you please go downstairs and sort out drinks after miles had left the room she tried to untangle her thick hair and repair her makeup she looked awful only when she had changed did she realize that she was wearing the wrong bra for her clinging top after a frantic search she remembered that the right one was drying in the utility room she hurried out onto the landing but the doorbell rang swearing she scuttled back to the bedroom the boy bands music was blaring out of libbys room gavin and kay had arrived on the dot of eight because gavin was afraid of what samantha might say if they turned up late he could imagine her suggesting that they had lost track of time because they were shagging or that they must have had a row she seemed to think that one of the perks of marriage was that it gave you rights of comment and intrusion over single peoples love lives she also thought that her crass uninhibited way of talking especially when drunk constituted trenchant humour helloelloello said miles moving back to let gavin and kay inside come in come in welcome to casa mollison he kissed kay on both cheeks and relieved her of the chocolates she was holding for us thanks very much lovely to meet you properly at last gavs been keeping you under wraps for far too long miles shook the wine out of gavins hand then clapped him on the back which gavin resented come on through samll be down in a mo whatll you have to drink kay would ordinarily have found miles rather smooth and overfamiliar but she was determined to suspend judgement couples had to mix with each others circles and manage to get along in them this evening represented significant progress in her quest to infiltrate the layers of his life to which gavin had never admitted her and she wanted to show him that she was at home in the mollisons big smug house that there was no need to exclude her any more so she smiled at miles asked for a red wine and admired the spacious room with its stripped pine floorboards its overcushioned sofa and its framed prints been here for ooh getting on for fourteen years said miles busy with the corkscrew youre down in hope street arent you nice little houses some great fixerupper opportunities down there samantha appeared smiling without warmth kay who had previously seen her only in an overcoat noted the tightness of her orange top beneath which every detail of her lacy bra was clearly visible her face was even darker than her leathery chest her eye makeup was thick and unflattering and her jangling gold earrings and highheeled golden mules were in kays opinion tarty samantha struck her as the kind of woman who would have raucous girls nights out and find stripograms hilarious and flirt drunkenly with everyone elses partner at parties hi there said samantha she kissed gavin and smiled at kay great youve got drinks ill have the same as kay miles she turned away to sit down having already taken stock of the other womans appearance kay was smallbreasted and heavyhipped and had certainly chosen her black trousers to minimize the size of her bottom she would have done better in samanthas opinion to wear heels given the shortness of her legs her face was attractive enough with eventoned olive skin large dark eyes and a generous mouth but the closely cropped boys hair and the resolutely flat shoes were undoubtedly pointers to certain sacrosanct beliefs gavin had done it again he had gone and picked another humourless domineering woman who would make his life a misery so said samantha brightly raising her glass gavinandkay she saw with satisfaction gavins hangdog wince of a smile but before she could make him squirm more or weasel private information out of them both to dangle over shirleys and maureens heads the doorbell rang again mary appeared fragile and angular especially beside miles who ushered her into the room her tshirt hung from protruding collarbones oh she said coming to a startled halt on the threshold i didnt realize you were having gavin and kay just dropped in said samantha a little wildly come in mary please have a drink mary this is kay said miles kay this is mary fairbrother oh said kay thrown she had thought that it would only be the four of them yes hello gavin who could tell that mary had not meant to drop in on a dinner party and was on the point of walking straight back out again patted the sofa beside him mary sat down with a weak smile he was overjoyed to see her here was his buffer even samantha must realize that her particular brand of prurience would be inappropriate in front of a bereaved woman plus the constrictive symmetry of a foursome had been broken up how are you he said quietly i was going to give you a ring actually thereve been developments with the insurance havent we got any nibbles sam asked miles samantha walked from the room seething at miles the smell of scorched meat met her as she opened the kitchen door oh shit shit shit she had completely forgotten the casserole which had dried out desiccated chunks of meat and vegetables sat forlorn survivors of the catastrophe on the singed bottom of the pot samantha sloshed in wine and stock chiselling the adhering bits off the pan with her spoon stirring vigorously sweating in the heat miles highpitched laugh rang out from the sitting room samantha put on longstemmed broccoli to steam drained her glass of wine ripped open a bag of tortilla chips and a tub of hummus and upended them into bowls mary and gavin were still conversing quietly on the sofa when she returned to the sitting room while miles was showing kay a framed aerial photograph of pagford and giving her a lesson in the towns history samantha set down the bowls on the coffee table poured herself another drink and settled into the armchair making no effort to join either conversation it was awfully uncomfortable to have mary there with her grief hanging so heavily around her she might as well have walked in trailing a shroud surely though she would leave before dinner gavin was determined that mary should stay as they discussed the latest developments in their ongoing battle with the insurance company he felt much more relaxed and in control than he usually did in miles and samanthas presence nobody was chipping away at him or patronizing him and miles was absolving him temporarily of all responsibility for kay and just here just out of sight miles was saying pointing to a spot two inches past the frame of the picture youve got sweetlove house the fawley place big queen anne manor house dormers stone quoins stunning you should visit its open to the public on sundays in the summer important family locally the fawleys stone quoins important family locally god you are an arse miles samantha hoisted herself out of her armchair and returned to the kitchen though the casserole was watery the burnt flavour dominated the broccoli was flaccid and tasteless the mashed potato cool and dry past caring she decanted it all into dishes and slammed it down on the circular diningroom table dinners ready she called at the sittingroom door oh i must go said mary jumping up i didnt mean no no no said gavin in a tone that kay had never heard before kindly and cajoling itll do you good to eat kidsll be all right for an hour miles added his support and mary looked uncertainly towards samantha who was forced to add her voice to theirs then dashed back through into the dining room to lay another setting she invited mary to sit between gavin and miles because placing her next to a woman seemed to emphasize her husbands absence kay and miles had moved on to discussing social work i dont envy you he said serving kay a large ladle full of casserole samantha could see black scorched flecks in the sauce spreading across the white plate bloody difficult job well were perennially underresourced said kay but it can be satisfying especially when you can feel youre making a difference and she thought of the weedons terris urine sample had tested negative at the clinic yesterday and robbie had had a full week in nursery the recollection cheered her counterbalancing her slight irritation that gavins attention was still focused entirely on mary that he was doing nothing to help ease her conversation with his friends youve got a daughter havent you kay thats right gaia shes sixteen same age as lexie we should get them together said miles divorced asked samantha delicately no said kay we werent married he was a university boyfriend and we split up not long after she was born yeah miles and i had barely left university ourselves said samantha kay did not know whether samantha meant to draw a distinction between herself who had married the big smug father of her children and kay who had been left not that samantha could know that brendan had left her gaias taken a saturday job with your father actually kay told miles at the new café miles was delighted he took enormous pleasure in the idea that he and howard were so much part of the fabric of the place that everybody in pagford was connected to them whether as friend or client customer or employee gavin who was chewing and chewing on a bit of rubbery meat that was refusing to yield to his teeth experienced a further lowering in the pit of his stomach it was news to him that gaia had taken a job with miles father somehow he had forgotten that kay possessed in gaia another powerful device for anchoring herself to pagford when not in the immediate vicinity of her slamming doors her vicious looks and caustic asides gavin tended to forget that gaia had any independent existence at all that she was not simply part of the uncomfortable backdrop of stale sheets bad cooking and festering grudges against which his relationship with kay staggered on does gaia like pagford samantha asked well its a bit quiet compared to hackney said kay but shes settling in well she took a large gulp of wine to wash out her mouth after disgorging the enormous lie there had been yet another row before leaving tonight whats the matter with you kay had asked while gaia sat at the kitchen table hunched over her laptop wearing a dressing gown over her clothes four or five boxes of dialogue were open on the screen kay knew that gaia was communicating online with the friends she had left behind in hackney friends she had had in most cases since she had been in primary school gaia refusal to answer was new and ominous kay was used to explosions of bile and rage against herself and particularly gavin gaia im talking to you i know i can hear you then kindly have the courtesy to answer me back black dialogue jerked upwards in the boxes on the screen funny little icons blinking and waggling gaia please will you answer me what what do you want im trying to ask about your day my day was shit yesterday was shit tomorrow will be shit as well when did you get home the same time i always get home sometimes even after all these years gaia displayed resentment at having to let herself in at kay not being at home to meet her like a storybook mother do you want to tell me why your day was shit because you dragged me to live in a shithole kay willed herself not to shout lately there had been screaming matches that she was sure the whole street had heard you know that im going out with gavin tonight gaia muttered something kay did not catch what i said i didnt think he liked taking you out whats that supposed to mean but gaia did not answer she simply typed a response into one of the scrolling conversations on the screen kay vacillated both wanting to press her and afraid of what she might hear well be back around midnight i expect gaia had not responded kay had gone to wait for gavin in the hall gaias made friends kay told miles with a girl who lives in this street whats her name narinder sukhvinder said miles and samantha together shes a nice girl said mary have you met her father samantha asked kay no said kay hes a heart surgeon said samantha who was on her fourth glass of wine absolutely bloody gorgeous oh said kay like a bollywood film star none of them samantha reflected had bothered to tell her that dinner was tasty which would have been simple politeness even though it was awful if she wasnt allowed to torment gavin she ought at least to be able to needle miles vikrams the only good thing about living in this godforsaken town i can tell you said samantha sex on legs and his wifes our local gp said miles and a parish councillor youll be employed by yarvil district council kay are you thats right said kay but i spend most of my time in the fields theyre technically in pagford parish arent they not the fields thought samantha oh dont mention the bloody fields ah said miles with a meaningful smile yes well the fields do belong to pagford technically technically they do painful subject kay really why asked kay hoping to make conversation general because gavin was still talking in an undertone to the widow well you see this is back in the fifties miles seemed to be embarking on a wellrehearsed speech yarvil wanted to expand the cantermill estate and instead of building out to the west where the bypass is now gavin mary more wine samantha called over miles they were a little bit duplicitous land was bought without it being very clear what they wanted it for and then they went and expanded the estate over the border into pagford parish why arent you mentioning old aubrey fawley miles asked samantha she had at last reached that delicious point of intoxication where her tongue became wicked and she became disengaged from fear of consequences eager to provoke and to irritate seeking nothing but her own amusement the truth is that old aubrey fawley who used to own all those lovely stone quoits or whatever miles was telling you about did a deal behind everyones backs thats not fair sam said miles but she talked over him again he flogged off the land where the fields are built pocketed i dont know must have been a quarter of a mill or so dont talk rubbish sam back in the fifties but then once he realized everyone was pissed off with him he pretended he hadnt known it would cause trouble upperclass twit and a drunk added samantha simply not true im afraid miles said firmly to fully understand the problem kay you need to appreciate a bit of local history samantha holding her chin in her hand pretended to slide her elbow off the table in boredom though she could not like samantha kay laughed and gavin and mary broke off their quiet conversation were talking about the fields said kay in a tone intended to remind gavin that she was there that he ought to be giving her moral support miles samantha and gavin realized simultaneously that the fields was a most tactless subject to raise in front of mary when they had been such a bone of contention between barry and howard apparently theyre a bit of a sore subject locally said kay wanting to force gavin to express a view to rope him in mmm he replied and turning back to mary he said so hows declans football coming on kay experienced a powerful stab of fury mary might be recently bereaved but gavins solicitousness seemed unnecessarily pointed she had imagined this evening quite differently a foursome in which gavin would have to acknowledge that they really were a couple yet nobody looking on would imagine that they enjoyed a closer relationship than acquaintanceship also the food was horrible kay put her knife and fork together with threequarters of her helping untouched an act that was not lost on samantha and addressed miles again did you grow up in pagford afraid so said miles smiling complacently born in the old kelland hospital along the road they closed it in the eighties and you kay asked samantha who cut across her god no im here by accident sorry i dont know what you do samantha asked kay ive got my own busi she sells outsize bras said miles samantha got up abruptly and went to fetch another bottle of wine when she returned to the table miles was telling kay the humorous anecdote doubtless intended to illustrate how everyone knew everyone in pagford of how he had been pulled over in the car one night by a policeman who turned out to be a friend he had known since primary school the blowbyblow reenactment of the banter between himself and steve edwards was tediously familiar to samantha as she moved around the table replenishing all the glasses she watched kays austere expression evidently kay did not find drinkdriving a laughing matter so steves holding out the breathalyser and im about to blow in it and out of nowhere we both start cracking up his partners got no idea what the hells going on hes like this miles mimed a man turning his head from side to side in astonishment and steves bent double pissing himself because all we can think of is the last time he was holding something steady for me to blow into which was nigh on twenty years ago and it was a blowup doll said samantha unsmiling dropping back into her seat beside miles miles and steve put it in their friend ians parents bed during ians eighteenthbirthday party anyway in the end miles was fined a grand and got three points on his licence because it was the second time hed been caught over the limit so that was hysterically funny miles grin remained foolishly in place like a limp balloon forgotten after a party a stiff little chill seemed to blow through the temporarily silent room though miles struck her as an almighty bore kay was on his side he was the only one at the table who seemed remotely inclined to ease her passage into pagford social life i must say the fields are pretty rough she said reverting to the subject with which miles seemed most comfortable and still ignorant that it was in any way inauspicious within marys vicinity ive worked in the inner cities i didnt expect to see that kind of deprivation in a rural area but its not all that different from london less of an ethnic mix of course oh yes weve got our share of addicts and wasters said miles i think thats about all i can manage sam he added pushing his plate away from him with a sizeable amount of food still on it samantha started to clear the table mary got up to help no no its fine mary you relax samantha said to kays annoyance gavin jumped up too chivalrously insisting on marys sitting back down but mary insisted too that was lovely sam said mary in the kitchen as they scraped most of the food into the bin no it wasnt it was horrible said samantha who was only appreciating how drunk she was now that she was on her feet what do you think of kay i dont know shes not what i expected said mary shes exactly what i expected said samantha taking out plates for pudding shes another lisa if you ask me oh no dont say that said mary he deserves someone nice this time this was a most novel point of view to samantha who was of the opinion that gavins wetness merited constant punishment they returned to the dining room to find an animated conversation in progress between kay and miles while gavin sat in silence offload responsibility for them which seems to me to be a pretty selfcentred and selfsatisfied well i think its interesting that you use the word responsibility said miles because i think that goes to the very heart of the problem doesnt it the question is where exactly do we draw the line beyond the fields apparently kay laughed with condescension you want to draw a line neatly between the homeowning middle classes and the lower pagfords full of workingclass people kay the difference is most of them work dyou know what proportion of the fields lives off benefits responsibility you say what happened to personal responsibility weve had them through the local school for years kids who havent got a single worker in the family the concept of earning a living is completely foreign to them generations of nonworkers and were expected to subsidize them so your solution is to shunt off the problem onto yarvil said kay not to engage with any of the underlying mississippi mud pie called samantha gavin and mary took slices with thanks kay to samanthas fury simply held out her plate as though samantha were a waitress her attention all on miles the addiction clinic which is absolutely crucial and which certain people are apparently lobbying to close oh well if youre talking about bellchapel said miles shaking his head and smirking i hope youve mugged up on what the success rates are kay pathetic frankly absolutely pathetic ive seen the figures i was going through them this morning and i wont lie to you the sooner they close and the figures youre talking about are success rates kay exactly what i said the number of people who have actually stopped using drugs gone clean im sorry but thats a very naive point of view if youre going to judge success purely but how on earth else are we supposed to judge an addiction clinics success demanded miles incredulous as far as i can tell all they do at bellchapel is dole out methadone which half of their clients use alongside heroin anyway the whole problem of addiction is immensely complicated said kay and its naive and simplistic to put the problem purely in terms of users and non but miles was shaking his head smiling kay who had been enjoying her verbal duel with this selfsatisfied lawyer was suddenly angry well i can give you a very concrete example of what bellchapels doing one family im working with mother teenage daughter and small son if the mother wasnt on methadone shed be on the streets trying to pay for her habit the kids are immeasurably better off theyd be better off away from their mother by the sound of it said miles and where exactly would you propose they go a decent foster home would be a good start said miles do you know how many foster homes there are against how many kids needing them asked kay the best solution would have been to have them adopted at birth fabulous ill hop in my time machine retorted kay well we know a couple who were desperate to adopt said samantha unexpectedly throwing her weight behind miles she would not forgive kay for the rude outstretched plate the woman was bolshy and patronizing exactly like lisa who had monopolized every gettogether with her political views and her job in family law despising samantha for owning a bra shop adam and janice she reminded miles in parenthesis who nodded and they couldnt get a baby for love nor money could they yes a baby said kay rolling her eyes everybody wants a baby robbies nearly four hes not pottytrained hes developmentally behind for his age and hes almost certainly had inappropriate exposure to sexual behaviour would your friends like to adopt him but the point is if hed been taken from his mother at birth she was off the drugs when he was born and making good progress said kay she loved him and wanted to keep him and she was meeting his needs at the time shed already raised krystal with some family support krystal shrieked samantha oh my god are we talking about the weedons kay was horrified that she had used names it had never mattered in london but everyone truly did know everyone in pagford it seemed i shouldnt have but miles and samantha were laughing and mary looked tense kay who had not touched her pie and had managed very little of the first course realized that she had drunk too much she had been sipping wine steadily out of nerves and now she had committed a prime indiscretion still it was too late to undo that anger overrode every other consideration krystal weedon is no advert for that womans mothering skills said miles krystals trying her damnedest to hold her family together said kay she loves her little brother very much shes terrified hell be taken away i wouldnt trust krystal weedon to look after a boiling egg said miles and samantha laughed again oh look its to her credit she loves her brother but he isnt a cuddly toy yes i know that snapped kay remembering robbies shitty crusted bottom but hes still loved krystal bullied our daughter lexie said samantha so weve seen a different side of her to the one im sure she shows you look we all know krystals had a rough deal said miles nobodys denying that its the drugaddled mother ive got an issue with as a matter of fact shes doing very well on the bellchapel programme at the moment but with her history said miles it isnt rocket science is it to guess that shell relapse if you apply that rule across the board you ought not to have a driving licence because with your history youre bound to drink and drive again miles was temporarily baffled but samantha said coldly i think thats a rather different thing do you said kay its the same principle yes well principles are sometimes the problem if you ask me said miles often whats needed is a bit of common sense which is the name people usually give to their prejudices rejoined kay according to nietzsche said a sharp new voice making them all jump philosophy is the biography of the philosopher a miniature samantha stood at the door into the hall a busty girl of around sixteen in tight jeans and a tshirt she was eating a handful of grapes and looking rather pleased with herself everyone meet lexie said miles proudly thank you for that genius youre welcome said lexie pertly and she swept off upstairs a heavy silence sank over the table without really knowing why samantha miles and kay all glanced towards mary who looked as though she might be on the verge of tears coffee said samantha lurching to her feet mary disappeared into the bathroom lets go and sit through said miles conscious that the atmosphere was somewhat charged but confident that he could with a few jokes and his habitual bonhomie steer everyone back into charity with each other bring your glasses his inner certainties had been no more rearranged by kays arguments than a breeze can move a boulder yet his feeling towards her was not unkind but rather pitying he was the least intoxicated by the constant refilling of glasses but on reaching the sitting room he realized how very full his bladder was whack on some music gav and ill go and get those choccies but gavin made no move towards the vertical stacks of cds in their sleek perspex stands he seemed to be waiting for kay to start on him sure enough as soon as miles had vanished from sight kay said well thank you very much gav thanks for all the support gavin had drunk even more greedily than kay throughout dinner enjoying his own private celebration that he had not after all been offered up as a sacrifice to samanthas gladiatorial bullying he faced kay squarely full of a courage born not only of wine but because he had been treated for an hour as somebody important knowledgeable and supportive by mary you seemed to be doing ok on your own he said indeed the little he had permitted himself to hear of kay and miles argument had given him a pronounced sense of déjà vu if he had not had mary to distract him he might have fancied himself back on that famous evening in the identical dining room when lisa had told miles that he epitomized all that was wrong with society and miles had laughed in her face and lisa had lost her temper and refused to stay for coffee it was not very long after that lisa had admitted that she was sleeping with an associate partner at her firm and advised gavin to get tested for chlamydia i dont know any of these people said kay and you havent done one damn thing to make it any easier for me have you what did you want me to do asked gavin he was wonderfully calm insulated by the imminent returns of the mollisons and mary and by the copious amounts of chianti he had consumed i didnt want an argument about the fields i dont give a monkeys about the fields plus he added its a touchy subject around mary barry was fighting on the council to keep the fields part of pagford well then why couldnt you have told me given me a hint he laughed exactly as miles had laughed at her before she could retort the others returned like the magi bearing gifts samantha carrying a tray of cups followed by mary holding the cafetière and miles with kays chocolates kay saw the flamboyant gold ribbon on the box and remembered how optimistic she had been about tonight when she had bought them she turned her face away trying to hide her anger frantic with the desire to shout at gavin and also with a sudden shocking urge to cry its been so nice she heard mary say in a thick voice that suggested she too might have been crying but i wont stay for coffee i dont want to be late back declans a bit a bit unsettled at the moment thanks so much sam miles its been good to you know well get out for a bit ill walk you up the miles began but gavin was talking firmly over him you stay here miles ill see mary back ill walk you up the road mary itll only take five minutes its dark up the top there kay was barely breathing all her being was concentrated in loathing of complacent miles tarty samantha and fragile drooping mary but most of all of gavin himself oh yes she heard herself saying as everybody seemed to look towards her for permission yep you see mary home gav she heard the front door close and gavin had gone miles was pouring kays coffee she watched the stream of hot black liquid fall and felt suddenly painfully alive to what she had risked in overthrowing her life for the man walking away into the night with another woman viii colin wall saw gavin and mary pass under his study window he recognized marys silhouette at once but had to squint to identify the stringy man at her side before they moved out of the aureole cast by the street light crouching halfraised out of his computer chair colin gaped after the figures as they disappeared into the darkness he was shocked to his core having taken it for granted that mary was in a kind of purdah that she was receiving only women in the sanctuary of her own home among them tessa who was still visiting every other day never had it occurred to him that mary might be socializing after dark least of all with a single man he felt personally betrayed as though mary on some spiritual level was cuckolding him had mary permitted gavin to see barrys body was gavin spending evenings sitting in barrys favourite seat by the fire were gavin and mary could they possibly be such things happened after all every day perhaps perhaps even before barrys death colin was perennially appalled by the threadbare state of other peoples morals he tried to insulate himself against shocks by pushing himself to imagine the worst by conjuring awful visions of depravity and betrayal rather than waiting for the truth to rip like a shell through his innocent delusions life for colin was one long brace against pain and disappointment and everybody apart from his wife was an enemy until they had proven otherwise he was half inclined to rush downstairs to tell tessa what he had just seen because she might be able to give him an innocuous explanation of marys nighttime stroll and to reassure him that his best friends widow had been and was still faithful to her husband nonetheless he resisted the urge because he was angry with tessa why was she showing such a determined lack of interest in his forthcoming candidacy for the council did she not realize how tight a stranglehold his anxiety had gained over him ever since he had sent in his application form even though he had expected to feel this way the pain was not diminished by anticipation any more than being hit by a train would be less devastating for seeing it approaching down the track colin merely suffered twice in the expectation and in its realization his nightmarish new fantasies swirled around the mollisons and the ways in which they were likely to attack him counterarguments explanations and extenuations ran constantly through his mind he saw himself already besieged fighting for his reputation the edge of paranoia always apparent in colins dealings with the world was becoming more pronounced and meanwhile tessa was pretending to be oblivious doing absolutely nothing to help alleviate the dreadful crushing strain he knew that she did not think he ought to be standing perhaps she too was terrified that howard mollison would slit open the bulging gut of their past and spill its ghastly secrets for all the pagford vultures to pick over colin had already made a few telephone calls to those whom barry had counted on for support he had been surprised and heartened that not one of them had challenged his credentials or interrogated him on the issues without exception they had expressed their profound sorrow at the loss of barry and their intense dislike of howard mollison or tha great smug basturd as one of the blunter voters had called him tryin ter crowbar in is son e could ardly stop hisself grinnin when e eard barry was dead colin who had compiled a list of profields talking points had not needed to refer to the paper once so far his main appeal as a candidate seemed to be that he was barrys friend and that he was not called mollison his miniature black and white face was smiling at him out of the computer monitor he had been sitting here all evening trying to compose his election pamphlet for which he had decided to use the same photograph as was featured on the winterdown website full face with a slightly anodyne grin his forehead steep and shiny the image had in its favour the fact that it had already been submitted to the public gaze and had not brought down ridicule or ruin upon him a powerful recommendation but beneath the photograph where the personal information ought to have been were only one or two tentative sentences colin had spent most of the last two hours composing and then deleting words at one point he had managed to complete an entire paragraph only to destroy it backspace by backspace with a nervous jabbing forefinger unable to bear the indecision and solitude he jumped up and went downstairs tessa was lying on the sofa in the sitting room apparently dozing with the television on in the background hows it going she asked sleepily opening her eyes marys just gone by walking up the street with gavin hughes oh said tessa she said something about going over to miles and samanthas earlier gavin must have been there hes probably walking her home colin was appalled mary visiting miles the man who sought to fill her husbands shoes who stood in opposition to all that barry had fought for what on earth was she doing at the mollisons they went with her to the hospital you know that said tessa sitting up with a small groan and stretching her short legs she hasnt spoken to them properly since she wanted to thank them have you finished your pamphlet im nearly there listen with the information i mean as far as the personal information goes past posts do you think or limit it to winterdown i dont think you need say more than where you work now but why dont you ask minda she tessa yawned shes done it herself yes said colin he waited standing over her but she did not offer to help or even to read what he had written so far yes thats a good idea he said more loudly ill get minda to look over it she grunted massaging her ankles and he left the room full of wounded pride his wife could not possibly realize what a state he was in how little sleep he was getting or how his stomach was gnawing itself from within tessa had only pretended to be asleep mary and gavins footsteps had woken her ten minutes previously tessa barely knew gavin he was fifteen years younger than her and colin but the main barrier towards intimacy had always been colins tendency to be jealous of barrys other friendships hes been amazing about the insurance mary had told tessa on the telephone earlier hes on the phone to them every day from what i can gather and he keeps telling me not to worry about fees oh god tessa if they dont pay out gavin will sort it out for you said tessa im sure he will it would have been nice thought tessa stiff and thirsty on the sofa if she and colin could have had mary round to the house to give her a change of scene and make sure she was eating but there was one insuperable barrier mary found colin difficult a strain this uncomfortable and hitherto concealed fact had emerged slowly in the wake of barrys death like flotsam revealed by the ebbing tide it could not have been plainer that mary wanted only tessa she shied away from suggestions that colin might help with anything and avoided talking to him too long on the telephone they had met so often as a foursome for years and marys antipathy had never surfaced barrys good humour must have cloaked it tessa had to manage the new state of affairs with great delicacy she had successfully persuaded colin that mary was happiest in the company of other women the funeral had been her one failure because colin had ambushed mary as they all left st michaels and tried to explain through racking sobs that he was going to stand for barrys seat on the council to carry on barrys work to make sure barry prevailed posthumously tessa had seen marys shocked and offended expression and pulled him away once or twice since colin had stated his intention of going over to show mary all his election materials to ask whether barry would have approved of them even voiced an intention of seeking guidance from mary as to how barry would have handled the process of canvassing for votes in the end tessa had told him firmly that he must not badger mary about the parish council he became huffy at this but it was better tessa thought that he should be angry with her rather than adding to marys distress or provoking her into a rebuff as had happened over the viewing of barrys body the mollisons though said colin reentering the room with a cup of tea he had not offered tessa one he was often selfish in these little ways too busy with his own worries to notice of all the people for her to have dinner with they were against everything barry stood for thats a bit melodramatic col said tessa anyway mary was never as interested in the fields as barry but colins only understanding of love was of limitless loyalty boundless tolerance mary had fallen irreparably in his estimation ix and where are you going asked simon planting himself squarely in the middle of the tiny hall the front door was open and the glass porch behind him full of shoes and coats was blinding in the bright saturday morning sun turning simon into a silhouette his shadow rippled up the stairs just touching the one on which andrew stood into town with fats homework all finished is it yeah it was a lie but simon would not bother to check ruth ruth she appeared at the kitchen door wearing an apron flushed with her hands covered in flour what do we need anything from town what no i dont think so taking my bike are you demanded simon of andrew yeah i was going to leaving it at fats house yeah what time do we want him back simon asked turning to ruth again oh i dont know si said ruth impatiently the furthest she ever went in irritation with her husband was on occasions when simon though basically in a good mood started laying down the law for the fun of it andrew and fats often went into town together on the vague understanding that andrew would return before it became dark five oclock then said simon arbitrarily any later and youre grounded fine andrew replied he kept his right hand in his jacket pocket clenched over a tightly folded wad of paper intensely aware of it like a ticking grenade the fear of losing this piece of paper on which was inscribed a line of meticulously written code and a number of crossedout reworked and heavily edited sentences had been plaguing him for a week he had been keeping it on him at all times and sleeping with it inside his pillowcase simon barely moved aside so that andrew had to edge past him into the porch his fingers clamped over the paper he was terrified that simon would demand that he turn out his pockets ostensibly looking for cigarettes bye then simon did not answer andrew proceeded into the garage where he took out the note unfolded it and read it he knew that he was being irrational that mere proximity to simon could not have magically switched the papers but still he made sure satisfied that all was safe he refolded it tucked it deeper into his pocket which fastened with a stud then wheeled the racing bike out of the garage and down through the gate into the lane he could tell that his father was watching him through the glass door of the porch hoping andrew was sure to see him fall off or mistreat the bicycle in some way pagford lay below andrew slightly hazy in the cool spring sun the air fresh and tangy andrew sensed the point at which simons eyes could no longer follow him it felt as though pressure had been removed from his back down the hill into pagford he streaked not touching the brakes then he turned into church row approximately halfway along the street he slowed down and cycled decorously into the drive of the walls house taking care to avoid cubbys car hello andy said tessa opening the front door to him hi mrs wall andrew accepted the convention that fats parents were laughable tessa was plump and plain her hairstyle was odd and her dress sense embarrassing while cubby was comically uptight yet andrew could not help but suspect that if the walls had been his parents he might have been tempted to like them they were so civilized so courteous you never had the feeling in their house that the floor might suddenly give way and plunge you into chaos fats was sitting on the bottom stair putting on his trainers a packet of loose tobacco was clearly visible peeking out of the breast pocket of his jacket arf fats dyou want to leave your fathers bicycle in the garage andy yeah thanks mrs wall she always he reflected said your father never your dad andrew knew that tessa detested simon it was one of the things that made him pleased to overlook the horrible shapeless clothes she wore and the unflattering bluntcut fringe her antipathy dated from that horrific epochmaking occasion years and years before when a sixyearold fats had come to spend saturday afternoon at hilltop house for the first time balancing precariously on top of a box in the garage trying to retrieve a couple of old badminton racquets the two boys had accidentally knocked down the contents of a rickety shelf andrew remembered the tin of creosote falling smashing onto the roof of the car and bursting open and the terror that had engulfed him and his inability to communicate to his giggling friend what they had brought upon themselves simon had heard the crash he ran out to the garage and advanced on them with his jaw jutting making his low moaning animal noise before starting to roar threats of dire physical punishment his fists clenched inches from their small upturned faces fats had wet himself a stream of urine had spattered down the inside of his shorts onto the garage floor ruth who had heard the yelling from the kitchen had run from the house to intervene no si si no it was an accident fats was white and shaking he wanted to go home straight away he wanted his mum tessa had arrived and fats had run to her in his soaking shorts sobbing it was the only time in his life that andrew had seen his father at a loss backing down somehow tessa had conveyed whitehot fury without raising her voice without threatening without hitting she had written out a cheque and forced it into simons hand while ruth said no no theres no need theres no need simon had followed her to her car trying to laugh it all off but tessa had given him a look of contempt while loading the stillsobbing fats into the passenger seat and slammed the drivers door in simons smiling face andrew had seen his parents expressions tessa was taking away with her down the hill into the town something that usually remained hidden in the house on top of the hill fats courted simon these days whenever he came up to hilltop house he went out of his way to make simon laugh and in return simon welcomed fats visits enjoyed his crudest jokes liked hearing about his antics still when alone with andrew fats concurred wholeheartedly that simon was a grade a carat cunt i reckon shes a lezzer said fats as they walked past the old vicarage dark in the shadow of the scots pine with ivy covering its front your mum asked andrew barely listening lost in his own thoughts what yelped fats and andrew saw that he was genuinely outraged fuck off sukhvinder jawanda oh yeah right andrew laughed and so a beat later did fats the bus into yarvil was crowded andrew and fats had to sit next to each other rather than in two double seats as they preferred as they passed the end of hope street andrew glanced along it but it was deserted he had not run into gaia outside school since the afternoon when they had both secured saturday jobs at the copper kettle the café would open the following weekend he experienced waves of euphoria every time he thought of it sipies election campaign on track is it asked fats busy making rollups one long leg was stuck out at an angle into the aisle of the bus people were stepping over it rather than asking him to move cubbys cacking it already and hes only making his pamphlet yeah hes busy said andrew and he bore without flinching a silent eruption of panic in the pit of his stomach he thought of his parents at the kitchen table as they had been nightly for the past week of a box of stupid pamphlets simon had had printed at work of the list of talking points ruth had helped simon compile which he used as he made telephone calls every evening to every person he knew within the electoral boundary simon did all of it with an air of immense effort he was tightly wound at home displaying heightened aggression towards his sons he might have been shouldering a burden that they had shirked the only topic of conversation at meals was the election with simon and ruth speculating about the forces ranged against simon they took it very personally that other candidates were standing for barry fairbrothers old seat and seemed to assume that colin wall and miles mollison spent most of their time plotting together staring up at hilltop house focused entirely on defeating the man who lived there andrew checked his pocket again for the folded paper he had not told fats what he intended to do he was afraid that fats might broadcast it andrew was not sure how to impress upon his friend the necessity for absolute secrecy how to remind fats that the maniac who had made little boys piss themselves was still alive and well and living in andrews house cubbys not too worried about sipie said fats he thinks the big competition is miles mollison yeah said andrew he had heard his parents discussing it both of them seemed to think that shirley had betrayed them that she ought to have forbidden her son from challenging simon this is a holy fucking crusade for cubby yknow said fats rolling a cigarette between forefinger and thumb hes picking up the regimental flag for his fallen comrade ole barry fairbrother he poked strands of tobacco into the end of the rollup with a match miles mollisons wifes got gigantic tits said fats an elderly woman sitting in front of them turned her head to glare at fats andrew began to laugh again humungous bouncing jubblies fats said loudly into the scowling crumpled face great big juicy doublef mams she turned her red face slowly to face the front of the bus again andrew could barely breathe they got off the bus in the middle of yarvil near the precinct and main pedestrianonly shopping street and wove their way through the shoppers smoking fats rollups andrew had virtually no money left howard mollisons wages would be very welcome the brightorange sign of the internet café seemed to blaze at andrew from a distance beckoning him on he could not concentrate on what fats was saying are you going to he kept asking himself are you going to he did not know his feet kept moving and the sign was growing larger and larger luring him leering at him if i find out youve breathed a word about whats said in this house ill skin you alive but the alternative the humiliation of having simon show what he was to the world the toll it would take on the family when after weeks of anticipation and idiocy he was defeated as he must be then would come rage and spite and a determination to make everybody else pay for his own lunatic decisions only the previous evening ruth had said brightly the boys will go through pagford and post your pamphlets for you andrew had seen in his peripheral vision pauls look of horror and his attempt to make eye contact with his brother i wanna go in here mumbled andrew turning right they bought tickets with codes on them and sat down at different computers two occupied seats apart the middleaged man on andrews right stank of body odour and old fags and kept sniffing andrew logged onto the internet and typed in the name of the website pagford parish council dot co dot uk the homepage bore the council arms in blue and white and a picture of pagford that had been taken from a point close to hilltop house with pargetter abbey silhouetted against the sky the site as andrew already knew from looking at it on a school computer looked dated and amateurish he had not dared go near it on his own laptop his father might be immensely ignorant about the internet but andrew did not rule out the possibility that simon might find somebody at work who could help him investigate once the thing was done even in this bustling anonymous place there was no avoiding the fact that todays date would be on the posting or of pretending that he had not been in yarvil when it happened but simon had never visited an internet café in his life and might not be aware that they existed the rapid contraction of andrews heart was painful swiftly he scrolled down the message board which did not seem to enjoy a lot of traffic there were threads entitled refuse collection a query and school catchment areas in crampton and little manning every tenth entry or so was a posting from the administrator attaching minutes of the last council meeting right at the bottom of the page was a thread entitled death of cllr barry fairbrother this had received views and fortythree responses then on the second page of the message board he found what he hoped to find a post from the dead man a couple of months previously andrews computing set had been supervised by a young supply teacher he had been trying to look cool trying to get the class onside he shouldnt have mentioned sql injections at all and andrew was quite sure that he had not been the only one who went straight home and looked them up he pulled out the piece of paper on which he had written the code he had researched in odd moments at school and brought up the login page on the council website everything hinged on the premise that the site had been set up by an amateur a long time ago that it had never been protected from the simplest of classical hacks carefully using only his index finger he input the magic line of characters he read them through twice making sure that every apostrophe was where it should be hesitated for a second on the brink his breathing shallow then pressed return he gasped as gleeful as a small child and had to fight the urge to shout out or punch the air he had penetrated the tinpot site at his first attempt there on the screen in front of him were barry fairbrothers user details his name his password his entire profile andrew smoothed out the magic paper he had kept under his pillow all week and set to work typing up his next paragraph with its many crossings out and reworkings was a much more laborious process he had been trying for a style that was as impersonal and impenetrable as possible for the dispassionate tone of a broadsheet journalist aspiring parish councillor simon price hopes to stand on a platform of cutting wasteful council spending mr price is certainly no stranger to keeping down costs and should be able to give the council the benefit of his many useful contacts he saves money at home by furnishing it with stolen goods most recently a pc and he is the goto man for any cutprice printing jobs that may need doing for cash once senior management has gone home at the harcourtwalsh printworks andrew read the message through twice he had been over it time and again in his mind there were many accusations he could have levelled at simon but the court did not exist in which andrew could have laid the real charges against his father in which he would have presented as evidence memories of physical terror and ritual humiliation all he had were the many petty infractions of the law of which he had heard simon boast and he had selected these two specific examples the stolen computer and the outofhours printing jobs done on the sly because both were firmly connected to simons workplace people at the printers knew that simon did these things and they could have talked to anybody their friends their families his guts were juddering the way they did when simon truly lost control and laid about anyone within reach seeing his betrayal in black and white on the screen was terrifying what the fuck are you doing asked fats quiet voice in his ear the stinking middleaged man had gone fats had moved up he was reading what andrew had written fucking hell said fats andrews mouth was dry his hand lay quiescent on the mouse howd you get in fats whispered sql injection said andrew its all on the net their securitys shit fats looked exhilarated wildly impressed andrew was half pleased half scared by the reaction youve gotta keep this to lemme do one about cubby no andrews hand on the mouse skidded away from fats reaching fingers this ugly act of filial disloyalty had sprung from the primordial soup of anger frustration and fear that had slopped inside him all his rational life but he knew no better way to convey this to fats than by saying im not just having a laugh he read the message through a third time then added a title to the message he could feel fats excitement beside him as if they were having another porn session andrew was seized by a desire to impress further look he said and he changed barrys username to theghost ofbarryfairbrother fats laughed loudly andrews fingers twitched on the mouse he rolled it sideways whether he would have gone through with it if fats had not been watching he would never know with a single click a new thread appeared at the top of the pagford parish council message board simon price unfit to stand for council outside on the pavement they faced each other breathless with laughter slightly overawed by what had happened then andrew borrowed fats matches set fire to the piece of paper on which he had drafted the message and watched it disintegrate into fragile black flakes which drifted onto the dirty pavement and vanished under passing feet x andrew left yarvil at halfpast three to be sure of getting back to hilltop house before five fats accompanied him to the bus stop and then apparently on a whim told andrew that he thought he would stay in town for a bit after all fats had made a loose arrangement to meet krystal in the shopping centre he strolled back towards the shops thinking about what andrew had done in the internet café and trying to disentangle his own reactions he had to admit that he was impressed in fact he felt somewhat upstaged andrew had thought the business through and kept it to himself and executed it efficiently all of this was admirable fats experienced a twinge of pique that andrew had formulated the plan without saying a word to him and this led fats to wonder whether perhaps he ought not to deplore the undercover nature of andrews attack on his father was there not something slippery and oversophisticated about it would it not have been more authentic to threaten simon to his face or to take a swing at him yes simon was a shit but he was undoubtedly an authentic shit he did what he wanted when he wanted without submitting to societal constraints or conventional morality fats asked himself whether his sympathies ought not to lie with simon whom he liked entertaining with crude crass humour focused mainly on people making tits of themselves or suffering slapstick injuries fats often told himself that he would rather have simon with his volatility his unpredictable picking of fights a worthy opponent an engaged adversary than cubby on the other hand fats had not forgotten the falling tin of creosote simons brutish face and fists the terrifying noise he had made the sensation of hot wet piss running down his own legs and perhaps most shameful of all his wholehearted desperate yearning for tessa to come and take him away to safety fats was not yet so invulnerable that he was unsympathetic to andrews desire for retribution so fats came full circle andrew had done something daring ingenious and potentially explosive in its consequences again fats experienced a small pang of chagrin that it had not been he who had thought of it he was trying to rid himself of his own acquired middleclass reliance on words but it was difficult to forgo a sport at which he excelled and as he trod the polished tiles of the shopping centre forecourt he found himself turning phrases that would blow cubbys selfimportant pretensions apart and strip him naked before a jeering public he spotted krystal among a small crowd of fields kids grouped around the benches in the middle of the thoroughfare between shops nikki leanne and dane tully were among them fats did not hesitate nor appear to gather himself in the slightest but continued to walk at the same speed his hands in his pockets into the battery of curious critical eyes raking him from the top of his head to his trainers all righ fatboy called leanne all right responded fats leanne muttered something to nikki who cackled krystal was chewing gum energetically colour high in her cheeks throwing back her hair so that her earrings danced tugging up her tracksuit bottoms all right fats said to her individually yeah she said duz yer mum know yer out fats asked nikki yeah she brought me said fats calmly into the greedy silence shes waiting outside in the car she says i can have a quick shag before we go home for tea they all burst out laughing except krystal who squealed fuck off you cheeky bastard but looked gratified you smokin rollies grunted dane tully his eyes on fats breast pocket he had a large black scab on his lip yeah said fats me uncle smokes them said dane knackered his fuckin lungs he picked idly at the scab wherere you two goin asked leanne squinting from fats to krystal dunno said krystal chewing her gum glancing sideways at fats he did not enlighten either of them but indicated the exit of the shopping centre with a jerk of his thumb laters krystal said loudly to the rest fats gave them a careless halfraised hand in farewell and walked away krystal striding along beside him he heard more laughter in their wake but did not care he knew that he had acquitted himself well wherere we goin asked krystal dunno said fats where dyou usually go she shrugged walking and chewing they left the shopping centre and walked on down the high street they were some distance from the recreation ground where they had previously gone to find privacy didjer mum really drop yeh krystal asked course she bloody didnt i got the bus in didnt i krystal accepted the rebuke without rancour glancing sideways into the shop windows at their paired reflections stringy and strange fats was a school celebrity even dane thought he was funny hes ony usin yeh yeh stupid bitch ashlee mellor had spat at her three days ago on the corner of foley road because yer a fuckin whore like yer mum ashlee had been a member of krystals gang until the two of them had clashed over another boy ashlee was notoriously not quite right in the head she was prone to outbursts of rage and tears and divided most of her time between learning support and guidance when at winterdown if further proof were needed of her inability to think through consequences she had challenged krystal on her home turf where krystal had backup and she had none nikki jemma and leanne had helped corner and hold ashlee and krystal had pummelled and slapped her everywhere she could reach until her knuckles came away bloody from the other girls mouth krystal was not worried about repercussions soft as shite an twice as runny she said of ashlee and her family but ashlees words had stung a tender infected place in krystals psyche so it had been balm to her when fats had sought her out at school the next day and asked her for the first time to meet him over the weekend she had told nikki and leanne immediately that she was going out with fats wall on saturday and had been gratified by their looks of surprise and to cap it all he had turned up when he had said he would or within half an hour of it right in front of all her mates and walked away with her it was like they were properly going out so whatve you been up to fats asked after they had walked fifty yards in silence back past the internet café he knew a conventional need to keep some form of communication going even while he wondered whether they would find a private place before the rec a halfhours walk away he wanted to screw her while they were both stoned he was curious to know what that was like i bin ter see my nana in hospital this mornin shes ad a stroke said krystal nana cath had not tried to speak this time but krystal thought she had known that she was there as krystal had expected terri was refusing to visit so krystal had sat beside the bed on her own for an hour until it was time to leave for the precinct fats was curious about the minutiae of krystals life but only in so far as she was an entry point to the real life of the fields particulars such as hospital visits were of no interest to him an krystal added with an irrepressible spurt of pride ive gave an interview to the paper what said fats startled why jus about the fields said krystal what its like growin up there the journalist had found her at home at last and when terri had given her grudging permission taken her to a café to talk she had kept asking her whether being at st thomass had helped krystal whether it had changed her life in any way she had seemed a little impatient and frustrated by krystals answers how are your marks at school she had said and krystal had been evasive and defensive mr fairbrother said that he thought it broadened your horizons krystal did not know what to say about horizons when she thought of st thomass it was of her delight in the playing field with the big chestnut tree which rained enormous glossy conkers on them every year she had never seen conkers before she went to st thomass she had liked the uniform at first liked looking the same as everybody else she had been excited to see her greatgrandfathers name on the war memorial in the middle of the square pte samuel weedon only one other boy had his surname on the war memorial and that was a farmers son who had been able to drive a tractor at nine and who had once brought a lamb into class for show and tell krystal had never forgotten the sensation of the lambs fleece under her hand when she told nana cath about it nana cath had said that their family had been farm labourers once krystal had loved the river green and lush where they had gone for nature walks best of all had been rounders and athletics she was always first to be picked for any kind of sporting team and she had delighted in the groan that went up from the other team whenever she was chosen and she thought sometimes of the special teachers she had been given especially miss jameson who had been young and trendy with long blonde hair krystal had always imagined annemarie to be a little bit like miss jameson then there were snippets of information that krystal had retained in vivid accurate detail volcanoes they were made by plates shifting in the ground they had made model ones and filled them with bicarbonate of soda and washingup liquid and they had erupted onto plastic trays krystal had loved that she knew about vikings too they had longships and horned helmets though she had forgotten when they arrived in britain or why but other memories of st thomass included the muttered comments made about her by little girls in her class one or two of whom she had slapped when social services had allowed her to go back to her mother her uniform became so tight short and grubby that letters were sent from school and nana cath and terri had a big row the other girls at school had not wanted her in their groups except for their rounders teams she could still remember lexie mollison handing everyone in the class a little pink envelope containing a party invitation and walking past krystal with as krystal remembered it her nose in the air only a couple of people had asked her to parties she wondered whether fats or his mother remembered that she had once attended a birthday party at their house the whole class had been invited and nana cath had bought krystal a party dress so she knew that fats huge back garden had a pond and a swing and an apple tree they had eaten jelly and had sack races tessa had told krystal off because trying desperately hard to win a plastic medal she had pushed other children out of the way one of them had had a nosebleed you enjoyed st thomass though did you the journalist had asked yeah said krystal but she knew that she had not conveyed what mr fairbrother had wanted her to convey and wished he could have been there with her to help yeah i enjoyed it how come they wanted to talk to you about the fields asked fats it were mr fairbrothers idea said krystal after another few minutes fats asked dyou smoke wha like spliffs yeah i dunnit with dane ive got some on me said fats get it off skye kirby didja asked krystal he wondered whether he imagined a trace of amusement in her voice because skye was the soft safe option the place the middleclass kids went if so fats liked her authentic derision where dyou get yours then he asked interested now i dunno it were danes she said from obbo suggested fats tha fuckin tosser whats wrong with him but krystal had no words for what was wrong with obbo and even if she had she would not have wanted to talk about him obbo made her flesh crawl sometimes he came round and shot up with terri at other times he fucked her and krystal would meet him on the stairs tugging up his filthy fly smiling at her through his bottlebottom glasses often obbo had little jobs to offer terri like hiding the computers or giving strangers a place to stay for a night or agreeing to perform services of which krystal did not know the nature but which took her mother out of the house for hours krystal had had a nightmare not long ago in which her mother had become stretched spread and tied on a kind of frame she was mostly a vast gaping hole like a giant raw plucked chicken and in the dream obbo was walking in and out of this cavernous interior and fiddling with things in there while terris tiny head was frightened and grim krystal had woken up feeling sick and angry and disgusted es a fucker said krystal is he a tall bloke with a shaved head and tattoos all up the back of his neck asked fats who had truanted for a second time that week and sat on a wall for an hour in the fields watching the bald man had interested him fiddling around in the back of an old white van nah thas pikey pritchard said krystal if yeh saw him down tarpen road what does he do i dunno said krystal ask dane es mates with pikeys brother but she liked his genuine interest he had never shown this much inclination to talk to her before pikeys on probation what for he glassed a bloke down the cross keys why ow the fuck do i know i werent there said krystal she was happy which always made her cocky setting aside her worry about nana cath who was after all still alive so might yet recover it had been a good couple of weeks terri was adhering to the bellchapel regime again and krystal was making sure that robbie went to nursery his bottom had mostly healed over the social worker seemed as pleased as her sort ever did krystal had been to school every day too though she had not attended either her monday or her wednesday morning guidance sessions with tessa she did not know why sometimes you got out of the habit she glanced sideways at fats again she had never once thought of fancying him not until he had targeted her at the disco in the drama hall everyone knew fats some of his jokes were passed around like funny stuff that happened on the telly krystal pretended to everyone that they had a television at home she watched enough at friends houses and at nana caths to be able to bluff her way through yeah it were shit werent it i know i nearly pissed meself she would say when the others talked about programmes they had seen fats was imagining how it would feel to be glassed how the jagged shard would slice through the tender flesh on his face he could feel the searing nerves and the sting of the air against his ripped skin the warm wetness as blood gushed he felt a tickly oversensitivity in the skin around his mouth as if it was already scarred is he still carrying a blade dane he asked ow dyou know es gotta blade demanded krystal he threatened kevin cooper with it oh yeah krystal conceded coopers a twat innee yeah he is said fats danes ony carryin cos o the riordon brothers said krystal fats liked the matteroffactness of krystals tone her acceptance of the need for a knife because there was a grudge and a likelihood of violence this was the raw reality of life these were things that actually mattered before arf had arrived at the house that day cubby had been importuning tessa to give him an opinion on whether his campaign leaflet should be printed on yellow or white paper what about in there suggested fats after a while to their right was a long stone wall its gates open to reveal a glimpse of green and stone yeah all righ said krystal she had been in the cemetery once before with nikki and leanne they had sat on a grave and split a couple of cans a little selfconscious about what they were doing until a woman had shouted at them and called them names leanne had lobbed an empty can back at the woman as they left but it was too exposed fats thought as he and krystal walked up the broad concreted walkway between the graves green and flat the headstones offering virtually no cover then he saw barberry hedges along the wall on the far side he cut a path right across the cemetery and krystal followed hands in her pockets as they picked their way between rectangular gravel beds headstones cracked and illegible it was a large cemetery wide and well tended gradually they reached the newer graves of highly polished black marble with gold lettering places where fresh flowers had been laid for the recently dead to lyndsey kyle september march sleep tight mum yeah well be all right in there said fats eyeing the dark gap between the prickly yellowflowered bushes and the cemetery wall they crawled into the damp shadows onto the earth their backs against the cold wall the headstones marched away from them between the bushes trunks but there were no human forms among them fats skinned up expertly hoping that krystal was watching and was impressed but she was gazing out under the canopy of glossy dark leaves thinking about annemarie who aunt cheryl had told her had come to visit nana cath on thursday if only she had skipped school and gone at the same time they could have met at last she had fantasized many times about how she would meet annemarie and say to her im yer sister annemarie in these fantasies was always delighted and they saw each other all the time after that and eventually annemarie suggested that krystal move in the imaginary annemarie had a house like nana caths neat and clean except that it was much more modern lately in her fantasies krystal had added a sweet little pink baby in a frilly crib there you go said fats handing krystal the joint she inhaled held the smoke in her lungs for a few seconds and her expression softened into dreaminess as the cannabis worked its magic you ain got brothers an sisters she asked ave yeh no said fats checking his pocket for the condoms he had brought krystal handed back the joint her head swimming pleasantly fats took an enormous drag and blew smoke rings im adopted he said after a while krystal goggled at fats are yeh adopted are yeh with the senses a little muffled and cushioned confidences peeled easily away everything became easy my sister wuz adopted said krystal marvelling at the coincidence delighted to talk about annemarie yeah i probably come from a family like yours said fats but krystal was not listening she wanted to talk i gottan older sister an an older brother liam but they wuz taken away before i wuz born why asked fats he was suddenly paying close attention me mum was with ritchie adams then said krystal she took a deep drag on the joint and blew out the smoke in a long thin jet hes a proper psycho hes doin life he killed a bloke proper violent to mum an the kids an then john an sue came an took em and the social got involved an it ended up john an sue kept em she drew on the joint again considering this period of her prelife which was doused in blood fury and darkness she had heard things about ritchie adams mainly from her aunt cheryl he had stubbed out cigarettes on oneyearold annemaries arms and kicked her until her ribs cracked he had broken terris face her left cheekbone was still receded compared to the right terris addiction had spiralled catastrophically aunt cheryl was matter of fact about the decision to remove the two brutalized neglected children from their parents it ad to appen said cheryl john and sue were distant childless relatives krystal had never known where or how they fitted in her complex family tree or how they had effected what to hear terri tell it sounded like kidnap after much wrangling with the authorities they had been allowed to adopt the children terri who had remained with ritchie until his arrest never saw annemarie or liam for reasons krystal did not entirely understand the whole story was clotted and festering with hatred and unforgivable things said and threatened restraining orders lots more social workers whos your dad then asked fats banger said krystal she struggled to recall his real name barry she muttered though she had a suspicion that was not right barry coates ony i uses me mums name weedon the memory of the dead young man who had overdosed in terris bathroom floated back to her through the sweet heavy smoke she passed the joint back to fats and leaned her head against the stone wall looking up at the sliver of sky mottled with dark leaves fats was thinking about ritchie adams who had killed a man and considering the possibility that his own biological father was in prison somewhere too tattooed like pikey spare and muscled he mentally compared cubby with this strong hard authentic man fats knew that he had been parted from his biological mother as a very small baby because there were pictures of tessa holding him frail and birdlike with a woolly white cap on his head he had been premature tessa had told him a few things though he had never asked his real mother had been very young when she had him he knew that perhaps she had been like krystal the school bike he was properly stoned now he put his hand behind krystals neck and pulled her towards him kissing her sticking his tongue into her mouth with his other hand he groped for her breast his brain was fuzzy and his limbs were heavy even his sense of touch seemed affected he fumbled a little to get his hand inside her tshirt to force it under her bra her mouth was hot and tasted of tobacco and dope her lips were dry and chapped his excitement was slightly blunted he seemed to be receiving all sensory information through an invisible blanket it took longer than the last time to prise her clothes loose from her body and the condom was difficult because his fingers had become stiff and slow then he accidentally placed his elbow with all his weight behind it on her soft fleshy underarm and she shrieked in pain she was drier than before he forced his way inside her determined to accomplish what he had come for time was gluelike and slow but he could hear his own rapid breathing and it made him edgy because he imagined someone else crouching in the dark space with them watching panting in his ear krystal moaned a little with her head thrown back her nose became broad and snoutlike he pushed up her tshirt to look at the smooth white breasts jiggling a little beneath the loose constraint of the undone bra he came without expecting it and his own grunt of satisfaction seemed to belong to the crouching eavesdropper he rolled off her peeled off the condom and threw it aside then zipped himself up feeling jittery looking around to check that they were definitely alone krystal was dragging her pants up with one hand pulling down her tshirt with the other reaching behind herself to do up her bra it had become cloudy and darker while they had sat behind the bushes there was a distant buzzing in fats ears he was very hungry his brain was working slowly while his ears were hypersensitive the fear that they had been watched perhaps over the top of the wall behind them would not leave him he wanted to go lets he muttered and without waiting for her he crawled out between the bushes and got to his feet brushing himself down there was an elderly couple a hundred yards away crouching at a graveside he wanted to get right away from phantom eyes that might or might not have watched him screw krystal weedon but at the same time the process of finding the right bus stop and getting on the bus to pagford seemed almost unbearably onerous he wished he could simply be transported this instant to his attic bedroom krystal had staggered out behind him she was pulling down the bottom of her tshirt and staring down at the grassy ground at her feet fuck she mumbled what said fats cmon lets go s mr fairbrother she said without moving what she pointed at the mound in front of them there was no headstone yet but fresh flowers lay all along it see she said crouching over and indicating cards stapled to the cellophane tha sez fairbrother she recognized the name easily from all those letters that had gone home from school asking her mother to give permission for her to go away on the minibus ter barry she read carefully an this sez ter dad she sounded out the words slowly from but niamh and siobhans names defeated her so demanded fats but in truth the news gave him the creeps that wickerwork coffin lay feet below them and inside it the short body and cheery face of cubbys dearest friend so often seen in their house rotting away in the earth the ghost of barry fairbrother he was unnerved it seemed like some kind of retribution cmon he said but krystal did not move whats the matter i rowed for im din i snapped krystal oh yeah fats was fidgeting like a restive horse edging backwards krystal stared down at the mound hugging herself she felt empty sad and dirty she wished they had not done it there so close to mr fairbrother she was cold unlike fats she had no jacket cmon said fats again she followed him out of the cemetery and they did not speak to each other once krystal was thinking about mr fairbrother he had always called her krys which nobody else had ever done she had liked being krys he had been a good laugh she wanted to cry fats was thinking about how he would be able to work this into a funny story for andrew about being stoned and fucking krystal and getting paranoid and thinking they were being watched and crawling out almost onto old barry fairbrothers grave but it did not feel funny yet not yet part three duplicity a resolution should not deal with more than one subject disregard of this rule usually leads to confused discussion and may lead to confused action charles arnoldbaker local council administration seventh edition i ran out of here screaming blue murder calling her a paki bitch and now the papers called for a comment because shes parminder heard the receptionists voice barely louder than a whisper as she passed the door of the staff meeting room which was ajar one swift light step and parminder had pulled it open to reveal one of the receptionists and the practice nurse in close proximity both jumped and spun round doct jawan you understand the confidentiality agreement you signed when you took this job dont you karen the receptionist looked aghast yeah i i wasnt laura already i was coming to give you this note the yarvil and district gazettes rang mrs weedons died and one of her granddaughters is saying and are those for me asked parminder coldly pointing at the patient records in karens hand oh yeah said karen flustered he wanted to see dr crawford but youd better get back to the front desk parminder took the patient records and strode back out to reception fuming once there and facing the patients she realized that she did not know whom to call and glanced down at the folder in her hand mr mr mollison howard heaved himself up smiling and walked towards her with his familiar rocking gait dislike rose like bile in parminders throat she turned and walked back to her surgery howard following her all well with parminder he asked as he closed her door and settled himself without invitation on the patients chair it was his habitual greeting but today it felt like a taunt whats the problem she asked brusquely bit of an irritation he said just here need a cream or something he tugged his shirt out of his trousers and lifted it a few inches parminder saw an angry red patch of skin at the edge of the fold where his stomach spilt out over his upper legs youll need to take your shirt off she said its only here thats itching i need to see the whole area he sighed and got to his feet as he unbuttoned his shirt he said did you get the agenda i sent through this morning no i havent checked emails today this was a lie parminder had read his agenda and was furious about it but this was not the moment to tell him so she resented his trying to bring council business into her surgery his way of reminding her that there was a place where she was his subordinate even if here in this room she could order him to strip could you please i need to look under he hoisted the great apron of flesh upwards the upper legs of his trousers were revealed and finally the waistband with his arms full of his own fat he smiled down at her she drew her chair nearer her head level with his belt an ugly scaly rash had spread in the hidden crease of howards belly a bright scalded red it stretched from one side to the other of his torso like a huge smeared smile a whiff of rotting meat reached her nostrils intertrigo she said and lichen simplex there where youve scratched all right you can put your shirt back on he dropped his belly and reached for his shirt unfazed youll see ive put the bellchapel building on the agenda its generating a bit of press interest at the moment she was tapping something into the computer and did not reply yarvil and district gazette howard said im doing them an article both sides he said buttoning up his shirt of the question she was trying not to listen to him but the sound of the newspapers name caused the knot in her stomach to tighten when did you last have your blood pressure done howard im not seeing a test in the last six months itll be fine im on medication for it we should check though as youre here he sighed again and laboriously rolled up his sleeve theyll be printing barrys article before mine he said you know he sent them an article about the fields yes she said against her own better judgement havent got a copy have you so i dont duplicate anything hes said her fingers trembled a little on the cuff it would not meet around howards arm she unfastened it and got up to fetch a bigger one no she said her back to him i never saw it he watched her work the pump and observed the pressure dial with the indulgent smile of a man observing some pagan ritual too high she told him as the needle registered one hundred and seventy over a hundred im on pills for it he said scratching where the cuff had been and letting down his sleeve dr crawford seems happy she scanned the list of his medications onscreen youre on amlodipine and bendroflumethiazide for your blood pressure yes and simvastatin for your heart no betablocker because of my asthma said howard tweaking his sleeve straight right and aspirin she turned to face him howard your weight is the single biggest factor in all of your health problems have you ever been referred to the nutritionist ive run a deli for thirtyfive years he said still smiling i dont need teaching about food a few lifestyle changes could make a big difference if you were able to lose with the ghost of a wink he said comfortably keep it simple all i need is cream for the itch venting her temper on the keyboard parminder banged out prescriptions for antifungal and steroid creams and when they were printed handed them to howard without another word thank you kindly he said as he heaved himself out of the chair and a very good day to you ii wha dyou wan terri weedons shrunken body was dwarfed by her own doorway she put clawlike hands on either jamb trying to make herself more imposing barring the entrance it was eight in the morning krystal had just left with robbie wanna talk ter yeh said her sister broad and mannish in her white vest and tracksuit bottoms cheryl sucked on a cigarette and squinted at terri through the smoke nana caths died she said wha nana caths died repeated cheryl loudly like you fuckin care but terri had heard the first time the news had hit her so hard in the guts that she had asked to hear it again out of confusion are you blasted demanded cheryl glaring into the taut and empty face fuck off no i aint it was the truth terri had not used that morning she had not used for three weeks she took no pride in it there was no star chart pinned up in the kitchen she had managed longer than this before months even obbo had been away for the past fortnight so it had been easier but her works were still in the old biscuit tin and the craving burned like an eternal flame inside her frail body she died yesterday danielle ony fuckin bothered to lemme know this mornin said cheryl an i were gonna go up the ospital an see er again today danielles after the ouse nana caths ouse greedy bitch terri had not been inside the little terraced house on hope street for a long time but when cheryl spoke she saw very vividly the knickknacks on the sideboard and the net curtains she imagined danielle there pocketing things ferreting in cupboards funerals tuesday at nine up the crematorium right said terri its our ouse as much as danielles said cheryl ill tell er we wan our share shall i yeah said terri she watched until cheryls canary hair and tattoos had vanished around the corner then retreated inside nana cath dead they had not spoken for a long time im washin my ands of yeh ive ad enough terri ive ad it she had never stopped seeing krystal though krystal had become her blueeyed girl she had been to watch krystal row in her stupid boat races she had said krystals name on her deathbed not terris fine then you old bitch like i care too late now tightchested and trembling terri moved through her stinking kitchen in search of cigarettes but really craving the spoon the flame and the needle too late now to say to the old lady what she ought to have said too late now to become again her terribaby big girls dont cry big girls dont cry it had been years before she had realized that the song nana cath had sung her in her rasping smokers voice was really sherry baby terris hands scuttled like vermin through the debris on the work tops searching for fag packets ripping them apart finding them all empty krystal had probably had the last of them she was a greedy little cow just like danielle riffling through nana caths possessions trying to keep her death quiet from the rest of them there was a long stub lying on a greasy plate terri wiped it off on her tshirt and lit it on the gas cooker inside her head she heard her own elevenyearold voice i wish you was my mummy she did not want to remember she leaned up against the sink smoking trying to look forward to imagine the clash that was coming between her two older sisters nobody messed with cheryl and shane they were both handy with their fists and shane had put burning rags through some poor bastards letter box not so long ago it was why hed done his last stretch and he would still be inside if the house had not been empty at the time but danielle had weapons cheryl did not money and her own home and a landline she knew official people and how to talk to them she was the kind that had spare keys and mysterious bits of paperwork yet terri doubted that danielle would get the house even with her secret weapons there were more than just the three of them nana cath had had loads of grandchildren and greatgrandchildren after terri had been taken into care her father had had more kids nine in total cheryl reckoned to five different mothers terri had never met her halfsiblings but krystal had told her that nana cath saw them yeah she had retorted i hope they rob her blind the stupid old bitch so she saw the rest of the family but they werent exactly angels from all that terri had heard it was only she who had once been terribaby whom nana cath had cut adrift for ever when you were straight evil thoughts and memories came pouring up out of the darkness inside you buzzing black flies clinging to the insides of your skull i wish you was my mummy in the vest top that terri was wearing today her scarred arm neck and upper back were fully exposed swirled into unnatural folds and creases like melted ice cream she had spent six weeks in the burns unit of south west general when she was eleven how did it happen love asked the mother of the child in the next bed her father had thrown a pan of burning chip fat at her her human league tshirt had caught fire naccident terri muttered it was what she had told everyone including the social worker and the nurses she would no sooner have shopped her father than chosen to burn alive her mother had walked out shortly after terris eleventh birthday leaving all three daughters behind danielle and cheryl had moved in with their boyfriends families within days terri had been the only one left trying to make chips for her father clinging to the hope that her mother would come back even through the agony and the terror of those first days and nights in the hospital she had been glad it had happened because she was sure that her mum would hear about it and come and get her every time there was movement at the end of the ward terris heart would leap but in six long weeks of pain and loneliness the only visitor had been nana cath through quiet afternoons and evenings nana cath had come to sit beside her granddaughter reminding her to say thank you to the nurses grimfaced and strict yet leaking unexpected tenderness she brought terri a cheap plastic doll in a shiny black mac but when terri undressed her she had nothing on underneath shes got no knickers nana and nana cath had giggled nana cath never giggled i wish you was my mummy she had wanted nana cath to take her home she had asked her to and nana cath had agreed sometimes terri thought that those weeks in hospital had been the happiest of her life even with the pain it had been so safe and people had been kind to her and looked after her she had thought that she was going home with nana cath to the house with the pretty net curtains and not back to her father not back to the bedroom door flying open in the night banging off the david essex poster cheryl had left behind and her father with his hand on his fly approaching the bed where she begged him not to the adult terri threw the smoking filter of the cigarette stub down onto the kitchen floor and strode to her front door she needed more than nicotine down the path and along the street she marched walking in the same direction as cheryl out of the corner of her eye she saw them two of her neighbours chatting on the pavement watching her go by like a fucking picture itll last longer terri knew that she was a perennial subject of gossip she knew what they said about her they shouted it after her sometimes the stuckup bitch next door was forever whining to the council about the state of terris garden fuck them fuck them fuck them she was jogging along trying to outrun the memories you dont even know who the father is do yeh yer whore im washin my ands of yeh terri ive ad enough that had been the last time they had ever spoken and nana cath had called her what everyone else called her and terri had responded in kind fuck you then you miserable old cow fuck you she had never said you let me down nana cath she had never said why didnt you keep me she had never said i loved you more than anyone nana cath she hoped to god obbo was back he was supposed to be back today today or tomorrow she had to have some she had to all righ terri seen obbo she asked the boy who was smoking and drinking on the wall outside the off licence the scars on her back felt as though they were burning again he shook his head chewing leering at her she hurried on nagging thoughts of the social worker of krystal of robbie more buzzing flies but they were like the staring neighbours judges all they did not understand the terrible urgency of her need nana cath had collected her from the hospital and taken her home to the spare room it had been the cleanest prettiest room terri had ever slept in on each of the three evenings she had spent there she had sat up in bed after nana cath had kissed her goodnight and rearranged the ornaments beside her on the windowsill there had been a tinkling bunch of glass flowers in a glass vase a plastic pink paperweight with a shell in it and terris favourite a rearing pottery horse with a silly smile on its face i like horses she had told nana cath there had been a school trip to the agricultural show in the days before terris mother had left the class had met a gigantic black shire covered in horse brasses she was the only one brave enough to stroke it the smell had intoxicated her she had hugged its column of a leg ending in the massive feathered white hoof and felt the living flesh beneath the hair while her teacher said careful terri careful and the old man with the horse had smiled at her and told her it was quite safe samson wouldnt hurt a nice little girl like her the pottery horse was a different colour yellow with a black mane and tail you can ave it nana cath told her and terri had known true ecstasy but on the fourth morning her father had arrived youre comin home he had said and the look on his face had terrified her youre not stayin with that fuckin grassin old cow no you aint no you aint you little bitch nana cath was as frightened as terri mikey no she kept bleating some of the neighbours were peering through the windows nana cath had terri by one arm and her father had the other youre coming home with me he blacked nana caths eye he dragged terri into his car when he got her back to the house he beat and kicked every bit of her he could reach seen obbo terri shouted at obbos neighbour from fifty yards away is e back i dunno said the woman turning away when michael was not beating terri he was doing the other things to her the things she could not talk about nana cath did not come any more terri ran away at thirteen but not to nana caths she did not want her father to find her they caught her anyway and put her into care terri thumped on obbos door and waited she tried again but nobody came she sank onto the doorstep shaking and began to cry two truanting winterdown girls glanced at her as they passed thas krystal weedons mum one of them said loudly the prozzie the other replied at the top of her voice terri could not muster the strength to swear at them because she was crying so hard snorting and giggling the girls strode out of sight whore one of them called back from the end of the street iii gavin could have invited mary into his office to discuss the most recent exchange of letters with the insurance company but decided to visit her at home instead he had kept the late afternoon free of appointments on the offchance that she might ask him to stay for something to eat she was a fantastic cook his instinctive shying away from her naked grief had been dissipated by regular contact he had always liked mary but barry had eclipsed her in company not that she ever appeared to dislike her supporting role on the contrary she had seemed delighted to beautify the background happy laughing at barrys jokes happy simply to be with him gavin doubted that kay had ever been happy to play second fiddle in her life crashing the gears as he drove up church row he thought that kay would have been outraged by any suggestion that she modify her behaviour or suppress her opinions for the sake of her partners enjoyment his happiness or his selfesteem he did not think that he had ever been unhappier in a relationship than he was now even in the death throes of the affair with lisa there had been temporary truces laughs sudden poignant reminders of better times the situation with kay was like war sometimes he forgot that there was supposed to be any affection between them did she even like him they had had their worst ever argument by telephone on the morning after miles and samanthas dinner party eventually kay had slammed down the receiver cutting gavin off for a full twentyfour hours he had believed that their relationship was at an end and although this was what he wanted he had experienced more fear than relief in his fantasies kay simply disappeared back to london but the reality was that she had tethered herself to pagford with a job and a daughter at winterdown he faced the prospect of bumping into her wherever he went in the tiny town perhaps she was already poisoning the well of gossip against him he imagined her repeating some of the things she had said to him on the telephone to samantha or to that nosy old woman in the delicatessen who gave him gooseflesh i uprooted my daughter and left my job and moved house for you and you treat me like a hooker you dont have to pay people would say that he had behaved badly perhaps he had behaved badly there must have been a crucial point when he ought to have pulled back but he had not seen it gavin spent the whole weekend brooding on how it would feel to be seen as the bad guy he had never been in that position before after lisa had left him everybody had been kind and sympathetic especially the fairbrothers guilt and dread dogged him until on sunday evening he cracked and called kay to apologize now he was back where he did not want to be and he hated kay for it parking his car in the fairbrothers drive as he had done so often when barry was alive he headed for the front door noticing that somebody had mowed the lawn since he had last called mary answered his ring on the doorbell almost instantaneously hi how mary whats wrong her whole face was wet her eyes brimming with diamondbright tears she gulped once or twice shook her head and then without quite knowing how it had happened gavin found himself holding her in his arms on the doorstep mary has something happened he felt her nod acutely aware of their exposed position of the open road behind him gavin manoeuvred her inside she was small and fragile in his arms her fingers clutched at him her face pressed into his coat he relinquished his briefcase as gently as he could but the sound of it hitting the floor made her withdraw from him her breath short as she covered her mouth with her hands im sorry im sorry oh god gav whats happened his voice sounded different from usual forceful take command more like the way miles sometimes talked in a crisis at work someones put i dont someones put barrys she beckoned him into the home office cluttered shabby and cosy with barrys old rowing trophies on the shelves and a big framed photograph on the wall of eight teenage girls punching the air with medals around their necks mary pointed a trembling finger at the computer screen still in his coat gavin dropped into the chair and stared at the message board of pagford parish councils website i wwas in the delicatessen this morning and maureen lowe told me that lots of people had put messages of condolence on the site so i was going to ppost a message to ssay thank you and look he spotted it as she spoke simon price unfit to stand for council posted by the ghost of barry fairbrother jesus christ said gavin in disgust mary dissolved into tears again gavin wanted to put his arms back around her but was afraid to especially here in this snug little room so full of barry he compromised by taking hold of her thin wrist and leading her through the hall into the kitchen you need a drink he told her in that unfamiliarly strong and commanding voice sod coffee wheres the proper stuff but he remembered before she answered he had seen barry take the bottles out of the cupboard often enough so he mixed her a small gin and tonic which was the only thing he had ever known her drink before dinner gav its four in the afternoon who gives a damn said gavin in his new voice get that down you an unbalanced laugh broke her sobs she accepted the glass and sipped he fetched her kitchen roll to mop her face and eyes youre so kind gav dont you want anything coffee or or beer she asked on another weak laugh he fetched himself a bottle from the fridge took off his coat and sat down opposite her at the island in the middle of the room after a while when she had drunk most of her gin she became calm and quiet again the way he always thought of her who dyou think did it she asked him some total bastard said gavin theyre all fighting over his council seat now squabbling away over the fields as usual and hes still in there putting his two cents in the ghost of barry fairbrother maybe it really is him posting on the message board gavin did not know whether this was meant as a joke and settled for a slight smile that might be quickly removed you know id love to think that hes worrying about us wherever he is about me and the kids but i doubt it ill bet hes still most worried about krystal weedon do you know what hed probably say to me if he was here she drained her glass gavin had not thought that he had mixed the gin very strong but there were patches of high colour on her cheeks no he said cautiously hed tell me that ive got support said mary and to gavins astonishment he heard anger in the voice he always thought of as gentle yeah hed probably say youve got all the family and our friends and the kids to comfort you but krystal marys voice was becoming louder krystals got nobody to look out for her dyou know what he spent our wedding anniversary doing no said gavin again writing an article for the local paper about krystal krystal and the fields the bloody fields if i never hear them mentioned again itll be too soon i want another gin i dont drink enough gavin picked up her glass automatically and returned to the drinks cupboard stunned he had always regarded her and barrys marriage as literally perfect never had it occurred to him that mary might be other than one hundred per cent approving of every venture and crusade with which the everbusy barry concerned himself rowing practice in the evenings driving them to races at the weekends she said over the tinkling of ice he was adding to her glass and most nights he was on the computer trying to get people to support him about the fields and getting stuff on the agenda for council meetings and everyone always said isnt barry marvellous the way he does it all the way he volunteers hes so involved with the community she took a big gulp of her fresh gin and tonic yes marvellous absolutely marvellous until it killed him all day long on our wedding anniversary struggling to meet that stupid deadline they havent even printed it yet gavin could not take his eyes off her anger and alcohol had restored colour to her face she was sitting upright instead of cowed and hunched over as she had been recently thats what killed him she said clearly and her voice echoed a little in the kitchen he gave everything to everybody except to me ever since barrys funeral gavin had dwelled with a sense of deep inadequacy on the comparatively small gap that he was sure he would leave behind in his community should he die looking at mary he wondered whether it would not be better to leave a huge hole in one persons heart had barry not realized how mary felt had he not realized how lucky he was the front door opened with a loud clatter and he heard the sound of the four children coming in voices and footsteps and the thumping of shoes and bags hi gav said eighteenyearold fergus kissing his mother on top of her head are you drinking mum its my fault said gavin blame me they were such nice kids the fairbrother kids gavin liked the way they talked to their mother hugged her chatted to each other and to him they were open polite and funny he thought of gaia her vicious asides silences like jagged glass the snarling way she addressed him gav we havent even talked about the insurance said mary as the children surged around the kitchen finding themselves drinks and snacks it doesnt matter said gavin without thinking before correcting himself hastily shall we go through to the sitting room or yes lets she wobbled a little getting down from the high kitchen stool and he caught her arm again are you staying for dinner gav called fergus do if you want to said mary a surge of warmth flooded him id love to he said thanks iv very sad said howard mollison rocking a little on his toes in front of his mantelpiece very sad indeed maureen had just finished telling them all about catherine weedons death she had heard everything from her friend karen the receptionist that evening including the complaint from cath weedons granddaughter a look of delighted disapproval was crumpling her face samantha who was in a very bad mood thought she resembled a monkey nut miles was making conventional sounds of surprise and pity but shirley was staring up at the ceiling with a bland expression on her face she hated it when maureen held centre stage with news that she ought to have heard first my mother knew the family of old howard told samantha who already knew it neighbours in hope street cath was decent enough in her way you know the house was always spotless and she worked until she was into her sixties oh yes she was one of the worlds grafters cath weedon whatever the rest of the family became howard was enjoying giving credit where credit was due the husband lost his job when they closed the steelworks hard drinker no she didnt always have it easy cath samantha was barely managing to look interested but fortunately maureen interrupted and the gazettes on to dr jawanda she croaked imagine how she must be feeling now the papers got it familys kicking up a stink well you cant blame them alone in that house for three days dyou know her howard which one is danielle fowler shirley got up and stalked out of the room in her apron samantha slugged a little more wine smiling lets think lets think said howard he prided himself on knowing almost everyone in pagford but the later generations of weedons belonged more to yarvil cant be a daughter she had four boys cath granddaughter i expect and she wants an inquiry said maureen well it was always going to come to this its been on the cards if anything im surprised its taken this long dr jawanda wouldnt give the hubbards son antibiotics and he ended up hospitalized for his asthma do you know did she train in india or shirley who was listening from the kitchen while she stirred the gravy felt irritated as she always did by maureens monopolization of the conversation that at least was how shirley put it to herself determined not to return to the room until maureen had finished shirley turned into the study and checked to see whether anyone had sent in apologies for the next parish council meeting as secretary she was already putting together the agenda howard miles come and look at this shirleys voice had lost its usual soft flutey quality it rang out shrilly howard waddled out of the sitting room followed by miles who was still in the suit he had worn all day at work maureens droopy bloodshot heavily mascaraed eyes were fixed on the empty doorway like a bloodhounds her hunger to know what shirley had found or seen was almost palpable maureens fingers a clutch of bulging knuckles covered in translucent leopardspotted skin slid the crucifix and wedding ring up and down the chain around her neck the deep creases running from the corners of maureens mouth to her chin always reminded samantha of a ventriloquists dummy why are you always here samantha asked the older woman loudly inside her own head you couldnt make me lonely enough to live in howard and shirleys pocket disgust rose in samantha like vomit she wanted to seize the overwarm cluttered room and mash it between her hands until the royal china and the gas fire and the giltframed pictures of miles broke into jagged pieces then with wizened and painted maureen trapped and squalling inside the wreckage she wanted to heave it like a celestial shotputter away into the sunset the crushed lounge and the doomed crone inside it soared in her imagination through the heavens plunging into the limitless ocean leaving samantha alone in the endless stillness of the universe she had had a terrible afternoon there had been another frightening conversation with her accountant she could not remember much of her drive home from yarvil she would have liked to offload on miles but after dumping his briefcase and pulling off his tie in the hall he had said you havent started dinner yet have you he sniffed the air ostentatiously then answered himself no you havent well good because mum and dad have invited us over and before she could protest he had added sharply its nothing to do with the council its to discuss arrangements for dads sixtyfifth anger was almost a relief it eclipsed her anxiety her fear she had followed miles out to the car cradling her sense of illusage when he asked at last on the corner of evertree crescent how was your day she answered absolutely bloody fantastic wonder whats up said maureen breaking the silence in the sitting room samantha shrugged it was typical of shirley to have summoned her menfolk and left the women in limbo samantha was not going to give her motherinlaw the satisfaction of showing interest howards elephantine footsteps made the floorboards under the hall carpet creak maureens mouth was slack with anticipation well well well boomed howard lumbering back into the room i was checking the council website for apologies said shirley a little breathless in his wake for the next meeting someones posted accusations about simon price miles told samantha pressing past his parents seizing the role of announcer what kind of accusations asked samantha receiving stolen goods said howard firmly reclaiming the spotlight and diddling his bosses at the printworks samantha was pleased to find herself unmoved she had only the haziest idea who simon price was theyve posted under a pseudonym howard continued and its not a particularly tasteful pseudonym either rude you mean samantha asked bigfatcock or something howards laughter boomed through the room maureen gave an affected shriek of horror but miles scowled and shirley looked furious not quite that sammy no said howard no theyve called themselves the ghost of barry fairbrother oh said samantha her grin evaporating she did not like that after all she had been in the ambulance while they had forced needles and tubes into barrys collapsed body she had watched him dying beneath the plastic mask seen mary clinging to his hand heard her groans and sobs oh no thats not nice said maureen relish in her bullfrogs voice no thats nasty putting words into the mouths of the dead taking names in vain thats not right no agreed howard almost absentmindedly he strolled across the room picked up the wine bottle and returned to samantha topping up her empty glass but someone out there doesnt care about good taste it seems if they can put simon price out of the running if youre thinking what i think youre thinking dad said miles wouldnt they have gone for me rather than price how do you know they havent miles meaning asked miles swiftly meaning said howard the happy cynosure of all eyes that i got sent an anonymous letter about you a couple of weeks ago nothing specific just said you were unfit to fill fairbrothers shoes id be very surprised if the letter didnt come from the same source as the online post the fairbrother theme in both you see samantha tilted her glass a little too enthusiastically so that wine trickled down the sides of her chin exactly where her own ventriloquists doll grooves would no doubt appear in time she mopped her face with her sleeve where is this letter asked miles striving not to look rattled i shredded it it was anonymous it didnt count we didnt want to upset you dear said shirley and she patted miles arm anyway they cant have anything on you howard reassured his son or theyd have dished the dirt the same as they have on price simon prices wife is a lovely girl said shirley with gentle regret i cant believe ruth knows anything about it if her husbands been on the fiddle shes a friend from the hospital shirley elaborated to maureen an agency nurse she wouldnt be the first wife who hasnt spotted whats going on under her nose retorted maureen trumping insider knowledge with worldly wisdom absolutely brazen using barry fairbrothers name said shirley pretending not to have heard maureen not a thought for his widow his family all that matters is their agenda theyll sacrifice anything to it shows you what were up against said howard he scratched the overfold of his belly thinking strategically its smart i saw from the getgo that price was going to split the profields vote no flies on bendsyourear shes realized it too and she wants him out but said samantha it mightnt have anything to do with parminder and that lot at all it could be from someone we dont know someone whos got a grudge against simon price oh sam said shirley with a tinkling laugh shaking her head its easy to see youre new to politics oh fuck off shirley so why have they used barry fairbrothers name then asked miles rounding on his wife well its on the website isnt it its his vacant seat and whos going to trawl through the council website for that kind of information no he said gravely this is an insider an insider libby had once told samantha that there could be thousands of microscopic species inside one drop of pond water they were all perfectly ridiculous samantha thought sitting here in front of shirleys commemorative plates as if they were in the cabinet room in downing street as though one bit of tittletattle on a parish council website constituted an organized campaign as though any of it mattered consciously and defiantly samantha withdrew her attention from the lot of them she fixed her eyes on the window and the clear evening sky beyond and she thought about jake the muscular boy in libbys favourite band at lunchtime today samantha had gone out for sandwiches and brought back a music magazine in which jake and his bandmates were interviewed there were lots of pictures its for libby samantha had told the girl who helped her in the shop wow look at that i wouldnt kick him out of bed for eating toast replied carly pointing at jake naked from the waist up his head thrown back to reveal that thick strong neck oh but hes only twentyone look im not a cradlesnatcher carly was twentysix samantha did not care to subtract jakes age from her own she had eaten her sandwich and read the interview and studied all the pictures jake with his hands on a bar above his head biceps swelling under a black tshirt jake with his white shirt open abdominal muscles chiselled above the loose waistband of his jeans samantha drank howards wine and stared out at the sky above the black privet hedge which was a delicate shade of rose pink the precise shade her nipples had been before they had been darkened and distended by pregnancy and breastfeeding she imagined herself nineteen to jakes twentyone slenderwaisted again taut curves in the right places and a strong flat stomach of her own fitting comfortably into her white size ten shorts she vividly recalled how it felt to sit on a young mans lap in those shorts with the heat and roughness of sunwarmed denim under her bare thighs and big hands around her lithe waist she imagined jakes breath on her neck she imagined turning to look into the blue eyes close to the high cheekbones and that firm carved mouth at the church hall and were getting it catered by bucknoles said howard weve invited everyone aubrey and julia everyone with luck it will be a double celebration you on the council me another year young samantha felt tipsy and randy when were they going to eat she realized that shirley had left the room hopefully to put food on the table the telephone rang at samanthas elbow and she jumped before any of them could move shirley had bustled back in she had one hand in a flowery oven glove and picked up the receiver with the other doubletwofivenine sang shirley on a rising inflection oh hello ruth dear howard miles and maureen became rigidly attentive shirley turned to look at her husband with intensity as if she were transmitting ruths voice through her eyes into her husbands mind yes fluted shirley yes samantha sitting closest to the receiver could hear the other womans voice but not make out the words oh really maureens mouth was hanging open again she was like an ancient baby bird or perhaps a pterodactyl hungering for regurgitated news yes dear i see oh that shouldnt be a problem no no ill explain to howard no no trouble at all shirleys small hazel eyes had not wavered from howards big popping blue ones ruth dear said shirley ruth i dont want to worry you but have you been on the council website today well its not very nice but i think you ought to know somebodys posted something nasty about simon well i think youd better read it for yourself i wouldnt want to all right dear all right see you wednesday i hope yes bye bye shirley replaced the receiver she didnt know miles stated shirley shook her head why was she calling her son shirley told howard your new potboy hes got a peanut allergy very handy in a delicatessen said howard she wanted to ask whether you could store a needleful of adrenalin in the fridge for him just in case said shirley maureen sniffed theyve all got allergies these days children shirleys ungloved hand was still clutching the receiver she was subconsciously hoping to feel tremors down the line from hilltop house v ruth stood alone in her lamplit sitting room continuing to grip the telephone she had just replaced in its cradle hilltop house was small and compact it was always easy to tell the location of each of the four prices because voices footfalls and the sounds of doors opening and shutting carried so effectively in the old house ruth knew that her husband was still in the shower because she could hear the hot water boiler under the stairs hissing and clanking she had waited for simon to turn on the water before telephoning shirley worried that he might think that even her request about the epipen was fraternizing with the enemy the family pc was set up in a corner of the sitting room where simon could keep an eye on it and make sure nobody was running up large bills behind his back ruth relinquished her grip on the phone and hurried to the keyboard it seemed to take a very long time to bring up the pagford council website ruth pushed her reading glasses up her nose with a trembling hand as she scanned the various pages at last she found the message board her husbands name blazed out at her in ghastly black and white simon price unfit to stand for council she doubleclicked the title brought up the full paragraph and read it everything around her seemed to reel and spin oh god she whispered the boiler had stopped clanking simon would be putting on the pyjamas he had warmed on the radiator he had already drawn the sittingroom curtains turned on the side lamps and lit the woodburner so that he could come down and stretch out on the sofa to watch the news ruth knew that she would have to tell him not doing so letting him find out for himself was simply not an option she would have been incapable of keeping it to herself she felt terrified and guilty though she did not know why she heard him jogging down the stairs and then he appeared at the door in his blue brushedcotton pyjamas si she whispered whats the matter he said immediately irritated he knew that something had happened that his luxurious programme of sofa fire and news was about to be disarranged she pointed at the computer monitor one hand pressed foolishly over her mouth like a little girl her terror infected him he strode to the pc and scowled down at the screen he was not a quick reader he read every word every line painstakingly carefully when he had finished he remained quite still passing for review in his mind all the likely grasses he thought of the gumchewing forklift driver whom he had left stranded in the fields when they had picked up the new computer he thought of jim and tommy who did the cashinhand jobs on the sly with him someone from work must have talked rage and fear collided inside him and set off a combustive reaction he strode to the foot of the stairs and shouted you two get down here now ruth still had her hand over her mouth he had a sadistic urge to slap her hand away to tell her to fucking pull herself together it was he who was in the shit andrew entered the room first with paul behind him andrew saw the arms of pagford parish council onscreen and his mother with her hand over her mouth walking barefoot across the old carpet he had the sensation that he was plummeting through the air in a broken lift someone said simon glaring at his sons has talked about things ive mentioned inside this house paul had brought his chemistry exercise book downstairs with him he was holding it like a hymnal andrew kept his gaze fixed on his father trying to project an expression of mingled confusion and curiosity whos told other people weve got a stolen computer asked simon i havent said andrew paul stared at his father blankly trying to process the question andrew willed his brother to speak why did he have to be so slow well simon snarled at paul i dont think i you dont think you dont think you told anyone no i dont think i told any oh this is interesting said simon pacing up and down in front of paul this is interesting with a slap he sent pauls exercise book flying out of his hands try and think dipshit he growled try and fucking think did you tell anyone weve got a stolen computer not stolen said paul i never told anyone i dont think i told anyone we had a new one even i see said simon so the news got out by magic then did it he was pointing at the computer monitor someones fucking talked he yelled because its on the fucking internet and ill be fucking lucky not to lose my job on each of the five last words he thumped paul on the head with his fist paul cowered and ducked black liquid trickled from his left nostril he suffered nosebleeds several times a week and what about you simon roared at his wife who was still frozen beside the computer her eyes wide behind her glasses her hand clamped like a yashmak over her mouth have you been fucking gossiping ruth ungagged herself no si she whispered i mean the only person i told we had a new computer was shirley and shed never you stupid woman you stupid fucking woman what did you have to tell him that for you did what asked simon quietly i told shirley whimpered ruth i didnt say it was stolen though si i only said you were bringing it home well thats fucking it then isnt it roared simon his voice became a scream her fucking sons standing for election of course she wants to get the fucking goods on me but shes the one who told me si just now she wouldnt have he ran at her and hit her in the face exactly as he had wanted to when he had first seen her silly frightened expression her glasses spun into the air and smashed against the bookcase he hit her again and she crashed down onto the computer table she had bought so proudly with her first months wages from south west general andrew had made himself a promise he seemed to move in slow motion and everything was cold and clammy and slightly unreal dont hit her he said forcing himself between his parents dont his lip split against his front tooth simons knuckle behind it and he fell backwards on top of his mother who was draped over the keyboard simon threw another punch which hit andews arms as he protected his face andrew was trying to get off his slumped struggling mother and simon was in a frenzy pummelling both of them wherever he could reach dont you fucking dare tell me what to do dont you dare you cowardly little shit you spotty streak of piss andrew dropped to his knees to get out of the way and simon kicked him in the ribs andrew heard paul say pathetically stop it simons foot swung for andrews ribcage again but andrew dodged it simons toes collided with the brick fireplace and he was suddenly absurdly howling in pain andrew scrambled out of the way simon was gripping the end of his foot hopping on the spot and swearing in a highpitched voice ruth had collapsed into the swivel chair sobbing into her hands andrew got to his feet he could taste his own blood anyone could have talked about that computer he panted braced for further violence he felt braver now that it had begun now that the fight was really on it was waiting that told on your nerves watching simons jaw begin to jut and hearing the urge for violence building in his voice you told us a security guard got beaten up anyone could have talked its not us dont you fucking little shit ive broken my fucking toe simon gasped falling backwards into an armchair still nursing his foot he seemed to expect sympathy andrew imagined picking up a gun and shooting simon in the face watching his features blast apart his brains spattering the room and paulines got her fucking period again simon yelled at paul who was trying to contain the blood dripping through his fingers from his nose get off the carpet get off the fucking carpet you little pansy paul scuttled out of the room andrew pressed the hem of his tshirt to his stinging mouth what about all the cashinhand jobs ruth sobbed her cheek pink from his punch tears dripping from her chin andrew hated to see her humiliated and pathetic like this but he half hated her too for landing herself in it when any idiot could have seen it says about the cashinhand jobs shirley doesnt know about them how could she someone at the printworks has put that on there i told you si i told you you shouldnt do those jobs theyve always worried the living daylights out of fucking shut up you whining cow you didnt mind spending the money yelled simon his jaw jutting again and andrew wanted to roar at his mother to stay silent she blabbed when any idiot could have told her she should keep quiet and she kept quiet when she might have done good by speaking out she never learned she never saw any of it coming nobody spoke for a minute ruth dabbed at her eyes with the back of her hand and sniffed intermittently simon clutched his toe his jaw clenched breathing loudly andrew licked the blood from his stinging lip which he could feel swelling thisll cost me my fucking job said simon staring wildeyed around the room as if there might be somebody there he had forgotten to hit theyre already talking about fucking redundancies thisll be it thisll he slapped the lamp off the end table but it didnt break merely rolled on the floor he picked it up tugged the lead out of the wall socket raised it over his head and threw it at andrew who dodged whos fucking talked simon yelled as the lamp base broke apart on the wall someones fucking talked its some bastard at the printworks isnt it andrew shouted back his lip was thick and throbbing it felt like a tangerine segment dyou think wed have dyou think we dont know how to keep our mouths shut by now it was like trying to read a wild animal he could see the muscles working in his fathers jaw but he could tell that simon was considering andrews words when was that put on there he roared at ruth look at it whats the date on it still sobbing she peered at the screen needing to approach the tip of her nose within two inches of it now that her glasses were broken the fifteenth she whispered fifteenth sunday said simon sunday wasnt it neither andrew nor ruth put him right andrew could not believe his luck nor did he believe it would hold sunday said simon so anyone couldve my fucking toe he yelled as he pulled himself up and limped exaggeratedly towards ruth get out of my way she hastened out of the chair and watched him read the paragraph through again he kept snorting like an animal to clear his airways andrew thought that he might be able to garrotte his father as he sat there if only there was a wire to hand someones got all this from work said simon as if he had just reached this conclusion and had not heard his wife or son urging the hypothesis on him he placed his hands on the keyboard and turned to andrew how do i get rid of it what you do fucking computing how do i get this off here you cant get you cant said andrew youd need to be the administrator make yourself the administrator then said simon jumping up and pointing andrew into the swivel chair i cant make myself the administrator said andrew he was afraid that simon was working himself up into a second bout of violence you need to input the right user name and passwords youre a real fucking waste of space arent you simon shoved andrew in the middle of his sternum as he limped past knocking him back into the mantelpiece pass me the phone simon shouted at his wife as he sat back down in the armchair ruth took the telephone and carried it the few feet to simon he ripped it out of her hands and punched in a number andrew and ruth waited in silence as simon called first jim and then tommy the men with whom he had completed the afterhours jobs at the printworks simons fury his suspicion of his own accomplices was funnelled down the telephone in curt short sentences full of swearwords paul had not returned perhaps he was still trying to staunch his bleeding nose but more likely he was too scared andrew thought his brother unwise it was safest to leave only after simon had given you permission his calls completed simon held out the telephone to ruth without speaking she took it and hurried it back into its stand simon sat thinking while his fractured toe pulsated sweating in the heat of the woodburner awash with impotent fury the beating to which he had subjected his wife and son was nothing he did not give them a thought a terrible thing had just happened to him and naturally his rage had exploded on those nearest him that was how life worked in any case ruth the silly bitch had admitted to telling shirley simon was building his own chain of evidence as he thought things must have happened some fucker and he suspected that gumchewing forklift driver whose expression as simon had sped away from him in the fields had been outraged talking about him to the mollisons somehow illogically ruths admission that she had mentioned the computer to shirley made this seem more likely and they the mollisons the establishment the smooth and the snide guarding their access to power had put up this message on their website shirley the old cow managed the site which set the seal on the theory its your fucking friend simon told his wetfaced tremblinglipped wife its your fucking shirley shes done this shes got some dirt on me to get me off her sons case thats who it is but si shut up shut up you silly cow thought andrew still on her side are you roared simon making to stand again no squealed ruth and he sank back into the chair glad to keep the weight off his pounding foot the harcourtwalsh management would not be happy about those afterhours jobs simon thought he wouldnt put it past the bloody police to come nosing around the computer a desire for urgent action filled him you he said pointing at andrew unplug that computer all of it the leads and everything youre coming with me vi things denied things untold things hidden and disguised the muddy river orr gushed over the wreckage of the stolen computer thrown from the old stone bridge at midnight simon limped to work on his fractured toe and told everyone that he had slipped on the garden path ruth pressed ice to her bruises and concealed them inexpertly with an old tube of foundation andrews lip scabbed over like dane tullys and paul had another nosebleed on the bus and had to go straight to the nurse on arrival at school shirley mollison who had been shopping in yarvil did not answer ruths repeated telephone calls until late afternoon by which time ruths sons had arrived home from school andrew listened to the onesided conversation from the stairs outside the sitting room he knew that ruth was trying to take care of the problem before simon came home because simon was more than capable of seizing the receiver from her and shouting and swearing at her friend just silly lies she was saying brightly but wed be very grateful if you could remove it shirley he scowled and the cut on his fat lip threatened to burst open again he hated hearing his mother asking the woman for a favour in that moment he was irrationally annoyed that the post had not been taken down already then he remembered that he had written it that he had caused everything his mothers battered face his own cut lip and the atmosphere of dread that pervaded the house at the prospect of simons return i do understand youve got a lot of things on ruth was saying cravenly but you can see how this might do simon damage if people believe yes ruth sounded tired shes going to take those things about dad off the site so hopefully thatll be the end of it andrew knew his mother to be intelligent and much handier around the house than his hamfisted father she was capable of earning her own living why didnt she take the post down straight away if youre friends he asked following her into the kitchen for the first time in his life his pity for ruth was mingled with a feeling of frustration that amounted to anger shes been busy snapped ruth one of her eyes was bloodshot from simons punch did you tell her she could be in trouble for leaving defamatory stuff on there if she moderates the boards we did that stuff in comput ive told you shes taking it down andrew said ruth angrily she was not frightened of showing temper to her sons was it because they did not hit her or for some other reason andrew knew that her face must ache as badly as his own so who dyou reckon wrote that stuff about dad he asked her recklessly she turned a face of fury upon him i dont know she said but whoever they are it was a despicable cowardly thing to do everyones got something theyd like to hide how would it be if dad put some of the things he knows about other people on the internet but he wouldnt do it thatd be against his moral code would it said andrew you dont know your father as well as you think you do shouted ruth with tears in her eyes get out go and do your homework i dont care just get out yet the deletion of the post could not remove it from the consciousness of those who were passionately interested in the forthcoming contest for barrys seat parminder jawanda had copied the message about simon price onto her computer and kept opening it subjecting each sentence to the scrutiny of a forensic scientist examining fibres on a corpse searching for traces of howard mollisons literary dna he would have done all he could to disguise his distinctive phraseology but she was sure that she recognized his pomposity in mr price is certainly no stranger to keeping down costs and in the benefit of his many useful contacts minda you dont know simon price said tessa wall she and colin were having supper with the jawandas in the old vicarage kitchen and parminder had started on the subject of the post almost the moment they had crossed the threshold hes a very unpleasant man and he could have upset any number of people i honestly dont think its howard mollison i cant see him doing anything so obvious dont kid yourself tessa said parminder howard will do anything to make sure miles is elected you watch hell go for colin next tessa saw colins knuckles whiten on his fork handle and wished that parminder would think before she spoke she of anyone knew what colin was like she prescribed his prozac vikram was sitting at the end of the table in silence his beautiful face fell naturally into a slightly sardonic smile tessa had always been intimidated by the surgeon as she was by all very goodlooking men although parminder was one of tessas best friends she barely knew vikram who worked long hours and involved himself much less in pagford matters than his wife i told you about the agenda didnt i parminder rattled on for the next meeting hes proposing a motion on the fields for us to pass to the yarvil committee doing the boundary review and a resolution on forcing the drug clinic out of their building hes trying to rush it all through while barrys seats empty she kept leaving the table to fetch things opening more cupboard doors than was necessary distracted and unfocused twice she forgot why she had got up and sat down again emptyhanded vikram watched her everywhere she moved from beneath his thick eyelashes i rang howard last night parminder said and i told him we ought to wait until were back up to the full complement of councillors before we vote on such big issues he laughed he says we cant wait yarvil wants to hear our views he said with the boundary review coming up what hes really scared of is that colins going to win barrys seat because it wont be so easy to foist it all on us then ive emailed everyone i think will vote with us to see if they cant put pressure on him to delay the votes for one meeting the ghost of barry fairbrother parminder added breathlessly the bastard hes not using barrys death to beat him not if i can help it tessa thought she saw vikrams lips twitch old pagford led by howard mollison generally forgave vikram the crimes that it could not forget in his wife brownness cleverness and affluence all of which to shirley mollisons nostrils had the whiff of a gloat it was tessa thought grossly unfair parminder worked hard at every aspect of her pagford life school fêtes and sponsored bakes the local surgery and the parish council and her reward was implacable dislike from the pagford old guard vikram who rarely joined or participated in anything was fawned upon flattered and spoken of with proprietary approval mollisons a megalomaniac parminder said pushing food nervously around her plate a bully and a megalomaniac vikram laid down his knife and fork and sat back in his chair so why he asked is he happy being chair of the parish council why hasnt he tried to get on the district council because he thinks that pagford is the epicentre of the universe snapped parminder you dont understand he wouldnt swap being chair of pagford parish council for being prime minister anyway he doesnt need to be on the council in yarvil hes already got aubrey fawley there pushing through the big agenda all revved up for the boundary review theyre working together parminder felt barrys absence like a ghost at the table he would have explained it all to vikram and made him laugh in the process barry had been a superb mimic of howards speech patterns of his rolling waddling walk of his sudden gastrointestinal interruptions i keep telling her shes letting herself get too stressed vikram told tessa who was appalled to find herself blushing slightly with his dark eyes upon her you know about this stupid complaint the old woman with emphysema yes tessa knows everyone knows do we have to discuss it at the dinner table snapped parminder and she jumped to her feet and began clearing the plates tessa tried to help but parminder told her crossly to stay where she was vikram gave tessa a small smile of solidarity that made her stomach flutter she could not help remembering as parminder clattered around the table that vikram and parminder had had an arranged marriage its only an introduction through the family parminder had told her in the early days of their friendship defensive and annoyed at something she had seen in tessas face nobody makes you marry you know but she had spoken at other times of the immense pressure from her mother to take a husband all sikh parents want their kids married its an obsession parminder said bitterly colin saw his plate snatched away without regret the nausea churning in his stomach was even worse than when he and tessa had arrived he might have been encased in a thick glass bubble so separate did he feel from his three dining companions it was a sensation with which he was only too familiar that of walking in a giant sphere of worry enclosed by it watching his own terrors roll by obscuring the outside world tessa was no help she was being deliberately cool and unsympathetic about his campaign for barrys seat the whole point of this supper was so that colin could consult parminder on the little leaflets he had produced advertising his candidacy tessa was refusing to get involved blocking discussion of the fear that was slowly engulfing him she was refusing him an outlet trying to emulate her coolness pretending that he was not after all caving under selfimposed pressure he had not told her about the telephone call from the yarvil and district gazette that he had received at school that day the journalist on the end of the line had wanted to talk about krystal weedon had he touched her colin had told the woman that the school could not possibly discuss a pupil and that krystal must be approached through her parents ive already talked to krystal said the voice on the end of the line i only wanted to get your but he had put the receiver down and terror had blotted out everything why did they want to talk about krystal why had they called him had he done something had he touched her had she complained the psychologist had taught him not to try and confirm or disprove the content of such thoughts he was supposed to acknowledge their existence then carry on as normal but it was like trying not to scratch the worst itch you had ever known the public unveiling of simon prices dirty secrets on the council website had stunned him the terror of exposure which had dominated so much of colins life now wore a face its features those of an ageing cherub with a demonic brain seething beneath a deerstalker on tight grey curls behind bulging inquisitive eyes he kept remembering barrys tales of the delicatessen owners formidable strategic brain and of the intricate web of alliances that bound the sixteen members of pagford parish council colin had often imagined how he would find out that the game was up a guarded article in the paper faces turned away from him when he entered mollison and lowes the headmistress calling him into her office for a quiet word he had visualized his downfall a thousand times his shame exposed and hung around his neck like a lepers bell so that no concealment would be possible ever again he would be sacked he might end up in prison colin tessa prompted quietly vikram was offering him wine she knew what was going on inside that big domed forehead not the specifics but the theme of his anxiety had been constant for years she knew that colin could not help it it was the way he was made many years before she had read and recognized as true the words of w b yeats a pity beyond all telling is hid at the heart of love she had smiled over the poem and stroked the page because she had known both that she loved colin and that compassion formed a huge part of her love sometimes though her patience wore thin sometimes she wanted a little concern and reassurance too colin had erupted into a predictable panic when she had told him that she had received a firm diagnosis of type diabetes but once she had convinced him that she was not in imminent danger of dying she had been taken aback by how quickly he dropped the subject how completely he reimmersed himself in his election plans that morning at breakfast she had tested her blood sugar with the glucometer for the first time then taken out the prefilled needle and inserted it into her own belly it had hurt much more than when deft parminder did it fats had seized his cereal bowl and swung round in his chair away from her sloshing milk over the table the sleeve of his school shirt and onto the kitchen floor colin had let out an inchoate shout of annoyance as fats spat his mouthful of cornflakes back into his bowl and demanded of his mother have you got to do that at the bloody table dont be so damn rude and disgusting shouted colin sit up properly wipe up that mess how dare you speak to your mother like that apologize tessa withdrew the needle too fast she had made herself bleed im sorry that you shooting up at breakfast makes me want to puke tess said fats from under the table where he was wiping the floor with a bit of kitchen roll your mother isnt shooting up shes got a medical condition shouted colin and dont call her tess i know you dont like needles stu said tessa but her eyes were stinging she had hurt herself and felt shaken and angry with both of them feelings that were still with her this evening tessa wondered why parminder did not appreciate vikrams concern colin never noticed when she was stressed perhaps tessa thought angrily theres something in this arranged marriage business my mother certainly wouldnt have chosen colin for me parminder was shoving bowls of cut fruit across the table for pudding tessa wondered a little resentfully what she would have offered a guest who was not diabetic and comforted herself with the thought of a bar of chocolate lying at home in the fridge parminder who had talked five times as much as anybody else all through supper had started ranting about her daughter sukhvinder she had already told tessa on the telephone about the girls betrayal she went through it all again at the table waitressing with howard mollison i dont i really dont know what shes thinking but vikram they dont think minda colin proclaimed breaking his long silence thats teenagers they dont care theyre all the same colin what rubbish snapped tessa they arent all the same at all wed be delighted if stu went and got himself a saturday job not that theres the remotest chance of that but vikram doesnt mind parminder pressed on ignoring the interruption he cant see anything wrong with it can you vikram answered easily its work experience she probably wont make university theres no shame in it its not for everyone i can see jolly married early quite happy waitressing well they cant all be academic can they no she certainly isnt academic said parminder who was almost quivering with anger and tension her marks are absolutely atrocious no aspiration no ambition waitressing lets face it im not going to get into uni no you certainly wont with that attitude with howard mollison oh he must have absolutely loved it my daughter going cap in hand for a job what was she thinking what was she thinking you wouldnt like it if stu took a job with someone like mollison colin told tessa i wouldnt care said tessa id be thrilled he was showing any kind of work ethic as far as i can tell all he seems to care about is computer games and but colin did not know that stuart smoked she broke off and colin said actually this would be exactly the kind of thing stuart would do insinuate himself with somebody he knew we didnt like to get at us hed love that for goodness sake colin sukhvinder isnt trying to get at minda said tessa so you think im being unreasonable parminder shot at tessa no no said tessa appalled at how quickly they had been sucked into the family row im just saying there arent many places for kids to work in pagford are there and why does she need to work at all said parminder raising her hands in a gesture of furious exasperation dont we give her enough money money you earn yourself is always different you know that said tessa tessas chair faced a wall that was covered in photographs of the jawanda children she had sat here often and had counted how many appearances each child made jaswant eighteen rajpal nineteen and sukhvinder nine there was only one photograph on the wall celebrating sukhvinders individual achievements the picture of the winterdown rowing team on the day that they had beaten st annes barry had given all the parents an enlarged copy of this picture in which sukhvinder and krystal weedon were in the middle of the line of eight with their arms around each others shoulders beaming and jumping up and down so that they were both slightly blurred barry she thought would have helped parminder see things the right way he had been a bridge between mother and daughter both of whom had adored him not for the first time tessa wondered how much difference it made that she had not given birth to her son did she find it easier to accept him as a separate individual than if he had been made from her flesh and blood her glucoseheavy tainted blood fats had recently stopped calling her mum she had to pretend not to care because it made colin so angry but every time fats said tessa it was like a needle jab to her heart the four of them finished their cold fruit in silence vii up in the little white house that sat high above the town simon price fretted and brooded days passed the accusatory post had vanished from the message boards but simon remained paralysed to withdraw his candidacy might seem like an admission of guilt the police had not come knocking about the computer simon half regretted throwing it off the old bridge now on the other hand he could not decide whether he had imagined a knowing grin from the man behind the till when he handed over his credit card in the garage at the foot of the hill there was a lot of talk about redundancies at work and simon was still afraid of the contents of that post coming to the bosses ears that they might save themselves redundancy pay by sacking himself jim and tommy andrew watched and waited losing hope every day he had tried to show the world what his father was and the world it seemed had merely shrugged andrew had imagined that someone from the printworks or the council would rise up and tell simon firmly no that he was not fit to set himself up in competition with other people that he was unsuitable and substandard and must not disgrace himself or his family yet nothing had happened except that simon stopped talking about the council or making telephone calls in the hope of garnering votes and the leaflets that he had had printed out of hours at work sat untouched in a box in the porch then without warning or fanfare came victory heading down the dark stairs in search of food on friday evening andrew heard simon talking stiffly on the telephone in the sitting room and paused to listen withdraw my candidacy he was saying yes well my personal circumstances have changed yes yes yeah thats right ok thank you andrew heard simon replace the receiver well thats that his father said to his mother im well out of it if thats the kind of shit theyre throwing around he heard his mother return some muffled approving rejoinder and before andrew had time to move simon had emerged into the hall below drawn breath into his lungs and yelled the first syllable of andrews name before realizing that his son was right in front of him what are you doing simons face was half in shadow lit only by the light escaping the sitting room i wanted a drink andrew lied his father did not like the boys helping themselves to food you start work with mollison this weekend dont you yeah right well you listen to me i want anything you can get on that bastard dyou hear me all the dirt you can get and on his son if you hear anything all right said andrew and ill put it up on the fucking website for them said simon and he walked back into the sitting room barry fairbrothers fucking ghost as he scavenged an assortment of food that might not be missed skimming off slices here handfuls there a jubilant jingle ran through andrews mind i stopped you you bastard i stopped you he had done exactly what he had set out to do simon had no idea who had brought his ambitions to dust the silly sod was even demanding andrews help in getting his revenge a complete aboutturn because when andrew had first told his parents that he had a job at the delicatessen simon had been furious you stupid little tit what about your fucking allergy i thought id try not eating any of the nuts said andrew dont get smart with me pizza face what if you eat one accidentally like at st thomass dyou think we want to go through that crap again but ruth had supported andrew telling simon that andrew was old enough to take care to know better when simon had left the room she had tried to tell andrew that simon was only worried about him the only thing hes worried about is that hed have to miss bloody match of the day to take me to hospital andrew returned to his bedroom where he sat shovelling food into his mouth with one hand and texting fats with the other he thought that it was all over finished done with andrew had never yet had reason to observe the first tiny bubble of fermenting yeast in which was contained an inevitable alchemical transformation viii the move to pagford had been the worst thing that had ever happened to gaia bawden excepting occasional visits to her father in reading london was all that she had ever known so incredulous had gaia been when kay had first said that she wanted to move to a tiny west country town that it had been weeks before she took the threat seriously she had thought it one of kays mad ideas like the two chickens she had bought for their tiny back garden in hackney killed by a fox a week after purchase or deciding to ruin half their saucepans and permanently scar her own hand by making marmalade when she hardly ever cooked wrenched from friends she had had since primary school from the house she had known since she was eight from weekends that were increasingly about every kind of urban fun gaia had been plunged over her pleas threats and protests into a life she had never dreamed existed cobbled streets and no shops open past six oclock a communal life that seemed to revolve around the church and where you could often hear birdsong and nothing else gaia felt as though she had fallen through a portal into a land lost in time she and kay had clung tightly to each other all gaias life for her father had never lived with them and kays two successive relationships had never been formalized bickering condoling and growing steadily more like flatmates with the passing years now though gaia saw nothing but an enemy when she looked across the kitchen table her only ambition was to return to london by any means possible and to make kay as unhappy as she could in revenge she could not decide whether it would punish kay more to fail all her gcses or to pass them and try and get her father to agree to house her while she attended a sixthform college in london in the meantime she had to exist in alien territory where her looks and her accent once instant passports to the most select social circles had become foreign currency gaia had no desire to become one of the popular students at winterdown she thought they were embarrassing with their west country accents and their pathetic ideas of what constituted entertainment her determined pursuit of sukhvinder jawanda was in part a way of showing the incrowd that she found them laughable and partly because she was in a mood to feel kinship with anybody who seemed to have outsider status the fact that sukhvinder had agreed to join gaia as a waitress had moved their friendship to a different level in their next period of double biology gaia unbent as she had never done before and sukhvinder glimpsed at last part of the mysterious reason why this beautiful cool newcomer had selected her as a friend adjusting the focus on their shared microscope gaia muttered its so frigging white here isnt it sukhvinder heard herself saying yeah before she had fully considered the question gaia was still talking but sukhvinder was only half listening so frigging white she supposed that it was at st thomass she had been made to get up the only brown person in the class and talk about the sikh religion she had stood obediently at the front of the class and told the story of the sikh religions founder guru nanak who disappeared into a river and was believed drowned but reemerged after three days underwater to announce there is no hindu there is no moslem the other children had sniggered at the idea of anyone surviving underwater for three days sukhvinder had not had the courage to point out that jesus had died and then come back to life she had cut the story of guru nanak short desperate to get back to her seat she had only ever visited a gurdwara a handful of times in her life there was none in pagford and the one in yarvil was tiny and dominated according to her parents by chamars a different caste from their own sukhvinder did not even know why that mattered because she knew that guru nanak explicitly forbade caste distinctions it was all very confusing and she continued to enjoy easter eggs and decorating the christmas tree and found the books that parminder pressed upon her children explaining the lives of the gurus and the tenets of khalsa extremely difficult to read because my mother wanted to be near her twat of a boyfriend muttered gaia gavin hughes dyou know him sukhvinder shook her head youve probably heard them shagging said gaia the whole street hears when theyre at it just keep your windows open some night sukhvinder tried not to look shocked but the idea of overhearing her parents her married parents having sex was quite bad enough gaia herself was flushed not sukhvinder thought with embarrassment but with anger hes going to ditch her shes so deluded he cant wait to leave after theyve done it sukhvinder would never have talked about her mother like this and nor would the fairbrother twins still in theory her best friends niamh and siobhan were working together at a microscope not far away since their father had died they seemed to have closed in on themselves choosing each others company drifting away from sukhvinder andrew price was staring almost constantly at gaia through a gap in the white faces all around them sukhvinder who had noticed this thought that gaia had not but she was wrong gaia was simply not bothering to stare back or preen herself because she was used to boys staring at her it had been happening since she was twelve two boys in the lower sixth kept turning up in the corridors as she moved between classes far more often than the law of averages would seem to dictate and both were betterlooking than andrew however none of them could compare to the boy to whom gaia had lost her virginity shortly before moving to pagford gaia could hardly bear that marco de luca was still physically alive in the universe and separated from her by a hundred and thirtytwo miles of aching useless space hes eighteen she told sukhvinder hes half italian he plays football really well hes supposed to be getting a tryout for arsenals youth squad gaia had had sex with marco four times before leaving hackney each time stealing condoms out of kays bedside table she had half wanted kay to know to what lengths she was driven to brand herself on marcos memory because she was being forced to leave him sukhvinder listened fascinated but not admitting to gaia that she had already seen marco on her new friends facebook page there was nobody like that in the whole of winterdown he looked like johnny depp gaia slumped against the desk playing absentmindedly with the focus on the microscope and across the room andrew price continued to stare at gaia whenever he thought fats would not notice maybe hell be faithful sherelles having a party on saturday night shes invited him shes sworn she wont let him get up to anything but shit i wish she stared at the desk with her flecked eyes out of focus and sukhvinder watched her humbly marvelling at her good looks lost in admiration for her life the idea of having another world where you belonged completely where you had a footballer boyfriend and a gang of cool devoted friends seemed to her even if you had been forcibly removed from it all an aweinspiring and enviable state of affairs they walked together to the shops at lunchtime something sukhvinder almost never did she and the fairbrother twins usually ate in the canteen as they hung about on the pavement outside the newsagents where they had bought sandwiches they heard words uttered in a piercing scream your fucking mum killed my nan all the winterdown students clustered by the newsagents looked around for the source of the shouting puzzled and sukhvinder imitated them as confused as everyone else then she spotted krystal weedon who was standing on the other side of the road pointing a stubby finger like a gun she had four other girls with her all of them strung along the pavement in a line held back by the traffic your fucking mum killed my nan shes gonna get fucking done and so are you sukhvinders stomach seemed to melt clean away people were staring at her a couple of thirdyear girls scuttled out of sight sukhvinder sensed the bystanders nearby transforming into a watchful eager pack krystal and her gang were dancing on tiptoes waiting for a break in the cars whats she talking about gaia asked sukhvinder whose mouth was so dry that she could not reply there was no point in running she would never make it leanne carter was the fastest girl in their year all that seemed to move in the world were the passing cars giving her a few final seconds of safety and then jaswant appeared accompanied by several sixthyear boys all right jolly she said whats up jaswant had not heard krystal it was mere luck that she had drifted this way with her entourage over the road krystal and her friends had gone into a huddle nothing much said sukhvinder dizzy with relief at her temporary reprieve she could not tell jaz what was happening in front of the boys two of them were nearly six feet tall all were staring at gaia jaz and her friends moved towards the newsagents door and sukhvinder with an urgent look at gaia followed them she and gaia watched through the window as krystal and her gang moved on glancing back every few steps what was that about gaia asked her greatgran was my mums patient and she died said sukhvinder she wanted to cry so much that the muscles in her throat were painful silly bitch said gaia but sukhvinders suppressed sobs were born not only from the shaky aftermath of fear she had liked krystal very much and she knew that krystal had liked her too all those afternoons on the canal all those journeys in the minibus she knew the anatomy of krystals back and shoulders better than she knew her own they returned to school with jaswant and her friends the bestlooking of the boys struck up a conversation with gaia by the time they had turned in at the gates he was teasing her about her london accent sukhvinder could not see krystal anywhere but she spotted fats wall at a distance loping along with andrew price she would have known his shape and his walk anywhere the way something primal inside you helped you recognize a spider moving across a shadowy floor wave upon wave of nausea rippled through her as she approached the school building there would be two of them from now on fats and krystal together everyone knew that they were seeing each other and into sukhvinders mind dropped a vividly coloured picture of herself bleeding on the floor and krystal and her gang kicking her and fats wall watching laughing need the loo she told gaia meet you up there she dived into the first girls bathroom they passed locked herself in a cubicle and sat down on the closed seat if she could have died if she could have disappeared for ever but the solid surface of things refused to dissolve around her and her body her hateful hermaphrodites body continued in its stubborn lumpen way to live she heard the bell for the start of afternoon lessons jumped up and hurried out of the bathroom queues were forming along the corridor she turned her back on all of them and marched out of the building other people truanted krystal did it and so did fats wall if she could only get away and stay away this afternoon she might be able to think of something to protect her before she had to go back in or she could walk in front of a car she imagined it slamming into her body and her bones shattering how quickly would she die broken in the road she still preferred the thought of drowning of cool clean water putting her to sleep for ever a sleep without dreams sukhvinder sukhvinder her stomach turned over tessa wall was hurrying towards her across the car park for one mad moment sukhvinder considered running but then the futility of it overwhelmed her and she stood waiting for tessa to reach her hating her with her stupid plain face and her evil son sukhvinder what are you doing where are you going she could not even think of a lie with a hopeless gesture of her shoulders she surrendered tessa had no appointments until three she ought to have taken sukhvinder to the office and reported her attempted flight instead she took sukhvinder upstairs to the guidance room with its nepalese wallhanging and the posters for childline sukhvinder had never been there before tessa spoke and left inviting little pauses then spoke again and sukhvinder sat with sweaty palms her gaze fixed on her shoes tessa knew her mother tessa would tell parminder that she had tried to truant but if she explained why would tessa could tessa intercede not with her son she could not control fats that was common knowledge but with krystal krystal came to guidance how bad would the beating be if she told but there would be a beating even if she did not tell krystal had been ready to set her whole gang on her anything happened sukhvinder she nodded tessa said encouragingly can you tell me what it was so sukhvinder told she was sure she could read in the minute contraction of tessas brow as she listened something other than sympathy for herself perhaps tessa was thinking about how parminder might react to the news that her treatment of mrs catherine weedon was being screamed about in the street sukhvinder had not forgotten to worry about that as she had sat in the bathroom cubicle wishing for death or perhaps tessas look of unease was reluctance to tackle krystal weedon doubtless krystal was her favourite too as she had been mr fairbrothers a fierce stinging sense of injustice burst through sukhvinders misery her fear and her selfloathing it swept aside that tangle of worries and terrors that encased her daily she thought of krystal and her mates waiting to charge she thought of fats whispering poisonous words from behind her in every maths lesson and of the message that she had wiped off her facebook page the previous evening lesbianism n sexual orientation of women to women also called sapphism a native or inhabitant of lesbos i dont know how she knows said sukhvinder with the blood thrumming in her ears knows asked tessa her expression still troubled that theres been a complaint about mum and her greatgran krystal and her mum dont talk to the rest of the family maybe said sukhvinder fats told her fats tessa repeated uncomprehendingly you know because theyre seeing each other said sukhvinder him and krystal going out together so maybe he told her it gave her some bitter satisfaction to see every vestige of professional calm drain from tessas face ix kay bawden never wanted to set foot in miles and samanthas house again she could not forgive them for witnessing gavins parade of indifference nor could she forget miles patronizing laughter his attitude to bellchapel or the sneery way that he and samantha had spoken about krystal weedon in spite of gavins apology and his tepid assurances of affection kay could not stop picturing him nose to nose with mary on the sofa jumping up to help her with the plates walking her home in the dark when gavin told her a few days later that he had had dinner at marys house she had to fight down an angry response because he had never eaten more than toast at her house in hope street she might not be allowed to say anything bad about the widow about whom gavin spoke as though she were the holy mother but the mollisons were different i cant say i like miles very much hes not exactly my best mate if you ask me itll be a catastrophe for the addiction clinic if he gets elected i doubt itll make any difference gavins apathy his indifference to other peoples pain always infuriated kay isnt there anyone wholl stick up for bellchapel colin wall i suppose said gavin so at eight oclock on monday evening kay walked up the walls drive and rang their doorbell from the front step she could make out samantha mollisons red ford fiesta parked in the drive three houses along the sight added a little extra zest to her desire for a fight the walls door was opened by a short plain dumpy woman in a tiedyed skirt hello said kay my names kay bawden and i was wondering whether i could speak to colin wall for a split second tessa simply stared at the attractive young woman on the doorstep whom she had never seen before the strangest idea flashed across her mind that colin was having an affair and that his lover had come to tell her so oh yes come in im tessa kay wiped her feet conscientiously on the doormat and followed tessa into a sitting room that was smaller shabbier but cosier than the mollisons a tall balding man with a high forehead was sitting in an armchair with a notebook in his lap and a pen in his hand colin this is kay bawden said tessa shed like to speak to you tessa saw colins startled and wary expression and knew at once that the woman was a stranger to him really she thought a little ashamed what were you thinking im sorry to barge in on you like this unannounced said kay as colin stood up to shake her hand i would have telephoned but youre were exdirectory yes said colin he towered over kay his eyes tiny behind the lenses of his glasses please sit down thank you its about the election said kay this parish council election youre standing arent you against miles mollison thats right said colin nervously he knew who she must be the reporter who had wanted to talk to krystal they had tracked him down tessa ought not to have let her in i was wondering whether i could help in any way said kay im a social worker mostly working in the fields there are some facts and figures i could give you about the bellchapel addiction clinic which mollison seems quite keen on closing ive been told that youre for the clinic that youd like to keep it open the onrush of relief and pleasure made him almost giddy oh yes said colin yes i would yes that was my predecessors thats to say the previous holder of the seat barry fairbrother was certainly opposed to closing the clinic and i am too well ive had a conversation with miles mollison and he made it quite clear that he doesnt think the clinics worth keeping open frankly i think hes rather ignorant and naive about the causes and treatment of addiction and about the very real difference bellchapel is making if the parish refuses to renew the lease on the building and the district cuts funding then theres a danger that some very vulnerable people will be left without support yes yes i see said colin oh yes i agree he was astonished and flattered that this attractive young woman would have walked through the evening to find him and offer herself as an ally would you like a cup of tea or coffee kay asked tessa oh thanks very much said kay tea please tessa no sugar fats was in the kitchen helping himself from the fridge he ate copiously and continually but remained scrawny never putting on an ounce of weight in spite of his openly declared disgust for them he seemed unaffected by tessas pack of readyfilled syringes which sat in a clinical white box next to the cheese tessa moved to the kettle and her thoughts returned to the subject that had consumed her ever since sukhvinder had suggested it earlier that fats and krystal were seeing each other she had not questioned fats and she had not told colin the more that tessa thought about it the more certain she was that it could not be true she was sure that fats held himself in such high regard that no girl would be good enough especially a girl like krystal surely he would not demean himself is that it is that what you think whos here fats asked tessa through a mouthful of cold chicken as she put on the kettle a woman who wants to help dad get elected to the council replied tessa foraging in the cupboard for biscuits why does she fancy him grow up stu said tessa crossly he plucked several slices of thin ham out of an open pack and poked them bit by bit into his crammed mouth like a magician inserting silk handkerchiefs into his fist fats sometimes stood for ten minutes at a time at the open fridge ripping open clingfilm and packets and putting chunks of food directly into his mouth it was a habit colin deprecated along with almost every other aspect of fats behaviour whys she want to help him seriously he asked having swallowed his mouthful of meat she wants the bellchapel addiction clinic to stay open what a junkie is she no she isnt a junkie said tessa noting with annoyance that fats had finished the last three chocolate biscuits and left the empty wrappings on the shelf shes a social worker and she thinks the clinic is doing a good job dad wants to keep it open but miles mollison doesnt think its very effective it cant be doing that well the fields are full of gluesniffers and smackheads tessa knew that if she had said that colin wanted to close the clinic fats would have instantly produced an argument for its continuation you ought to be a barrister stu she said as the kettle lid started to rattle when tessa returned to the sitting room with her tray she found kay talking colin through a sheaf of printed material she had brought out of her big tote bag two drugs workers partfunded by the council and partly by action on addiction which is a really good charity then theres a social worker attached to the clinic nina shes the one who gave me all this oh thanks very much said kay beaming up at tessa who had set down a mug of tea on the table beside her kay had taken to the walls in just a few minutes as she had not taken to anybody else in pagford there had been no sweeping upanddown glance from tessa as she walked in no gimleteyed assessment of her physical imperfections and dress sense her husband though nervous seemed decent and earnest in his determination to obstruct the abandonment of the fields is that a london accent kay asked tessa dunking a plain biscuit in her tea kay nodded what brings you to pagford a relationship said kay she took no pleasure saying it even though she and gavin were officially reconciled she turned back to colin i dont quite understand the situation with regards to the parish council and the clinic oh it owns the building said colin its an old church the lease is coming up for renewal so that would be an easy way to force them out exactly when did you say youd spoken to miles mollison asked colin both hoping and dreading to hear that miles had mentioned him we had dinner friday before last kay explained gavin and i oh youre gavins girlfriend interjected tessa yes and anyway the subject of the fields came up it would said tessa and miles mentioned bellchapel and i was quite quite dismayed by the way he talked about the issues involved i told him im dealing with a family at the moment kay remembered her indiscreet mention of the weedons names and proceeded carefully and if the mother is deprived of methadone shell almost certainly end up back on the game that sounds like the weedons said tessa with a lowering sensation i yes i am talking about the weedons actually said kay tessa reached for another biscuit im krystals guidance teacher this must be the second time her mothers been through bellchapel is it third said kay weve known krystal since she was five she was in our sons class at primary school tessa said shes had an awful life really absolutely said kay its astounding shes as sweet as she is actually oh i agree said colin heartily remembering colins absolute refusal to rescind krystals detention after the squawking incident in assembly tessa raised her eyebrows then she wondered with a sick lurch in her stomach what colin would say if sukhvinder was not lying or mistaken but surely sukhvinder was wrong she was a shy naive girl probably she had got the wrong end of the stick misheard something the point is about the only thing that motivates terri is the fear of losing her kids said kay shes back on track at the moment her key worker at the clinic told me she senses a bit of a breakthrough in terris attitude if bellchapel closes it all goes bellyup again and god knows whatll happen to the family this is all very useful said colin nodding importantly and starting to make notes on a clean page in his notebook very useful indeed did you say youve got statistics on people going clean kay shuffled the printed pages looking for the information tessa had the impression that colin wanted to reclaim kays attention for himself he had always been susceptible to good looks and a sympathetic manner tessa munched another biscuit still thinking about krystal their recent guidance sessions had not been very satisfactory krystal had been standoffish todays had been no different she had extracted a promise from krystal that she would not pursue or harass sukhvinder jawanda again but krystals demeanour suggested that tessa had let her down that trust was broken possibly colins detention was to blame tessa had thought that she and krystal had forged a bond strong enough to withstand that although it had never been quite like the one krystal had with barry tessa had been there on the spot the day that barry had come into school with a rowing machine looking for recruits to the crew he was trying to start she had been summoned from the staff room to the gym because the pe teacher was off sick and the only supply teacher they could find at such short notice was male the fourthyear girls in their shorts and aertex tops had been giggly when they had arrived in the gym to find miss jarvis absent replaced by two strange men tessa had had to reprimand krystal nikki and leanne who had pushed to the front of the class and were making lewd suggestive remarks about the supply teacher he was a handsome young man with an unfortunate tendency to blush barry short gingerhaired and bearded was wearing a tracksuit he had taken a morning off work to do this everybody thought his idea was strange and unrealistic schools like winterdown did not have rowing eights niamh and siobhan had seemed half amused half mortified by their dads presence barry explained what he was trying to do put together crews he had secured the use of the old boathouse down on the canal at yarvil it was a fabulous sport and an opportunity to shine for themselves for their school tessa had positioned herself right next to krystal and her friends to keep them in check the worst of their giggling had subsided but was not entirely quelled barry demonstrated the rowing machine and asked for volunteers nobody stepped forward krystal weedon said barry pointing at her ive seen you dangling off the monkey bars down the park thats proper upper body strength youve got there come here and give it a go krystal was only too happy to step into the spotlight she swaggered up to the machine and sat down on it even with tessa glowering beside them nikki and leanne had howled with laughter and the rest of the class joined in barry showed krystal what to do the silent supply teacher had watched in professional alarm as barry positioned her hands on the wooden handle she heaved on the handle making a stupid face at nikki and leanne and everyone laughed again look at that barry had said beaming shes a natural had krystal really been a natural tessa did not know anything about rowing she could not tell straighten your back barry told krystal or youll injure it thats it pull pull look at that technique have you done this before then krystal really had straightened her back and she really had done it properly she stopped looking at nikki and leanne she hit a rhythm excellent said barry look at that excellent thats how you do it atta girl and again and again and it urts shouted krystal i know it does thats how you end up with arms like jennifer aniston doing that said barry there had been a little ripple of laughter but this time they laughed with him what was it that barry had had he was always so present so natural so entirely without selfconsciousness teenagers tessa knew were riven with the fear of ridicule those who were without it and god knew there were few enough of them in the adult world had natural authority among the young they ought to be forced to teach and rest barry said and krystal slumped red in the face and rubbing her arms youll have to give up the fags krystal said barry and he got a big laugh this time ok who else wants a try when krystal rejoined her watching classmates she was no longer laughing she watched each new rower jealously her eyes darting constantly to barrys bearded face to see what he thought of them when carmen lewis messed it up completely barry said show em krystal and her face lit up as she returned to the machine but at the end of the exhibition when barry asked those who were interested in trying out for the team to raise their hands krystal kept her arms folded tessa watched her shake her head sneering as nikki muttered to her barry carefully noted down the names of the interested girls then looked up and you krystal weedon he said pointing at her youre coming too dont you shake your head at me ill be very annoyed if i dont see you thats natural talent youve got there i dont like seeing natural talent wasted krys tal he said loudly inscribing her name wee don had krystal thought about her natural talent as she showered at the end of the lesson had she carried the thought of her new aptitude around with her that day like an unexpected valentine tessa did not know but to the amazement of all except perhaps barry krystal had turned up at tryouts colin was nodding vigorously as kay took him through relapse rates at bellchapel parminder should see this he said ill make sure she gets a copy yes yes very useful indeed feeling slightly sick tessa took a fourth biscuit x parminder worked late on monday evenings and as vikram was usually at the hospital the three jawanda children laid the table and cooked for themselves sometimes they squabbled occasionally they had a laugh but today each was absorbed in their own particular thoughts and the job was completed with unusual efficiency in near silence sukhvinder had not told her brother or her sister that she had tried to truant or about krystal weedons threat to beat her up the habit of secrecy was very strong in her these days she was actively frightened of imparting confidences because she feared that they might betray the world of oddness that lived inside her the world that fats wall seemed able to penetrate with such terrifying ease all the same she knew that the events of the day could not be kept quiet indefinitely tessa had told her that she intended to telephone parminder im going to have to call your mum sukhvinder its what we always do but im going to explain to her why you did it sukhvinder had felt almost warm towards tessa even though she was fats walls mother frightened though she was of her mothers reaction a tiny little glow of hope had kindled inside her at the thought of tessa interceding for her would the realization of sukhvinders desperation lead at last to some crack in her mothers implacable disapproval her disappointment her endless stonefaced criticism when the front door opened at last she heard her mother speaking punjabi oh not the bloody farm again groaned jaswant who had cocked an ear to the door the jawandas owned a patch of ancestral land in the punjab which parminder the oldest had inherited from their father in the absence of sons the farm occupied a place in the family consciousness that jaswant and sukhvinder had sometimes discussed to their slightly amused astonishment a few of their older relatives seemed to live in the expectation that the whole family would move back there one day parminders father had sent money back to the farm all his life it was tenanted and worked by second cousins who seemed surly and embittered the farm caused regular arguments among her mothers family nanis gone off on one again interpreted jaswant as parminders muffled voice penetrated the door parminder had taught her firstborn some punjabi and jaz had picked up a lot more from their cousins sukhvinders dyslexia had been too severe to enable her to learn two languages and the attempt had been abandoned harpreet still wants to sell off that bit for the road sukhvinder heard parminder kicking off her shoes she wished that her mother had not been bothered about the farm tonight of all nights it never put her into a good mood and when parminder pushed open the kitchen door and she saw her mothers tight masklike face her courage failed her completely parminder acknowledged jaswant and rajpal with a slight wave of her hand but she pointed at sukhvinder and then towards a kitchen chair indicating that she was to sit down and wait for the call to end jaswant and rajpal drifted back upstairs sukhvinder waited beneath the wall of photographs in which her relative inadequacy was displayed for the world to see pinned to her chair by her mothers silent command on and on went the call until at long last parminder said goodbye and cut the connection when she turned to look at her daughter sukhvinder knew instantly before a word was spoken that she had been wrong to hope so said parminder i had a call from tessa while i was at work i expect you know what it was about sukhvinder nodded her mouth seemed to be full of cotton wool parminders rage crashed over her like a tidal wave dragging sukhvinder with it so that she was unable to find her feet or right herself why why is this copying the london girl again are you trying to impress her jaz and raj never behave like this never why do you whats wrong with you are you proud of being lazy and sloppy do you think its cool to act like a delinquent how do you think i felt when tessa told me called at work ive never been so ashamed im disgusted by you do you hear me do we not give you enough do we not help you enough what is wrong with you sukhvinder in desperation sukhvinder tried to break through her mothers tirade and mentioned the name krystal weedon krystal weedon shouted parminder that stupid girl why are you paying attention to anything she says did you tell her i tried to keep her damn greatgrandmother alive did you tell her that i no if youre going to care about what the likes of krystal weedon says theres no hope for you perhaps thats your natural level is it sukhvinder you want to play truant and work in a café and waste all your opportunities for education because thats easier is that what being in a team with krystal weedon taught you to sink to her level sukhvinder thought of krystal and her gang raring to go on the opposite kerb waiting for a break in the cars what would it take to make her mother understand an hour ago she had had the tiniest fantasy that she might confide in her mother at last about fats wall get out of my sight go ill speak to your father when he comes in go sukhvinder walked upstairs jaswant called from her bedroom what was all that shouting about sukhvinder did not answer she proceeded to her own room where she closed the door and sat down on the edge of her bed whats wrong with you sukhvinder you disgust me are you proud of being lazy and sloppy what had she expected warm encircling arms and comfort when had she ever been hugged and held by parminder there was more comfort to be had from the razor blade hidden in her stuffed rabbit but the desire mounting to a need to cut and bleed could not be satisfied by daylight with the family awake and her father on his way the dark lake of desperation and pain that lived in sukhvinder and yearned for release was in flames as if it had been fuel all along let her see how it feels she got up crossed her bedroom in a few strides and dropping into the chair by her desk pounded at the keyboard of her computer sukhvinder had been just as interested as andrew price when that stupid supply teacher had tried to impress them with his cool in computing unlike andrew and a couple of the other boys sukhvinder had not plied the teacher with questions about the hacking she had merely gone home quietly and looked it all up online nearly every modern website was proof against a classic sql injection but when sukhvinder had heard her mother discussing the anonymous attack on the pagford parish council website it had occurred to sukhvinder that the security on that feeble old site was probably minimal sukhvinder always found it much easier to type than to write and computer code easier to read than long strings of words it did not take very long for her to retrieve a site that gave explicit instructions for the simplest form of sql injection then she brought up the parish council website it took her five minutes to hack the site and then only because she had transcribed the code wrong the first time to her astonishment she discovered that whoever was administering the site had not removed the user details of theghostofbarryfairbrother from the database but merely deleted the post it would be childs play therefore to post in the same name it took sukhvinder much longer to compose the message than it had to hack into the site she had carried the secret accusation with her for months ever since new years eve when she had noticed with wonder her mothers face at ten to midnight from the corner of the party where she was hiding she typed slowly autocorrect helped with her spelling she was not afraid that parminder would check her computer history her mother knew so little about her and about what went on in this bedroom that she would never suspect her lazy stupid sloppy daughter sukhvinder pressed the mouse like a trigger xi krystal did not take robbie to nursery on tuesday morning but dressed him for nana caths funeral instead as she pulled up his least ripped trousers which were a good two inches too short in the leg she tried to explain to him who nana cath had been but she might as well have saved her breath robbie had no memory of nana cath he had no idea what nana meant no concept of any relative other than mother and sister in spite of her shifting hints and stories krystal knew that terri had no idea who his father was krystal heard her mothers footsteps on the stairs leave it she snapped at robbie who had reached for an empty beer can lying beneath terris usual armchair cmere she pulled robbie by the hand into the hall terri was still wearing the pyjama bottoms and dirty tshirt in which she had spent the night and her feet were bare why intcha changed demanded krystal i aint goin said terri pushing past her son and daughter into the kitchen changed me mind why i don wanna said terri she was lighting a cigarette off the ring of the cooker don fuckin ave to krystal was still holding robbies hand as he tugged and swung theyre all goin said krystal cheryl an shane an all so said terri aggressively krystal had been afraid that her mother would pull out at the last minute the funeral would bring her face to face with danielle the sister who pretended that terri did not exist not to mention all the other relatives who had disowned them annemarie might be there krystal had been holding on to that hope like a torch in the darkness through the nights she had sobbed for nana cath and mr fairbrother you gotta go said krystal no i ain its nana cath innit said krystal so said terri again she done loads fer us said krystal no she ain snapped terri she did said krystal her face hot and her hand clutching robbies fer you maybe said terri she done fuckall for me go an fuckin bawl all over er fuckin grave if yeh want im waitin in wha for said krystal my busness innit the old familiar shadow fell obbos comin round is e my busness repeated terri with pathetic dignity come to the funeral said krystal loudly you go don go fuckin usin said krystal her voice an octave higher i ain said terri but she turned away looking out of the dirty back window over the patch of overgrown litterstrewn grass they called the back garden robbie tugged his hand out of krystals and disappeared into the sitting room with her fists deep in her trackie pockets shoulders squared krystal tried to decide what to do she wanted to cry at the thought of not going to the funeral but her distress was edged with relief that she would not have to face the battery of hostile eyes she had sometimes met at nana caths she was angry with terri and yet felt strangely on her side you dont even know who the father is do yeh yer whore she wanted to meet annemarie but was scared all righ then ill stay an all you don ave ter go if yeh wan i don fuckin care but krystal certain that obbo would appear stayed obbo had been away for more than a week for some nefarious purpose of his own krystal wished that he had died that he would never come back for something to do she began to tidy the house while smoking one of the rollups fats wall had given her she didnt like them but she liked that he had given them to her she had been keeping them in nikkis plastic jewellery box along with tessas watch she had thought that she might not see fats any more after their shag in the cemetery because he had been almost silent afterwards and left her with barely a goodbye but they had since met up on the rec she could tell that he had enjoyed this time more than the last they had not been stoned and he had lasted longer he lay beside her in the grass beneath the bushes smoking and when she had told him about nana cath dying he had told her that sukhvinder jawandas mother had given nana cath the wrong drugs or something he was not clear exactly what had happened krystal had been horrified so nana cath need not have died she might still have been in the neat little house on hope street there in case krystal needed her offering a refuge with a comfortable cleansheeted bed the tiny kitchen full of food and mismatched china and the little tv in the corner of the sitting room i don wanna watch no filth krystal turn that off krystal had liked sukhvinder but sukhvinders mother had killed nana cath you did not differentiate between members of an enemy tribe it had been krystals avowed intention to pulverize sukhvinder but then tessa wall had intervened krystal could not remember the details of what tessa had told her but it seemed that fats had got the story wrong or at least not exactly right she had given tessa a grudging promise not to go after sukhvinder but such promises could only ever be stopgaps in krystals frantic everchanging world put it down krystal shouted at robbie because he was trying to prise the lid off the biscuit tin where terri kept her works krystal snatched the tin from him and held it in her hands like a living creature something that would fight to stay alive whose destruction would have tremendous consequences there was a scratched picture on the lid a carriage with luggage piled high on the roof drawn through the snow by four chestnut horses a coachman in a top hat carrying a bugle she carried the tin upstairs with her while terri sat in the kitchen smoking and hid it in her bedroom robbie trailed after her wanna go play park she sometimes took him and pushed him on the swings and the roundabout not today robbie he whined until she shouted at him to shut up later when it was dark after krystal had made robbie his tea of spaghetti hoops and given him a bath when the funeral was long since over obbo rapped on the front door krystal saw him from robbies bedroom window and tried to get there first but terri beat her to it all righ ter he said over the threshold before anyone had invited him in eard you was lookin fer me las week although she had told him to stay put robbie had followed krystal downstairs she could smell his shampooed hair over the smell of fags and stale sweat that clung to obbo in his ancient leather jacket obbo had had a few when he leered at her she smelt the beer fumes all righ obbo said terri with the note in her voice krystal never heard otherwise it was conciliating accommodating it conceded that he had rights in their house where you bin then bristol he said hows you ter she don wan nuthin said krystal he blinked at her through his thick glasses robbie was clutching krystals leg so tightly that she could feel his nails in her skin oos this ter asked obbo yer mum terri laughed krystal glared at him robbies grip tight on her thigh obbos bleary gaze dropped to him an ows me boy he ain your fuckin boy said krystal ow dyou know obbo asked her quietly grinning fuck off she don wan nuthin tell im krystal virtually shouted at terri

bollocks she told her mother they aven said nuthin ave they cuts repeated obbo patting his bulging pockets for cigarettes we got the case review krystal reminded terri yeh cant use yeh cant whas that asked obbo fiddling with his lighter but neither woman enlightened him terri met her daughters gaze for a bare two seconds her eyes fell reluctantly to robbie in his pyjamas still clinging tightly to krystals leg yeah i wuz gonna go ter bed obbo she mumbled without looking at him ill mebbe see yer another time i eard your nan died he said cheryl wuz tellin me pain contorted terris face she looked as old as nana cath herself yeah im goin ter bed cmon robbie come wi me robbie robbie did not want to let go of krystal while obbo was still there terri held out her clawlike hand yeah go on robbie krystal urged him in certain moods terri clutched her son like a teddy bear better robbie than smack go on go wi mum he was reassured by something in krystals voice and allowed terri to take him upstairs see yeh said krystal without looking at obbo but stalking away from him into the kitchen pulling the last of fats walls rollups out of her pocket and bending to light it off the gas ring she heard the front door close and felt triumphant fuck him you got a lovely arse krystal she jumped so violently that a plate slipped off the heaped side and smashed on the filthy floor he had not gone but had followed her he was staring at her chest in its tight tshirt fuck off she said big girl intcha fuck off i eard you give it away free said obbo closing in you could make better moneyn yer mum fuck his hand was on her left breast she tried to knock it away he seized her wrist in his other hand her lit cigarette grazed his face and he punched her twice to the side of the head more plates shattered on the filthy floor and then as they wrestled she slipped and fell the back of her head smacked on the floor and he was on top of her she could feel his hand at the waistband of her tracksuit bottoms pulling no fuck no his knuckles in her belly as he undid his own flies she tried to scream and he smacked her across the face the smell of him was thick in her nostrils as he growled in her ear fuckin shout and ill cut yer he was inside her and it hurt she could hear him grunting and her own tiny whimper she was ashamed of the noise she made so frightened and so small he came and clambered off her at once she pulled up her tracksuit bottoms and jumped up to face him tears pouring down her face as he leered at her ill tell mist fairbrother she heard herself sob she did not know where it came from it was a stupid thing to say the fucks he obbo tugged up his flies lit a cigarette taking his time blocking her exit you fuckin im too are yeh little slapper he sauntered up the hall and was gone she was shaking as she had never done in her life she thought she might be sick she could smell him all over her the back of her head throbbed there was a pain inside her and wetness seeping into her pants she ran out of the room into the living room and stood shivering with her arms wrapped around herself then she knew a moment of terror that he would come back and hurried to the front door to lock it back in the sitting room she found a long stub in the ashtray and lit it smoking shaking and sobbing she sank into terris usual chair then jumped up because she heard footsteps on the stairs terri had reappeared looking confused and wary whassa matter with you krystal gagged on the words he jus he jus fucked me wha said terri obbo e jus e wouldn it was the instinctive denial with which terri met all of life he wouldnt no i never no i didnt krystal flew at her and pushed her emaciated as she was terri crumpled backwards into the hall shrieking and swearing krystal ran to the door she had just locked fumbled to unfasten it and wrenched it open still sobbing she was twenty yards along the dark street before she realized that obbo might be waiting out here watching she cut across a neighbours garden at a run and took a zigzag route through back ways in the direction of nikkis house and all the time the wetness spread in her pants and she thought she might throw up krystal knew that it was rape what he had done it had happened to leannes older sister in the car park of a nightclub in bristol some people would have gone to the police she knew that but you did not invite the police into your life when your mother was terri weedon ill tell mist fairbrother her sobs came faster and faster she could have told mr fairbrother he had known what real life was like one of his brothers had done time he had told krystal stories of his youth it had not been like her youth nobody was as low as her she knew that but like nikkis like leannes money had run out his mother had bought her council house and then been unable to keep up the payments they had lived for a while in a caravan lent by an uncle mr fairbrother took care of things he sorted things out he had come to their house and talked to terri about krystal and rowing because there had been an argument and terri was refusing to sign forms for krystal to go away with the team he had not been disgusted or he had not shown it which came to the same thing terri who liked and trusted nobody had said e seems all righ and she had signed mr fairbrother had once said to her itll be tougher for you than these others krys it was tougher for me but you can do better you dont have to go the same way he had meant working hard at school and stuff but it was too late for that and anyway it was all bollocks how would reading help her now ows me boy he ain your fuckin boy ow dyou know leannes sister had had to get the morningafter pill krystal would ask leanne about the pill and go and get it she could not have obbos baby the thought of it made her retch i gotta get out of here she thought fleetingly of kay and then discarded her as bad as the police to tell a social worker that obbo walked in and out of their house raping people she would take robbie for sure if she knew that a clear lucid voice in krystals head was speaking to mr fairbrother who was the only adult who had ever talked to her the way she needed unlike mrs wall so wellintentioned and so blinkered and nana cath refusing to hear the whole truth i gotta get robbie out of here how can i get away i gotta get away her one sure refuge the little house in hope street was already being gobbled up by squabbling relatives she scurried around a corner underneath a street lamp looking over her shoulder in case he was watching her following and then the answer came to her as though mr fairbrother had shown her the way if she got knocked up by fats wall she would be able to get her own place from the council she would be able to take robbie to live with her and the baby if terri used again and obbo would never enter her house not ever there would be bolts and chains and locks on the door and her house would be clean always clean like nana caths house half running along the dark street krystals sobs slowed and subsided the walls would probably give her money they were like that she could imagine tessas plain concerned face bending over a cot krystal would have their grandchild she would lose fats in getting pregnant they always went once you were expecting she had watched it happen nearly every time in the fields but perhaps he would be interested he was so strange it did not much matter to her either way her interest in him except as the essential component in her plan had dwindled to almost nothing what she wanted was the baby the baby was more than a means to an end she liked babies she had always loved robbie she would keep the two of them safe together she would be like a better kinder younger nana cath to her family annemarie might come and visit once she was away from terri their children would be cousins a very vivid image of herself and annemarie came to krystal they were standing at the school gates of st thomass in pagford waving off two little girls in pale blue dresses and ankle socks the lights were on in nikkis house as they always were krystal broke into a run part four lunacy at common law idiots are subject to a permanent legal incapacity to vote but persons of unsound mind may vote during lucid intervals charles arnoldbaker local council administration seventh edition i samantha mollison had now bought herself all three of the dvds released by libbys favourite boy band she kept them hidden in her socks and tights drawer beside her diaphragm she had her story ready if miles spotted them they were a gift for libby sometimes at work where business was slower than ever she searched the internet for pictures of jake it was during one of these trawling sessions jake in a suit but with no shirt jake in jeans and a white vest that she discovered that the band was playing at wembley in a fortnights time she had a friend from university who lived in west ealing she could stay over sell it to libby as a treat a chance to spend time together with more genuine excitement than she had felt in a long time samantha managed to buy two very expensive tickets for the concert when she let herself into the house that evening she glowed with a delicious secret almost as though she were coming home from a date miles was already in the kitchen still in his work suit with the phone in his hand he stared at her as she entered and his expression was strange difficult to read what said samantha a little defensively i cant get hold of dad said miles his bloody phones engaged theres been another post and when samantha looked nonplussed he said with a trace of impatience barry fairbrothers ghost another message on the council website oh said samantha unwinding her scarf right yeah i met betty rossiter just now coming up the street she was full of it ive checked the message board but i cant see it mum mustve taken it down already well i bloody hope she has shell be in the firing line if bendsyourear goes to a lawyer about parminder jawanda was it asked samantha her tone deliberately casual she did not ask what the accusation had been first because she was determined not to be a nosy gossiping old bag like shirley and maureen and secondly because she thought she already knew that parminder had caused the death of old cath weedon after a moment or two she asked sounding vaguely amused did you say your mother might be in the firing line well shes the site administrator so shes liable if she doesnt get rid of defamatory or potentially defamatory statements im not sure she and dad understand how serious this could be you could defend your mother shed like that but miles had not heard he was pressing redial and scowling because his fathers mobile was still engaged this is getting serious he said you were all quite happy when it was simon price who was getting attacked whys this any different if its a campaign against anyone on the council or standing for council samantha turned away to hide her grin his concern was not about shirley after all but why would anyone write stuff about you she asked innocently you havent got any guilty secrets you might be more bloody interesting if you had what about that letter what letter for gods mum and dad said there was a letter an anonymous letter about me saying i wasnt fit to fill barry fairbrothers shoes samantha opened the freezer and stared at the unappetizing contents aware that miles could no longer see her expression with the door open you dont think anyones got anything on you do you she asked no but im a lawyer arent i there might be people with a grudge i dont think this kind of anonymous stuff i mean so far its all about the other side but there could be reprisals i dont like the way this things going well thats politics miles said samantha openly amused dirty business miles stalked out of the room but she did not care her thoughts had already returned to chiselled cheekbones winged eyebrows and taut tight abdominal muscles she could sing along with most of the songs now she would buy a band tshirt to wear and one for libby too jake would be undulating mere yards away from her it would be more fun than she had had in years howard meanwhile was pacing up and down the closed delicatessen with his mobile phone clamped to his ear the blinds were down the lights were on and through the archway in the wall shirley and maureen were busy in the soontobeopened café unpacking china and glasses talking in excited undertones and half listening to howards almost monosyllabic contributions to his conversation yes mm hmm yes screaming at me said shirley screaming and swearing take it bloody down she said i said im taking it down dr jawanda and ill thank you not to swear at me idve left it up there for another couple of hours if shed sworn at me said maureen shirley smiled as it happened she had chosen to go and make herself a cup of tea leaving the anonymous post about parminder up on the site for an extra fortyfive minutes before removing it she and maureen had already picked over the topic of the post until it was ragged and bare there was plenty of scope for further dissection but the immediate urge was sated instead shirley looked ahead greedily to parminders reaction to having her secret spilt in public it cant have been her who did that post about simon price after all said maureen no obviously not said shirley as she wiped over the pretty blue and white china that she had chosen overruling maureens preference for pink sometimes though not directly involved in the business shirley liked to remind maureen that she still had huge influence as howards wife yes said howard on the telephone but wouldnt it be better to mm hmm so who do you think it is asked maureen i really dont know said shirley in a genteel voice as though such knowledge or suspicions were beneath her someone who knows the prices and the jawandas said maureen obviously said shirley again howard hung up at last aubrey agrees he told the two women waddling through into the café he was clutching todays edition of the yarvil and district gazette very weak piece very weak indeed it took the two women several seconds to recollect that they were supposed to be interested in the posthumous article by barry fairbrother in the local newspaper his ghost was so much more interesting oh yes well i thought it was very poor when i read it said shirley hurriedly catching up the interview with krystal weedon was funny guffawed maureen making out she enjoyed art i suppose thats what she calls graffitiing the desks howard laughed as an excuse to turn her back shirley picked up andrew prices spare epipen from the counter which ruth had dropped into the delicatessen that morning shirley had looked up epipens on her favourite medical website and felt fully competent to explain how adrenalin worked nobody asked though so she put the small white tube away in the cupboard and closed the door as noisily as she could to try and disrupt maureens further witticisms the phone in howards huge hand rang yes hello oh miles yes yes we know all about it mum saw it this morning he laughed yes shes taken it down i dont know i think it was posted yesterday oh i wouldnt say that weve all known about bendsyourear for years but howards jocularity faded as miles talked after a while he said ah yes i see yes no i hadnt considered it from perhaps we should get someone to have a look at security the sound of a car in the darkening square outside went virtually unremarked by the three in the delicatessen but its driver noticed the enormous shadow of howard mollison moving behind the cream blinds gavin put his foot down eager to get to mary she had sounded desperate on the telephone whos doing this whos doing it who hates me this much nobody hates you he had said who could hate you stay there im coming over he parked outside the house slammed the door and hurried up the footpath she opened the front door before he had even knocked her eyes were puffy with tears again and she was wearing a floorlength woollen dressing gown that dwarfed her it was not at all seductive the very antithesis of kays scarlet kimono but its homeliness its very shabbiness represented a new level of intimacy marys four children were all in the sitting room mary gestured him through into the kitchen do they know he asked her fergus does somebody at school told him ive asked him not to tell the others honestly gavin im about at the end of my tether the spite it isnt true he said and then his curiosity getting the better of him is it no she said outraged i mean i dont know i dont really know her but to make him talk like that putting the words in his mouth dont they care what its like for me she dissolved into tears again he felt that he shouldnt hug her while she was wearing her dressing gown and was glad that he had not when eighteenyearold fergus entered the kitchen a moment later hey gav the boy looked tired older than his years gavin watched him put an arm around mary and saw her lean her head against his shoulder mopping her eyes on her baggy sleeve like a child i dont think it was the same person fergus told them without preamble ive been looking at it again the style of the message is different he had it on his mobile phone and began to read aloud parish councillor dr parminder jawanda who pretends to be so keen on looking after the poor and needy of the area has always had a secret motive until i died fergus dont said mary slumping down at the kitchen table i cant take it i honestly cant and his article in the paper today too as she covered her face with her hands and sobbed silently gavin noticed the yarvil and district gazette lying there he never read it without asking or offering he moved across to the cupboard to make her a drink thanks gav she said thickly when he pushed the glass into her hand it might be howard mollison suggested gavin sitting down beside her from what barry said about him i dont think so said mary dabbing at her eyes its so crude he never did anything like that when barry was she hiccuped alive and then she snapped at her son throw that paper away fergus the boy looked confused and hurt its got dads throw it away said mary with an edge of hysteria in her voice i can read it off the computer if i want to the last thing he ever did on our anniversary fergus took the newspaper off the table and stood for a moment watching his mother who had buried her face in her hands again then with a glance at gavin he walked out of the room still holding the gazette after a while when gavin judged that fergus was not coming back he put out a consoling hand and rubbed marys arm they sat in silence for some time and gavin felt much happier with the newspaper gone from the table ii parminder was not supposed to be working the next morning but she had a meeting in yarvil once the children had left for school she moved methodically around the house making sure that she had everything she needed but when the telephone rang she jumped so much that she dropped her bag yes she yelped sounding almost frightened tessa on the other end of the line was taken aback minda its me are you all right yes yes the phone made me jump said parminder looking at the kitchen floor now littered with keys papers loose change and tampons what is it nothing really said tessa just calling for a chat see how you are the subject of the anonymous post hung between them like some jeering monster dangling from the line parminder had barely allowed tessa to talk about it during yesterdays call she had shouted its a lie a filthy lie and dont tell me howard mollison didnt do it tessa had not dared pursue the subject i cant talk said parminder ive got a meeting in yarvil a case review for a little boy on the atrisk register oh right sorry maybe later yes said parminder great goodbye she scooped up the contents of her bag and hurried from the house running back from the garden gate to check that she had closed the front door properly every so often as she drove she realized that she had no recollection of travelling the last mile and told herself fiercely to concentrate but the malicious words of the anonymous post kept coming back to her she already knew them by heart parish councillor dr parminder jawanda who pretends to be so keen on looking after the poor and needy of the area has always had a secret motive until i died she was in love with me which she could barely hide whenever she laid eyes on me and she would vote however i told her to whenever there was a council meeting now that i am gone she will be useless as a councillor because she has lost her brain she had first seen it the previous morning when she opened up the council website to check the minutes of the last meeting the shock had been almost physical her breathing had become very fast and shallow as it had been during the most excruciating parts of childbirth when she had tried to lift herself over the pain to disengage from the agonizing present everyone would know by now there was nowhere to hide the oddest thoughts kept coming to her for instance what her grandmother would have said if she had known that parminder had been accused of loving another womans husband and a gora to boot in a public forum she could almost see bebe covering her face with a fold of her sari shaking her head rocking backwards and forwards as she had always done when a harsh blow had hit the family some husbands vikram had said to her late last night with a strange new twist to his sardonic smile might want to know whether it was true of course it isnt true parminder had said with her own shaking hand over her mouth how can you ask me that of course it isnt you knew him he was my friend just a friend she was already passing the bellchapel addiction clinic how had she travelled so far without realizing it she was becoming a dangerous driver she was not paying attention she remembered the evening that she and vikram had gone to the restaurant nearly twenty years ago the night they had agreed to marry she had told him about all the fuss the family had made when she had walked home with stephen hoyle and he had agreed how silly it was he had understood then but he did not understand when it was howard mollison who accused her instead of her own hidebound relatives apparently he did not realise that goras could be narrow and untruthful and full of malice she had missed the turning she must concentrate she must pay attention am i late she called as she hurried at last across the car park towards kay bawden she had met the social worker once before when she had come in for a renewal of her prescription for the pill not at all said kay i thought id show you up to the office because its a rabbit warren in here kay led her down a shabby deserted institutional corridor into a meeting room three more women were already sitting there they greeted parminder with smiles this is nina who works with robbies mother at bellchapel said kay sitting down with her back to the venetianblinded windows and this is my supervisor gillian and this is louise harper who oversees the anchor road nursery dr parminder jawanda robbies gp kay added parminder accepted coffee the other four women began talking without involving her parish councillor dr parminder jawanda who pretends to be so keen on looking after the poor and needy of the area who pretends to be so keen you bastard howard mollison but he had always seen her as a hypocrite barry had said so he thinks that because i came from the fields i want pagford overrun by yarvillians but youre proper professional class so he doesnt think youve got any right to be on the side of the fields he thinks youre a hypocrite or making trouble for fun understand why the familys registered with a gp in pagford said one of the three unfamiliar social workers whose names parminder had already forgotten several families in the fields are registered with us said parminder at once but wasnt there some trouble with the weedons and their previous yeah the cantermill practice threw them out said kay in front of whom sat a pile of notes thicker than either of her colleagues terri assaulted a nurse there so theyve been registered with you how long nearly five years said parminder who had looked up all the details at the surgery she had seen howard in church at barrys funeral pretending to pray with his big fat hands clasped in front of him and the fawleys kneeling beside him parminder knew what christians were supposed to believe in love thy neighbour as thyself if howard had been more honest he would have turned sideways and prayed to aubrey until i died she was in love with me which she could barely hide whenever she laid eyes on me had she really not been able to hide it last seen him parminder asked kay when his sister brought him in for antibiotics for an ear infection said parminder about eight weeks ago and how was his physical condition then asked one of the other women well hes not failing to thrive said parminder withdrawing a slim sheaf of photocopied notes from her handbag i checked him quite thoroughly because well i know the family history hes a good weight although i doubt his diets anything to write home about no lice or nits or anything of that description his bottom was a bit sore and i remember his sister said that he still wets himself sometimes they keep putting him back in nappies said kay but you wouldnt asked the woman who had first questioned parminder have any major concerns healthwise there was no sign of abuse said parminder i remember i took off his vest to check and there were no bruises or other injuries theres no man in the house interjected kay and this ear infection her supervisor prompted parminder you said it was the sister who brought him in not the mother are you terris doctor too i dont think weve seen terri for five years said parminder and the supervisor turned to nina instead hows she doing on methadone until i died she was in love with me parminder thought perhaps its shirley or maureen whos the ghost not howard they would be much more likely to watch her when she was with barry hoping to see something with their dirty oldwomanish minds longest shes lasted on the programme so far said nina shes mentioned the case review quite a lot i get the feeling she knows that this is it that shes running out of chances she doesnt want to lose robbie shes said that a few times id have to say youve got through to her kay i really do see her taking some responsibility for the situation for the first time since ive known her thank you but im not going to get overexcited the situations still pretty precarious kays dampening words were at odds with her tiny irrepressible smile of satisfaction how are things going at nursery louise well hes back again said the fourth social worker hes been in full attendance for the past three weeks which is a dramatic change the teenage sister brings him his clothes are too small and usually dirty but he talks about bath and meal times at home and behaviourally hes developmentally delayed his language skills are very poor he doesnt like men coming into the nursery when fathers turn up he wont go near them he hangs around the nursery workers and becomes very anxious and once or twice she said turning a page in her notes hes mimicked what are clearly sexual acts on or near little girls i dont think whatever we decide there can be any question of taking him off the atrisk register said kay to a murmur of agreement it sounds like everything hinges on terri staying on your programme said the supervisor to nina and staying off the game thats key certainly kay agreed but im concerned that even when shes heroinfree she doesnt provide much mothering to robbie krystal seems to be raising him and shes sixteen and got plenty of her own issues parminder remembered what she had said to sukhvinder a couple of nights previously krystal weedon that stupid girl is that what being in a team with krystal weedon taught you to sink to her level barry had liked krystal he had seen things in her that were invisible to other peoples eyes once long ago parminder had told barry the story of bhai kanhaiya the sikh hero who had administered to the needs of those wounded in combat whether friend or foe when asked why he gave aid indiscriminately bhai kanhaiya had replied that the light of god shone from every soul and that he had been unable to distinguish between them the light of god shone from every soul she had called krystal weedon stupid and implied that she was low barry would never have said it she was ashamed when there was a greatgrandmother who seemed to provide some backup in care but she died said parminder rushing to say it before anyone else could emphysema and stroke yeah said kay still looking at her notes so we go back to terri she came out of care herself has she ever attended parenting classes we offer them but shes never been in a fit state to attend said the woman from the nursery if she agreed to take them and actually turned up it would be a massive step forward said kay if they close us down sighed nina from bellchapel addressing parminder i suppose shell have to come to you for her methadone im concerned that she wouldnt said kay before parminder could answer what do you mean asked parminder angrily the other women stared at her just that catching buses and remembering appointments isnt terris forte said kay she only has to walk up the road to bellchapel oh said parminder mortified yes sorry yes youre probably right she had thought that kay was making a reference to the complaint about catherine weedons death that she did not think terri weedon would trust her concentrate on what theyre saying whats wrong with you so big picture said the supervisor looking down at her notes weve got neglectful parenting interspersed with some adequate care she sighed but there was more exasperation than sadness in the sound the immediate crisis is over shes stopped using robbies back in nursery where we can keep a proper eye on him and theres no immediate concern for his safety as kay says he stays on the atrisk register i certainly think well need another meeting in four weeks it was another forty minutes before the meeting broke up kay walked parminder back down to the car park it was very good of you to come in person most gps send through a report it was my morning off said parminder she meant it as an explanation for her attendance because she hated sitting at home alone with nothing to do but kay seemed to think that she was asking for more praise and gave it at parminders car kay said youre the parish councillor arent you did colin pass you the figures on bellchapel i gave him yes he did said parminder it would be good to have a talk about that some time its on the agenda for the next meeting but when kay had given her her number and left with renewed thanks parminders thoughts reverted to barry the ghost and the mollisons she was driving through the fields when the simple thought that she had tried to bury to drown out slipped past her lowered defences at last perhaps i did love him iii andrew had spent hours deciding which clothes he ought to wear for his first days work at the copper kettle his final choice was draped over the back of the chair in his bedroom a particularly angry acne pustule had chosen to bring itself to a shiny tight peak on his left cheek and andrew had gone so far as to experiment with ruths foundation which he had sneaked out of her dressingtable drawer he was laying the kitchen table on friday evening his mind full of gaia and the seven solid hours of close proximity to her that were within touching distance when his father returned from work in a state that andrew had never seen before simon seemed subdued almost disorientated wheres your mother ruth came bustling out of the walkin pantry hello sipie how whats wrong theyve made me redundant ruth clapped her hands to her face in horror then dashed to her husband threw her arms around his neck and drew him close why she whispered that message said simon on that fucking website they pulled in jim and tommy too it was take redundancy or well sack you and its a shitty deal its not even what they gave brian grant andrew stood perfectly still calcifying slowly into a monument of guilt fuck said simon into ruths shoulder youll get something else she whispered not round here said simon he sat down on a kitchen chair still in his coat and stared across the room apparently too stunned to speak ruth hovered around him dismayed affectionate and tearful andrew was glad to detect in simons catatonic gaze a whiff of his usual ham theatrics it made him feel slightly less guilty he continued to lay the table without saying a word dinner was a subdued affair paul apprised of the family news looked terrified as though his father might accuse him of causing it all simon acted like a christian martyr through the first course wounded but dignified in the face of unwarranted persecution but then ill pay someone to punch the fuckers fat face through the back of his neck he burst out as he spooned apple crumble into himself and the family knew that he meant howard mollison you know theres been another message on that council website said ruth breathlessly its not only you whos had it si shir somebody told me at work the same person the ghost of barry fairbrother has put up something horrible about dr jawanda so howard and shirley got someone in to look at the site and he realized that whoevers doing these messages has been using barry fairbrothers login details so to be safe theyve taken them off the the database or something and will any of this get me my fucking job back ruth did not speak again for several minutes andrew was unnerved by what his mother had said it was worrying that theghostofbarryfairbrother was being investigated and unnerving that somebody else had followed his lead who else would have thought of using barry fairbrothers login details but fats yet why would fats go for dr jawanda or was it just another way of getting at sukhvinder andrew did not like it at all whats the matter with you simon barked across the table nothing andrew muttered and then backtracking its a shock isnt it your job oh youre shocked are you shouted simon and paul dropped his spoon and dribbled ice cream down himself clean it up pauline you little pansy well this is the real world pizza face he shouted at andrew fuckers everywhere trying to do you down so you he pointed across the table at his eldest son you get some dirt on mollison or dont bother coming home tomorrow si simon pushed his chair away from the table threw down his own spoon which bounced onto the floor with a clatter and stalked from the room slamming the door behind him andrew waited for the inevitable and was not disappointed its a terrible shock for him a shaken ruth whispered at her sons after all the years hes given that company hes worried how hes going to look after us all when the alarm rang at six thirty the next morning andrew slammed it off within seconds and virtually leapt out of bed feeling as though it was christmas day he washed and dressed at speed then spent forty minutes on his hair and face dabbing minuscule amounts of foundation onto the most obvious of his spots he half expected simon to waylay him as he crept past his parents room but he met nobody and after a hasty breakfast he wheeled simons racing bicycle out of the garage and sped off down the hill towards pagford it was a misty morning that promised sunshine later the blinds were still down in the delicatessen but the door tinkled and gave when he pushed it not this way shouted howard waddling towards him you come in round the back you can leave the bike by the bins get it away from the front the rear of the delicatessen reached by a narrow passageway comprised a tiny dank patch of stonepaved yard bordered by high walls sheds with industrialsized metal bins and a trapdoor that led down vertiginous steps to a cellar you can chain it up somewhere there out of the way said howard who had appeared at the back door wheezing and sweatyfaced while andrew fumbled with the padlock on the chain howard dabbed at his forehead with his apron right well start with the cellar he said when andrew had secured the bicycle he pointed at the trapdoor get down there and see the layout he bent over the hatch as andrew climbed down the steps howard had not been able to climb down into his own cellar for years maureen usually tottered up and down the steps a couple of times a week but now that it was fully stocked with goods for the café younger legs were indispensible have a good look around he shouted at the outofsight andrew see where weve got the gateaux and all the baked goods see the big bags of coffee beans and the boxes of teabags and in the corner the toilet rolls and the bin bags yeah andrews voice echoed up from the depths you can call me mr mollison said howard with a slightly tart edge to his wheezy voice down in the cellar andrew wondered whether he ought to start straight away ok mr mollison it sounded sarcastic he hastened to make amends with a polite question whats in these big cupboards have a look said howard impatiently thats what youre down there for to know where you put everything and where you get it from howard listened to the muffled sounds of andrew opening the heavy doors and hoped that the boy would not prove gormless or need a lot of direction howards asthma was particularly bad today the pollen count was unseasonably high on top of all the extra work and the excitement and petty frustrations of the opening the way he was sweating he might need to ring shirley to bring him a new shirt before they unlocked the doors heres the van howard shouted hearing a rumble at the other end of the passageway get up here youre to carry the stuff down to the cellar and put it away all right and bring a couple of gallons of milk through to me in the café you got that yeah mr mollison said andrews voice from below howard walked slowly back inside to fetch the inhaler that he kept in his jacket which was hanging up in the staff room behind the delicatessen counter several deep breaths later he felt much better wiping his face on his apron again he sat down on one of the creaking chairs to rest several times since he had been to see her about his skin rash howard had thought about what dr jawanda had said about his weight that it was the source of all his health problems nonsense obviously look at the hubbards boy built like a beanpole and shocking asthma howard had always been big as far back as he could remember in the very few photographs taken of him with his father who had left the family when howard was four or five he was merely chubby after his father had left his mother had sat him at the head of the table between herself and his grandmother and been hurt if he did not take seconds steadily he had grown to fill the space between the two women as heavy at twelve as the father who had left them howard had come to associate a hearty appetite with manliness his bulk was one of his defining characteristics it had been built with pleasure by the women who loved him and he thought it was absolutely characteristic of bendsyourear that emasculating killjoy that she wanted to strip him of it but sometimes in moments of weakness when it became difficult to breathe or to move howard knew fear it was all very well for shirley to act as though he had never been in danger but he remembered long nights in the hospital after his bypass when he had not been able to sleep for worry that his heart might falter and stop whenever he caught sight of vikram jawanda he remembered that those long dark fingers had actually touched his naked beating heart the bonhomie with which he brimmed at each encounter was a way of driving out that primitive instinctive terror they had told him at the hospital afterwards that he needed to lose some weight but he had dropped two stone naturally while he was forced to live off their dreadful food and shirley had been intent on fattening him up again once he was out howard sat for a moment more enjoying the ease with which he breathed after using his inhaler today meant a great deal to him thirtyfive years previously he had introduced fine dining to pagford with the élan of a sixteenthcentury adventurer returning with delicacies from the other side of the world and pagford after initial wariness had soon begun to nose curiously and timidly into his polystyrene pots he thought wistfully of his late mother who had been so proud of him and his thriving business he wished that she could have seen the café howard heaved himself back to his feet took his deerstalker from its hook and placed it carefully on his head in an act of selfcoronation his new waitresses arrived together at halfpast eight he had a surprise for them here you are he said holding out the uniforms black dresses with frilly white aprons exactly as he had imagined ought to fit maureen reckoned she knew your sizes shes wearing one herself gaia forced back a laugh as maureen stalked into the delicatessen from the café smiling at them she was wearing dr scholls sandals over her black stockings her dress finished two inches above her wrinkled knees you can change in the staff room girls she said indicating the place from which howard had just emerged gaia was already pulling off her jeans beside the staff toilet when she saw sukhvinders expression whassamatter sooks she asked the new nickname gave sukhvinder the courage to say what she might otherwise have been unable to voice i cant wear this she whispered why asked gaia youll look ok but the black dress had short sleeves i cant but wh jesus said gaia sukhvinder had pulled back the sleeves of her sweatshirt her inner arms were covered in ugly crisscross scars and angry freshclotted cuts travelled up from her wrist to her inner arm sooks said gaia quietly what are you playing at mate sukhvinder shook her head with her eyes full of tears gaia thought for a moment then said i know come here she was stripping off her longsleeved tshirt the door suffered a big blow and the imperfectly closed bolt shot open a sweating andrew was halfway inside carrying two weighty packs of toilet rolls when gaias angry shout stopped him in his tracks he tripped out backwards into maureen theyre changing in there she said in sour disapproval mr mollison told me to put these in the staff bathroom holy shit holy shit she had been stripped to her bra and pants he had seen nearly everything sorry andrew yelled at the closed door his whole face was throbbing with the force of his blush wanker muttered gaia on the other side she was holding out her tshirt to sukhvinder put it on underneath the dress thatll look weird never mind you can get a black one for next week itll look like youre wearing long sleeves well tell him some story shes got eczema gaia announced when she and sukhvinder emerged from the staff room fully dressed and aproned all up her arms its a bit scabby ah said howard glancing at sukhvinders white tshirted arms and then back at gaia who looked every bit as gorgeous as he had hoped ill get a black one for next week said sukhvinder unable to look howard in the eye fine he said patting gaia in the small of her back as he sent the pair of them through to the café brace yourselves he called to his staff at large were nearly there doors open please maureen there was already a little knot of customers waiting on the pavement a sign outside read the copper kettle opening today first coffee free andrew did not see gaia again for hours howard kept him busy heaving milk and fruit juices up and down the steep cellar steps and swabbing the floor of the small kitchen area at the back he was given a lunch break earlier than either of the waitresses the next glimpse he got of her was when howard summoned him to the counter of the café and they passed within inches of each other as she walked in the other direction towards the back room were swamped mr price said howard in high good humour get yourself a clean apron and mop down some of these tables for me while gaia has her lunch miles and samantha mollison had sat down with their two daughters and shirley at a table in the window it seems to be going awfully well doesnt it shirley said looking around but what on earth is that jawanda girl wearing under her dress bandages suggested miles squinting across the room hi sukhvinder called lexie who knew her from primary school dont shout darling shirley reproved her granddaughter and samantha bristled maureen emerged from behind the counter in her short black dress and frilly apron and shirley corpsed into her coffee oh dear she said quietly as maureen walked towards them beaming it was true samantha thought maureen looked ridiculous especially next to a pair of sixteenyearolds in identical dresses but she was not going to give shirley the satisfaction of agreeing with her she turned ostentatiously away watching the boy mopping tables nearby he was spare but reasonably broadshouldered she could see his muscles working under the loose tshirt incredible to think that miles big fat backside could ever have been that small and tight then the boy turned into the light and she saw his acne not half bad is it maureen was croaking to miles weve been full all day all right girls miles addressed his family whatll we have to keep up grandpas profits samantha listlessly ordered a bowl of soup as howard waddled through from the delicatessen he had been striding in and out of the café every ten minutes all day greeting customers and checking the flow of cash into the till roaring success he told miles squeezing in at their table what dyou think of the place sammy you havent seen it before have you like the mural like the china mm said samantha lovely i was thinking about having my sixtyfifth here said howard absentmindedly scratching at the itch parminders creams had not yet cured but its not big enough i think well stick with the church hall whens that grandpa piped up lexie am i coming twentyninth and what are you now sixteen course you can come said howard happily the twentyninth said samantha oh but shirley looked at her sharply howards been planning this for months weve all been talking about it for ages thats the night of libbys concert said samantha a school thing is it asked howard no said libby mums got me tickets for my favourite group its in london and im going with her said samantha she cant go alone harriets mum says she could im taking you libby if youre going to london the twentyninth said miles looking hard at samantha the day after the election samantha let loose the derisive laugh that she had spared maureen its the parish council miles its not as though youll be giving press conferences well well miss you sammy said howard as he hauled himself up with the aid of the back of her chair best get on all right andrew youre done here go and see if we need anything up from the cellar andrew was forced to wait beside the counter while people passed to and from the bathroom maureen was loading up sukhvinder with plates of sandwiches hows your mother she asked the girl abruptly as though the thought had just occurred to her fine said sukhvinder her colour rising not too upset by that nasty business on the council website no said sukhvinder her eyes watering andrew proceeded out into the dank yard which in the early afternoon had become warm and sunny he had hoped that gaia might be there taking a breath of fresh air but she must have gone into the staff room in the deli disappointed he lit up a cigarette he had barely inhaled when gaia emerged from the café finishing her lunch with a can of fizzy drink hi said andrew his mouth dry hi she said then after a moment or two hey whys that friend of yours such a shit to sukhvinder is it personal or is he racist he isnt racist said andrew he removed the cigarette from his mouth trying to keep his hands from trembling but could not think of anything else to say the sunshine reflected off the bins warmed his sweaty back close proximity to her in the tight black dress was almost overwhelming especially now that he had glimpsed what lay beneath he took another drag of the cigarette not knowing when he had felt so bedazzled or so alive whats she ever done to him though the curve of her hips to her tiny waist the perfection of her wide flecked eyes over the can of sprite andrew felt like saying nothing hes a bastard ill hit him if you let me touch you sukhvinder emerged into the yard blinking in the sunlight she looked uncomfortable and hot in gaias top he wants you back in she said to gaia he can wait said gaia coolly im finishing this ive only had forty minutes andrew and sukhvinder contemplated her as she sipped her drink awed by her arrogance and her beauty was that old bitch saying something to you just then about your mum gaia asked sukhvinder sukhvinder nodded i think it mightve been his mate she said staring at andrew again and he found her emphasis on his positively erotic even if she meant it to be derogatory who put that message about your mum on that website cantve been said andrew and his voice wobbled slightly whoever did it went after my old man too couple of weeks ago what asked gaia the same person posted something about your dad he nodded relishing her interest something about stealing wasnt it asked sukhvinder with considerable daring yeah said andrew and he got the sack for it yesterday so her mum he met gaias blinding gaze almost steadily isnt the only one whos suffered bloody hell said gaia upending the can and throwing it into a bin people round here are effing mental iv the post about parminder on the council website had driven colin walls fears to a nightmarish new level he could only guess how the mollisons were getting their information but if they knew that about parminder for gods sake colin tessa had said its just malicious gossip theres nothing in it but colin did not dare believe her he was constitutionally prone to believing that others too lived with secrets that drove them halfdemented he could not even take comfort in knowing that he had spent most of his adult life in dread of calamities that had not materialized because by the law of averages one of them was bound to come true one day he was thinking about his imminent exposure as he thought about it constantly while walking back from the butchers at halfpast two and it was not until the hubbub from the new café caught his startled attention that he realized where he was he would have crossed to the other side of the square if he had not been already level with the copper kettles windows mere proximity to any mollison frightened him now then he saw something through the glass that made him do a doubletake when he entered their kitchen ten minutes later tessa was on the telephone to her sister colin deposited the leg of lamb in the fridge and marched upstairs all the way to fats loft conversion flinging open the door he saw as he had expected a deserted room he could not remember the last time he had been in here the floor was covered in dirty clothes there was an odd smell even though fats had left the skylight propped open colin noticed a large matchbox on fats desk he slid it open and saw a mass of twisted cardboard stubs a packet of rizlas lay brazenly on the desk beside the computer colins heart seemed to have toppled down out of his chest to thump against his guts colin came tessas voice from the landing below where are you up here he roared she appeared at fats door looking frightened and anxious wordlessly he picked up the matchbox and showed her the contents oh said tessa weakly he said he was going out with andrew price today said colin tessa was frightened by the muscle working in colins jaw an angry little bump moving from side to side ive just been past that new café in the square and andrew price is working in there mopping tables so wheres stuart for weeks tessa had been pretending to believe fats whenever he said that he was going out with andrew for days she had been telling herself that sukhvinder must be mistaken in thinking that fats was going out would condescend ever to go out with krystal weedon i dont know she said come down and have a cup of tea ill ring him i think ill wait here said colin and he sat down on fats unmade bed come on colin come downstairs said tessa she was scared of leaving him here she did not know what he might find in the drawers or in fats school bag she did not want him to look on the computer or under the bed refusing to probe dark corners had become her sole modus operandi come downstairs col she urged him no said colin and he crossed his arms like a mutinous child but with that muscle working in his jaw drugs in his bin the son of the deputy headmaster tessa who had sat down on fats computer chair felt a familiar thrill of anger she knew that selfpreoccupation was an inevitable consequence of his illness but sometimes plenty of teenagers experiment she said still defending him are you doesnt it ever occur to you that its your constant excuses for him that make him think he can get away with blue murder she was trying to keep a curb on her temper because she must be a buffer between them im sorry colin but you and your job arent the be all and end i see so if i get the sack why on earth would you get the sack for gods sake shouted colin outraged it all reflects on me its already bad enough hes already one of the biggest problem students in the thats not true shouted tessa nobody but you thinks stuarts anything other than a normal teenager hes not dane tully hes going the same way as tully drugs in his bin i told you we should have sent him to paxton high i knew youd make everything he did all about you if he went to winterdown is it any wonder he rebels when his every movement is supposed to be a credit to you i never wanted him to go to your school and i bellowed colin jumping to his feet never bloody wanted him at all dont say that gasped tessa i know youre angry but dont say that the front door slammed two floors below them tessa looked around frightened as though fats might materialize instantly beside them it wasnt merely the noise that had made her start stuart never slammed the front door he usually slipped in and out like a shapeshifter his familiar tread on the stairs did he know or suspect they were in his room colin was waiting with his fists clenched by his sides tessa heard the creak of the halfway step and then fats stood before them she was sure he had arranged his expression in advance a mixture of boredom and disdain afternoon he said looking from his mother to his rigid tense father he had all the selfpossession that colin had never had this is a surprise desperate tessa tried to show him the way dad was worried about where you are she said with a plea in her voice you said you were going to be with arf today but dad saw yeah change of plan said fats he glanced towards the place where the matchbox had been so do you want to tell us where youve been asked colin there were white patches around his mouth yeah if you like said fats and he waited stu said tessa half whisper half groan ive been out with krystal weedon said fats oh god no thought tessa no no no youve what said colin so taken aback that he forgot to sound aggressive ive been out with krystal weedon fats repeated a little more loudly and since when said colin after an infinitesimal pause has she been a friend of yours a while said fats tessa could see colin struggling to formulate a question too grotesque to utter you should have told us stu she said told you what he said she was frightened that he was going to push the argument to a dangerous place where you were going she said standing up and trying to look matter of fact next time call us she looked towards colin in the hope that he might follow her lead and move towards the door he remained fixed in the middle of the room staring at fats in horror are you involved with krystal weedon colin asked they faced each other colin taller by a few inches but fats holding all the power involved fats repeated what dyou mean involved you know what i mean said colin his face growing red dyou mean am i shagging her asked fats tessas little cry of stu was drowned by colin shouting how bloody dare you fats merely looked at colin smirking everything about him was a taunt and a challenge what said fats are you colin was struggling to find the words growing redder all the time are you sleeping with krystal weedon it wouldnt be a problem if i was would it fats asked and he glanced at his mother as he said it youre all for helping krystal arent you helping arent you trying to keep that addiction clinic open so you can help krystals family whats that got to do i cant see what the problem is with me going out with her and are you going out with her asked tessa sharply if fats wanted to take the row into this territory she would meet him there do you actually go anywhere with her stuart his smirk sickened her he was not prepared even to pretend to some decency well we dont do it in either of our houses do colin had raised one of his stiff clenchfisted arms and swung it he connected with fats cheek and fats whose attention had been on his mother was caught off guard he staggered sideways hit the desk and slid momentarily to the floor a moment later he had jumped to his feet again but tessa had already placed herself between the pair of them facing her son behind her colin was repeating you little bastard you little bastard yeah said fats and he was no longer smirking id rather be a little bastard than be you you arsehole no shouted tessa colin get out get out horrified furious and shaken colin lingered for a moment then marched from the room they heard him stumble a little on the stairs how could you tessa whispered to her son how could i fucking what said stuart and the look on his face alarmed her so much that she hurried to close and bar the bedroom door youre taking advantage of that girl stuart and you know it and the way you just spoke to your the fuck i am said fats pacing up and down every semblance of cool gone the fuck im taking advantage of her she knows exactly what she wants just because she lives in the fucking fields it doesnt the truth is you and cubby dont want me to shag her because you think shes beneath thats not true said tessa even though it was and for all her concern about krystal she would still have been glad to know that fats had sense enough to wear a condom youre fucking hypocrites you and cubby he said still pacing the length of the bedroom all the bollocks the pair of you spout about wanting to help the weedons but you dont want thats enough shouted tessa dont you dare speak to me like that dont you realise dont you understand are you so damn selfish words failed her she turned tugged open his door and was gone slamming it behind her her exit had an odd effect on fats who stopped pacing and stared at the closed door for several seconds then he searched his pockets drew out a cigarette and lit it not bothering to blow the smoke out of the skylight round and round his room he walked and he had no control of his own thoughts jerky unedited images filled his brain sweeping past on a tide of fury he remembered the friday evening nearly a year previously when tessa had come up here to his bedroom to tell him that his father wanted to take him out to play football with barry and his sons next day what fats had been staggered the suggestion was unprecedented for fun a kickaround tessa had said avoiding fats glare by scowling down at the clothes littering the floor why because dad thought it might be nice said tessa bending to pick up a school shirt declan wants a practice or something hes got a match fats was quite good at football people found it surprising they expected him to dislike sport to disdain teams he played as he talked skilfully with many a feint fooling the clumsy daring to take chances unconcerned if they did not come off i didnt even know he could play dad can play very well he was playing twice a week when we met said tessa riled ten oclock tomorrow morning all right ill wash your tracksuit bottoms fats sucked on his cigarette remembering against his will why had he gone along with it today he would have simply refused to participate in cubbys little charade but remained in bed until the shouting died away a year ago he had not yet understood about authenticity instead he had left the house with cubby and endured a silent fiveminute walk each equally aware of the enormous shortfall that filled all the space between them the playing field belonged to st thomass it had been sunny and deserted they had divided into two teams of three because declan had a friend staying for the weekend the friend who clearly heroworshipped fats had joined fats and cubbys team fats and cubby passed to each other in silence while barry easily the worst player had yelled cajoled and cheered in his yarvil accent as he tore up and down the pitch they had marked out with sweatshirts when fergus scored barry had run at him for a flying chest bump mistimed it and smashed fergus on the jaw with the top of his head the two of them had fallen to the ground fergus groaning in pain and laughing while barry sat apologizing through his roars of mirth fats had found himself grinning then heard cubbys awkward booming laugh and turned away scowling and then had come that moment that cringeworthy pitiful moment with the scores equal and nearly time to go when fats had successfully wrested the ball from fergus and cubby had shouted come on stu lad lad cubby had never said lad in his life it sounded pitiful hollow and unnatural he was trying to be like barry imitating barrys easy unselfconscious encouragement of his sons trying to impress barry the ball had flown like a cannon ball from fats foot and there was time before it hit cubby full in his unsuspecting foolish face before his glasses cracked and a single drop of blood bloomed beneath his eye to realize his own intent to know that he had hoped to hit cubby and that the ball had been dispatched for retribution they had never played football again the doomed little experiment in fatherson togetherness had been shelved like a dozen before it and i never wanted him at all he was sure he had heard it cubby must have been talking about him they had been in his room who else could cubby have been talking about like i give a shit thought fats it was what hed always suspected he did not know why this sensation of spreading cold had filled his chest fats pulled the computer chair back into position from the place where it had been knocked when cubby had hit him the authentic reaction would have been to shove his mother out of the way and punch cubby in the face crack his glasses again make him bleed fats was disgusted with himself that he had not done it but there were other ways he had overheard things for years he knew much more about his fathers ludicrous fears than they thought fats fingers were clumsier than usual ash spilt onto the keyboard from the cigarette in his mouth as he brought up the parish council website weeks previously he had looked up sql injections and found the line of code that andrew had refused to share after studying the council message board for a few minutes he logged himself in without difficulty as betty rossiter changed her username to theghostofbarryfairbrother and began to type v shirley mollison was convinced that her husband and son were overstating the danger to the council of leaving the ghosts posts online she could not see how the messages were worse than gossip and that she knew was not yet punishable by law nor did she believe that the law would be foolish and unreasonable enough to punish her for what somebody else had written that would be monstrously unfair proud as she was of miles law degree she was sure that he must have this bit wrong she was checking the message boards even more frequently than miles and howard had advised but not because she was afraid of legal consequences certain as she was that barry fairbrothers ghost had not yet finished his selfappointed task of crushing the profielders she was eager to be the first to set eyes on his next post several times a day she scurried into patricias old room and clicked on the web page sometimes a little frisson would run through her while she was hoovering or peeling potatoes and she would race to the study only to be disappointed again shirley felt a special secret kinship with the ghost he had chosen her website as the forum where he would expose the hypocrisy of howards opponents and this she felt entitled her to the pride of the naturalist who has constructed a habitat in which a rare species deigns to nest but there was more to it than that shirley relished the ghosts anger his savagery and his audacity she wondered who he might be visualizing a strong shadowy man standing behind herself and howard on their side cutting a path for them through the opponents who crumpled as he slayed them with their own ugly truths somehow none of the men in pagford seemed worthy to be the ghost she would have felt disappointed to learn that it was any of the antifielders she knew thats if its a man said maureen good point said howard i think its a man said shirley coolly when howard left for the café on sunday morning shirley still in her dressing gown and holding her cup of tea padded automatically to the study and brought up the website fantasies of a deputy headmaster posted by theghostofbarryfairbrother she set down her tea with trembling hands clicked on the post and read it openmouthed then she ran to the lounge seized the telephone and called the café but the number was engaged a mere five minutes later parminder jawanda who had also developed a habit of looking at the council message boards much more frequently than usual opened up the site and saw the post like shirley her immediate reaction was to seize a telephone the walls were breakfasting without their son who was still asleep upstairs when tessa picked up parminder cut across her friends greeting theres a post about colin on the council website dont let him see it whatever you do tessas frightened eyes swivelled to her husband but he was a mere three feet from the receiver and had already heard every word that parminder had spoken so loudly and clearly ill call you back said tessa urgently colin she said fumbling to replace the receiver colin wait but he had already stalked out of the room bobbing up and down his arms stiff by his side and tessa had to jog to catch him up perhaps its better not to look she urged him as his big knobbleknuckled hand moved the mouse across the desk or i can read it and fantasies of a deputy headmaster one of the men hoping to represent the community at parish council level is colin wall deputy headmaster at winterdown comprehensive school voters might be interested to know that wall a strict disciplinarian has a very unusual fantasy life mr wall is so frightened that a pupil might accuse him of inappropriate sexual behaviour that he has often needed time off work to calm himself down again whether mr wall has actually fondled a first year the ghost can only guess the fervour of his feverish fantasies suggests that even if he hasnt he would like to stuart wrote that thought tessa at once colins face was ghastly in the light pouring out of the monitor it was how she imagined he would look if he had had a stroke colin i suppose fiona shawcross has told people he whispered the catastrophe he had always feared was upon him it was the end of everything he had always imagined taking sleeping tablets he wondered whether they had enough in the house tessa who had been momentarily thrown by the mention of the headmistress said fiona wouldnt anyway she doesnt know she knows ive got ocd yes but she doesnt know what you what youre afraid of she does said colin i told her before the last time i needed sick leave why tessa burst out what on earth did you tell her for i wanted to explain why it was so important i had time off said colin almost humbly i thought she needed to know how serious it was tessa fought down a powerful desire to shout at him the tinge of distaste with which fiona treated him and talked about him was explained tessa had never liked her always thought her hard and unsympathetic be that as it may she said i dont think fionas got anything to do not directly said colin pressing a trembling hand to his sweating upper lip but mollisons heard gossip from somewhere it wasnt mollison stuart wrote that i know he did tessa recognized her son in every line she was even astonished that colin could not see it that he had not connected the message with yesterdays row with hitting his son he couldnt even resist a bit of alliteration he must have done all of them simon price parminder tessa was horrorstruck but colin was not thinking about stuart he was recalling thoughts that were as vivid as memories as sensory impressions violent vile ideas a hand seizing and squeezing as he passed through densely packed young bodies a cry of pain a childs face contorted and then asking himself again and again had he done it had he enjoyed it he could not remember he only knew that he kept thinking about it seeing it happen feeling it happen soft flesh through a thin cotton blouse seize squeeze pain and shock a violation how many times he did not know he had spent hours wondering how many of the children knew he did it whether they had spoken to each other how long it would be until he was exposed not knowing how many times he had offended and unable to trust himself he burdened himself with so many papers and files that he had no hands free to attack as he moved through the corridors he shouted at the swarming children to get out of the way to stand clear as he passed none of it helped there were always stragglers running past him up against him and with his hands burdened he imagined other ways to have improper contact with them a swiftly repositioned elbow brushing against a breast a sidestep to ensure bodily contact a leg accidentally entangled so that the childs groin made contact with his flesh colin said tessa but he had started to cry again great sobs shaking his big ungainly body and when she put her arms around him and pressed her face to his her own tears wet his skin a few miles away in hilltop house simon price was sitting at a brandnew family computer in the sitting room watching andrew cycle away to his weekend job with howard mollison and the reflection that he had been forced to pay full market price for this computer made him feel irritable and additionally hard done by simon had not looked at the parish council website once since the night that he had thrown out the stolen pc but it occurred to him by an association of ideas to check whether the message that had cost him his job was still on the site and thus viewable by potential employers it was not simon did not know that he owed this to his wife because ruth was scared of admitting that she had telephoned shirley even to request the removal of the post slightly cheered by its absence simon looked for the post about parminder but that was gone too he was about to close the site when he saw the newest post which was entitled fantasies of a deputy headmaster he read it through twice and then alone in the sitting room he began to laugh it was a savage triumphant laugh he had never taken to that big bobbing man with his massive forehead it was good to know that he simon had got off very lightly indeed by comparison ruth came into the room smiling timidly she was glad to hear simon laughing because he had been in a dreadful mood since losing his job whats funny you know fats old man wall the deputy headmaster hes only a bloody paedo ruths smile slipped she hurried forward to read the post im going to shower said simon in high good humour ruth waited until he had left the room before trying to call her friend shirley and alert her to this new scandal but the mollisons telephone was engaged shirley had at last reached howard at the delicatessen she was still in her dressing gown he was pacing up and down the little back room behind the counter been trying to get you for ages mo was using the phone what did it say slowly shirley read the message about colin enunciating like a newsreader she had not reached the end when he cut across her did you copy this down or something sorry she said are you reading it off the screen is it still on there have you taken it off im dealing with it now lied shirley unnerved i thought youd like to get it off there now god above shirley this is getting out of hand we cant have stuff like that on there i just thought you ought to make sure youve got rid of it and well talk about it when i get home howard shouted shirley was furious they never raised their voices to each other vi the next parish council meeting the first since barry had died would be crucial in the ongoing battle over the fields howard had refused to postpone the votes on the future of bellchapel addiction clinic or the towns wish to transfer jurisdiction of the estate to yarvil parminder therefore suggested that she colin and kay ought to meet up the evening before the meeting to discuss strategy pagford cant unilaterally decide to alter the parish boundary can it asked kay no said parminder patiently kay could not help being a newcomer but the district council has asked for pagfords opinion and howards determined to make sure its his opinion that gets passed on they were holding their meeting in the walls sitting room because tessa had put subtle pressure on colin to invite the other two where she could listen in tessa handed around glasses of wine put a large bowl of crisps on the coffee table then sat back in silence while the other three talked she was exhausted and angry the anonymous post about colin had brought on one of his most debilitating attacks of acute anxiety so severe that he had been unable to go to school parminder knew how ill he was she had signed him off work yet she invited him to participate in this premeeting not caring it seemed what fresh effusions of paranoia and distress tessa would have to deal with tonight theres definitely resentment out there about the way the mollisons are handling things colin was saying in the lofty knowledgeable tone he sometimes adopted when pretending to be a stranger to fear and paranoia i think its starting to get up peoples noses the way they think that they can speak for the town ive got that impression you know while ive been canvassing it would have been nice thought tessa bitterly if colin could have summoned these powers of dissimulation for her benefit occasionally once long ago she had liked being colins sole confidante the only repository of his terrors and the font of all reassurance but she no longer found it flattering he had kept her awake from two oclock until halfpast three that morning rocking backwards and forwards on the edge of the bed moaning and crying saying that he wished he were dead that he could not take it that he wished he had never stood for the seat that he was ruined tessa heard fats on the stairs and tensed but her son passed the open door on his way to the kitchen with nothing worse than a scathing glance at colin who was perched in front of the fire on a leather pouffe his knees level with his chest maybe miles standing for the empty seat will really antagonize people even the mollisons natural supporters said kay hopefully i think it might said colin nodding kay turned to parminder dyou think the council will really vote to force bellchapel out of their building i know people get uptight about discarded needles and addicts hanging around the neighbourhood but the clinics miles away why does pagford care howard and aubrey are scratching each others backs explained parminder whose face was taut with dark brown patches under her eyes it was she who would have to attend the council meeting the next day and fight howard mollison and his cronies without barry by her side they need to make cuts in spending at district level if howard turfs the clinic out of its cheap building itll be much more expensive to run and fawley can say the costs have increased and justify cutting council funding then fawley will do his best to make sure that the fields get reassigned to yarvil tired of explaining parminder pretended to examine the new stack of papers about bellchapel that kay had brought with her easing herself out of the conversation why am i doing this she asked herself she could have been sitting at home with vikram who had been watching comedy on television with jaswant and rajpal as she left the sound of their laughter had jarred on her when had she last laughed why was she here drinking nasty warm wine fighting for a clinic that she would never need and a housing development inhabited by people she would probably dislike if she met them she was not bhai kanhaiya who could not see a difference between the souls of allies and enemies she saw no light of god shining from howard mollison she derived more pleasure from the thought of howard losing than from the thought of fields children continuing to attend st thomass or from fields people being able to break their addictions at bellchapel although in a distant and dispassionate way she thought that these were good things but she knew why she was doing it really she wanted to win for barry he had told her all about coming to st thomass his classmates had invited him home to play he who had been living in a caravan with his mother and two brothers had relished the neat and comfortable houses of hope street and been awed by the big victorian houses on church row he had even attended a birthday party in that very cowfaced house that he had subsequently bought and where he had raised his four children he had fallen in love with pagford with the river and the fields and the solidwalled houses he had fantasized about having a garden to play in a tree from which to hang a swing space and greenness everywhere he had collected conkers and taken them back to the fields after shining at st thomass top of his class barry had gone on to be the first in his family to go to university love and hate parminder thought a little frightened by her own honesty love and hate thats why im here she turned over a page of kays documents feigning concentration kay was pleased that the doctor was scrutinizing her papers so carefully because she had put a lot of time and thought into them she could not believe that anybody reading her material would not be convinced that the bellchapel clinic ought to remain in situ but through all the statistics the anonymous case studies and firstperson testimonies kay really thought of the clinic in terms of only one patient terri weedon there had been a change in terri kay could feel it and it made her both proud and frightened terri was showing faint glimmerings of an awakened sense of control over her life twice lately terri had said to kay they ain takin robbie i won lerrem and these had not been impotent railings against fate but statements of intent i took im ter nursery yestday she told kay who had made the mistake of looking astonished whys tha so fuckin shockin aren i good enough ter go ter the fuckin nursry if bellchapels door was slammed shut against terri kay was sure it would blow to pieces that delicate structure they were trying to build out of the wreckage of a life terri seemed to have a visceral fear of pagford that kay did not understand i ate that fuckin place she had said when kay had mentioned it in passing beyond the fact that her dead grandmother had lived there kay knew nothing of terris history with the town but she was afraid that if terri was asked to travel there weekly for her methadone her selfcontrol would crumble and with it the familys fragile new safety colin had taken over from parminder explaining the history of the fields kay nodded bored and said mm but her thoughts were a long way away colin was deeply flattered by the way this attractive young woman was hanging on his every word he felt calmer tonight than at any point since he had read that awful post which was gone from the website none of the cataclysms that colin had imagined in the small hours had come to pass he was not sacked there was no angry mob outside his front door nobody on the pagford council website or indeed anywhere else on the internet he had performed several google searches was demanding his arrest or incarceration fats walked back past the open door spooning yoghurt into his mouth as he went he glanced into the room and for a fleeting moment met colins gaze colin immediately lost the thread of what he had been saying and yes well thats it in a nutshell he finished lamely he glanced towards tessa for reassurance but his wife was staring stonily into space colin was a little hurt he would have thought that tessa would be glad to see him feeling so much better so much more in control after their wretched sleepless night dreadful swooping sensations of dread were agitating his stomach but he drew much comfort from the proximity of his fellow underdog and scapegoat parminder and from the sympathetic attention of the attractive social worker unlike kay tessa had listened to every word that colin had just said about the fields right to remain joined to pagford there was in her opinion no conviction behind his words he wanted to believe what barry had believed and he wanted to defeat the mollisons because that was what barry had wanted colin did not like krystal weedon but barry had liked her so he assumed that there was more worth in her than he could see tessa knew her husband to be a strange mixture of arrogance and humility of unshakeable conviction and insecurity theyre completely deluded tessa thought looking at the other three who were poring over some graph that parminder had extracted from kays notes they think theyll reverse sixty years of anger and resentment with a few sheets of statistics none of them was barry he had been a living example of what they proposed in theory the advancement through education from poverty to affluence from powerlessness and dependency to valuable contributor to society did they not see what hopeless advocates they were compared to the man who had died people are definitely getting irritable with the mollisons trying to run everything colin was saying i do think said kay that theyll be hardpushed if they read this stuff to pretend that the clinic isnt doing crucial work not everybodys forgotten barry on the council said parminder in a slightly shaky voice tessa realized that her greasy fingers were groping vainly in space while the others had talked she had singlehandedly finished the entire bowl of crisps vii it was a bright balmy morning and the computing lab at winterdown comprehensive became stuffy as lunchtime approached the dirty windows speckling the dusty monitors with distracting spots of light even though there was no fats or gaia here to distract him andrew price could not concentrate he could think of nothing but what he had overheard his parents discussing the previous evening they had been talking quite seriously about moving to reading where ruths sister and brotherinlaw lived with his ear turned towards the open kitchen door andrew had hovered in the tiny dark hall and listened simon it appeared had been offered a job or the possibility of a job by the uncle whom andrew and paul barely knew because simon disliked him so much its less money simon had said you dont know that he hasnt said bound to be and itll be more expensive all round living there ruth made a noncommital noise scarcely daring to breathe in the hall andrew could tell by the mere fact that his mother was not rushing to agree with simon that she wanted to go andrew found it impossible to imagine his parents in any house but hilltop house or against any backdrop but pagford he had taken it for granted that they would remain there for ever he andrew would leave one day for london but simon and ruth would remain rooted to the hillside like trees until they died he had crept back upstairs to his bedroom and stared out of the window at the twinkling lights of pagford cupped in the deep black hollow between the hills he felt as though he had never seen the view before somewhere down there fats was smoking in his attic room probably looking at porn on his computer gaia was there too absorbed in the mysterious rites of her gender it occurred to andrew that she had been through this she had been torn away from the place she knew and transplanted they had something profoundly in common at last there was almost melancholy pleasure in the idea that in leaving he would share something with her but she had not caused her own displacement with a squirming unease in his guts he had picked up his mobile and texted fats sipie offered job in reading might take it fats had still not responded and andrew had not seen him all morning because they shared none of their classes he had not seen fats for the previous two weekends either because he had been working at the copper kettle their longest conversation recently had concerned fats posting about cubby on the council website i think tessa suspects fats had told andrew casually she keeps looking at me like she knows whatre you gonna say andrew had muttered scared he knew fats desire for glory and credit and he knew fats passion for wielding the truth as a weapon but he was not sure that his friend understood that his own pivotal role in the activities of the ghost of barry fairbrother must never be revealed it had never been easy to explain to fats the reality of having simon as a father and somehow fats was becoming more difficult to explain things to when his it teacher had passed by out of sight andrew looked up reading on the internet it was huge compared with pagford it had an annual music festival it was only forty miles from london he contemplated the train service perhaps he would go up to the capital at weekends the way he currently took the bus to yarvil but the whole thing seemed unreal pagford was all he had ever known he still could not imagine his family existing anywhere else at lunchtime andrew headed straight out of school looking for fats he lit up a cigarette just out of sight of the grounds and was delighted to hear as he was slipping his lighter casually back into his pocket a female voice that said hey gaia and sukhvinder caught up with him all right he said blowing smoke away from gaias beautiful face the three of them had something these days that nobody else had two weekends work at the café had created a fragile bond between them they knew howards stock phrases and had endured maureens prurient interest in all of their home lives they had smirked together at her wrinkled knees in the tooshort waitresss dress and had exchanged like traders in a foreign land small nuggets of personal information thus the girls knew that andrews father had been sacked andrew and sukhvinder knew that gaia was working to save for a train ticket back to hackney and he and gaia knew that sukhvinders mother hated her working for howard mollison wheres your fat friend she asked as the three of them fell into step together dunno said andrew havent seen him no loss said gaia how many of those do you smoke a day dont count said andrew elated by her interest dyou want one no said gaia i dont like smoking he wondered instantly whether the dislike extended to kissing people who smoked niamh fairbrother had not complained when he had stuck his tongue into her mouth at the school disco doesnt marco smoke asked sukhvinder no hes always in training said gaia andrew had become almost inured to the thought of marco de luca by now there were advantages to gaia being safeguarded as it were by an allegiance beyond pagford the power of the photographs of them together on her facebook page had been blunted by his familiarity with them he did not think it was his own wishful thinking that the messages she and marco left for each other were becoming less frequent and less friendly he could not know what was happening by telephone or email but he was sure that gaias air when he was mentioned was dispirited oh there he is said gaia it was not the handsome marco who had come into view but fats wall who was talking to dane tully outside the newsagents sukhvinder braked but gaia grabbed her upper arm you can walk where you like she said tugging her gently onwards her flecked green eyes narrowing as they approached the place where fats and dane were smoking all right arf called fats as the three of them came close fats said andrew trying to head off trouble especially fats bullying sukhvinder in front of gaia he asked did you get my text what text said fats oh yeah that thing about si you leaving then are you it was said with a cavalier indifference that andrew could only attribute to the presence of dane tully yeah maybe said andrew where are you going asked gaia my old mans been offered a job in reading said andrew oh thats where my dad lives said gaia in surprise we could hang out when i go and stay the festivals awesome dyou wanna get a sandwich then sooks andrew was so stupefied by her voluntary offer to spend time with him that she had disappeared into the newsagents before he could gather his wits and agree for a moment the dirty bus stop the newsagents even dane tully tattooed and shabby in a tshirt and tracksuit bottoms seemed to glow with an almost celestial light well i got things to do said fats dane sniggered before andrew could say anything or offer to accompany him he had loped away fats was sure that andrew would be nonplussed and hurt by his cool attitude and he was glad of it fats did not ask himself why he was glad or why a general desire to cause pain had become his overriding emotion in the last few days he had lately decided that questioning your own motives was inauthentic a refinement of his personal philosophy that had made it altogether easier to follow as he headed into the fields fats thought about what had happened at home the previous evening when his mother had entered his bedroom for the first time since cubby had punched him that message about your father on the parish council website she had said ive got to ask you this stuart and i wish stuart did you write it it had taken her a few days to summon the courage to accuse him and he was prepared no he said perhaps it would have been more authentic to say yes but he had preferred not to and he did not see why he should have to justify himself you didnt she repeated with no change of tone or expression no he repeated because very very few people know what dad what he worries about well it wasnt me the post went up the same evening that dad and you had the row and dad hit ive told you i didnt do it you know hes ill stuart yeah so you keep telling me i keep telling you because its true he cant help it hes got a serious mental illness that causes him untold distress and misery fats mobile had beeped and he had glanced down at a text from andrew he read it and experienced an air punch to the midriff arf leaving for good im talking to you stuart i know what all these posts simon price parminder dad these are all people you know if youre behind all this ive told you im not youre causing untold damage serious awful damage stuart to peoples lives fats was trying to imagine life without andrew they had known each other since they were four its not me he had said serious awful damage to peoples lives they had made their lives fats thought scornfully as he turned into foley road the victims of the ghost of barry fairbrother were mired in hypocrisy and lies and they didnt like the exposure they were stupid bugs running from bright light they knew nothing about real life he could see a house ahead that had a bald tyre lying on the grass in front of it he had a strong suspicion that that was krystals and when he saw the number he knew he was right he had never been here before he would never have agreed to meet her at her home during the lunch hour a couple of weeks ago but things changed he had changed they said that her mother was a prostitute she was certainly a junkie krystal had told him that the house would be empty because her mother would be at bellchapel addiction clinic receiving her allotted amount of methadone fats walked up the garden path without slowing but with unexpected trepidation krystal had been on the watch for him from her bedroom window she had closed the doors of every room downstairs so that all he would see was the hall she had thrown everything that had spilt into it back into the sitting room and kitchen the carpet was gritty and burnt in places and the wallpaper stained but she could do nothing about that there had been none of the pinescented disinfectant left but she had found some bleach and sloshed that around the kitchen and bathroom both of them sources of the worst smells in the house when he knocked she ran downstairs they did not have long terri would probably be back with robbie at one not long to make a baby hiya she said when she opened the door all right said fats blowing out smoke through his nostrils he did not know what he had expected his first glimpse of the interior of the house was of a grimy bare box there was no furniture the closed doors to his left and ahead were strangely ominous are we the only ones here he asked as he crossed the threshold yeah said krystal we cn go upstairs my room she led the way the deeper inside they went the worse the smell became mingled bleach and filth fats tried not to care all doors were closed on the landing except one krystal went inside fats did not want to be shocked but there was nothing in the room except a mattress which was covered with a sheet and a bare duvet and a small pile of clothes heaped up in a corner a few pictures ripped from tabloid newspapers were sellotaped to the wall a mixture of pop stars and celebrities krystal had made her collage the previous day in imitation of the one on nikkis bedroom wall knowing that fats was coming over she had wanted to make the room more hospitable she had drawn the thin curtains they gave a blueish tinge to daylight gimme a fag she said im gasping he lit it for her she was more nervous than he had ever seen her he preferred her cocky and worldly we ain got long she told him and with the cigarette in her mouth she began to strip me mumll be back yeah at bellchapel isnt she said fats somehow trying to harden krystal up again in his mind yeah said krystal sitting on the mattress and pulling off her tracksuit bottoms what if they close it asked fats taking off his blazer i heard theyre thinking about it i dunno said krystal but she was frightened her mothers willpower fragile and vulnerable as a fledgling chick could fail at the slightest provocation she had already stripped to her underwear fats was taking off his shoes when he noticed something nestled beside her heaped clothes a small plastic jewellery box lying open and curled inside a familiar watch is that my mums he said in surprise what krystal panicked no she lied it was my nana caths dont but he had already pulled it out of the box it is hers he said he recognized the strap it fuckin aint she was terrified she had almost forgotten that she had stolen it where it had come from fats was silent and she did not like it the watch in fats hand seemed to be both challenging and reproaching him in quick succession he imagined walking out slipping it casually into his pocket or handing it back to krystal with a shrug its mine she said he did not want to be a policeman he wanted to be lawless but it took the recollection that the watch had been cubbys gift to make him hand it back to her and carry on taking off his clothes scarlet in the face krystal tugged off bra and pants and slipped naked beneath the duvet fats approached her in his boxer shorts a wrapped condom in his hand we don need that said krystal thickly im takin the pill now are you she moved over on the mattress for him fats slid under the duvet as he pulled off his boxers he wondered whether she was lying about the pill like the watch but he had wanted to try without a condom for a while go on she whispered and she tugged the little foil square out of his hand and threw it on top of his blazer crumpled on the floor he imagined krystal pregnant with his child the faces of tessa and cubby when they heard his kid in the fields his flesh and blood it would be more than cubby had ever managed he climbed on top of her this he knew was real life viii at halfpast six that evening howard and shirley mollison entered pagford church hall shirley was carrying an armful of papers and howard was wearing the chain of office decorated with the blue and white pagford crest the floorboards creaked beneath howards massive weight as he moved to the head of the scratched tables that had already been set end to end howard was almost as fond of this hall as he was of his own shop the brownies used it on tuesdays and the womens institute on wednesdays it had hosted jumble sales and jubilee celebrations wedding receptions and wakes and it smelt of all of these things of stale clothes and coffee urns and the ghosts of homebaked cakes and meat salads of dust and human bodies but primarily of aged wood and stone beatenbrass lights hung from the rafters on thick black flexes and the kitchen was reached through ornate mahogany doors shirley bustled from place to place setting out papers she adored council meetings quite apart from the pride and enjoyment she derived from listening to howard chair them maureen was necessarily absent with no official role she had to be content with the pickings shirley deigned to share howards fellow councillors arrived singly and in pairs he boomed out greetings his voice echoing from the rafters the full complement of sixteen councillors rarely attended he was expecting twelve of them today the table was half full when aubrey fawley arrived walking as he always did as if into a high wind with an air of reluctant forcefulness slightly stooped his head bowed aubrey called howard joyfully and for the first time he moved forward to greet the newcomer how are you hows julia did you get my invitation sorry i dont to my sixtyfifth here saturday day after the election oh yes yes howard theres a young woman outside she says shes from the yarvil and district gazette alison something oh said howard strange ive just sent her my article you know the one answering fairbrothers maybe its something to do ill go and see he waddled away full of vague misgivings parminder jawanda entered as he approached the door scowling as usual she walked straight past without greeting him and for once howard did not ask hows parminder out on the pavement he found a young blonde woman stocky and square with an aura of impermeable cheerfulness that howard recognized immediately as determination of his own brand she was holding a notebook and looking up at the sweetlove initials carved over the double doors hello hello said howard his breathing a little laboured alison is it howard mollison have you come all this way to tell me i cant write for toffee she beamed and shook the hand he proffered oh no we like the article she assured him i thought as things are getting so interesting id come and sit in on the meeting you dont mind press are allowed i think ive looked up all the regulations she was moving towards the door as she spoke yes yes press are allowed said howard following her and pausing courteously at the entrance to let her through first unless we have to deal with anything in camera that is she glanced back at him and he could make out her teeth even in the fading light like all those anonymous accusations on your message board from the ghost of barry fairbrother oh dear wheezed howard smiling back at her theyre not news surely a couple of silly comments on the internet has it only been a couple somebody told me the bulk of them had been taken off the site no no somebodys got that wrong said howard there have only been two or three to my knowledge nasty nonsense personally he said improvising on the spot i think its some kid a kid you know teenager having fun would teenagers target parish councillors she asked still smiling i heard actually that one of the victims has lost his job possibly as a result of the allegations made against him on your site news to me said howard untruthfully shirley had seen ruth at the hospital the previous day and reported back to him i see on the agenda said alison as the pair of them entered the brightly lit hall that youll be discussing bellchapel you and mr fairbrother made good points on both sides of the argument in your articles we had quite a few letters to the paper after we printed mr fairbrothers piece my editor liked that anything that makes people write letters yes i saw those said howard nobody seemed to have much good to say about the clinic did they the councillors at the table were watching the pair of them alison jenkins returned their gaze still smiling imperturbably let me get you a chair said howard puffing slightly as he lifted one down from a nearby stack and settling alison some twelve feet from the table thank you she pulled it six feet forward ladies and gentlemen called howard weve got a press gallery here tonight miss alison jenkins of the yarvil and district gazette a few of them seemed interested and gratified by alisons appearance but most looked suspicious howard stumped back to the head of the table where aubrey and shirley were questioning him with their eyes barry fairbrothers ghost he told them in an undertone as he lowered himself gingerly into the plastic chair one of them had collapsed under him two meetings ago and bellchapel and theres tony he shouted making aubrey jump come on in tony well give henry and sheila another couple of minutes shall we the murmur of talk around the table was slightly more subdued than usual alison jenkins was already writing in her notebook howard thought angrily this is all bloody fairbrothers fault he was the one who had invited the press in for a split second howard thought of barry and the ghost as one and the same a troublemaker alive and dead like shirley parminder had brought a stack of papers with her to the meeting and these were piled up underneath the agenda she was pretending to read so that she did not have to speak to anybody in reality she was thinking about the woman sitting almost directly behind her the yarvil and district gazette had written about catherine weedons collapse and the familys complaints against their gp parminder had not been named but doubtless the journalist knew who she was perhaps alison had got wind of the anonymous post about parminder on the parish council website too calm down youre getting like colin howard was already taking apologies and asking for revisions to the last set of minutes but parminder could barely hear over the sound of her own blood thudding in her ears now unless anybodys got any objections said howard were going to deal with items eight and nine first because district councillor fawleys got news on both and he cant stay long got until eight thirty said aubrey checking his watch yes so unless there are objections no floors yours aubrey aubrey stated the position simply and without emotion there was a new boundary review coming and for the first time there was an appetite beyond pagford to reassign the fields to yarvil absorbing pagfords relatively small costs seemed worthwhile to those who hoped to add antigovernment votes to yarvils tally where they might make a difference as opposed to being wasted in pagford which had been a safe conservative seat since the s the whole thing could be done under the guise of simplifying and streamlining yarvil provided almost all services for the place as it was aubrey concluded by saying that it would be helpful should pagford wish to cut the estate away for the town to express its wishes for the benefit of the district council a good clear message from you he said and i really think that this time its never worked before said a farmer to muttered agreement well now john weve never been invited to state our position before said howard shouldnt we decide what our position is before we declare it publicly asked parminder in an icy voice all right said howard blandly would you like to kick off dr jawanda i dont know how many people saw barrys article in the gazette said parminder every face was turned towards her and she tried not to think about the anonymous post or the journalist sitting behind her i thought it made the arguments for keeping the fields part of pagford very well parminder saw shirley who was writing busily give her pen a tiny smile by telling us the likes of krystal weedon benefit said an elderly woman called betty from the end of the table parminder had always detested her by reminding us that people living in the fields are part of our community too she answered they think of themselves as from yarvil said the farmer always have i remember said betty when krystal weedon pushed another child into the river on a nature walk no she didnt said parminder angrily my daughter was there that was two boys who were fighting anyway i heard it was krystal weedon said betty you heard wrong said parminder except that she did not say it she shouted it they were shocked she had shocked herself the echo hummed off the old walls parminder could barely swallow she kept her head down staring at the agenda and heard johns voice from a long way off barry wouldve done better to talk about himself not that girl he got a lot out of st thomass trouble is for every barry said another woman you get a load of yobs theyre yarvil people bottom line said a man they belong to yarvil thats not true said parminder keeping her voice deliberately low but they all fell silent to listen to her waiting for her to shout again its simply not true look at the weedons that was the whole point of barrys article they were a pagford family going back years but they moved to yarvil said betty there was no housing here said parminder fighting her own temper none of you wanted a new development on the outskirts of town you werent here im sorry said betty pink in the face looking ostentatiously away from parminder you dont know the history talk had become general the meeting had broken into several little knots of conversation and parminder could not make out any of it her throat was tight and she did not dare meet anyones eyes shall we have a show of hands howard shouted down the table and silence fell again those in favour of telling the district council that pagford will be happy for the parish boundary to be redrawn to take the fields out of our jurisdiction parminders fists were clenched in her lap and the nails of both her hands were embedded in their palms there was a rustle of sleeves all around her excellent said howard and the jubilation in his voice rang triumphantly from the rafters well ill draft something with tony and helen and well send it round for everyone to see and well get it off excellent a couple of councillors clapped parminders vision blurred and she blinked hard the agenda swam in and out of focus the silence went on so long that finally she looked up howard in his excitement had had recourse to his inhaler and most of the councillors were watching solicitously all right then wheezed howard putting the inhaler away again red in the face and beaming unless anyones got anything else to add an infinitesimal pause item nine bellchapel and aubreys got something to tell us here too barry wouldnt have let it happen hed have argued hed have made john laugh and vote with us he ought to have written about himself not krystal ive let him down thank you howard said aubrey as the blood pounded in parminders ears and she dug her nails still more deeply into her palms as you know were having to make some pretty drastic cuts at district level she was in love with me which she could barely hide whenever she laid eyes on me and one of the projects weve got to look at is bellchapel said aubrey i thought id have a word because as you all know its the parish that owns the building and the lease is almost up said howard thats right but nobody else is interested in that old place are they asked a retired accountant from the end of the table its in a bad state from what ive heard oh im sure we could find a new tenant said howard comfortably but thats not really the issue the point is whether we think the clinic is doing a good thats not the point at all said parminder cutting across him it isnt the parish councils job to decide whether or not the clinics doing a good job we dont fund their work theyre not our responsibility but we own the building said howard still smiling still polite so i think its natural for us to want to consider if were going to look at information on the clinics work i think its very important that we get a balanced picture said parminder im terribly sorry said shirley blinking down the table at parminder but could you try not to interrupt the chair dr jawanda its awfully difficult to take notes if people talk over other people and now ive interrupted she added with a smile sorry i presume the parish wants to keep getting revenue from the building said parminder ignoring shirley and we have no other potential tenant lined up as far as i know so im wondering why we are even considering terminating the clinics lease they dont cure them said betty they just give them more drugs id be very happy to see them out were having to make some very difficult decisions at district council level said aubrey fawley the governments looking for more than a billion in savings from local government we cannot continue to provide services the way we have done thats the reality parminder hated the way that her fellow councillors acted around aubrey drinking in his deep modulated voice nodding gently as he talked she was well aware that some of them called her bendsyourear research indicates that illegal drug use increases during recessions said parminder its their choice said betty nobody makes them take drugs she looked around the table for support shirley smiled at her were having to make some tough choices said aubrey so youve got together with howard parminder talked over him and decided that you can give the clinic a little push by forcing them out of the building i can think of better ways to spend money than on a bunch of criminals said the accountant id cut off all their benefits personally said betty i was invited to this meeting to put you all in the picture about whats happening at district level said aubrey calmly nothing more than that dr jawanda helen said howard loudly pointing to another councillor whose hand was raised and who had been trying to make her views heard for a minute parminder heard nothing of what the woman said she had quite forgotten about the stack of papers lying underneath her agenda on which kay bawden had spent so much time the statistics the profiles of successful cases the explanation of the benefits of methadone as against heroin studies showing the cost financial and social of heroin addiction everything around her had become slightly liquid unreal she knew that she was going to erupt as she had never erupted in her life and there was no room to regret it or to prevent it or do anything except watch it happen it was too late far too late culture of entitlement said aubrey fawley people who have literally not worked a day in their lives and lets face it said howard this is a problem with a simple solution stop taking the drugs he turned smiling and conciliating to parminder they call it cold turkey isnt that right dr jawanda oh you think that they should take responsibility for their addiction and change their behaviour said parminder in a nutshell yes before they cost the state any more money exact and you said parminder loudly as the silent eruption engulfed her do you know how many tens of thousands of pounds you howard mollison have cost the health service because of your total inability to stop gorging yourself a rich red claret stain was spreading up howards neck into his cheeks do you know how much your bypass cost and your drugs and your long stay in hospital and the doctors appointments you take up with your asthma and your blood pressure and the nasty skin rash which are all caused by your refusal to lose weight as parminders voice became a scream other councillors began to protest on howards behalf shirley was on her feet parminder was still shouting clawing together the papers that had somehow been scattered as she gesticulated what about patient confidentiality shouted shirley outrageous absolutely outrageous parminder was at the door of the hall and striding through it and she heard over her own furious sobs betty calling for her immediate expulsion from the council she was half running away from the hall and she knew that she had done something cataclysmic and she wanted nothing more than to be swallowed up by the darkness and to disappear for ever ix the yarvil and district gazette erred on the side of caution in reporting what had been said during the most acrimonious pagford parish council meeting in living memory it made little difference the bowdlerized report augmented by the vivid eyewitness descriptions offered by all who had attended still created widespread gossip to make matters worse a frontpage story detailed the anonymous internet attacks in the dead mans name that had to quote alison jenkins caused considerable speculation and anger see page four for full report while the names of the accused and the details of their supposed misdemeanours were not given the sight of serious allegations and criminal activity in newsprint disturbed howard even more than the original posts we should have beefed up security on the site as soon as that first post appeared he said addressing his wife and business partner from in front of his gas fire silent spring rain sprinkled the window and the back lawn glistened with tiny red pinpricks of light howard was feeling shivery and was hogging all the heat emanating from the fake coal for several days nearly every visitor to the delicatessen and the café had been gossiping about the anonymous posts about the ghost of barry fairbrother and about parminder jawandas outburst at the council meeting howard hated the things that she had shouted being bandied about in public for the first time in his life he felt uncomfortable in his own shop and concerned about his previously unassailable position in pagford the election for the replacement of barry fairbrother would take place the following day and where howard had felt sanguine and excited he was worried and twitchy this has done a lot of damage a lot of damage he repeated his hand strayed to his belly to scratch but he pulled it away enduring the itch with a martyrs expression he would not soon forget what dr jawanda had screamed to the council and the press he and shirley had already checked the details of the general medical council gone to see dr crawford and made a formal complaint parminder had not been seen at work since so no doubt she was already regretting her outburst nevertheless howard could not rid himself of the sight of her expression as she screamed at him it had shaken him to see such hatred on another humans face itll all blow over said shirley reassuringly im not so sure said howard im not so sure it doesnt make us look good the council rows in front of the press we look divided aubrey says theyre not happy at district level this whole things undermined our statement about the fields squabbling in public everything getting dirty it doesnt look like the councils speaking for the town but we are said shirley with a little laugh nobody in pagford wants the fields hardly anyone the article makes it look like our side went after profielders tried to intimidate them said howard succumbing to the temptation to scratch and doing it fiercely all right aubrey knows it wasnt any of our side but thats not how that journalist made it look and ill tell you this if yarvil makes us look inept or dirty theyve been looking for a chance to take us over for years that wont happen said shirley at once that couldnt happen i thought it was over said howard ignoring his wife and thinking of the fields i thought wed done it i thought wed got rid of them the article over which he had spent so much time explaining why the estate and the bellchapel addiction clinic were drains and blots on pagford had been completely overshadowed by the scandals of parminders outburst and the ghost of barry fairbrother howard had completely forgotten now how much pleasure the accusations against simon price had given him and that it had not occurred to him to remove them until prices wife had asked district councils emailed me he told maureen with a bunch of questions about the website they want to hear what steps weve taken against defamation they think the securitys lax shirley who detected a personal reproof in all of this said coldly ive told you ive taken care of it howard the nephew of friends of howard and shirleys had come round the previous day while howard was at work the boy was halfway through a degree in computing his recommendation to shirley had been that they take down the immensely hackable website bring in someone who knows what theyre doing and set up a new one shirley had understood barely one word in ten of the technical jargon that the young man had spewed at her she knew that hack meant to breach illegally and when the student stopped talking his gibberish she was left with the confused impression that the ghost had somehow managed to find out peoples passwords maybe by questioning them cunningly in casual conversation she had therefore emailed everybody to request that they change their password and make sure not to share the new one with anybody this was what she meant by ive taken care of it as to the suggestion of closing down the site of which she was guardian and curator she had taken no steps nor had she mentioned the idea to howard shirley was afraid that a site containing all the security measures that the superior young man had suggested would be way beyond the scope of her managerial and technical skills she was already stretched to the limits of her abilities and she was determined to cling to the post of administrator if miles is elected shirley began but maureen interrupted in her deep voice lets hope it hasnt hurt him this nasty stuff lets hope there isnt a backlash against him people will know miles had nothing to do with it said shirley coolly will they though said maureen and shirley simply hated her how dare she sit in shirleys lounge and contradict her and what was worse howard was nodding his agreement with maureen thats my worry he said and we need miles more than ever now get some cohesion back on the council after bendsyourear said what she said after all the uproar we didnt even take the vote on bellchapel we need miles shirley had already walked out of the room in silent protest at howards siding with maureen she busied herself with the teacups in the kitchen silently fuming wondering why she did not set out only two cups to give maureen the hint that she so richly deserved shirley continued to feel nothing but defiant admiration for the ghost his accusations had exposed the truth about people whom she disliked and despised people who were destructive and wrongheaded she was sure that the electorate of pagford would see things her way and vote for miles rather than that disgusting man colin wall when shall we go and vote shirley asked howard reentering the room with the tinkling tea tray and pointedly ignoring maureen for it was their son whose name they would tick on the ballot but to her intense irritation howard suggested that all three of them go after closing time miles mollison was quite as concerned as his father that the unprecedented illhumour surrounding next days vote would affect his electoral chances that very morning he had entered the newsagents behind the square and caught a snatch of conversation between the woman behind the till and her elderly customer mollisons always thought he was king of pagford the old man was saying oblivious to the wooden expression on the shopkeepers face i liked barry fairbrother tragedy that was tragedy the mollison boy did our wills and i thought he was very pleased with himself miles had lost his nerve at that and slipped back out of the shop his face glowing like a schoolboys he wondered whether the wellspoken old man was the originator of that anonymous letter miles comfortable belief in his own likeability was shaken and he kept trying to imagine how it would feel if nobody voted for him the following day as he undressed for bed that night he watched his silent wifes reflection in the dressingtable mirror for days samantha had been nothing but sarcastic if he mentioned the election he could have done with some support some comfort this evening he also felt randy it had been a long time thinking back he supposed that it had been the night before barry fairbrother dropped dead she had been a little bit drunk it often took a little bit of drink these days how was work he asked watching her undo her bra in the mirror samantha did not answer immediately she rubbed the deep red grooves in the flesh beneath her arms left by the tight bra then said without looking at miles ive been meaning to talk to you about that actually she hated having to say it she had been trying to avoid doing so for several weeks roy thinks i ought to close the shop its not doing well exactly how badly the shop was doing would be a shock to miles it had been a shock to her when her accountant had laid out the position in the baldest terms she had both known and not known it was strange how your brain could know what your heart refused to accept oh said miles but youd keep the website yeah she said wed keep the website well thats good said miles encouragingly he waited for almost a minute out of respect for the death of her shop then he said i dont suppose you saw the gazette today she reached over for the nightdress on her pillow and he had a satisfying glimpse of her breasts sex would definitely help relax him its a real shame sam he said crawling across the bed behind her and waiting to put his arms around her as she wriggled into the nightdress about the shop it was a great little place and youve had it what ten years fourteen said samantha she knew what he wanted she considered telling him to go and screw himself and decamping to the spare room but the trouble was that there would then be a row and an atmosphere and what she wanted more than anything in the world was to be able to head off to london with libby in two days time wearing the tshirts that she had bought them both and to be within close proximity of jake and his band mates for a whole evening this excursion constituted the entire sum of samanthas current happiness what was more sex might assuage miles continuing annoyance that she was missing howards birthday party so she let him embrace and then kiss her she closed her eyes climbed on top of him and imagined herself riding jake on a deserted white beach nineteen years old to his twentyone she came while imagining miles watching them furiously through binoculars from a distant pedalo x at nine oclock on the morning of the election for barrys seat parminder left the old vicarage and walked up church row to the walls house she rapped on the door and waited until at last colin appeared there were shadows around his bloodshot eyes and beneath his cheekbones his skin seemed to have thinned and his clothes grown too big he had not yet returned to work the news that parminder had screamed confidential medical information about howard in public had set back his tentative recovery the more robust colin of a few nights ago who had sat on the leather pouffe and pretended to be confident of victory might never have been is everything all right he asked closing the door behind her looking wary yes fine she said i thought you might like to walk down the church hall with me to vote i no he said weakly im sorry i know how you feel colin said parminder in a small tight voice but if you dont vote it means theyve won im not going to let them win im going to go down there and vote for you and i want you to come with me parminder was effectively suspended from work the mollisons had complained to every professional body for which they could find an address and dr crawford had advised parminder to take time off to her great surprise she felt strangely liberated but colin was shaking his head she thought she saw tears in his eyes i cant minda you can she said you can colin youve got to stand up to them think of barry i cant im sorry i he made a choking noise and burst into tears colin had cried in her surgery before now sobbed in desperation at the burden of fear he carried with him every day of his life come on she said unembarrassed and she took his arm and steered him through to the kitchen where she handed him kitchen roll and let him sob himself into hiccups again wheres tessa at work he gasped mopping his eyes there was an invitation to howard mollisons sixtyfifth birthday party lying on the kitchen table somebody had torn it neatly in two i got one of those as well said parminder before i shouted at him listen colin voting i cant whispered colin shows them they havent beaten us but they have said colin parminder burst out laughing after contemplating her with his mouth open for a moment colin started to laugh too a big booming guffaw like the bark of a mastiff all right theyve run us out of our jobs said parminder and neither of us wants to leave the house but other than that i think were in very good shape indeed colin took off his glasses and dabbed his wet eyes grinning come on colin i want to vote for you it isnt over yet after i blew my top and told howard mollison he was no better than a junkie in front of the whole council and the local press he burst out laughing again and she was delighted she had not heard him laugh so much since new year and then it had been barry making him do it they forgot to vote on forcing the addiction clinic out of bellchapel so please get your coat well walk down there together colins snorts and giggles died away he stared down at the big hands fumbled over each other as if he were washing them clean colin its not over youve made a difference people dont like the mollisons if you get in wed be in a much stronger position to fight please colin all right he said after a few moments awed by his own daring it was a short walk in the fresh clean air each of them clutching their voter registration cards the church hall was empty of voters apart from themselves each put a thick pencil cross beside colins name and left with the sense that they had got away with something miles mollison did not vote until midday he paused at his partners door on the way out im off to vote gav he said gavin indicated the telephone pressed against his ear he was on hold with marys insurance company oh right im off to vote shona said miles turning to their secretary there was no harm in reminding them both that he was in need of their support miles jogged downstairs and proceeded to the copper kettle where during a brief postcoital chat he had arranged to meet his wife so that they could go down to the church hall together samantha had spent the morning at home leaving her assistant in charge at the shop she knew that she could no longer put off telling carly that they were out of business and that carly was out of a job but she could not bring herself to do it before the weekend and the concert in london when miles appeared and she saw his excited little grin she experienced a rush of fury dad not coming were his first words theyre going down after closing time said samantha there were two old ladies in the voting booths when she and miles got there samantha waited looking at the backs of their irongrey perms their thick coats and their thicker ankles that was how she would look one day the more crooked of the two old women noticed miles as they left beamed and said ive just voted for you well thank you very much said miles delighted samantha entered the booth and stared down at the two names miles mollison and colin wall the pencil tied to the end of a piece of string in her hand then she scribbled i hate bloody pagford across the paper folded it over crossed to the ballot box and dropped it unsmiling through the slot thanks love said miles quietly with a pat on her back tessa wall who had never failed to vote in an election before drove past the church hall on her way back home from school and did not stop ruth and simon price spent the day talking more seriously than ever about the possibility of moving to reading ruth threw out their voter registration cards while clearing the kitchen table for supper gavin had never intended to vote if barry had been alive to stand he might have done so but he had no desire to help miles achieve another of his lifes goals at halfpast five he packed up his briefcase irritable and depressed because he had finally run out of excuses not to have dinner at kays it was particularly irksome because there were hopeful signs that the insurance company was shifting in marys favour and he had very much wanted to go over and tell her so this meant that he would have to store up the news until tomorrow he did not want to waste it on the telephone when kay opened the door to him she launched at once into the rapid quickfire talk that usually meant she was in a bad mood sorry its been a dreadful day she said although he had not complained and they had barely exchanged greetings i was late back i meant to be further on with dinner come through from upstairs came the insistent crash of drums and a loud bass line gavin was surprised that the neighbours were not complaining kay saw him glance up at the ceiling and said oh gaias furious because some boy she liked back in hackney has started going out with another girl she seized the glass of wine she was already drinking and took a big gulp her conscience had hurt her when she called marco de luca some boy he had virtually moved into their house in the weeks before they had left london kay had found him charming considerate and helpful she would have liked a son like marco shell live said kay pushing the memories away and she returned to the potatoes she was boiling shes sixteen you bounce at that age help yourself to wine gavin sat down at the table wishing that kay would make gaia turn the music down she had virtually to shout at him over the vibration of the bass the rattling saucepan lids and the noisy extractor fan he yearned again for the melancholy calm of marys big kitchen for marys gratitude her need for him what he said loudly because he could tell that kay had just asked him something i said did you vote vote in the council election she said no he replied couldnt care less he was not sure whether she had heard she was talking again and only when she turned to the table with knives and forks could he hear her clearly absolutely disgusting actually that the parish is colluding with aubrey fawley i expect bellchapel will be finished if miles gets in she drained the potatoes and the splatter and crash drowned her temporarily again if that silly woman hadnt lost her temper we might be in with a better shot i gave her masses of stuff on the clinic and i dont think she used any of it she just screamed at howard mollison that he was too fat talk about unprofessional gavin had heard rumours about dr jawandas public outburst he had found it mildly amusing all this uncertaintys very damaging to the people who work at that clinic not to mention the clients but gavin could muster neither pity nor indignation all he felt was dismay at the firm grip kay seemed to have on the intricacies and personalities involved in this esoteric local issue it was yet another indication of how she was driving roots deeper and deeper into pagford it would take a lot to dislodge her now he turned his head and gazed out of the window onto the overgrown garden beyond he had offered to help fergus with marys garden this weekend with luck he thought mary would invite him to stay for dinner again and if she did he would skip howard mollisons sixtyfifth birthday party to which miles seemed to think he was looking forward with excitement wanted to keep the weedons but no gillian says we cant cherrypick would you call that cherrypicking sorry what asked gavin matties back she said and he had to struggle to recollect that this was a colleague of hers whose cases she had been covering i wanted to keep working with the weedons because sometimes you do get a particular feeling for a family but gillian wont let me its crazy you must be the only person in the world who ever wanted to keep the weedons said gavin from what ive heard anyway it took nearly all kays willpower not to snap at him she pulled the salmon fillets she had been baking out of the oven gaias music was so loud that she could feel it vibrating through the tray which she slammed down on the hob gaia she screamed making gavin jump as she strode past him to the foot of the stairs gaia turn it down i mean it turn it down the volume diminished by perhaps a decibel kay marched back into the kitchen fuming the row with gaia before gavin arrived had been one of their worst ever gaia had stated her intention of telephoning her father and asking to move in with him well good luck with that kay had shouted but perhaps brendan would say yes he had left her when gaia was only a month old brendan was married now with three other children he had a huge house and a good job what if he said yes gavin was glad that he did not have to talk as they ate the thumping music filled the silence and he could think about mary in peace he would tell her tomorrow that the insurance company was making conciliatory noises and receive her gratitude and admiration he had almost cleared his plate when he realized that kay had not eaten a single mouthful she was staring at him across the table and her expression alarmed him perhaps he had somehow revealed his inner thoughts gaias music came to an abrupt halt overhead the throbbing quiet was dreadful to gavin he wished that gaia would put something else on quickly you dont even try kay said miserably you dont even pretend to care gavin he attempted to take the easy way out kay ive had a long day he said im sorry if im not up to the minutiae of local politics the second i walk im not talking about local politics she said you sit there looking as if youd rather be anywhere else its its offensive what do you want gavin he saw marys kitchen and her sweet face i have to beg to see you kay said and when you come round here you couldnt make it clearer that you dont want to come she wanted him to say thats not true the last point at which a denial might have counted slunk past they were sliding at increasing speed towards that crisis which gavin both urgently desired and dreaded tell me what you want she said wearily just tell me both could feel the relationship crumbling to pieces beneath the weight of everything that gavin refused to say it was with a sense of putting them both out of their misery that he reached for words that he had not intended to speak aloud perhaps ever but which in some way seemed to excuse both of them i didnt want this to happen gavin said earnestly i didnt mean it to kay im really sorry but i think im in love with mary fairbrother he saw from her expression that she had not been prepared for this mary fairbrother she repeated i think he said and there was a bittersweet pleasure in talking about it even though he knew he was wounding her he had not been able to say it to anyone else its been there for a long time i never acknowledged i mean when barry was alive id never have i thought he was your best friend whispered kay he was hes only been dead a few weeks gavin did not like hearing that look he said im trying to be honest with you im trying to be fair youre trying to be fair he had always imagined it ending in a blaze of fury but she simply watched him putting on his coat with tears in her eyes im sorry he said and walked out of her house for the last time on the pavement he experienced a rush of elation and hurried to his car he would be able to tell mary about the insurance company tonight after all part five privilege a person who has made a defamatory statement may claim privilege for it if he can show that he made it without malice and in pursuit of a public duty charles arnoldbaker local council administration seventh edition i terri weedon was used to people leaving her the first and greatest departure had been her mothers who had never said goodbye but had simply walked out one day with a suitcase while terri was at school there had been lots of social workers and care workers after she ran away at fourteen and some of them had been nice enough but they all left at the end of the working day every fresh departure added a fine new layer to the crust building over her core she had had friends in care but at sixteen they were all on their own and life had scattered them she met ritchie adams and she bore him two children tiny little pink things pure and beautiful like nothing in the whole world and they had come out of her and for shining hours in the hospital twice it had been like her own rebirth and then they took the children from her and she never saw them again either banger had left her nana cath had left her nearly everybody went hardly anyone stayed she ought to be used to it by now when mattie her regular social worker reappeared terri demanded wheres the other one kay she was only covering for me while i was ill said mattie so wheres liam no i mean robbie dont i terri did not like mattie for one thing she did not have kids and how could people who didnt have kids tell you how to raise them how could they understand she had not liked kay exactly either except that kay gave you a funny feeling the same feeling that nana cath had once given terri before she had called her a whore and told her she never wanted to see her again you felt with kay even though she carried folders like the rest of them even though she had instituted the case review you felt that she wanted things to go right for you and not only for the forms you really did feel that but she was gone and she probably dont even think about us now thought terri furiously on friday afternoon mattie told terri that bellchapel would almost certainly close its political she said briskly they want to save money but methadone treatments unpopular with the district council plus pagford wants them out of the building it was all in the local paper maybe you saw it sometimes she spoke to terri like that veering into a kind of afterallwereinthistogether smalltalk that jarred because it sat alongside enquiries as to whether terri was remembering to feed her son but this time it was what she said rather than how she said it that upset terri theyre closin it she repeated it looks that way said mattie breezily but it wont make any difference to you well obviously three times terri had embarked upon the programme at bellchapel the dusty interior of the converted church with its partition walls and its flyers the bathroom with its neonblue light so you could not find veins and shoot up in there had become familiar and almost friendly lately she had begun to sense in the workers there a change in the way they spoke to her they had all expected her to fail again in the beginning but they had started talking to her the way kay had talked as if they knew a real person lived inside her pockmarked burned body obviously it will be different but you can get your methadone from your gp instead said mattie she flipped over pages in the distended file that was the states record of terris life youre registered with dr jawanda in pagford right pagford why are you going all the way out there i smacked a nurse at cantermill said terri almost absentmindedly after mattie had left terri sat for a long time in her filthy chair in the sitting room gnawing at her nails until they bled the moment krystal came home bringing robbie back from nursery she told her that they were closing bellchapel they aint decided yet said krystal with authority the fuck do you know demanded terri theyre closin it and now they say ive gotta go to fuckin pagford to that bitch that killed nana cath well i fuckin aint you gotta said krystal krystal had been like this for days bossing her mother acting as though she krystal was the grownup i ain gotta do fuckin anythin said terri furiously cheeky little bitch she added for good measure if you start fuckin usin again said krystal scarlet in the face theyll take robbie away he was still holding krystals hand and burst into tears see both women shouted at each other youre fuckin doin it to him shouted krystal an anyway that doctor didn do nuthin to nana cath thats all jus cheryl an them talking shit fuckin little knowitall aint yeh yelled terri you know fuckall krystal spat at her get the fuck out screamed terri and because krystal was bigger and heavier she seized a shoe lying on the floor and brandished it gerrout i fuckin will yelled krystal an ill take robbie an all an you can stay here an fuckin screw obbo an make another one she dragged the wailing robbie out with her before terri could stop her krystal marched him all the way to her usual refuge forgetting that at this time in the afternoon nikki would still be hanging around outside somewhere not at home it was nikkis mum who opened the door in her asda uniform he ain stayin ere she told krystal firmly while robbie whined and tried to pull his hand from krystals tight grip wheres your mum home said krystal and everything else she wanted to say evaporated in the older womans stern gaze so she returned to foley road with robbie where terri bitterly triumphant grabbed her sons arm pulled him inside and blocked krystal from entering ad enough of him already ave yeh terri jeered over robbies wails fuck off and she slammed the door terri had robbie sleep beside her on her own mattress that night she lay awake and thought about how little she needed krystal and ached for her as badly as she had ever craved smack krystal had been angry for days the thing that krystal had said about obbo she said what he had laughed incredulously when they had met in the street and terri had muttered something about krystal being upset he wouldnt have done it he couldnt have obbo was one of the few people who had hung around terri had known him since she was fifteen they had gone to school together hung out in yarvil while she was in care swigged cider together beneath the trees on the footpath that cut its way through the small patch of remaining farmland beside the fields they had shared their first joint krystal had never liked him jealous thought terri watching robbie sleep in the street light pouring through the thin curtains just jealous hes done more for me than anyone thought terri defiantly because when she tallied kindnesses she subtracted abandonment thus all of nana caths care had been annihilated by her rejection but obbo had hidden her once from ritchie the father of her first two children when she had fled the house barefoot and bleeding sometimes he gave her free bags of smack she saw them as equivalent kindnesses his refuges were more reliable than the little house in hope street that she had once for three glorious days thought was home krystal did not return on saturday morning but that was nothing new terri knew she must be at nikkis in a rage because they were low on food and she was out of cigarettes and robbie was whining for his sister she stormed into her daughters room and kicked her clothes around searching for money or the odd overlooked fag something clattered as she threw aside krystals crumpled old rowing kit and she saw the little plastic jewellery box upended with the rowing medal that krystal had won and tessa walls watch lying beneath it terri picked up the watch and stared at it she had never seen it before she wondered where krystal had got it her first assumption was that krystal had stolen it but then she wondered whether she might have been given it by nana cath or even left it in nana caths will that was a much more troubling thought than the idea of the watch being stolen the idea of the sneaky little bitch hiding it away treasuring it never mentioning it terri put the watch inside the pocket of her tracksuit bottoms and bellowed for robbie to come with her to the shops it took ages to get him into his shoes and terri lost her temper and slapped him she wished she could go to the shop alone but the social workers did not like you leaving kids behind in the house even though you could get things done much quicker without them wheres krystal wailed robbie as she manhandled him out of the door i wan krystal i dunno where the little tart is snapped terri dragging him along the road obbo was on the corner beside the supermarket talking to two men when he saw her he raised a hand in greeting and his two companions walked away ows ter he said nbad she lied robbie leggo he was digging his fingers so tightly into her thin leg that it hurt listen said obbo couldja keep a bit more stuff for me fer a bit kinda stuff asked terri prising robbie off her leg and holding his hand instead coupla bags o stuff said obbo really help me out ter ow long for few days bring it round this evenin will yeh terri thought of krystal and what she would say if she knew yeah go on then said terri she remembered something else and pulled tessas watch out of her pocket gonna sell this whaddaya reckon not bad said obbo weighing it in his hand ill give yeh twenty for it bring it over tonight terri had thought the watch might be worth more but she did not like to challenge him yeah all righ then she took a few steps towards the supermarket entrance hand in hand with robbie but then turned abruptly i ain usin though she said so don bring still on the mixture he said grinning at her through his thick glasses bellchapels done for mind all in the paper yeah she said miserably and she tugged robbie towards the entrance of the supermarket i know i aint going to pagford she thought as she picked biscuits off the shelf i aint going there she was almost inured to constant criticism and assessment to the sideways glance of passersby to abuse from the neighbours but she was not going to go all the way to that smug little town to get double helpings to travel back in time once a week to the place where nana cath had said she would keep her but let her go she would have to pass that pretty little school that had sent horrible letters home about krystal saying that her clothes were too small and too dirty that her behaviour was unacceptable she was afraid of longforgotten relatives emerging from hope street as they squabbled over nana caths house and of what cheryl would say if she knew that terri had entered into voluntary dealings with the paki bitch who had killed nana cath another mark against her in the family that despised her they aint making me go to fuckin pagford terri muttered aloud pulling robbie towards the checkout ii brace yourself teased howard mollison at midday on saturday mums about to post the results on the website want to wait and see it made public or shall i tell you now miles turned away instinctively from samantha who was sitting opposite him at the island in the middle of the kitchen they were having a last coffee before she and libby set off for the station and the concert in london with the handset pressed tightly to his ear he said go on you won comfortably pretty much two to one over wall miles grinned at the kitchen door ok he said keeping his voice as steady as he could good to know hang on said howard mum wants a word well done darling said shirley gleefully absolutely wonderful news i knew youd do it thanks mum said miles those two words told samantha everything but she had resolved not to be scornful or sarcastic her band tshirt was packed she had had her hair done and she had bought new heels she could hardly wait to leave parish councillor mollison then is it she said when he had hung up thats right he said a little warily congratulations she said its going to be a real celebration tonight then im sorry im missing it actually she lied out of excitement at her imminent escape touched miles leaned forward and squeezed her hand libby appeared in the kitchen in tears she was clutching her mobile in her hand what said samantha startled please will you call harriets mum why please will you but why libby because she wants to talk to you because libby wiped her eyes and nose on the back of her hand harriet and ive had a big row please will you call her samantha took the telephone through to the sitting room she had only the haziest idea who this woman was since the girls had started at boarding school she had virtually no contact with their friends parents im so desperately sorry to do this said harriets mother i told harriet id speak to you because ive been telling her its not that libby doesnt want her to go you know how close they are and i hate seeing them like this samantha checked her watch they needed to leave in ten minutes at the latest harriets got it into her head that libby had a spare ticket but didnt want to take her ive told her its not true youre taking the ticket because you dont want libby going alone arent you well naturally said samantha she cant go alone i knew it said the other woman she sounded strangely triumphant and i absolutely understand your protectiveness and i would never suggest it if i didnt think it would save you an awful lot of bother its just that the girls are so close and harriets absolutely wild about this silly group and i think from what libbys just told harriet on the phone that libbys really desperate for her to go too i totally understand why you want to keep an eye on libby but the thing is my sisters taking her two girls so there would be an adult there with them i could drive libby and harriet up together this afternoon wed meet up with the others outside the stadium and we could all stay overnight at my sisters place i absolutely guarantee that my sister or i will be with libby at all times oh thats so kind but my friend said samantha with a strange ringing in her ears is expecting us you see but if you still wanted to go and visit your friend all im saying is theres really no need for you to attend is there if somebody else is with the girls and harriets absolutely desperate really desperate i wasnt going to get involved but now its putting a strain on their friendship then on a less gushing note wed buy the ticket from you of course there was nowhere to go nowhere to hide oh said samantha yes i just thought it might be nice to go with her theyd much prefer to be with each other said harriets mother firmly and you wont have to crouch down and hide among all the little teenyboppers ha ha its all right for my sister shes only five foot two iii to gavins disappointment it seemed that he would have to attend howard mollisons birthday party after all if mary a client of the firm and the widow of his best friend had asked him to stay for dinner he would have considered himself more than justified in skipping it but mary had not asked him to stay she had family visiting and she had been oddly flustered when he had turned up she doesnt want them to know he thought taking comfort in her selfconsciousness as she ushered him towards the door he drove back to the smithy replaying his conversation with kay in his mind i thought he was your best friend hes only been dead a few weeks yeah and i was looking after her for barry he retorted in his head which is what hed have wanted neither of us expected this to happen barrys dead it cant hurt him now alone in the smithy he looked out a clean suit for the party because the invitation said formal and tried to imagine gossipy little pagford relishing the story of gavin and mary so what he thought staggered by his own bravery is she supposed to be alone for ever it happens i was looking after her and in spite of his reluctance to attend a party that was sure to be dull and exhausting he was buoyed inside by a little bubble of excitement and happiness up in hilltop house andrew price was styling his hair with his mothers blowdrier he had never looked forward to a disco or a party as much as he had longed for tonight he gaia and sukhvinder were being paid by howard to serve food and drinks at the party howard had hired him a uniform for the occasion a white shirt black trousers and a bow tie he would be working alongside gaia not as potboy but as a waiter but there was more to his anticipation than this gaia had split up with the legendary marco de luca he had found her crying about it in the back yard of the copper kettle that afternoon when he had gone outside for a smoke his loss andrew had said trying to keep the delight out of his voice and she had sniffed and said cheers andy you little poofter said simon when andrew finally turned off the drier he had been waiting to say it for several minutes standing on the dark landing staring through the gap in the door which was ajar watching andrew preen himself in the mirror andrew jumped then laughed his good humour discomposed simon look at you he jeered as andrew passed him on the landing in his shirt and bow tie with your dickybow you look a twat and youre unemployed and i did it to you dickhead andrews feelings about what he had done to his father changed almost hourly sometimes the guilt would bear down on him tainting everything but then it would melt away leaving him glorying in his secret triumph tonight the thought of it gave extra heat to the excitement burning beneath andrews thin white shirt an additional tingle to the gooseflesh caused by the rush of evening air as he sped on simons racing bike down the hill into town he was excited full of hope gaia was available and vulnerable her father lived in reading shirley mollison was standing in a party dress outside the church hall when he cycled up tying giant gold helium balloons in the shapes of fives and sixes to the railings hello andrew she trilled bike away from the entrance please he wheeled it along to the corner passing a brandnew racing green bmw convertible parked feet away he walked around the car on his way inside taking in the luxurious inner fittings and heres andy andrew saw at once that his bosss good humour and excitement were equal to his own howard was striding down the hall wearing an immense velvet dinner jacket he resembled a conjuror there were only five or six other people dotted around the party would not start for twenty minutes blue white and gold balloons had been fastened up everywhere there was a massive trestle table largely covered in plates draped with teatowels and at the top of the hall a middleaged dj setting up his equipment go help maureen andy will you she was laying out glasses at one end of the long table caught gaudily in a stream of light from an overhead lamp dont you look handsome she croaked as he approached she was wearing a scant stretchy shiny dress that revealed every contour of the bony body to which unexpected little rolls and pads of flesh still clung exposed by the unforgiving fabric from somewhere out of sight came a small hi gaia was crouching over a box of plates on the floor glasses out of boxes please andy said maureen and set them up here where were having the bar he did as he was told as he unpacked the box a woman he had never seen before approached carrying several bottles of champagne these should go in the fridge if there is one she had howards straight nose howards big blue eyes and howards curly fair hair but whereas his features were womanish softened by fat his daughter she had to be his daughter was unpretty yet striking with low brows big eyes and a cleft chin she was wearing trousers and an opennecked silk shirt after dumping the bottles onto the table she turned away her demeanour and something about the quality of her clothing made andrew sure that she was the owner of the bmw outside thats patricia whispered gaia in his ear and his skin tingled again as though she carried an electric charge howards daughter yeah i thought so he said but he was much more interested to see that gaia was unscrewing the cap of a bottle of vodka and pouring out a measure as he watched she drank it straight off with a little shudder she had barely replaced the top when maureen reappeared beside them with an ice bucket bloody old slapper said gaia as maureen walked away and andrew smelt the spirits on her breath look at the state of her he laughed turned and stopped abruptly because shirley was right beside them smiling her pussycat smile has miss jawanda not arrived yet she asked shes on her way she just texted me said gaia but shirley did not really care where sukhvinder was she had overheard andrew and gaias little exchange about maureen and it had completely restored the good mood that had been dented by maureens evident delight in her own toilette it was difficult to satisfactorily puncture selfesteem so obtuse so deluded but as shirley walked away from the teenagers towards the dj she planned what she would say to howard the next time she saw him alone im afraid the young ones were well laughing at maureen its such a pity she wore that dress i hate seeing her make a fool of herself there was plenty to be pleased about shirley reminded herself for she needed a little bolstering tonight she and howard and miles were all going to be on the council together it would be marvellous simply marvellous she checked that the dj knew that howards favourite song was the green green grass of home tom jones version and looked around for more little jobs to do but instead her gaze fell upon the reason that her happiness tonight had not quite that perfect quality she had anticipated patricia was standing alone staring up at the pagford coat of arms on the wall and making no effort to talk to anybody shirley wished that patricia would wear a skirt sometimes but at least she had arrived alone shirley had been afraid that the bmw might contain another person and that absence was something gained you werent supposed to dislike your own child you were supposed to like them no matter what even if they were not what you wanted even if they turned out to be the kind of person that you would have crossed the street to avoid had you not been related howard took a large view of the whole matter he even joked about it in a mild way beyond patricias hearing shirley could not rise to those heights of detachment she felt compelled to join patricia in the vague unconscious hope that she might dilute the strangeness she was afraid everyone else would smell by her own exemplary dress and behaviour do you want a drink darling not yet said patricia still staring up at the pagford arms i had a heavy night last night probably still over the limit we were out drinking with mellys office pals shirley smiled vaguely up at the crest above them mellys fine thanks for asking said patricia oh good said shirley i liked the invitation said patricia pat and guest im sorry darling but thats just what you put you know when people arent married ah thats what it says in debretts does it well melly didnt want to come if she wasnt even named on the invitation so we had a massive row and here i am alone result eh patricia stalked away towards the drinks leaving shirley a little shaken behind her patricias rages had been frightening even as a child youre late miss jawanda she called recovering her composure as a flustered sukhvinder came hurrying towards her in shirleys opinion the girl was demonstrating a kind of insolence turning up at all after what her mother had said to howard here in this very hall she watched her hurry to join andrew and gaia and thought that she would tell howard that they ought to let sukhvinder go she was tardy and there was probably a hygiene issue with the eczema she was hiding under the longsleeved black tshirt shirley made a mental note to check whether it was contagious on her favourite medical website guests began to arrive promptly at eight oclock howard told gaia to come and stand beside him and collect coats because he wanted everyone to see him ordering her around by name in that little black dress and frilly apron but there were soon too many coats for her to carry alone so he summoned andrew to help nick a bottle gaia ordered andrew as they hung coats three and four deep in the tiny cloakroom and hide it in the kitchen we can take it in turns to go and have some ok said andrew elated gavin cried howard as his sons partner came through the door alone at halfpast eight kay not with you gavin asked shirley swiftly maureen was changing into sparkly stilettos behind the trestle table so there was very little time to steal a march on her no she couldnt make it unfortunately said gavin then to his horror he came face to face with gaia who was waiting to take his coat mum could have made it said gaia in a clear carrying voice as she glared at him but gavins dumped her havent you gav howard clapped gavin on the shoulder pretending he had not heard and boomed great to see you go get yourself a drink shirleys expression remained impassive but the thrill of the moment did not subside quickly and she was a little dazed and dreamy greeting the next few guests when maureen tottered over in her awful dress to join the greeting party shirley took immense pleasure in telling her quietly weve had a very awkward little scene very awkward gavin and gaias mother oh dear if wed known what whats happened but shirley shook her head savouring the exquisite pleasure of maureens frustrated curiosity and opened her arms wide as miles samantha and lexie entered the hall here he is parish councillor miles mollison samantha watched shirley hugging miles as though from a great distance she had moved so abruptly from happiness and anticipation to shock and disappointment that her thoughts had become white noise against which she had to fight to take in the exterior world miles had said thats great you can come to dads party you were only just saying yes she had replied i know it is great isnt it but when he had seen her dressed in the jeans and band tshirt she had been visualizing herself in for over a week he had been perplexed its formal miles its the church hall in pagford i know but the invitation im wearing this hello sammy said howard look at you you neednt have dressed up but his embrace was as lascivious as ever and he patted her tightly jeaned backside samantha gave shirley a cold tight smile and walked past her towards the drinks a nasty voice inside her head was asking but what did you think was going to happen at the concert anyway what was the point what were you after nothing a bit of fun the dream of strong young arms and laughter which was to have had some kind of catharsis tonight her own thin waist encircled again and the sharp taste of the new the unexplored her fantasy had lost wings it was plummeting back to earth i only wanted to look looking good sammy cheers pat she had not met her sisterinlaw for over a year i like you more than anyone else in this family pat miles had caught up with her he kissed his sister how are you hows mel isnt she here no she didnt want to come said patricia she was drinking champagne but from her expression it might have been vinegar the invitation said pat and guest are invited huge bloody row one up to mum oh pat come on said miles smiling oh pat fucking come on what miles a furious delight took hold of samantha a pretext to attack thats a bloody rude way to invite your sisters partner and you know it miles your mother could do with some lessons in manners if you ask me he was fatter surely than he had been a year ago she could see his neck bulging over the collar of his shirt his breath went sour quickly he had a little trick of bouncing on his toes that he had caught from his father she experienced a surge of physical disgust and walked away to the end of the trestle table where andrew and sukhvinder were busy filling and handing out glasses have you got any gin samantha asked give me a big one she barely recognized andrew he poured her a measure trying not to look at her breasts boundlessly exposed in the tshirt but it was like trying not to squint in direct sunlight do you know them samantha asked after downing half a glass of gin and tonic a blush had risen before andrew could marshal his thoughts to his horror she gave a reckless cackle and said the band im talking about the band yeah i yeah ive heard of them i dont not my kind of thing is that right she said throwing back the rest of her drink ill have another one of those please she realized who he was the mousy boy from the delicatessen his uniform made him look older maybe a couple of weeks of lugging pallets up and down the cellar steps had built some muscle oh look said samantha spotting a figure heading away from her into the growing crowd theres gavin the second most boring man in pagford after my husband obviously she strode off pleased with herself holding her new drink the gin had hit her where she most needed it anaesthetizing and stimulating at the same time and as she walked she thought he liked my tits lets see what he thinks of my arse gavin saw samantha coming and tried to deflect her by joining somebody elses conversation anybodys the nearest person was howard and he insinuated himself hastily into the group around his host i took a risk howard was saying to three other men he was waving a cigar and a little ash had dribbled down the front of his velvet jacket i took a risk and i put in the graft simple as that no magic formula nobody handed me oh heres sammy who are those young men samantha while four elderly men stared at the pop group stretched across her breasts samantha turned to gavin hi she said leaning in and forcing him to kiss her kay not here no said gavin shortly talking about business sammy said howard happily and samantha thought of her shop failed and finished i was a selfstarter he informed the group reprising what was clearly an established theme thats all there is to it thats all you need i was a selfstarter massive and globular he was like a miniature velvety sun radiating satisfaction and contentment his tones were already rounded and mellowed by the brandy in his hand i was ready to take a risk couldve lost everything well your mum could have lost everything samantha corrected him didnt hilda mortgage her house to put up half the deposit on the shop she saw the tiny flicker in howards eyes but his smile remained constant all credit to my mother then he said for working and scrimping and saving and giving her son a start i multiply what i was given and i give back to the family pay for your girls to go to st annes what goes round comes round eh sammy she expected this from shirley but not from howard both of them drained their glasses and samantha watched gavin drift away without trying to stop him gavin was wondering whether it would be possible to slip out unnoticed he was nervous and the noise was making it worse a horrible idea had taken possession of him since meeting gaia at the door what if kay had told her daughter everything what if the girl knew that he was in love with mary fairbrother and told other people it was the sort of thing that a vengeful sixteenyearold might do the very last thing he wanted was for pagford to know that he was in love with mary before he had a chance to tell her himself he had imagined doing it months and months hence perhaps a year down the line letting the first anniversary of barrys death slip by and in the mean time nurturing the tiny shoots of trust and reliance that were already there so that the reality of her feelings stole gradually upon her as they had upon him you havent got a drink gav said miles that situation must be remedied he led his partner firmly to the drinks table and poured him a beer talking all the while and like howard giving off an almost visible glow of happiness and pride you heard i won the seat gavin had not but he did not feel equal to feigning surprise yeah congratulations hows mary asked miles expansively he was a friend to the whole town tonight because it had elected him she doing ok yeah i think i heard she might be going to liverpool might be for the best what said gavin sharply maureen was saying this morning apparently marys sisters trying to persuade mary to go home with the kids shes still got a lot of family in liver this is her home i think it was barry who liked pagford im not sure mary will want to stay without him gaia was watching gavin through a chink in the kitchen door she was clutching a paper cup containing several fingers of the vodka that andrew had stolen for her hes such a bastard she said wed still be in hackney if he hadnt led mum on shes so bloody stupid i could have told her he wasnt that interested he never took her out he couldnt wait to leave after theyd shagged andrew who was piling additional sandwiches on an almost empty platter behind her could hardly believe that she was using words like shagged the chimeric gaia who filled his fantasies was a sexually inventive and adventurous virgin he did not know what the real gaia had done or not done with marco de luca her judgement on her mother made it sound as if she knew how men behaved after sex if they were interested drink something she told andrew as he approached the door with the platter and she held up her own polystyrene cup to his lips and he drank some of her vodka giggling a little she backed away to let him out and called after him make sooks come in here and get some the hall was crowded and noisy andrew put the pile of fresh sandwiches on the table but interest in the food seemed to have waned sukhvinder was struggling to keep up with demand at the drinks table and many people had started pouring their own gaia wants you in the kitchen andrew told sukhvinder and he took over from her there was no point acting like a bartender instead he filled as many glasses as he could find and left them on the table for people to help themselves hi peanut said lexie mollison can i have some champagne they had been at st thomass together but he had not seen her for a long time her accent had changed since she had been at st annes he hated being called peanut its there in front of you he said pointing lexie youre not drinking snapped samantha appearing out of the crowd absolutely not grandad said i dont care everyone else i said no lexie stomped away andrew glad to see her go smiled at samantha and was surprised when she beamed at him do you talk back to your parents yeah he said and she laughed her breasts really were enormous ladies and gentlemen boomed a voice through the microphone and everyone stopped talking to listen to howard wanted to say a few words most of you probably know by now that my son miles has just been elected to the parish council there was a smattering of applause and miles raised his drink high above his head to acknowledge it andrew was startled to hear samantha say quite clearly under her breath hoofuckingray nobody was coming for drinks now andrew slipped back into the kitchen gaia and sukhvinder were alone in there drinking and laughing and when they saw andrew they both shouted andy he laughed too are you both pissed yes said gaia and no said sukhvinder she is though i dont care said gaia mollison can sack me if he wants no point saving up for a ticket to hackney any more he wont sack you said andrew helping himself to some of the vodka youre his favourite yeah said gaia creepy old bastard and the three of them laughed again through the glass doors amplified by the microphone came maureens croaky voice come on then howard come on a duet for your birthday go on ladies and gentlemen howards favourite song the teenagers gazed at each other in tantalized horror gaia tripped forward giggling and pushed the door open the first few bars of the green green grass of home blared out and then in howards bass and maureens gravelly alto the old home town looks the same as i step down from the train gavin was the only one who heard the giggles and snorts but when he turned around all he saw were the double doors to the kitchen swinging a little on their hinges miles had left to chat with aubrey and julia fawley who had arrived late wreathed in polite smiles gavin was in the grip of a familiar mixture of dread and anxiety his brief sunlit haze of freedom and happiness had been overcast by the twin threats of gaia blabbing what he had said to her mother and of mary leaving pagford for ever what was he going to do down the lane i walk with my sweet mary hair of gold and lips like cherries kay not here samantha had arrived leaning against the table beside him smirking you already asked me that said gavin no everything ok with you two is that really any of your business it slipped out of him before he could stop it he was sick of her constant probing and jeering for once it was just the two of them miles was still busy with the fawleys she overacted being taken aback her eyes were bloodshot and her speech was deliberate for the first time gavin felt more dislike than intimidation im sorry i was only asking yeah he said as howard and maureen swayed arm in arm id like to see you settled down you and kay seemed good together yeah well i like my freedom said gavin i dont know many happily married couples samantha had drunk too much to feel the full force of the dig but she had the impression that one had been made marriages are always a mystery to outsiders she said carefully nobody can ever really know except the two people involved so you shouldnt judge gavin thanks for the insight he said and irritated past endurance he set down his empty beer can and headed towards the cloakroom samantha watched him leave sure that she had had the best of the encounter and turned her attention to her motherinlaw whom she could see through a gap in the crowd watching howard and maureen sing samantha relished shirleys anger which was expressed in the tightest coldest smile she had worn all evening howard and maureen had performed together many a time over the years howard loved to sing and maureen had once performed backing vocals for a local skiffle band when the song finished shirley clapped her hands together once she might have been summoning a flunkey and samantha laughed out loud and moved along to the bar end of the table which she was disappointed to find unmanned by the boy in the bow tie andrew gaia and sukhvinder were still convulsed in the kitchen they laughed because of howard and maureens duet and because they had finished twothirds of the vodka but mostly they laughed because they laughed feeding off each other until they could barely stand the little window over the sink propped ajar so that the kitchen did not become too steamy rattled and clattered and fats head appeared through it evening he said evidently he had climbed onto something outside because with a noise of scraping and a heavy object falling over more and more of him emerged through the window until he landed heavily on the draining board knocking several glasses to the ground where they shattered sukhvinder walked straight out of the kitchen andrew knew immediately that he did not want fats there only gaia seemed unperturbed still giggling she said theres a door you know no shit said fats wheres the drink this is ours said gaia cradling the vodka in her arms andy nicked it youll have to get your own not a problem said fats coolly and he walked through the doors into the hall need the loo mumbled gaia and she stowed the vodka bottle back under the sink and left the kitchen too andrew followed sukhvinder had returned to the bar area gaia was disappearing into the bathroom and fats was leaning against the trestle table with a beer in one hand and a sandwich in the other didnt think youd want to come to this said andrew i was invited mate said fats it was on the invitation whole wall family does cubby know youre here dunno said fats hes in hiding didnt get ol barrys seat after all the whole social fabricll collapse now cubbys not holding it together fucking hell thats horrible he added spitting out a mouthful of sandwich wanna fag the hall was so noisy and the guests so raucously drunk that nobody seemed to care where andrew went any more when they got outside they found patricia mollison alone beside her sports car looking up at the clear starry sky smoking you can have one of these she said offering her packet if you want after she had lit their cigarettes she stood at her ease with one hand balled deep in her pocket there was something about her that andrew found intimidating he could not even bring himself to glance at fats to gauge his reaction im pat she told them after a little while howard and shirleys daughter hi said andrew m andrew stuart said fats she did not seem to need to prolong conversation andrew felt it as a kind of compliment and tried to emulate her indifference the silence was broken by footsteps and the sound of muffled girls voices gaia was dragging sukhvinder outside by the hand she was laughing and andrew could tell that the full effect of the vodka was still intensifying inside her you said gaia to fats are really horrible to sukhvinder stop it said sukhvinder tugging against gaias hand im serious let me he is said gaia breathlessly you are do you put stuff on her facebook stop it shouted sukhvinder she wrenched herself free and plunged back inside the party you are horrible to her said gaia grabbing onto the railings for support calling her a lesbian and stuff nothing wrong with being a lesbian said patricia her eyes narrowed through the smoke she was inhaling but then i would say that andrew saw fats look at pat sideways i never said there was anything wrong with it its only jokes he said gaia slid down the rails to sit on the chilly pavement her head in her arms you all right andrew asked if fats had not been there he would have sat down too pissed she muttered might do better to stick your fingers down your throat suggested patricia looking down at her dispassionately nice car fats said eyeing the bmw yeah said patricia new i make double what my brother makes she said but miles is the christ child miles the messiah parish councillor mollison the second of pagford do you like pagford she asked fats while andrew watched gaia breathing deeply her head between her knees no said fats its a shithole yeah well i couldnt wait to leave personally did you know barry fairbrother a bit said fats something in his voice made andrew worried he was my reading mentor at st thomass said patricia with her eyes still on the end of the street lovely bloke i would have come back for the funeral but melly and i were in zermatt whats all this stuff my mothers been gloating about this barrys ghost stuff someone putting stuff on the parish council website said andrew hastily afraid of what fats might say if he let him rumours and stuff yeah my mother would love that said patricia wonder what the ghostll say next fats asked with a sidelong glance at andrew probably stop now the elections over muttered andrew oh i dunno said fats if theres stuff old barrys ghost is still pissed off about he knew that he was making andrew anxious and he was glad of it andrew was spending all his time at his poxy job these days and he would soon be moving fats did not owe andrew anything true authenticity could not exist alongside guilt and obligation you all right down there patricia asked gaia who nodded with her face still hidden what was it the drink or the duet that made you feel sick andrew laughed a little bit out of politeness and because he wanted to keep the subject away from the ghost of barry fairbrother turned my stomach too said patricia old maureen and my father singing along together arm in arm patricia took a final fierce drag on her cigarette and threw the end down grinding it beneath her heel i walked in on her blowing him when i was twelve she said and he gave me a fiver not to tell my mother andrew and fats stood transfixed scared even to look at each other patricia wiped her face on the back of her hand she was crying shouldnt have bloody come she said knew i shouldnt she got into the bmw and the two boys watched stunned as she turned on the engine reversed out of her parking space and drove away into the night fuck me said fats i think i might be sick whispered gaia mr mollison wants you back inside for the drinks her message delivered sukhvinder darted away again i cant whispered gaia andrew left her there the din in the hall hit him as he opened the inner doors the disco was in full swing he had to move aside to allow aubrey and julia fawley room to leave both with their backs to the party looked grimly pleased to be going samantha mollison was not dancing but was leaning up against the trestle table where so recently there had been rows and rows of drinks while sukhvinder rushed around collecting glasses andrew unpacked the last box of clean ones set them out and filled them your bow ties crooked samantha told him and she leaned across the table and straightened it for him embarrassed he ducked into the kitchen as soon as she let go between each load of glasses he put in the dishwasher andrew took another swig of the vodka he had stolen he wanted to be drunk like gaia he wanted to return to that moment when they had been laughing uncontrollably together before fats had appeared after ten minutes he checked the drinks table again samantha was still propped up against it glassyeyed and there were plenty of freshpoured drinks left for her to enjoy howard was bobbing in the middle of the dance floor sweat pouring down his face roaring with laughter at something maureen had said to him andrew wound his way through the crowd and back outside he could not see where she was at first then he spotted them gaia and fats were locked together ten yards away from the door leaning up against the railings bodies pressed tight against each other tongues working in each others mouths look im sorry but i cant do it all said sukhvinder desperately from behind him then she spotted fats and gaia and let out something between a yelp and a sob andrew walked back into the hall with her completely numb in the kitchen he poured the remainder of the vodka into a glass and downed it in one mechanically he filled the sink and set to washing out the glasses that could not fit in the dishwasher the alcohol was not like dope it made him feel empty but also keen to hit someone fats for instance after a while he realized that the plastic clock on the kitchen wall had leapt from midnight to one and that people were leaving he was supposed to find coats he tried for a while but then lurched off to the kitchen again leaving sukhvinder in charge samantha was leaning up against the fridge on her own with a glass in her hand andrews vision was strangely jerky like a series of stills gaia had not come back she was doubtless long gone with fats samantha was talking to him she was drunk too he was not embarrassed by her any more he suspected that he might be sick quite soon hate bloody pagford said samantha and but youre young enough to get out yeah he said unable to feel his lips an i will nigh will she pushed his hair off his forehead and called him sweet the image of gaia with her tongue in fats mouth threatened to obliterate everything he could smell samanthas perfume coming in waves from her hot skin that bands shit he said pointing at her chest but he did not think she heard him her mouth was chapped and warm and her breasts were huge pressed against his chest her back was as broad as his what the fuck andrew was slumped against the draining board and samantha was being dragged out of the kitchen by a big man with short greying hair andrew had a dim idea that something bad had happened but the strange flickering quality of reality was becoming more and more pronounced until the only thing to do was to stagger across the room to the bin and throw up again and again and again sorry you cant come in he heard sukhvinder tell someone stuff piled up against the door he tied the bin bag tightly on his own vomit sukhvinder helped him clear the kitchen he needed to throw up twice more but both times managed to get to the bathroom it was nearly two oclock by the time howard sweaty but smiling thanked them and said goodnight very good work he said see you tomorrow then very good wheres miss bawden by the way andrew left sukhvinder to come up with a lie out in the street he unchained simons bicycle and wheeled it away into the darkness the long cold walk back to hilltop house cleared his head but assuaged neither his bitterness nor his misery had he ever told fats that he fancied gaia maybe not but fats knew he knew that fats knew were they perhaps shagging right now im moving anyway andrew thought bent over and shivering as he pushed the bicycle up the hill so fuck them then he thought id better be moving had he just snogged lexie mollisons mother had her husband walked in on them had that really happened he was scared of miles but he also wanted to tell fats about it to see his face when he let himself into the house exhausted simons voice came out of the darkness from the kitchen have you put my bike in the garage he was sitting at the kitchen table eating a bowl of cereal it was nearly halfpast two in the morning couldnt sleep said simon for once he was not angry ruth was not there so he did not have to prove himself bigger or smarter than his sons he seemed weary and small think were gonna have to move to reading pizza face said simon it was almost a term of endearment shivering slightly feeling old and shellshocked and immensely guilty andrew wanted to give his father something to make up for what he had done it was time to redress balances and claim simon as an ally they were a family they had to move together perhaps it could be better somewhere else ive got something for you he said come through here found out how to do it at school and he led the way to the computer iv a misty blue sky stretched like a dome over pagford and the fields dawn light shone upon the old stone war memorial in the square on the cracked concrete façades of foley road and turned the white walls of hilltop house pale gold as ruth price climbed into her car ready for another long shift at the hospital she looked down at the river orr shining like a silver ribbon in the distance and felt how completely unjust it was that somebody else would soon have her house and her view a mile below in church row samantha mollison was still sound asleep in the spare bedroom there was no lock on the door but she had barricaded it with an armchair before collapsing semidressed onto the bed the beginnings of a vicious headache disturbed her slumber and the sliver of sunshine that had penetrated the gap in the curtains fell like a laser beam across the corner of one eye she twitched a little in the depths of her drymouthed anxious halfsleep and her dreams were guilty and strange downstairs among the clean bright surfaces of the kitchen miles sat bolt upright and alone with an untouched mug of tea in front of him staring at the fridge and stumbling again in his minds eye upon his drunken wife locked in the embrace of a sixteenyearold schoolboy howard mollison was sleeping soundly and happily in his double bed the patterned curtains dappled him with pink petals and protected him from a rude awakening but his rattling wheezing snores had roused his wife shirley was eating toast and drinking coffee in the kitchen wearing her glasses and her candlewick dressing gown she visualized maureen swaying arm in arm with her husband in the village hall and experienced a concentrated loathing that took the taste from every mouthful in the smithy a few miles outside pagford gavin hughes soaped himself under a hot shower and wondered why he had never had the courage of other men and how they managed to make the right choices among almost infinite alternatives there was a yearning inside him for a life he had glimpsed but never tasted yet he was afraid choice was dangerous you had to forgo all other possibilities when you chose kay bawden was lying awake and exhausted in bed in hope street listening to the early morning quiet of pagford and watching gaia who was asleep beside her in the double bed pale and drained in the early daylight there was a bucket next to gaia on the floor placed there by kay who had half carried her daughter from bathroom to bedroom in the early hours after holding her hair out of the toilet for an hour why did you make us come here gaia had wailed as she choked and retched over the bowl get off me get off i fuck i hate you kay watched the sleeping face and recalled the beautiful little baby who had slept beside her sixteen years ago she remembered the tears that gaia had shed when kay had split up with steve her livein partner of eight years steve had attended gaias parents evenings and taught her to ride a bicycle kay remembered the fantasy she had nurtured with hindsight as silly as fouryearold gaias wish for a unicorn that she would settle down with gavin and give gaia at last a permanent stepfather and a beautiful house in the country how desperate she had been for a storybook ending and a life to which gaia would always want to return because her daughters departure was hurtling towards kay like a meteorite and she foresaw the loss of gaia as a calamity that would shatter her world kay reached out a hand beneath the duvet and held gaias the feel of the warm flesh that she had accidentally brought into the world made kay start to weep quietly but so violently that the mattress shook and at the bottom of church row parminder jawanda slipped a coat on over her nightdress and took her coffee into the back garden sitting in the chilly sunlight on a wooden bench she saw that it was promising to be a beautiful day but there seemed to be a blockage between her eyes and her heart the heavy weight on her chest deadened everything the news that miles mollison had won barrys seat on the parish council had not been a surprise but on seeing shirleys neat little announcement on the website she had known another flicker of that madness that had overtaken her at the last meeting a desire to attack superseded almost at once by stifling hopelessness im going to resign from the council she told vikram whats the point but you like it he had said she had liked it when barry had been there too it was easy to conjure him up this morning when everything was quiet and still a little gingerbearded man she had been taller than him by half a head she had never felt the slightest physical attraction towards him what was love after all thought parminder as a gentle breeze ruffled the tall hedge of leyland cypresses that enclosed the jawandas big back lawn was it love when somebody filled a space in your life that yawned inside you once they had gone i did love laughing thought parminder i really miss laughing and it was the memory of laughter that at last made the tears flow from her eyes they trickled down her nose and into her coffee where they made little bullet holes swiftly erased she was crying because she never seemed to laugh any more and also because the previous evening while they had been listening to the jubilant distant thump of the disco in the church hall vikram had said why dont we visit amritsar this summer the golden temple the holiest shrine of the religion to which he was indifferent she had known at once what vikram was doing time lay slack and empty on her hands as never before in her life neither of them knew what the gmc would decide to do with her once it had considered her ethical breach towards howard mollison mandeep says its a big tourist trap she had replied dismissing amritsar at a stroke sukhvinder had crossed the lawn without parminder noticing she was dressed in jeans and a baggy sweatshirt parminder hastily wiped her face and squinted at sukhvinder who had her back to the sun i dont want to go to work today parminder responded at once in the same spirit of automatic contradiction that had made her turn down amritsar youve made a commitment sukhvinder i dont feel well you mean youre tired youre the one who wanted this job now you fulfil your obligations but youre going to work snapped parminder and she might have been pronouncing sentence youre not giving the mollisons another reason to complain after sukhvinder walked back to the house parminder felt guilty she almost called her daughter back but instead she made a mental note that she must try and find time to sit down with her and talk to her without arguing v krystal was walking along foley road in the early morning sunlight eating a banana it was an unfamiliar taste and texture and she could not make up her mind whether she liked it or not terri and krystal never bought fruit nikkis mother had just turfed her unceremoniously out of the house we got things to do krystal she had said were going to nikkis grans for dinner as an afterthought she had handed krystal the banana to eat for breakfast krystal had left without protest there was barely enough room for nikkis family around the kitchen table the fields were not improved by sunshine which merely showed up the dirt and the damage the cracks in the concrete walls the boarded windows and the litter the square in pagford looked freshly painted whenever the sun shone twice a year the primary school children had walked through the middle of town crocodile fashion on their way to church for christmas and easter services nobody had ever wanted to hold krystals hand fats had told them all that she had fleas she wondered whether he remembered there had been hanging baskets full of flowers splashes of purple pink and green and every time krystal had passed one of the planted troughs outside the black canon she had pulled off a petal each one had been cool and slippery in her fingers swiftly becoming slimy and brown as she clutched it and she usually wiped it off on the underside of a warm wooden pew in st michaels she let herself into her house and saw at once through the open door to her left that terri had not gone to bed she was sitting in her armchair with her eyes closed and her mouth open krystal closed the door with a snap but terri did not stir krystal was at terris side in four strides shaking her thin arm terris head fell forwards onto her shrunken chest she snored krystal let go of her the vision of a dead man in the bathroom swam back into her subconscious silly bitch she said then it occurred to her that robbie was not there she pounded up the stairs shouting for him mere she heard him say from behind her own closed bedroom door when she shouldered it open she saw robbie standing there naked behind him scratching his bare chest lying on her own mattress was obbo all righ krys he said grinning she seized robbie and pulled him into his own room her hands trembled so badly that it took her ages to dress him did e do somethin to yer she whispered to robbie mungry said robbie when he was dressed she picked him up and ran downstairs she could hear obbo moving around in her bedroom whys e ere she shouted at terri who was drowsily awake in her chair whys e with robbie robbie fought to get out of her arms he hated shouting an wha the fucks that screamed krystal spotting for the first time two black holdalls lying beside terris armchair snuthin said terri vaguely but krystal had already forced one of the zips open snuthin shouted terri big bricklike blocks of hashish wrapped neatly in sheets of polythene krystal who could barely read who could not have identified half the vegetables in a supermarket who could not have named the prime minister knew that the contents of the bag if discovered on the premises meant prison for her mother then she saw the tin with the coachman and horses on the lid halfprotruding from the chair on which terri was sitting yehve used said krystal breathlessly as disaster rained invisibly around her and everything collapsed yehve fuckin she heard obbo on the stairs and she snatched up robbie again he wailed and struggled in her arms frightened by her anger but krystals grip was unbreakable fuckin lerrim go called terri fruitlessly krystal had opened the front door and was running as fast as she could encumbered by robbie who was resisting and moaning back along the road vi shirley showered and pulled clothes out of the wardrobe while howard slept noisily on the church bell of st michael and all saints ringing for ten oclock matins reached her as she buttoned up her cardigan she always thought how loud it must be for the jawandas living right opposite and hoped that it struck them as a loud proclamation of pagfords adherence to the old ways and traditions of which they so conspicuously were not a part automatically because it was what she so often did shirley walked along the hall turned into patricias old bedroom and sat down at the computer patricia ought to be here sleeping on the sofabed that shirley had made up for her it was a relief not to have to deal with her this morning howard who had still been humming the green green grass of home when they arrived at ambleside in the early hours had not realized that patricia was absent until shirley had had the key in the front door wheres pat he had wheezed leaning against the porch oh she was upset that melly didnt want to come sighed shirley they had a row or something i expect shes gone home to try and patch things up never a dull moment said howard bouncing lightly off alternate walls of the narrow hallway as he navigated his way carefully towards the bedroom shirley brought up her favourite medical website when she typed in the first letter of the condition she wished to investigate the site offered its explanation of epipens again so shirley swiftly revised their use and content because she might yet have an opportunity to save their potboys life next she carefully typed in eczema and learned somewhat to her disappointment that the condition was not infectious and could not therefore be used as an excuse to sack sukhvinder jawanda from sheer force of habit she then typed in the address of the pagford parish council website and clicked onto the message board she had grown to recognize at a glance the shape and length of the user name theghostofbarryfairbrother just as a besotted lover knows at once the back of their beloveds head or the set of their shoulders or the tilt of their walk a single glimpse at the topmost message sufficed excitement exploded he had not forsaken her she had known that dr jawandas outburst could not go unpunished affair of the first citizen of pagford she read it but did not at first understand she had been expecting to see parminders name she read it again and gave the suffocated gasp of a woman being hit by icy water howard mollison first citizen of pagford and longstanding resident maureen lowe have been more than business partners for many years it is common knowledge that maureen holds regular tastings of howards finest salami the only person who appears not to be in on the secret is shirley howards wife completely motionless in her chair shirley thought its not true it could not be true yes she had once or twice suspected had hinted sometimes to howard no she would not believe it she could not believe it but other people would they would believe the ghost everybody believed him her hands were like empty gloves fumbling and feeble as she tried with many a blunder to remove the message from the site every second that it remained there somebody else might be reading it believing it laughing about it passing it to the local newspaper howard and maureen howard and maureen the message was gone shirley sat and stared at the computer monitor her thoughts scurrying like mice in a glass bowl trying to escape but there was no way out no firm foothold no way of climbing back to the happy place she had occupied before she saw that dreadful thing written in public for the world to see he had laughed at maureen no she had laughed at maureen howard had laughed at kenneth always together holidays and workdays and weekend excursions only person who appears not to be in on the secret she and howard did not need sex separate beds for years they had a silent understanding holds regular tastings of howards finest salami shirleys mother was alive in the room with her cackling and jeering a glass slopping wine shirley could not bear dirty laughter she had never been able to bear ribaldry or ridicule she jumped up tripping over the chair legs and hurried back to the bedroom howard was still asleep lying on his back making rumbling porcine noises howard she said howard it took a whole minute to rouse him he was confused and disorientated but as she stood over him she saw him still as a knight protector who could save her howard the ghost of barry fairbrothers put up another message disgruntled at his rude awakening howard made a growling groaning noise into the pillow about you said shirley they did very little plain speaking she and howard she had always liked that but today she was driven to it about you she repeated and maureen it says youve been having an affair his big hand slid up over his face and he rubbed his eyes he rubbed them longer she was convinced than he needed what he said his face shielded you and maureen having an affair wheres he get that from no denial no outrage no scathing laughter merely a cautious request for a source ever afterwards shirley would remember this moment as a death a life truly ended vii fuckin shurrup robbie shurrup krystal had dragged robbie to a bus stop several streets away so that neither obbo nor terri could find them she was not sure she had enough money for the fare but she was determined to get to pagford nana cath was gone mr fairbrother was gone but fats wall was there and she needed to make a baby why wuz e in the room with yeh krystal shouted at robbie who grizzled and did not answer there was only a tiny amount of battery power left on terris mobile phone krystal called fats number but it went to voicemail in church row fats was busy eating toast and listening to his parents having one of their familiar bizarre conversations in the study across the hall it was a welcome distraction from his own thoughts the mobile in his pocket vibrated but he did not answer it there was nobody he wanted to talk to it would not be andrew not after last night colin you know what youre supposed to do his mother was saying she sounded exhausted please colin we had dinner with them on saturday night the night before he died i cooked what if colin you didnt put anything in the food for gods sake now im doing it im not supposed to do this colin you know im not supposed to get into it this is your ocd talking but i mightve tess i suddenly thought what if i put something then why are we alive you me and mary they did a postmortem colin nobody told us the details mary never told us i think thats why she doesnt want to talk to me any more she suspects colin for christs sake tessas voice became an urgent whisper too quiet to hear fats mobile vibrated again he pulled it out of his pocket krystals number he answered hiya said krystal over what sounded like a kid shouting dyou wanna meet up dunno yawned fats he had been intending to go to bed im comin into pagford on the bus we could hook up last night he had pressed gaia bawden into the railings outside the town hall until she had pulled away from him and thrown up then she had started to berate him again so he had left her there and walked home i dunno he said he felt so tired so miserable go on she said from the study he heard colin you say that but would it show up what if i colin we shouldnt be going into this youre not supposed to take these ideas seriously how can you say that to me how can i not take it seriously if im responsible yeah all right said fats to krystal ill meet you in twenty front of the pub in the square viii samantha was driven from the spare room at last by her urgent need to pee she drank cold water from the tap in the bathroom until she felt sick gulped down two paracetamol from the cabinet over the sink then took a shower she dressed without looking at herself in the mirror through everything she did she was alert for some noise that would indicate the whereabouts of miles but the house seemed to be silent perhaps she thought he had taken lexie out somewhere away from her drunken lecherous cradlesnatching mother he was in lexies class at school miles had spat at her once they were alone in their bedroom she had waited for him to move away from the door then wrenched it back open and run to the spare room nausea and mortification came over her in waves she wished she could forget that she had blacked out but she could still see the boys face as she launched herself at him she could remember the feel of his body pressed against her so skinny so young if it had been vikram jawanda there might have been some dignity in it she had to get coffee she could not stay in the bathroom for ever but as she turned to open the door she saw herself in the mirror and her courage almost failed her face was puffy her eyes hooded the lines in her face etched more deeply by pressure and dehydration oh god what must he have thought of me miles was sitting in the kitchen when she entered she did not look at him but crossed straight to the cupboard where the coffee was before she had touched the handle he said ive got some here thanks she muttered and poured herself out a mug avoiding eye contact ive sent lexie over to mum and dads said miles we need to talk samantha sat down at the kitchen table go on then she said go on is that all you can say youre the one who wants to talk last night said miles at my fathers birthday party i came to look for you and i found you snogging a sixteenyear sixteenyearold yes said samantha legal one good thing he stared at her appalled you think this is funny if youd found me so drunk that i didnt even realize i did realize said samantha she refused to be shirley to cover everything up with a frilly little tablecloth of polite fiction she wanted to be honest and she wanted to penetrate that thick coating of complacency through which she no longer recognized a young man she had loved you did realize what said miles he had so plainly expected embarrassment and contrition that she almost laughed i did realize that i was kissing him she said he stared at her and her courage seeped away because she knew what he was going to say next and if lexie had walked in samantha had no answer to that the thought of lexie knowing what had happened made her want to run away and not come back and what if the boy told her they had been at school together she had forgotten what pagford was like what the hells going on with you asked miles im unhappy said samantha why asked miles but then he added quickly is it the shop is it that a bit said samantha but i hate living in pagford i hate living on top of your parents and sometimes she said slowly i hate waking up next to you she thought he might get angry but instead he asked quite calmly are you saying you dont love me any more i dont know said samantha maybe hell be the first of many yelled samantha getting up from the table and slamming her mug down in the sink the handle came off in her hand dont you get it miles ive had enough i hate our fucking life and i hate your fucking parents you dont mind them paying for the girls education i hate you turning into your father in front of me absolute bollocks you just dont like me being happy when youre not whereas my darling husband doesnt give a shit how i feel plenty for you to do round here but youd rather sit at home and sulk i dont intend to sit at home any more miles not going to apologize for getting involved with the community well i meant what i said youre not fit to fill his shoes what he said and his chair fell over as he jumped to his feet while samantha strode to the kitchen door you heard me she shouted like my letter said miles youre not fit to fill barry fairbrothers shoes he was sincere your letter he said yep she said breathlessly with her hand on the doorknob i sent that letter too much to drink one evening while you were on the phone to your mother and she pulled the door open i didnt vote for you either the look on his face unnerved her out in the hall she slipped on clogs the first pair of shoes she could find and was through the front door before he could catch up ix the journey took krystal back to her childhood she had made this trip daily to st thomass all on her own on the bus she knew when the abbey would come into sight and she pointed it out to robbie see the big ruin castle robbie was hungry but slightly distracted by the excitement of being on a bus krystal held his hand tightly she had promised him food when they got off at the other end but she did not know where she would get it perhaps she could borrow money from fats for a bag of crisps not to mention the return bus fare i wen ter school ere she told robbie while he wiped his fingers on the dirty windows making abstract patterns an youll go to school ere too when they rehoused her because of her pregnancy they were almost certain to give her another fields house nobody wanted to buy them they were so run down but krystal saw this as a good thing because in spite of their dilapidation it would put robbie and the baby in the catchment area for st thomass anyway fats parents would almost certainly give her enough money for a washing machine once she had their grandchild they might even get a television the bus rolled down a slope towards pagford and krystal caught a glimpse of the glittering river briefly visible before the road sank too low she had been disappointed when she joined the rowing team that they did not train on the orr but on the dirty old canal in yarvil ere we are krystal told robbie as the bus turned slowly into the flowerdecked square fats had forgotten that waiting in front of the black canon meant standing opposite mollison and lowes and the copper kettle there was more than an hour to go until midday when the café opened on sundays but fats did not know how early andrew had to arrive for work he had no desire to see his oldest friend this morning so he skulked down the side of the pub out of sight and only emerged when the bus arrived it pulled away revealing krystal and a small dirtylooking boy nonplussed fats loped towards them es my brother said krystal aggressively in response to something she had seen in fats face fats made another mental adjustment to what gritty and authentic life meant he had been fleetingly taken with the idea of knocking krystal up and showing cubby what real men were able to achieve casually without effort but this little boy clinging to his sisters hand and leg disconcerted him fats wished that he had not agreed to meet her she was making him ridiculous he would rather have gone back to that stinking squalid house of hers now that he saw her in the square ave yeh got any money krystal demanded what said fats his wits were slow with tiredness he could not remember now why he had wanted to sit up all night his tongue was throbbing with all the cigarettes he had smoked money repeated krystal es ungry an ive lost a fiver pay yeh back fats stuck a hand in his jeans pocket and touched a crumpled bank note somehow he did not want to look too flush in front of krystal so he ferreted deeper for change and finally came up with a small amount of silver and coppers they went to the tiny newsagents two streets from the square and fats hung around outside while krystal bought robbie crisps and a packet of rolos none of them said a word not even robbie who seemed fearful of fats at last when krystal had handed her brother the crisps she said to fats wherell we go surely he thought she could not mean that they were going to shag not with the boy there he had had some idea of taking her to the cubby hole it was private and it would be a final desecration of his and andrews friendship he owed nothing to anyone any more but he baulked at the idea of fucking in front of a threeyearold ell be all right said krystal es got chocolates now no later she said to robbie who was whining for the rolos still in her hand when youve ad the crisps they walked off down the road in the direction of the old stone bridge ell be all right krystal repeated e does as es told dontcha she said loudly to robbie wan chocolates he said yeah in a minute she could tell that fats needed cajoling today she had known on the bus that bringing robbie however necessary would be difficult whatcha bin up ter she asked party last night said fats yeah who wuz there he yawned widely and she had to wait for an answer arf price sukhvinder jawanda gaia bawden does she live in pagford asked krystal sharply yeah in hope street said fats he knew because andrew had let it slip where she lived andrew had never said that he liked her but fats had watched him watching gaia almost constantly in the few classes they shared he had noticed andrews extreme selfconsciousness around her and whenever she was mentioned krystal though was thinking about gaias mother the only social worker she had ever liked the only one who had got through to her mother she lived in hope street the same as nana cath she was probably there right now what if but kay had left them mattie was their social worker again anyway you werent supposed to bother them at home shane tully had once followed his social worker to her house and hed got a restraining order for his pains but then shane had earlier tried to heave a brick through the womans car window and krystal reasoned squinting as the road turned and the river dazzled her eyes with thousands of blinding white spots of light kay was still the keeper of folders the scorekeeper and the judge she had seemed all right but none of her solutions would keep krystal and robbie together we could go down there she suggested to fats pointing at the overgrown stretch of bank a little way along from the bridge an robbie could wait up there on the bench she would be able to keep an eye on him from there she thought and she would make sure he didnt see anything not that it was anything he had not seen before in the days that terri brought strangers home but exhausted as he was fats was revolted he could not do it in the grass under the eye of a small boy nah he said trying to sound offhand e won bother said krystal es got is rolos e won even know she said although she thought that was a lie robbie knew too much there had been trouble at nursery when hed mimicked doing it doggystyle on another child krystals mother fats remembered was a prostitute he hated the idea of what she was suggesting but was that not inauthenticity whassamatter krystal asked him aggressively nothing he said dane tully would do it pikey pritchard would do it cubby not in a million years krystal walked robbie to the bench fats bent to peer over the back of it down to the overgrown patch of weeds and bushes and thought that the kid might not see anything but that he would be as quick as he could in any case ere yare krystal told robbie pulling out the long tube of rolos while he reached for them excitedly yeh can ave all of em if yeh jus sit ere fer a minute all righ yeh jus sit ere robbie an ill be in them bushes dyeh understand robbie yeah he said happily his cheeks already full of chocolate and toffee krystal slipped and slid down the bank towards the patch of undergrowth hoping that fats was not going to make any difficulties about doing it without a condom x gavin was wearing sunglasses against the glare of the morning sun but that was no disguise samantha mollison was sure to recognize his car when he caught sight of her striding along the pavement alone with her hands in her pockets and her head down gavin made a sharp left turn and instead of continuing along the road to marys crossed the old stone bridge and parked up a side lane on the other side of the river he did not want samantha to see him parking outside marys house it did not matter on work days when he wore a suit and carried a briefcase it had not mattered before he had admitted to himself what he felt about mary but it mattered now in any case the morning was glorious and a walk bought him time still keeping my options open he thought as he crossed the bridge on foot there was a small boy sitting by himself on a bench eating sweets below him i dont have to say anything ill play it by ear but his palms were wet the thought of gaia telling the fairbrother twins that he was in love with their mother had haunted him all through a restless night mary seemed pleased to see him wheres your car she asked peering over his shoulder parked it down by the river he said lovely morning i fancied a walk and then it occurred to me that i could mow the lawn if you oh graham did it for me she said but thats so sweet of you come in and have a coffee she chatted as she moved around the kitchen she was wearing old cutoff jeans and a tshirt they showed how thin she was but her hair was shiny again the way he usually thought of it he could see the twin girls lying out on the freshly mown lawn on a blanket both with headphones in listening to their ipods how are you mary asked sitting down beside him he could not think why she sounded so concerned then he remembered that he had found time to tell her yesterday during his brief visit that he and kay had split up im ok he said probably for the best she smiled and patted his arm i heard last night he said his mouth a little dry that you might be moving news travels fast in pagford she said its just an idea theresa wants me to move back to liverpool and how do the kids feel about that well id wait for the girls and fergus to do their exams in june declans not so much of a problem i mean none of us wants to leave she melted into tears in front of him but he was so happy that he reached out to touch her delicate wrist of course you dont barrys grave ah said gavin his happiness snuffed out like a candle mary wiped her streaming eyes on the back of her hand gavin found her a little morbid his family cremated their dead barrys burial had only been the second he had ever attended and he had hated everything about it gavin saw a grave purely as a marker for the place where a corpse was decomposing a nasty thought yet people took it into their heads to visit and bring flowers as though it might yet recover she had got up to get tissues outside on the lawn the twins had switched to sharing a set of headphones their heads bobbing up and down in time to the same song so miles got barrys seat she said i could hear the celebrations all the way up here last night well it was howards yeah thats right said gavin and pagfords nearly rid of the fields she said yeah looks like it and now miles is on the council itll be easier to close bellchapel she said gavin always had to remind himself what bellchapel was he had no interest in these issues at all yeah i suppose so so everything barry wanted is finished she said her tears had dried up and the patches of high angry colour had returned to her cheeks i know he said its really sad i dont know she said still flushed and angry why should pagford pick up the bills for the fields barry only ever saw one side of it he thought everyone in the fields was like him he thought krystal weedon was like him but she wasnt it never occurred to him that people in the fields might be happy where they are yeah said gavin overjoyed that she disagreed with barry and feeling as if the shadow of his grave had lifted from between them i know what you mean from all ive heard about krystal weedon she got more of his time and his attention than his own daughters said mary and she never even gave a penny for his wreath the girls told me the whole rowing team chipped in except krystal and she didnt come to his funeral even after all hed done for her yeah well that shows im sorry but i cant stop thinking about it all she said frenetically i cant stop thinking that hed still want me to worry about bloody krystal weedon i cant get past it all the last day of his life and he had a headache and he didnt do anything about it writing that bloody article i know said gavin i know i think he said with a sense of putting his foot tentatively on an old rope bridge its a bloke thing miles is the same samantha didnt want him to stand for the council but he went ahead anyway you know some men really like a bit of power barry wasnt in it for power said mary and gavin hastily retreated no no barry wasnt he was in it for he couldnt help himself she said he thought everyone was like him that if you gave them a hand theyd start bettering themselves yeah said gavin but the point is there are other people who could use a hand people at home well exactly said mary dissolving yet again into tears mary said gavin leaving his chair moving to her side on the rope bridge now with a sense of mingled panic and anticipation look its really early i mean its far too soon but youll meet someone else at forty sobbed mary with four children plenty of men he began but that was no good he would rather she did not think she had too many options the right man he corrected himself wont care that youve got kids anyway theyre such nice kids anyone would be glad to take them on oh gavin youre so sweet she said dabbing her eyes again he put his arm around her and she did not shrug it off they stood without speaking while she blew her nose and then he felt her tense to move away and he said mary what ive got to mary i think im in love with you he knew for a few seconds the glorious pride of the skydiver who pushes off firm floor into limitless space then she pulled away gavin i im sorry he said observing with alarm her repulsed expression i wanted you to hear it from me i told kay thats why i wanted to split up and i was scared youd hear it from someone else i wouldnt have said anything for months years he added trying to bring back her smile and the mood in which she found him sweet but mary was shaking her head arms folded over her thin chest gavin i never ever forget i said anything he said foolishly lets just forget it i thought you understood she said he gathered that he should have known that she was encased in the invisible armour of grief and that it ought to have protected her i do understand he lied i wouldnt have told you only barry always said you fancied me said mary i didnt he said frantically gavin i think youre such a nice man she said breathlessly but i dont i mean even if no he said loudly trying to drown her out i understand listen im going to go theres no need but he almost hated her now he had heard what she was trying to say even if i werent grieving for my husband i wouldnt want you his visit had been so brief that when mary slightly shaky poured away his coffee it was still hot xi howard had told shirley that he did not feel well that he thought he had better stay in bed and rest and that the copper kettle could run without him for an afternoon ill call mo he said no ill call her said shirley sharply as she closed the bedroom door on him shirley thought hes using his heart he had said dont be silly shirl and then its rubbish bloody rubbish and she had not pressed him years of genteel avoidance of grisly topics shirley had been literally struck dumb when twentythreeyearold patricia had said im gay mum seemed to have muzzled something inside her the doorbell rang lexie said dad told me to come round here he and mum have got something to do wheres grandad in bed said shirley he overdid it a bit last night it was a good party wasnt it said lexie yes lovely said shirley with a tempest building inside her after a while her granddaughters prattling wore shirley down lets have lunch at the café she suggested howard she called through the closed bedroom door im taking lexie for lunch at the copper kettle he sounded worried and she was glad she was not afraid of maureen she would look maureen right in the face but it occurred to shirley as she walked that howard might have telephoned maureen the moment she had left the bungalow she was so stupid somehow she had thought that in calling maureen herself about howards illness she had stopped them communicating she was forgetting the familiar wellloved streets seemed different strange she had taken a regular inventory of the window she presented to this lovely little world wife and mother hospital volunteer secretary to the parish council first citizeness and pagford had been her mirror reflecting in its polite respect her value and her worth but the ghost had taken a rubber stamp and smeared across the pristine surface of her life a revelation that would nullify it all her husband was sleeping with his business partner and she never knew it would be all that anyone said when she was mentioned all that they ever remembered about her she pushed open the door of the café the bell tinkled and lexie said theres peanut price howard all right croaked maureen just tired said shirley moving smoothly to a table and sitting down her heart beating so fast that she wondered whether she might have a coronary herself tell him neither of the girls has turned up said maureen crossly lingering by their table and neither of them bothered to call in either its lucky were not busy lexie went to the counter to talk to andrew who had been put on waiter duty conscious of her unusual solitude as she sat alone at the table shirley remembered mary fairbrother erect and gaunt at barrys funeral widowhood draped around her like a queens train the pity the admiration in losing her husband mary had become the silent passive recipient of admiration whereas she shackled to a man who had betrayed her was cloaked in grubbiness a target of derision long ago in yarvil men had subjected shirley to smutty jokes because of her mothers reputation even though she shirley had been as pure as it was possible to be grandads feeling ill lexie was telling andrew whats in those cakes he bent down behind the counter hiding his red face i snogged your mum andrew had almost skived off work he had been afraid that howard might sack him on the spot for kissing his daughterinlaw and was downright terrified that miles mollison might storm in looking for him at the same time he was not so naive that he did not know that samantha who must he thought ruthlessly be well over forty would figure as the villain of the piece his defence was simple she was pissed and she grabbed me there was a tiny glimmer of pride in his embarrassment he had been anxious to see gaia he wanted to tell her that a grown woman had pounced on him he had hoped that they might laugh about it the way that they laughed about maureen but that she might be secretly impressed and also that in the course of laughing he might find out exactly what she had done with fats how far she had let him go he was prepared to forgive her she had been pissed too but she had not turned up he went to fetch a napkin for lexie and almost collided with his bosss wife who was standing behind the counter holding his epipen howard wanted me to check something shirley told him and this needle shouldnt be kept in here ill put it in the back xii halfway down his packet of rolos robbie became extremely thirsty krystal had not bought him a drink he climbed off the bench and crouched down in the warm grass where he could still see her outline in the bushes with the stranger after a while he scrambled down the bank towards them m thirsty he whined robbie get out of it screamed krystal go an sit on the bench wanna drink fuckin go an wai by the bench an ill gerra drink in a minute go way robbie crying he climbed back up the slippery bank to the bench he was accustomed to not being given what he wanted and disobedient by habit because grownups were arbitrary in their wrath and their rules so he had learned to seize his tiny pleasures wherever and whenever he could angry at krystal he wandered a little way from the bench along the road a man in sunglasses was walking along the pavement towards him gavin had forgotten where he had parked the car he had marched out of marys and walked straight down church row only realizing that he was heading in the wrong direction when he drew level with miles and samanthas house not wanting to pass the fairbrothers again he had taken a circuitous route back to the bridge he saw the boy chocolatestained illkempt and unappealing and walked past with his happiness in tatters half wishing that he could have gone to kays house and been silently cradled she had always been nicest to him when he was miserable it was what had attracted him to her in the first place the rushing of the river increased robbies thirst he cried a bit more as he changed direction and headed away from the bridge back past the place where krystal was hidden the bushes had started shaking he walked on wanting a drink then noticed a hole in a long hedge on the left of the road when he drew level he spotted a playing field beyond robbie wriggled through the hole and contemplated the wide green space with its spreading chestnut tree and goal posts robbie knew what they were because his cousin dane had showed him how to kick a football at the play park he had never seen so much greenness a woman came striding across the field with her arms folded and her head bowed samantha had been walking at random walking and walking anywhere as long as it was nowhere near church row she had been asking herself many questions and coming up with few answers and one of the questions she asked herself was whether she might not have gone too far in telling miles about that stupid drunken letter which she had sent out of spite and which seemed much less clever now she glanced up and her eyes met robbies children often wriggled through the hole in the hedge to play in the field at weekends her own girls had done it when they were younger she climbed over the gate and turned away from the river towards the square selfdisgust clung to her no matter how hard she tried to outrun it robbie went back through the hole in the hedge and walked a little way along the road after the striding lady but she was soon out of sight the halfpacket of remaining rolos were melting in his hand and he did not want to put them down but he was so thirsty maybe krystal had finished he wandered back in the opposite direction when he reached the first patch of bushes on the bank he saw that they were not moving so he thought it was all right to approach krystal he said but the bushes were empty krystal was gone robbie started to wail and shout for krystal he clambered back up the bank and looked wildly up and down the road but there was no sign of her krystal he yelled a woman with short silver hair glanced at him frowning as she trotted briskly along the opposite pavement shirley had left lexie at the copper kettle where she seemed happy but a short way across the square she had caught a glimpse of samantha who was the very last person she wanted to meet so she had taken off in the opposite direction the boys wails and squawks echoed behind her as she hurried along shirleys fist was clutched tightly around the epipen in her pocket she would not be a dirty joke she wanted to be pure and pitied like mary fairbrother her rage was so enormous so dangerous that she could not think coherently she wanted to act to punish to finish just before the old stone bridge a patch of bushes shivered to shirleys left she glanced down and caught a disgusting glimpse of something sordid and vile and it drove her on xiii sukhvinder had been walking around pagford longer than samantha she had left the old vicarage shortly after her mother had told her she must go to work and since then had been wandering the streets observing invisible exclusion zones around church row hope street and the square she had nearly fifty pounds in her pocket which represented her wages from the café and the party and the razor blade she had wanted to take her building society pass book which resided in a little filing cabinet in her fathers study but vikram had been at his desk she had waited for a while at the bus stop where you could catch a bus into yarvil but then she had spotted shirley and lexie mollison coming down the road and dived out of sight gaias betrayal had been brutal and unexpected pulling fats wall he would drop krystal now that he had gaia any boy would drop any girl for gaia she knew that but she could not bear to go to work and hear her one ally trying to tell her that fats was all right really her mobile buzzed gaia had already texted her twice how pissed was i last nite r u going work nothing about fats wall nothing about snogging sukhvinders torturer the new message said r u ok sukhvinder put the mobile back into her pocket she might walk towards yarvil and catch a bus outside town where nobody would see her her parents would not miss her until five thirty when they expected her home from the café a desperate plan formed as she walked hot and tired if she could find a place to stay that cost less than fifty pounds all she wanted was to be alone and ply her razor blade she was on the river road with the orr flowing beside her if she crossed the bridge she would be able to take a back street all the way round to the start of the bypass robbie robbie where are you it was krystal weedon running up and down the river bank fats wall was smoking with one hand in his pocket watching krystal run sukhvinder took a sharp right onto the bridge terrified that one of them might notice her krystals yells were echoing off the rushing water sukhvinder caught sight of something in the river below her hands were already on the hot stone ledge before she had thought about what she was doing and then she had hoisted herself onto the edge of the bridge she yelled hes in the river krys and dropped feet first into the water her leg was sliced open by a broken computer monitor as she was pulled under by the current xiv when shirley opened the bedroom door she saw nothing but two empty beds justice required a sleeping howard she would have to advise him to return to bed but there was no sound from either the kitchen or the bathroom shirley was worried that by taking the river road home she had missed him he must have got dressed and set off for work he might already be with maureen in the back room discussing shirley planning perhaps to divorce her and marry maureen instead now that the game was up and pretence was ended she half ran into the sitting room intending to telephone the copper kettle howard was lying on the carpet in his pyjamas his face was purple and his eyes were popping a faint wheezing noise came from his lips one hand was clutching feebly at his chest his pyjama top had ridden up shirley could see the very patch of scabbed raw skin where she had planned to plunge the needle howards eyes met hers in mute appeal shirley stared at him terrified then darted out of the room at first she hid the epipen in the biscuit barrel then she retrieved it and shoved it down the back of the cookery books she ran back into the sitting room seized the telephone receiver and dialled pagford this is for orrbank cottage is it theres one on the way oh thank you thank god said shirley and she had almost hung up when she realized what she had said and screamed no no not orrbank cottage but the operator had gone and she had to dial again she was panicking so much that she dropped the receiver on the carpet beside her howards wheezing was becoming fainter and fainter not orrbank cottage she shouted thirtysix evertree crescent pagford my husbands having a heart attack xv in church row miles mollison came tearing out of his house in bedroom slippers and sprinted down the steep sloping pavement to the old vicarage on the corner he banged on the thick oak door with his left hand while trying to dial his wifes number with his right yes said parminder opening the door my dad gasped miles another heart attack mums called an ambulance will you come please will you come parminder made a swift move back into the house mentally seizing her doctors bag but checked i cant im suspended from work miles i cant youre joking please the ambulance wont be here for i cant miles she said he turned and ran away from her through the open gate ahead he saw samantha walking up their garden path he called to her his voice breaking and she turned in surprise at first she thought that his panic was on her account dad collapsed theres an ambulance coming bloody parminder jawanda wont come my god said samantha oh my god they dashed to the car and drove up the road miles in his slippers samantha in the clogs that had blistered her feet miles listen theres a siren its here already but when they turned into evertree crescent there was nothing there and the siren was already gone on a lawn a mile away sukhvinder jawanda was vomiting river water beneath a willow tree while an old lady pressed blankets around her that were already as sodden as sukhvinders clothes a short distance away the dogwalker who had dragged sukhvinder from the river by her hair and her sweatshirt was bent over a small limp body sukhvinder had thought she felt robbie struggling in her arms but had that been the cruel tug of the river trying to rip him from her she was a strong swimmer but the orr had dragged her under pulled her helplessly wherever it chose she had been swept around the bend and it had thrown her in towards land and she had managed a scream and seen the man with his dog running towards her along the bank no good said the man who had worked on robbies little body for twenty minutes hes gone sukhvinder wailed and slumped to the cold wet ground shaking furiously as the sound of the siren reached them too late back in evertree crescent the paramedics were having enormous difficulty getting howard onto the stretcher miles and samantha had to help well follow in the car you go with dad miles shouted at shirley who seemed bewildered and unwilling to get into the ambulance maureen who had just shown her last customer out of the copper kettle stood on the doorstep listening lots of sirens she said over her shoulder to an exhausted andrew who was mopping tables something must have happened and she took a deep breath as though she hoped to taste the tang of disaster on the warm afternoon air part six weaknesses of voluntary bodies the main weaknesses of such bodies are that they are hard to launch liable to disintegrate charles arnoldbaker local council administration seventh edition i many many times had colin wall imagined the police coming to his door they arrived at last at dusk on sunday evening a woman and a man not to arrest colin but to look for his son a fatal accident and stuart is it was a witness is he at home no said tessa oh dear god robbie weedon but he lives in the fields why was he here the policewoman explained kindly what they believed to have happened the teenagers took their eye off him was the phrase she used tessa thought she might faint you dont know where stuart is asked the policeman no said colin gaunt and shadoweyed where was he last seen when our colleague pulled up stuart seems to have ah run away oh dear god said tessa again hes not answering said colin calmly he had already dialled fats on his mobile well need to go and look for him colin had rehearsed for calamity all his life he was ready he took down his coat ill try arf said tessa running to the telephone isolated above the little town no news of the calamities had yet reached hilltop house andrews mobile rang in the kitchen lo he said his mouth full of toast andy its tessa wall is stu with you no he said sorry but he was not at all sorry that fats was not with him somethings happened andy stu was down at the river with krystal weedon and she had her little brother with her and the boys drowned stus run run off somewhere can you think where he might be no said andrew automatically because that was his and fats code never tell the parents but the horror of what she had just told him crept through the phone like a clammy fog everything was suddenly less clear less certain she was about to hang up wait mrs wall he said i might know theres a place down by the river i dont think hed go near the river now said tessa seconds flicked by and andrew was more and more convinced that fats was in the cubby hole its the only place i can think of he said tell me where id have to show you ill be there in ten minutes she shouted colin was already patrolling the streets of pagford on foot tessa drove the nissan up the winding hill road and found andrew waiting for her on the corner where he usually caught the bus he directed her down through the town the street lights were feeble by twilight they parked by the trees where andrew usually threw down simons racing bike tessa got out of the car and followed andrew to the edge of the water puzzled and frightened hes not here she said its along there said andrew pointing at the sheer dark face of pargetter hill running straight down to the river with barely a lip of bank before the rushing water what do you mean asked tessa horrified andrew had known from the first that she would not be able to come with him short and dumpy as she was ill go and see he said if you wait here but its too dangerous she cried over the roar of the powerful river ignoring her he reached for the familiar hand and footholds as he inched away along the tiny ledge the same thought came to both of them that fats might have fallen or jumped into the river thundering so close to andrews feet tessa remained at the waters edge until she could not make andrew out any longer then turned away trying not to cry in case stuart was there and she needed to talk to him calmly for the first time she wondered where krystal was the police had not said and her terror for fats had obliterated every other concern please god let me find stuart she prayed let me find stuart please god then she pulled her mobile from her cardigan pocket and called kay bawden i dont know whether youve heard she shouted over the rushing water and she told kay the story but im not her social worker any more said kay twenty feet away andrew had reached the cubby hole it was pitch black he had never been here this late he swung himself inside fats he heard something move at the back of the hole fats you there got a light arf said an unrecognizable voice i dropped my bloody matches andrew thought of shouting out to tessa but she did not know how long it took to reach the cubby hole she could wait a few more moments he passed over his lighter by its flickering flame andrew saw that his friends appearance was almost as changed as his voice fats eyes were swollen his whole face looked puffy the flame went out fats cigarette tip glowed bright in the darkness is he dead her brother andrew had not realized that fats did not know yeah he said and then he added i think so thats what i what i heard there was a silence and then a soft pigletlike squeal reached him through the darkness mrs wall yelled andrew sticking his head out of the hole as far as it would go so that he could not hear fats sobs over the sound of the river mrs wall hes here ii the policewoman had been gentle and kind in the cluttered cottage by the river where dank water now covered blankets chintzy chairs and worn rugs the old lady who owned the place had brought a hotwater bottle and a cup of boiling tea which sukhvinder could not lift because she was shaking like a drill she had disgorged chunks of information her own name and krystals name and the name of the dead little boy that they were loading onto an ambulance the dogwalker who had pulled her from the river was rather deaf he gave a statement to the police in the next room and sukhvinder hated the sound of his bellowed account he had tethered his dog to a tree outside the window and it whined persistently then the police had called her parents and they had come parminder knocking over a table and smashing one of the old ladys ornaments as she crossed the room with clean clothes in her arms in the tiny bathroom the deep dirty gash on sukhvinders leg was revealed peppering the fluffy bath mat with black spots and when parminder saw the wound she shrieked at vikram who was thanking everyone loudly in the hall that they must take sukhvinder to the hospital she had vomited again in the car and her mother who was beside her in the back seat had mopped her up and all the way there parminder and vikram had kept up a flow of loud talk her father kept repeating himself saying things like shell need a sedative and that cut will definitely need stitches and parminder who was in the back seat with the shaking and retching sukhvinder kept saying you might have died you might have died it was as if she was still underwater sukhvinder was somewhere she could not breathe she tried to cut through it all to be heard does krystal know hes dead she asked through chattering teeth and parminder had to ask her to repeat the question several times i dont know she answered at last you might have died jolly at the hospital they made her undress again but this time her mother was with her in the curtained cubicle and she realized her mistake too late when she saw the expression of horror on parminders face my god she said grabbing sukhvinders forearm my god what have you done to yourself sukhvinder had no words so she allowed herself to subside into tears and uncontrollable shaking and vikram shouted at everyone including parminder to leave her alone but also to damn well hurry up and that her cut needed cleaning and she needed stitches and sedatives and xrays later they put her in a bed with a parent on each side of her and both of them stroked her hands she was warm and numb and there was no pain in her leg any more the sky beyond the windows was dark howard mollisons had another heart attack she heard her mother tell her father miles wanted me to go to him bloody nerve said vikram to sukhvinders drowsy surprise they talked no more about howard mollison they merely continued to stroke her hands until shortly afterwards she fell asleep on the far side of the building in a shabby blue room with plastic chairs and a fish tank in the corner miles and samantha were sitting on either side of shirley waiting for news from theatre miles was still wearing his slippers i cant believe parminder jawanda wouldnt come he said for the umpteenth time his voice cracking samantha got up moved past shirley and put her arms around miles kissing his thick hair speckled with grey breathing in his familiar smell shirley said in a high strangled voice im not surprised she wouldnt come im not surprised absolutely appalling all she had left of her old life and her old certainties was attacking familiar targets shock had taken almost everything from her she no longer knew what to believe or even what to hope the man in theatre was not the man she had thought she had married if she could have returned to that happy place of certainty before she had read that awful post perhaps she ought to shut down the whole website take away the message boards in their entirety she was afraid that the ghost might come back that he might say the awful thing again she wanted to go home right now and disable the website and while there she could destroy the epipen once and for all he saw it i know he saw it but id never have done it really i wouldnt have done it i was upset id never have done it what if howard survived and his first words were she ran out of the room when she saw me she didnt call an ambulance straight away she was holding a big needle then ill say his brains been affected shirley thought defiantly and if he died beside her samantha was hugging miles shirley did not like it she ought to be the centre of attention it was her husband who was lying upstairs fighting for his life she had wanted to be like mary fairbrother cosseted and admired a tragic heroine this was not how she had imagined it shirley ruth price in her nurses uniform had come hurrying into the room her thin face forlorn with sympathy i just heard i had to come shirley how awful im so sorry ruth dear said shirley getting up and allowing herself to be embraced thats so kind so kind shirley liked introducing her medical friend to miles and samantha and receiving her pity and her kindness in front of them it was a tiny taste of how she had imagined widowhood but then ruth had to go back to work and shirley returned to her plastic chair and her uncomfortable thoughts hell be ok samantha was murmuring to miles as he rested his head on her shoulder i know hell pull through he did last time shirley watched little neonbright fish darting hither and thither in their tank it was the past that she wished she could change the future was a blank has anyone phoned mo miles asked after a while wiping his eyes on the back of one hand while the other gripped samanthas leg mum dyou want me to no said shirley sharply well wait until we know in the theatre upstairs howard mollisons body overflowed the edges of the operating table his chest was wide open revealing the ruins of vikram jawandas handiwork nineteen people laboured to repair the damage while the machines to which howard was connected made soft implacable noises confirming that he continued to live and far below in the bowels of the hospital robbie weedons body lay frozen and white in the morgue nobody had accompanied him to the hospital and nobody had visited him in his metal drawer iii andrew had refused a lift back to hilltop house so it was only tessa and fats in the car together and fats said i dont want to go home all right tessa replied and she drove while talking to colin on the telephone ive got him andy found him well be back in a bit yes yes i will tears were spattering down fats face his body was betraying him it was exactly like the time when hot urine had spilt down his leg into his sock when simon price had made him piss himself the hot saltiness leaked over his chin and onto his chest pattering like drops of rain he kept imagining the funeral a tiny little coffin he had not wanted to do it with the boy so near would the weight of the dead child ever lift from him so you ran away said tessa coldly over his tears she had prayed that she would find him alive but her strongest emotion was disgust his tears did not soften her she was used to mens tears part of her was ashamed that he had not after all thrown himself into the river krystal told the police that you and she were in the bushes you just left him to his own devices did you fats was speechless he could not believe her cruelty did she not understand the desolation roaring inside him the horror the sense of contagion well i hope you have got her pregnant said tessa itll give her something to live for every time they turned a corner he thought that she was taking him home he had feared cubby most but now there was nothing to choose between his parents he wanted to get out of the car but she had locked all the doors without warning she swerved and braked fats clutching the sides of his seat saw that they were in a layby on the yarvil bypass frightened that she would order him out of the car he turned his swollen face to her your birth mother she said looking at him as she had never done before without pity or kindness was fourteen years old we had the impression from what we were told that she was middle class quite a bright girl she absolutely refused to say who your father was nobody knew whether she was trying to protect an underage boyfriend or something worse we were told all of this in case you had any mental or physical difficulties in case she said clearly like a teacher trying to emphasize a point sure to come up in a test you had been the result of incest he cowered away from her he would have preferred to be shot i was desperate to adopt you she said desperate but dad was very ill he said to me i cant do it im scared ill hurt a baby i need to get better before we do this and i cant do that and cope with a new baby as well but i was so determined to have you said tessa that i pressured him into lying and telling the social workers that he was fine and pretending to be happy and normal we brought you home and you were tiny and premature and on the fifth night we had you dad slipped out of bed and went to the garage put a hosepipe on the exhaust of the car and tried to kill himself because he was convinced hed smothered you and he almost died so you can blame me said tessa for your and dads bad start and maybe you can blame me for everything thats come since but ill tell you this stuart your fathers spent his life facing up to things he never did i dont expect you to understand his kind of courage but her voice broke at last and he heard the mother he knew he loves you stuart she added the lie because she could not help herself tonight for the first time tessa was convinced that it was a lie and also that everything she had done in her life telling herself that it was for the best had been no more than blind selfishness generating confusion and mess all around but who could bear to know which stars were already dead she thought blinking up at the night sky could anybody stand to know that they all were she turned the key in the ignition crashed the gears and they pulled out again onto the bypass i dont want to go to the fields said fats in terror were not going to the fields she said im taking you home iv the police had picked up krystal weedon at last as she ran hopelessly along the river bank on the very edge of pagford still calling her brother in a cracked voice the policewoman who approached her addressed her by name and tried to break the news to her gently but she still tried to beat the woman away from her and in the end the policewoman had almost to wrestle her into the car krystal had not noticed fats melting away into the trees he did not exist to her any more the police drove krystal home but when they knocked on the front door terri refused to answer she had glimpsed them through an upstairs window and thought that krystal had done the one unthinkable and unforgivable thing and told the pigs about the holdalls full of obbos hash she dragged the heavy bags upstairs while the police hammered at the door and only opened up when she considered that it had become unavoidable whatcha wan she shouted through an inchwide gap in the door the policewoman asked to come in three times and terri refused still demanding to know what they wanted a few neighbours had begun to peer through windows even when the policewoman said its about your son robbie terri did not realize es fine theres nuthin wrong with im krystals got im but then she saw krystal who had refused to stay in the car and had walked halfway up the garden path terris gaze trickled down her daughters body to the place where robbie should have been clinging to her frightened by the strange men terri flew from her house like a fury with her hands outstretched like claws and the policewoman had to catch her round the middle and swing her away from krystal whose face she was trying to lacerate yeh little bitch yeh little bitch whatve yeh done ter robbie krystal dodged the struggling pair darted into the house and slammed the front door behind her for fucks sake muttered the policeman under his breath miles away in hope street kay and gaia bawden faced each other in the dark hallway neither of them was tall enough to replace the light bulb that had been dead for days and they had no ladder all day long they had argued and almost made up then argued again finally at the moment when reconciliation seemed within touching distance when kay had agreed that she too hated pagford that it had all been a mistake and that she would try and get them both back to london her mobile had rung krystal weedons brothers drowned whispered kay as she cut tessas call oh said gaia knowing that she ought to express pity but frightened to let discussion of london drop before she had her mothers firm commitment she added in a tight little voice thats sad it happened here in pagford said kay along the road krystal was with tessa walls son gaia felt even more ashamed of letting fats wall kiss her he had tasted horrible of lager and cigarettes and he had tried to feel her up she was worth much more than fats wall she knew that if it had even been andy price she would have felt better about it sukhvinder had not returned one of her calls all day long shell be absolutely broken up said kay her eyes unfocused but theres nothing you can do said gaia is there well said kay not again cried gaia its always always the same youre not her social worker any more what she shouted stamping her foot as she had done when she was a little girl about me the police officer in foley road had already called a duty social worker terri was writhing and screaming and trying to beat at the front door while from behind it came the sounds of furniture being dragged to form a barricade neighbours were coming out onto their doorsteps a fascinated audience to terris meltdown somehow the cause of it was transmitted through the watchers from terris incoherent shouts and the attitudes of the ominous police the boys dead they told each other nobody stepped forward to comfort or calm terri weedon had no friends come with me kay begged her mutinous daughter ill go to the house and see if i can do anything i got on with krystal shes got nobody i bet she was shagging fats wall when it happened shouted gaia but it was her final protest and a few minutes later she was buckling herself into kays old vauxhall glad in spite of everything that kay had asked her along but by the time they had reached the bypass krystal had found what she was looking for a bag of heroin concealed in the airing cupboard the second of two that obbo had given terri in payment for tessa walls watch she took it with terris works into the bathroom the only room that had a lock on the door her aunt cheryl must have heard what had happened because krystal could hear her distinctive raucous yell added to terris screams even through the two doors you little bitch open the door letcha mother see ya and the police shouting trying to shut the two women up krystal had never shot up before but she had watched it happen many times she knew about longboats and how to make a model volcano and she knew how to heat the spoon and about the tiny little ball of cotton wool you used to soak up the dissolved smack and act as a filter when you were filling the syringe she knew that the crook of the arm was the best place to find a vein and she knew to lay the needle as flat as possible against the skin she knew because she had heard it said many times that firsttimers could not take what addicts could manage and that was good because she did not want to take it robbie was dead and it was her fault in trying to save him she had killed him flickering images filled her mind as her fingers worked to achieve what must be done mr fairbrother running alongside the canal bank in his tracksuit as the crew rowed nana caths face fierce with pain and love robbie waiting for her at the window of his foster home unnaturally clean jumping up and down with excitement as she approached the front door she could hear the policeman calling to her through the letter box not to be a silly girl and the policewoman trying to quieten terri and cheryl the needle slid easily into krystals vein she pressed the plunger down hard in hope and without regret by the time kay and gaia arrived and the police decided to force their way in krystal weedon had achieved her only ambition she had joined her brother where nobody could part them part seven relief of poverty gifts to benefit the poor are charitable and a gift for the poor is charitable even if it happens incidentally to benefit the rich charles arnoldbaker local council administration seventh edition nearly three weeks after the sirens had wailed through sleepy pagford on a sunny morning in april shirley mollison stood alone in her bedroom squinting at her reflection in the mirrored wardrobe she was making final adjustments to her dress before her nowdaily drive to south west general the belt buckle slid up a hole tighter than it had done a fortnight ago her silver hair was in need of a trim and her grimace against the sunshine blazing into the room could have been a simple expression of her mood when miles accompanied her to the hospital she could let him do all the talking to howard which he did keeping up a steady monologue of pagford news she felt so much better both more visible and more protected with tall miles walking beside her down the chilly corridors he chatted genially to the nurses and handed her in and out of the car and restored to her the sense of being a rare creature worthy of care and protection but miles could not come every day and to shirleys profound irritation he kept deputizing samantha to accompany her this was not the same thing at all even though samantha was one of the few who managed to bring a smile to howards purple vacant face nobody seemed to realize how dreadful the silence was at home either when the doctors had told the family that recuperation would take months shirley had hoped that miles would ask her to move into the spare room of the big house in church row or that he might stay over from time to time in the bungalow but no she had been left alone quite alone except for a painful threeday period when she had played hostess to pat and melly id never have done it she reassured herself automatically in the silent night when she could not sleep i never really meant to i was just upset id never have done it she had buried andrews epipen in the soft earth beneath the bird table in the garden like a tiny corpse she did not like knowing it was there some dark evening soon the night before refusecollection day she would dig it up again and slip it into a neighbours bin howard had not mentioned the needle to her or to anyone he had not asked her why she had run away when she saw him shirley found relief in long rattling streams of invective directed at the people who had in her stated opinion caused the catastrophe that had fallen on her family parminder jawanda was the first of these naturally for her callous refusal to attend howard then there were the two teenagers who through their vile irresponsibility had diverted the ambulance that might have reached howard sooner the latter argument was perhaps a little weak but it was the enjoyable fashion to denigrate stuart wall and krystal weedon and shirley found plenty of willing listeners in her immediate circle what was more it had transpired that the wall boy had been the ghost of barry fairbrother all along he had confessed to his parents and they had personally telephoned the victims of the boys spite to apologize the ghosts identity had leaked swiftly into the wider community and this coupled with the knowledge that he had been jointly responsible for the drowning of a threeyearold child made abuse of stuart both a duty and a pleasure shirley was more vehement in her comments than anybody there was a savagery in her denunciations each of them a little exorcism of the kinship and admiration she had felt for the ghost and a repudiation of that awful last post which nobody else as yet had admitted to seeing the walls had not telephoned shirley to apologize but she was constantly primed in case the boy should mention it to his parents or in case anybody should bring it up to deliver a final crushing blow to stuarts reputation oh yes howard and i know all about it she planned to say with icy dignity and its my belief that the shock caused his heart attack she had actually practised saying this aloud in the kitchen the question of whether stuart wall had really known something about her husband and maureen was less urgent now because howard was patently incapable of shaming her in that way again and perhaps never would be and nobody seemed to be gossiping and if the silence she offered howard when she was unavoidably alone with him was tinged with a sense of grievance on both sides she was able to face the prospect of his protracted incapacitation and absence from the house with more equanimity than she might have thought possible three weeks previously the doorbell rang and shirley hurried to open it maureen was there hobbling on illadvised high heels garish in bright aquamarine hello dear come in said shirley ill get my bag theyre saying people got up a collection said maureen brimful of gossip that shirley had somehow missed in her endless back and forward trips to the hospital dont ask me who anyway i wouldnt have thought the family would want it right by the river would you the dirty and foulmouthed little boy of whose existence few had been aware and of whom nobody but his mother and sister had been especially fond had undergone such a transformation in pagfords collective mind by his drowning that he was spoken of everywhere as a water baby a cherub a pure and gentle angel whom all would have embraced with love and compassion if only they could have saved him but the needle and the flame had had no transformative effect upon krystals reputation on the contrary they had fixed her permanently in the mind of old pagford as a soulless creature whose pursuit of what the elderly liked to call kicks had led to the death of an innocent child shirley was pulling on her coat you realize i actually saw them that day she said her cheeks turning pink the boy bawling by one clump of bushes and krystal weedon and stuart wall in another did you and were they really asked maureen avidly oh yes said shirley broad daylight open air and the boy was right by the river when i saw him a couple of steps and hed have been in something in maureens expression stung her i was hurrying said shirley with asperity because howard had said he was feeling poorly and i was worried sick i didnt want to go out at all but miles and samantha had sent lexie over i think if you want my honest opinion theyd had a row and then lexie wanted to visit the café i was absolutely distracted and all i could think was i must get back to howard i didnt actually realize what id seen until much later and the dreadful thing said shirley her colour higher than ever and returning again to her favourite refrain is that if krystal weedon hadnt let that child wander off while she was having her fun in the bushes the ambulance would have reached howard so much more quickly because you know with two of them coming things got confu thats right said maureen interrupting as they moved out towards the car because she had heard all this before you know i cant think why theyre having the service here in pagford she longed to suggest that they drive past the church on the way to the hospital she had a craving to see what the weedon family looked like en masse and to glimpse perhaps that degenerate junkie mother but could think of no way to frame the request you know theres one comfort shirley she said as they set off for the bypass the fields are as good as gone that must be a comfort to howard even if he cant attend council for a while he got that done andrew price was speeding down the steep hill from hilltop house with the sun hot on his back and the wind in his hair his weekold shiner had turned yellow and green and looked if possible even worse than it had when he had turned up at school with his eye almost closed andrew had told the teachers who enquired that he had fallen off his bike it was now the easter holidays and gaia had texted andrew the previous evening to ask whether he would be going to krystals funeral the next day he had sent an immediate yes and was now dressed after much deliberation in his cleanest jeans and a dark grey shirt because he did not own a suit he was not very clear why gaia was going to the funeral unless it was to be with sukhvinder jawanda to whom she seemed to cling more fondly than ever now that she was moving back to london with her mother mum says she should never have come to pagford gaia had told andrew and sukhvinder happily as the three of them sat on the low wall beside the newsagents at lunchtime she knows gavins a total twat she had given andrew her mobile number and told him that they would go out together when she came to reading to see her father and even mentioned casually taking him to see some of her favourite places in london if he visited she was showering benefits around her in the manner of a demobhappy soldier and these promises made so lightly gilded the prospect of andrews own move he had greeted the news that his parents had had an offer on hilltop house with at least as much excitement as pain the sweeping turn into church row usually made with an uplift of spirits dampened them he could see people moving around in the graveyard and he wondered what this funeral was going to be like and for the first time that morning thought of krystal weedon in more than the abstract a memory long buried in the deepest recesses of his mind came back to him of that time in the playground at st thomass when fats in a spirit of disinterested investigation had handed him a peanut hidden inside a marshmallow he could still feel his burning throat closing inexorably he remembered trying to yell and his knees giving way and the children all around him watching with a strange bloodless interest and then krystal weedons raucous scream andiprice iz avin a lurgycacshun she had run on her stocky little legs all the way to the staff room and the headmaster had snatched andrew up and sprinted with him to the nearby surgery where dr crawford had administered adrenalin she was the only one who had remembered the talk that their teacher had given the class explaining andrews lifethreatening condition the only one to recognize his symptoms krystal ought to have been given a gold merit star and perhaps a certificate at assembly as pupil of the week but the very next day andrew remembered it as clearly as his own collapse she had hit lexie mollison so hard in the mouth that she had knocked out two of lexies teeth he wheeled simons bike carefully into the walls garage then rang the doorbell with a reluctance that had never been there before tessa wall answered dressed in her best grey coat andrew was annoyed with her it was down to her that he had a black eye come in andy said tessa and her expression was tense well just be a minute he waited in the hallway where the coloured glass over the door cast its paintboxy glow on the floorboards tessa marched into the kitchen and andrew glimpsed fats in his black suit crumpled up in a kitchen chair like a crushed spider with one arm over his head as if he were fending off blows andrew turned his back the two boys had had no communication since andrew had led tessa to the cubby hole fats had not been to school for a fortnight andrew had sent a couple of texts but fats had not replied his facebook page remained frozen as it had been on the day of howard mollisons party a week ago without warning tessa had telephoned the prices told them that fats had admitted to having posted the messages under the name theghostofbarryfairbrother and offered her deepest apologies for the consequences they had suffered so how did he know i had that computer simon had roared advancing on andrew how did fucking fats wall know i did jobs afterhours at the printworks andrews only consolation was that if his father had known the truth he might have ignored ruths protests and continued to pummel andrew until he was unconscious why fats had decided to pretend he had authored all the posts andrew did not know perhaps it was fats ego at work his determination to be the mastermind the most destructive the baddest of them all perhaps he had thought he was doing something noble taking the fall for both of them either way fats had caused much more trouble than he knew he had never realized thought andrew waiting in the hall what it was like to live with a father like simon price safe in his attic room with his reasonable civilized parents andrew could hear the adult walls talking in quiet voices they had not closed the kitchen door we need to leave now tessa was saying hes got a moral obligation and hes going hes had enough punishment said cubbys voice im not asking him to go as a arent you said cubby sharply for gods sake tessa dyou think theyll want him there you go stu can stay here with me a minute later tessa emerged from the kitchen closing the door firmly behind her stu isnt coming andy she said and he could tell that she was furious about it im sorry about that no problem he muttered he was glad he could not imagine what they had left to talk about this way he could sit with gaia a little way down church row samantha mollison was standing at her sittingroom window holding a coffee and watching mourners pass her house on their way to st michael and all saints when she saw tessa wall and what she thought was fats she let out a little gasp oh my god hes going she said out loud to nobody then she recognized andrew turned red and backed hastily away from the glass samantha was supposed to be working from home her laptop lay open behind her on the sofa but that morning she had put on an old black dress half wondering whether she would attend krystal and robbie weedons funeral she supposed that she had only a few more minutes in which to make up her mind she had never spoken a kind word about krystal weedon so surely it would be hypocritical to attend her funeral purely because she had wept over the account of her death in the yarvil and district gazette and because krystals chubby face grinned out of every one of the class photographs that lexie had brought home from st thomass samantha set down her coffee hurried to the telephone and rang miles at work hello babe he said she had held him while he sobbed with relief beside the hospital bed where howard lay connected to machines but alive hi she said how are you not bad busy morning lovely to hear from you he said are you all right they had made love the previous night and she had not pretended that he was anybody else the funerals about to start said samantha people going by she had suppressed what she wanted to say for nearly three weeks because of howard and the hospital and not wanting to remind miles of their awful row but she could not hold it back any longer miles i saw that boy robbie weedon i saw him miles she was panicky pleading he was in the st thomass playing field when i walked across it that morning in the playing field in the last three weeks a desire to be absorbed in something bigger than herself had grown in samantha day by day she had waited for the strange new need to subside this is how people go religious she thought trying to laugh herself out of it but it had if anything intensified miles she said you know the council with your dad and parminder jawanda resigning too youll want to coopt a couple of people wont you she knew all the terminology she had listened to it for years i mean you wont want another election after all this bloody hell no so colin wall could fill one seat she rushed on and i was thinking ive got time now the business is all online i could do the other one you said miles astonished id like to get involved said samantha krystal weedon dead at sixteen barricaded inside the squalid little house on foley road samantha had not drunk a glass of wine in two weeks she thought that she might like to hear the arguments for bellchapel addiction clinic the telephone was ringing in number ten hope street kay and gaia were already late leaving for krystals funeral when gaia asked who was speaking her lovely face hardened she seemed much older its gavin she told her mother i didnt call him whispered kay like a nervous schoolgirl as she took the phone hi said gavin how are you on my way out to a funeral said kay with her eyes locked on her daughters the weedon childrens so not fabulous oh said gavin christ yeah sorry i didnt realize he had spotted the familiar surname in a yarvil and district gazette headline and vaguely interested at last bought a copy it had occurred to him that he might have walked close by the place where the teenagers and the boy had been but he had no actual memory of seeing robbie weedon gavin had had an odd couple of weeks he was missing barry badly he did not understand himself when he should have been mired in misery that mary had turned him down all he wanted was a beer with the man whose wife he had hoped to take as his own muttering aloud as he had walked away from her house he had said to himself thats what you get for trying to steal your best friends life and failed to notice the slip of the tongue listen he said i was wondering whether you fancied a drink later kay almost laughed turn you down did she she handed gaia the phone to hang up they hurried out of the house and half jogged to the end of the street and up through the square for ten strides as they passed the black canon gaia held her mothers hand they arrived as the hearses appeared at the top of the road and hurried into the graveyard while the pallbearers were shuffling out onto the pavement get away from the window colin wall commanded his son but fats who had to live henceforth with the knowledge of his own cowardice moved forward trying to prove that he could at least take this the coffins glided past in the big blackwindowed cars the first was bright pink and the sight robbed him of breath and the second was tiny and shiny white colin placed himself in front of fats too late to protect him but he drew the curtains anyway in the gloomy familiar sitting room where fats had confessed to his parents that he had exposed his fathers illness to the world where he had confessed to as much as he could think of in the hope that they would conclude him to be mad and ill where he had tried to heap upon himself so much blame that they would beat him or stab him or do to him all those things that he knew he deserved colin put a hand gently on his sons back and steered him away towards the sunlit kitchen outside st michael and all saints the pallbearers were readying themselves to take the coffins up the church path dane tully was among them with his earring and a selfinked tattoo of a spiders web on his neck in a heavy black overcoat the jawandas waited with the bawdens in the shade of the yew tree andrew price hovered near them and tessa wall stood at some distance pale and stonyfaced the other mourners formed a separate phalanx around the church doors some had a pinched and defiant air others looked resigned and defeated a few wore cheap black clothes but most were in jeans or tracksuits and one girl was sporting a cutoff tshirt and a bellyring that caught the sun when she moved the coffins moved up the path gleaming in the bright light it was sukhvinder jawanda who had chosen the bright pink coffin for krystal as she was sure she would have wanted it was sukhvinder who had done nearly everything organizing choosing and persuading parminder kept looking sideways at her daughter and finding excuses to touch her brushing her hair out of her eyes smoothing her collar just as robbie had come out of the river purified and regretted by pagford so sukhvinder jawanda who had risked her life to try and save the boy had emerged a heroine from the article about her in the yarvil and district gazette to maureen lowes loud proclamations that she was recommending the girl for a special police award to the speech her headmistress made about her from the lectern in assembly sukhvinder knew for the first time what it was to eclipse her brother and sister she had hated every minute of it at night she felt again the dead boys weight in her arms dragging her towards the deep she remembered the temptation to let go and save herself and asked herself how long she would have resisted it the deep scar on her leg itched and ached whether moving or stationary the news of krystal weedons death had had such an alarming effect on her that her parents had arranged a counsellor but she had not cut herself once since being pulled from the river her near drowning seemed to have purged her of the need then on her first day back at school with fats wall still absent and admiring stares following her down the corridors she had heard the rumour that terri weedon had no money to bury her children that there would be no stone marker and the cheapest coffins thats very sad jolly her mother had said that evening as the family sat eating dinner together under the wall of family photographs her tone was as gentle as the policewomans had been there was no snap in parminders voice any more when she spoke to her daughter i want to try and get people to give money said sukhvinder parminder and vikram glanced at each other across the kitchen table both were instinctively opposed to the idea of asking people in pagford to donate to such a cause but neither of them said so they were a little afraid now that they had seen her forearms of upsetting sukhvinder and the shadow of the asyetunknown counsellor seemed to be hovering over all their interactions and sukhvinder went on with a feverish energy like parminders own i think the funeral service should be here at st michaels like mr fairbrothers krys used to go to all the services here when we were at st thomass i bet she was never in another church in her life the light of god shines from every soul thought parminder and to vikrams surprise she said abruptly yes all right well have to see what we can do the bulk of the expense had been met by the jawandas and the walls but kay bawden samantha mollison and a couple of the mothers of girls on the rowing team had donated money too sukhvinder then insisted on going into the fields in person to explain to terri what they had done and why all about the rowing team and why krystal and robbie should have a service at st michaels parminder had been exceptionally worried about sukhvinder going into the fields let alone that filthy house by herself but sukhvinder had known that it would be all right the weedons and the tullys knew that she had tried to save robbies life dane tully had stopped grunting at her in english and had stopped his mates from doing it too terri agreed to everything that sukhvinder suggested she was emaciated dirty monosyllabic and entirely passive sukhvinder had been frightened of her with her pockmarked arms and her missing teeth it was like talking to a corpse inside the church the mourners divided cleanly with the people from the fields taking the lefthand pews and those from pagford the right shane and cheryl tully marched terri along between them to the front row terri in a coat two sizes too large seemed scarcely aware of where she was the coffins lay side by side on biers at the front of the church a bronze chrysanthemum oar lay on krystals and a white chrysanthemum teddy bear on robbies kay bawden remembered robbies bedroom with its few grimy plastic toys and her fingers trembled on the order of service naturally there was to be an inquiry at work because the local paper was clamouring for one and had written a frontpage piece suggesting that the small boy had been left in the care of a pair of junkies and that his death could have been avoided if only he had been removed to safety by negligent social workers mattie had been signed off with stress again and kays handling of the case review was being assessed kay wondered what effect it would have on her chances of getting another job in london when every local authority was cutting numbers of social workers and how gaia would react if they had to stay in pagford she had not dared discuss it with her yet andrew glanced sideways at gaia and they exchanged small smiles up in hilltop house ruth was already sorting things for the move andrew could tell that his mother hoped in her perennially optimistic way that by sacrificing their house and the beauty of the hills they would be rewarded with a rebirth wedded for ever to an idea of simon that took no account of his rages or his crookedness she was hoping that these would be left behind like boxes forgotten in the move but at least andrew thought he would be one step nearer london when they went and he had gaias assurance that she had been too drunk to know what she was doing with fats and perhaps she might invite him and sukhvinder back to her house for coffee after the funeral was over gaia who had never been inside st michaels before was half listening to the vicars singsong delivery letting her eyes travel over the high starry ceiling and the jewelcoloured windows there was a prettiness about pagford that now she knew that she was leaving she thought she might quite miss tessa wall had chosen to sit behind everyone else on her own this brought her directly under the calm gaze of st michael whose foot rested eternally on that writhing devil with its horns and tail tessa had been in tears ever since her first glimpse of the two glossy coffins and as much as she tried to stifle them her soft gurglings were still audible to those near her she had half expected somebody on the weedon side of the church to recognize her as fats mother and attack her but nothing had happened her family life had turned inside out colin was furious with her you told him what he wanted a taste of real life she had sobbed he wanted to see the seamy underside dont you understand what all that slumming it was about so you told him that he might be the result of incest and that i tried to kill myself because he came into the family years of trying to reconcile them and it had taken a dead child and colins profound understanding of guilt to do it she had heard the two of them talking in fats attic room the previous evening and paused to eavesdrop at the foot of the stairs you can put that that thing that mum suggested out of your head completely colin was saying gruffly youve got no physical or mental abnormalities have you well then dont worry about it any more but your counsellor will help you with all of this tessa gurgled and snorted into her sodden tissue and thought how little she had done for krystal dead on the bathroom floor it would have been a relief if st michael had stepped down from his glowing window and enacted judgement on them all decreeing exactly how much fault was hers for the deaths for the broken lives for the mess a fidgeting young tully boy on the other side of the aisle hopped out of his pew and a tattooed woman reached out a powerful arm grabbed him and pulled him back tessas sobs were punctuated by a little gasp of surprise she was sure that she had recognized her own lost watch on the thick wrist sukhvinder who was listening to tessas sobs felt sorry for her but did not dare turn around parminder was furious with tessa there had been no way for sukhvinder to explain the scars on her arms without mentioning fats wall she had begged her mother not to call the walls but then tessa had telephoned parminder to tell them that fats had taken full responsibility for theghostof barryfairbrothers posts on the council website and parminder had been so vitriolic on the telephone that they had not spoken since it had been such a strange thing for fats to do to take the blame for her post too sukhvinder thought of it almost as an apology he had always seemed to read her mind did he know that she had attacked her own mother sukhvinder wondered whether she would be able to confess the truth to this new counsellor in whom her parents seemed to place so much faith and whether she would ever be able to tell the newly kind and contrite parminder she was trying to follow the service but it was not helping her in the way that she had hoped she was glad about the chrysanthemum oar and the teddy bear which laurens mum had made she was glad that gaia and andy had come and the girls from the rowing team but she wished that the fairbrother twins had not refused itd upset mum siobhan had told sukhvinder see she thinks dad spent too much time on krystal oh said sukhvinder taken aback and said niamh mum doesnt like the idea that shell have to see krystals grave every time we visit dads theyll probably be really near each other sukhvinder thought these objections small and mean but it seemed sacrilegious to apply such terms to mrs fairbrother the twins walked away wrapped up in each other as they always were these days and treating sukhvinder with coolness for her defection to the outsider gaia bawden sukhvinder kept waiting for somebody to stand up and talk about who krystal really was and what she had done in her life the way that niamh and siobhans uncle had done for mr fairbrother but apart from the vicars brief reference to tragically short lives and local family with deep roots in pagford he seemed determined to skirt the facts so sukhvinder focused her thoughts on the day that their crew had competed in the regional finals mr fairbrother had driven them in the minibus to face the girls from st annes the canal ran right through the private schools grounds and it had been decided that they were to change in the st annes sports hall and start the race there unsporting course it is mr fairbrother had told them on the way homeground advantage i tried to get it changed but they wouldnt just dont be intimidated all right i ain fuck krys i ain scared but when they turned into the grounds sukhvinder was scared long stretches of soft green lawn and a big symmetrical goldenstoned building with spires and a hundred windows she had never seen anything like it except on picture postcards its like buckingham palace lauren shrieked from the back and krystals mouth had formed a round o she had been as unaffected as a child sometimes all of their parents and krystals greatgrandmother were waiting at the finishing line wherever that was sukhvinder was sure that she was not the only one who felt small scared and inferior as they approached the entrance of the beautiful building a woman in academic dress came swooping out to greet mr fairbrother in his tracksuit you must be winterdown course es not does e look like a fuckin buildin said krystal loudly they were sure that the teacher from st annes had heard and mr fairbrother turned and tried to scowl at krystal but they could tell that he thought it was funny really the whole team started to giggle and they were still snorting and cackling when mr fairbrother saw them off at the entrance to the changing rooms stretch he shouted after them the team from st annes was inside with their own coach the two sets of girls eyed each other across the benches sukhvinder was struck by the other teams hair all of them wore it long natural and shiny they could have starred in shampoo adverts on their own team siobhan and niamh had bobs laurens hair was short krystal always wore hers in a tight high pony tail and sukhvinders was rough thick and unruly as a horses mane she thought she saw two of the st annes girls exchange whispers and smirks and was sure of it when krystal suddenly stood tall glaring at them and said spose your shit smells of roses does it i beg your pardon said their coach jus askin said krystal sweetly turning her back to pull off her tracksuit bottoms the urge to giggle had been too powerful to resist the winterdown team snorted with laughter as they changed krystal clowned away and as the st annes crew filed out she mooned them charming said the last girl to leave thanks a lot krystal called after her ill let yer ave another look later if yeh want i know yehre all lezzers she yelled stuck in ere together with no boys holly had laughed so much that she had doubled over and banged her head on the locker door fuckin watch it hol krystal had said delighted with the effect she was having on them all yehll need yer ead as they had trooped down to the canal sukhvinder could see why mr fairbrother had wanted the venue changed there was nobody but him here to support them at the start whereas the st annes crew had lots of friends shrieking and applauding and jumping up and down on the spot all with the same kind of glossy long hair look shouted krystal pointing into this group as they passed its lexie mollison remember when i knocked yer teeth out lex sukhvinder had a pain from laughing she was glad and proud to be walking along behind krystal and she could tell that the others were too something about how krystal faced the world was protecting them from the effect of the staring eyes and the fluttering bunting and the building like a palace in the background but she could tell that even krystal was feeling the pressure as they climbed into their boat krystal turned to sukhvinder who always sat behind her she was holding something in her hand goodluck charm she said showing her it was a red plastic heart on a keyring with a picture of her little brother in it ive told im im gonna bring im back a medal said krystal yeah said sukhvinder with a rush of faith and fear we will yeah said krystal facing front again and tucking the keyring back inside her bra no competition this lot she said loudly so the whole crew could hear bunch o muff munchers les do em sukhvinder remembered the starting gun and the crowds cheers and her muscles screaming she remembered her elation at their perfect rhythm and the pleasure of their deadly seriousness after laughter krystal had won it for them krystal had taken away the homeground advantage sukhvinder wished that she could be like krystal funny and tough impossible to intimidate always coming out fighting she had asked terri weedon for two things and they had been granted because terri agreed with everyone always the medal that krystal had won that day was around her neck for her burial the other request came at the very end of the service and this time as he announced it the vicar sounded resigned good girl gone bad take three action no clouds in my storms let it rain i hydroplane into fame comin down with the dow jones her family half carried
