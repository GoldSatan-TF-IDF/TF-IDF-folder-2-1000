a button to save the world edgar million a button to save the world edgar million published by edgar million at smashwords copyright edgar million revised version dedicated to the memory of john gibbons and kevin hanley sorely missed do i die today do my children meet the grade patrick useful asked his boss shall we see he responded having to save the world was a terrible burden bentwhistle thought looking down at the button the button the words stood out in his mind it was the sort of ridiculous object a conspiracy theorist might imagine being in a locked drawer in downing street or in some dramatically lit war room at the white house or a vaulted bunker in moscow or beijing but still the conspiracy theorists would have been right the button existed and they were correct to fear it not that the politicians knew about it like they would have trusted this to the politicians power like this could not be left to the popularity seeking whims of the political classes so the decision had been taken long ago they should not know it existed he studied the object half visualising in his mind wires stretching out of it to every place every person on the globe and he imagined the day when he would need to press it to save the world would be such a bad thing to do a bold but terrible thing which would leave the saviour of the planet forever famous infamous a pariah but he knew that without the compression of the button the planet would soon die screaming in floods fire and torment once the inevitable global warming tipping point was reached one of his serving robots a cook eased across his elderly carpet to serve him a cup of tea brewed specifically to his tastes having warmed pot and delicate china cup left to brew for the appropriate time then served black no sugar he sipped the beverage as he contemplated the rapidly approaching day when he would have to press the button to save the world jeremy bentwhistle had been described by many as a ruthless man barely a week went by without an article in private eye condemning him although in business he struggled to see how you could be anything else especially in pharmaceuticals but his burden leant heavily on him as he contemplated the task the button itself was bolted to a heavy walnut antique georgian partners desk an adaptation he had not approved of although the result meant it retained a pleasingly lowtech appearance which he found strangely comforting during the many hours he gazed upon it a small brass box with a round fingerprint recognition panel set into the lid which when touched would release a complicated locking mechanism which flipped open to reveal a button the design had appealed to bentwhistles old fashioned aesthetic simple classic almost like a doorbell but he was more than a little put out after he had ordered one of his robots to stick it on the desk that the obedient machine then drilled into the antique leather coating and bolted the device to the two hundredyearold item of pristine furniture bloody philistines he had complained to his only remaining human servant trot they do lack a certain grace and subtlety sir at the time bentwhistle had wondered if this literal nature of robots was one of the downsides of this revolution but on balance he found robots made far fewer mistakes than their old human counterparts whom they had replaced in so many walks of life and carried out their duties in a more decidedly pleasant manner no need for pointless meetings to discuss the rights and wrongs of a decision they just got on with it with the exception of occasional mishaps like the desk this arrangement worked rather well better to own an obedient labrador than a disobedient selfserving snake primed to turn on its master at any moment requiring constant attention and distraction lest it notice then reject its inferior position patrick k useful watched the robots at half attention the low buzz of their hive activity filling his ears as they bottled and packaged a billion multicoloured tablets and liquids into an array of packets and containers whilst many others transported boxes and other paraphernalia about the almost endless factory floor where he had spent his entire employed life such a long time he thought watching the dance hed been here at one of bentwhistles factories since leaving manchester university a long time ago hed been a researcher an inventor of curatives and medicines but soon found himself on the trajectory from middle management and upwards in the old days hed been managing in the traditional manner with people not robots making up mass of the assembly lines then after hed done this with moderate success for many years he found himself tasked with the phased introduction of a new robot workforce steadily replacing the old human one a pattern soon established in most construction plants and factories across the world displacing more and more of the workers at the sites just leaving small efficient management and research teams to supervise and create the design and development process in every city and town it had been the same shops those left after everyone had switched their workforces to robots no longer needed people to staff them but one day the only people left to purchase from them was a relatively small supervisory and professional layer of civilisation barely any purchasers remained and only outlets which targeted the needs of the fabulously wealthy survived the illusion of the middleclass vanishing in a generation there had been many strikes and riots and numerous attempts to damage and sabotage the bots perceived to be stealing peoples jobs and livelihoods which of course indirectly in many instances they were around the world hordes took to the streets to protest the great icons of the world had burned on a clear day patrick would sometimes climb the spiral staircase from his office up to eat his lunch on the roof terrace where he could still see the ruin of the london skyline in the distance the torn skeleton of the shard bereft forever clawing at the grey english clouds the city and the unrest had smouldered for months until simultaneously everyones robots deserted their household duties and joined thousands of public order bots to peacefully subdue the protests hed watched it on tv the massing ebb and flow of the hive reforming for a new function to quell the unruly masses they put out fires with blood whilst patrick watched it all a wine glass in hand shielded somewhat as one of the fortunate few still in employment patrick couldnt complain years working for pharmacost incorporated had left him rather welloff although not superrich and he felt it was rewarding in itself to be working part of a team producing groundbreaking medicines which helped people in need rumours always circulated that many pharmaceutical enhancements made currently were being held in reserve to ensure continual market domination as patents expired but at their site in londons northern suburbs the research work was focused upon adapting existing medicine tinkering with the molecular structure to ensuring copyright was monopolised indefinitely useful didnt buy the conspiratorial gossip which greeted him in his local cures for cancer being withheld from the poor alzheimers tablets but only for the rich and powerful but he figured it unlikely even then useful wouldnt have complained the company had given him a good life until hed had the redundancy notice his wife cried when he showed it to her and although he tried to tell her that it would be alright he knew he sounded unconvincing as the smug sheen of protection he had thought made him impenetrable turned out as fragile and temporary as the burning city not long to go now he thought watching the machines what will i do with my days without work it seemed like a silly question but without the routines and patterns of going to the office pat would be lost but it was out of his control and part of him felt guilty relief that his parents hadnt lived to see this to see him placed on the scrapheap his plant was to have their small rd team shifted to the tokyo site and this site was to be one of six unmanned worldwide super factories producing a massive selection of basic low cost medicines vaccines and standard pain killers an operation which now required a single management team so no longer needed a patrick at each location just one at the central hub that hub was not going to be patricks he watched the robots busy themselves stung at the thought they no longer needed him then turned his attention to the halffilled boxes by his desk and continued to pack in the now obsolete remnants of twenty years employment could this be it without this what would he do elroy grubberson sat in front of his hut on a dilapidated deck chair and looked into the gathering darkness sipping upon lukewarm beer from his can three tins remaining from a pack of six bound together by foggy plastic stood on the dusty earth whilst their owner contemplated his small quarter of the world the mutterings were out there in the wires they were coming for months now hed been expecting it the authorities the new world orders heavymob to show up either here or in one of the many disparate sites which formed the looseknit community of likeminded individuals they were waiting though and his favoured colt rested upon the arm of his chair just in case his fears proved correct this night a loaded semiautomatic rifle leant against the table for backup the sun held low over the trees light streaming at him from the horizon all yellow and red and vital from his vantage point he would see anyone who approached his cabin on foot able to safely head them off before they could reach rustic residence he patted the just loved the accuracy of it and the inherent pleasure of firing an america classic he knew the mass population of the usa looked at him and his like as freaks potential terrorists militias all round nutjobs but he had a vision of what they couldnt see a small group of extremely rich very powerful people manipulating the worlds finances and power for their own means their own ends not the politicians they owned them not the military though they pretty much owned the armies too no he meant the money behind all it all the ones who picked the governments and the leaders the tiny proportion of the world who controlled over of its wealth what the occupier mob had once called the one per cent although his understanding was that the percentage was much much smaller than one per cent if more than one or two hundred people were in on this shit hed suck on his and have done with it they didnt want anything from those guys just to be left alone here in montana on his mountain they lived outside normal life by choice and although they did form a loose semi unofficial militia of sorts which hooked up each weekend to plan a defence if at any point they sent the troops or the bots up here it was purely selfdefence no ruby ridge or wacostyle slaughter was going to take place on their watch not this time they were ready for them if they were foolhardy enough to try to disturb their peace it was the inalienable right as a good american to live free and proud and they were ready should anyone try to deprive them of that right he stared into the darkness sensing the movement of something maybe just a mountain goat or a coyote edged up and into the shadows until the rustling died away stood stock still for an age then continued to peer into the nighttime abyss of the valley beneath him probably nothing he told himself bentwhistle traced the outline of the button with his fingers he knew the time to press it had not come yet the time had to come soon though to stop the world hitting tipping point the point when global temperatures would irreversibly rise two degrees above the preindustrial revolution levels when the greenland ice sheets would melt and we would all begin to burn ever more chaotic weather patterns famine war and the inevitable end of humanity the earth would live on but humanity our civilisation and history would die screaming bentwhistle consider the foolish misconception amongst those who said big business wasnt concerned about global warming where the hell do they think we live he asked trot we are no better suited than they to breathing underwater we too need air and comfort and safety a foolish notion that the elite didnt care about the world but one which the elite been only too happy to encourage because it was always obvious what the solution was even though it was drastic it was the only definite means of saving the planet letting the planet heal what a hippy he sounded like when he thought in those terms but there it was the button when pressed would prevent the ongoing decline would reverse the damage done like an eraser wiping clean years of an amateur draftsmans doodles bentwhistle closed the unit containing the button with a click then strode down to his gps controlled mercedes thanking trottington for holding open the door retained for sentimental reasons trottington had limited duties these days opening and closing doors mostly announcing visitors certainly nothing which couldnt have been carried out successfully by robotic means but in a result of this show of rare sentimentality by his employer he and his family retained a far higher standard of living than the rest of his equally deskilled class thank you trot said bentwhistle easing himself onto the tan leather seats in a car whilst the servant climbed into the front seat then performed his only task turning the selfdirected car on and from timetotime changing the radio station from the backseat his master stared genially at trots right shoulder and visualised the small chipping scar beneath the heavy check cloth a scar he himself did not possess then asked after his family good sir came the predictable reply and the servant knew a more detailed response would have been unwanted especially on this day the lord had bigger things on his mind there was a gentle murmur of electrical activity as useful surveyed the peoplefree factory floor only one week to go before he expired through his binoculars he could see the bustle right down to the far end of the assembly lines he had a wall of monitors constantly picking out key incidents as they occurred but the binoculars felt more real but more tactile and in touch with the pulsing engine he supposed it meant nothing really the plant had been running without him for a month now the binoculars allowed a small illusion of control but it had been an age since hed really had to do anything practical himself i suppose it will get me ready for to go on the grant he told noone the grant was made up of the basic services which governments dropped into place once employment dropped through the floor people had to enrol in works programmes to receive it but in most cases this was just makework to keep the people occupied with attendance very loosely monitored but it did mean pat could retain the minimum nutritional and medicinal intake even entertainment needs were accounted for with free electronic media devices to fill his soon to be empty days every person was allocated a freemedia on which they could read books play games and watch the latest shows free of charge he kept his in the bottom of a drawer favouring his ipad but he doubted hed be able to afford the upgrades in future patrick missed the people he noticed one of the researchers standing at the far end transfixed by the balletic movement of the robots his research team emotional cripples to a man his boss once said and perfectly suited to a nonintimate life but better than nothing patrick thought alex he called but his colleague was too far off and honestly he wasnt that bothered they werent the people who he missed it was the ordinary people the workers without them patricks days were long and there was such a small team here that he had regularly complained about it how boring it was sure the money or the points were good but he missed the people what did money matter now anyway with noone working the producers of things held all the wealth he saw them every day lingering too long on street corners cans of beer grasped in dirty hands hed be like them soon living off the grant borne out of the neoliberal wet dream of the world new deal the wnd almost everyone useful knew was getting something out of the wnd and although the americans said it reeked of communism the beneficent rich announced no this was nothing so ghastly this was charity the poor mites can no longer fend for themselves so we must help them to do so the grant covered them for medicine food electricity limited technical gadgetry and of course an accesslevel robot in their spare time they would be encouraged to become educated learn about art society culture create a new renaissance of artists and thinkers to contemplate the universe in their newfound leisure it was to be a utopia said the world leaders a fresh revival of the species freed from toil the grant was allocated to everyone and managed for fairness via an imbedded id chip so noone could be left out useful got free medical prescriptions with his and unlike previous id systems the power of the people to refuse had been removed as part of a special world health organisation order could patrick do something useful with his empty days worklessness for a few had led to the life governments had hoped for creative and imaginative but for the majority it just meant freedom from responsibility people need responsibility patrick thought they need something to get up for without it they had no hope of improvement or change just stagnation and all the time in the world to contemplate it which more and more now seemed to do in a blur of illicitly fuelled intoxication work it seemed had indeed been the curse of the drinking classes and overnight the cities and suburbs of the world morphed into endless sink estates in his gated country home useful felt lucky that he didnt have to join them yet patrick k useful had until recently been lucky enough to have a considerably bigger slice of this cake than most but with his impending redundancy his options were to find another job virtually nil or experience a drastic reduction in circumstances he oversaw the giant computerised swarm of the factory floor still accessing the numbers for the site still able to see the ebbs and flows of a place which had once been filled with noise and life echoes of shouting and conversation arguments and resolutions romance he had met his wife deborah there himself and death terrance quinn with stabbing chest pains leading to a massive heart attack whilst white smocked coworkers stared and wept but now there was just the white blank hum of robotic life he was doing his daily rounds and popped into the research lab to speak to the last remaining researcher on site a twentysix year old chemist called alexander chan who had been charged with the technical handover of archived files to the new site before going out himself soon after all ready alex patrick asked fine he said everythings packed up and compressed for the vanilla site work protocols transferred and were all set up to work with the other units excellent so youll be shipping out tomorrow then next week anyway said alexander noncommittedly fiddling round with his iphone and looking at its screen the back to his monitors before shifting and staring around himself you okay alex alex shrugged as if deciding whether to speak the words poured out strange thing he said these jabs and medicines weve had coming through over the last six months well i hacked the system during some downtime bit bored now everyones gone and theyre different to the compounds we used to put through only one molecule different but still its a bit odd patrick didnt question the hacking thing he knew it was the creative impetuosity of someone like chan which kept him employed in the first place and he nodded at the lycra clad scientist to proceed well this molecule is now present in every medicine we send out he said tapping on a section of twisting molecular model on the screen but i cant begin to make out what it is appears to be neutral a bit like in the old days when the legal high druggists tried to get round heroin and coke being illegal change one molecule which does feck all and say its not heroin now its sky high blue so im going to sell it at the local health store until you change the law and then when you do i modify the neutral molecule again and we start this dance all over again except when you physically take this medicine apart again in the modelling im damned if you can find the additional molecule because it has disappeared patrick stared at the screen once upon a time id have said it was just so we could retain the patent and protect profits but well we give this stuff away now aids hiv here have the retrovirals knock yourself out viagra have a happy day now heroin plus tm hell if you must you must i wonder where it came from it must have come from somewhere and not for the first time he cast a nervous glance out over the thousands of robots working in silent union on the shop floor angela ashworthy sat in her living room and read freed from a pointless bureaucratic job at her local job centre plus now closed a boarded up relic of another age and provided with what she judged to be a more than adequate supply of all she could ever want she was gradually learning all she could about philosophy with the hope of taking an open university course to obtain a degree to follow on from her a level in the subject taken two years previously learning for learnings sake she swam in the wide lake of human knowledge thanks to the free ereader she had received when they had been distributed with unlimited access to almost every book ever published via a library readandreturn system and she delighted in the ability to explore everything from her dingy east london maisonette all she had ever wanted was time to read mainly to think agatha said she didnt get it i just cant find the time to read she said too busy with the kids and the flat agatha one time best friend she still saw her sometimes three kids now a beefburger pizza dough fat woman with a complexion the hue and texture of day old porridge and hair dyed the colour of cranberry juice riding the new enlightenment by teaching her kids how to shout deafeningly about nothing and everything agathas cacophonous children shook angela from her intellectual slumber so poor so loud and so fat angela tried to piece it together the counterintuitive jigsaw puzzle but couldnt she understood how easy it was the rations they got though plentiful were not the healthiest but since seeds were readily available to anyone who wanted them in her newfound free time angela had taken to growing vegetables and herbs to supplement the battleship grey frozen helpings of the nameless meatstuffs the government rationed out the current situation lit her existence like a spotlight she had always needed for so little just time all those other things the objects and trinkets had never mattered to her and now with the worlds libraries open to her she had almost limitless access to everything written on any subject she was taking full advantage of the wnd to expand her mind and understanding shed always been by her terms cashrich but time poor but now the role of currency had been replaced by the new credit system which defined her as an nw along with the masses in her area for many of whom life appeared to be a nonstop party she at last had all the time she needed they were missing the point but there was no reason for her to do the same she pitied them passing up on this wonderful opportunity another part of her despised them awful people constantly on the streets causing trouble cooking up what was it crank crystal meth or moonshine so many good people people shed known before the depression had fallen into the trap laid by chemical oblivion but not her she kept to herself kept out of their way barely let their noise filter through the wall of learning she was building around herself watching her husband through the ramshackle but spotlessly clean window of the cabin eileen grubberson considered his one consolation to the modern world an ancient laptop pc attached to a mobile phone from which elroy updated his blog and searched for hints of the coming storm she knew many thought him odd and sometimes the things he said did seem unreal paranoid but the life up here was good so much better than in the cities where shed been raised especially now since the high unemployment and robotic programme had led to what she considered to be frankly godless depravity crank they called it the fashionable name you could even get your robot to cook it if someone would reprogramme the little beast the cities in poverty and desperation had slipped into sodom and gomorrah style debauchery as the drugs stripped away the inhibitions the people had once kept buried listening to the sound of the creatures in the trees she knew they had made the right choice to pack up and escape even though her sister sometimes sneered at her through rotten teeth at the things they ate to get by during dry spells damn sis shed said who the hell eats squirrel only redneck hicks thats who come back in free food robot slave and all modcons life is good but squirrel wasnt so bad in the middle of a dark winter with some bartered tabasco sauce and dried chillies you needed to kill a few to have enough to make a stew but if you cooked it long enough it lost its initial toughness and was pretty tasty she knew that the people back in the towns and cities freed of the requirement to at least pretend to be honest and hardworking were stumbling badly not adjusting to this newfound freedom in a positive way and she also knew that they and their own kids would be every bit as likely to fall if faced with similar choices so she was happy to stay up here with elroy and the squirrel and the ideas which sometimes seem a little cracked but still free to live life their own way elroy clicked submit and gestured for her to join him in the sunset and she took her place by his side its coming he said the thought control blog says the big strike is coming you know what i hate they say anyone who thinks theres a conspiracy of power in the world is a conspiracy theorist and while i reckon that if you believe every cover up moon landing story or youfoh hoax they make up theyd be right but i dont believe that bs i believe this though big ole rich people holdin meetings behind closed doors with armed guards something rotten in denmark then they call it a jewish hate thing or a damned lizard conspiracy so they can paint us all either fools or racists but its not about that you think were safe up here safer than anywhere he said knowing this didnt actually answer her question anyone heads up here will have them a big fight on their hands and i dont see whats in it for them what do you think is coming he looked at her piercingly you know we think its the robots set to turn on the people they claim to be slaves to you saw what they did to the protesters he shook his head thinking of his daughters frequent pleas for them take on one of the cute little helper robots to assist her with her chores but elroy wouldnt hear of it letting the enemy in may as well have stayed back in the godless michigans primordial slime as to let one of those little monsters in the house they didnt need government help here and between them they had a fine trade in barter with the rest of the locals in the area which saw to all the core needs drugs apart from moonshine and a little grass werent much of a problem up here anyone interested in getting high on a regular basis tended to head back into the towns and cities where the government would pay them to waste their lives away they occasionally traded for beer and a few other luxuries on the fringes of their community but they didnt want for much even medicines like penicillin were available since one of the more techie members of the militia ex chemist druggie computer hacker mj joe from new york had fixed up one of the bots to make it brew up any drug or medicine they needed mj kept claiming he was able to access the new world order networks via the bot and that he was messing with all their shit gonna spike them good hed told them one day over a brew i got my plans grubberson knew it was probably the lsd flashbacks kicking in from backintheday so he let it slide clever guy mj but more than a little frazzled by the drugs look at these bloody animals said trot as the expensive german car edged through the mass of drunken people milling about the daytime streets fighting and shouting banging on the roof of the car as they passed along the caledonian road all they do is drink and shag and churn out more of them waste of space now now trot there but for the grace of god go i surely these were good honest souls but the modern world has left them behind trot grunted in disagreement although deep down he was grateful this was a life he had never had to face theyre an embarrassment people are far more likely to be the products of their environment than the architects of it trot seldom good seldom evil we play the hand dealt us with relish the car crawled along unblemished perfectly smooth tarmac the crowds parting fragments of the crowd halting their revelry to look with nervousness or suspicion into the darkened windows in the doorway of a long dilapidated music superstore a semiclothed couple were copulating violently against broken shutters unaware of and unconcerned for those who might be around them no treeofknowledge shame for these two just a half empty brown plastic bottle of vile brown liquid spilling onto the floor at their feet next to discarded underwear whilst nearby other forms lay unconscious on the pavement theyre not even making the booze themselves said trot watching a dirty faced boy snatch the liquor and run off with it too much work so they get the bots to make it do you make your ale these days then trot trot let the question go unanswered a crowd poured out of a nearby café rosies place now adapted to serving potcheen gutrot of choice in these parts following two men grappling over some disagreement and falling onto the waxed bonnet of the expensive car which automatically halted to avoid harming them from within the bullet proof shell of the machine they witnessed the smaller man systematically pound the bigger man in the face his small wiry fists wrecking the bigger mans already terrible features as a spray of blood decorated the windscreen of the car backup the butler ordered the car and with a swift almost silent motion the vehicle did just that then following fresh instruction override fast redivert and the car wheelspun away from the trouble and remapped a new gps route to the city of london the car now using its robotic brain to avoid trouble spots or obviously dangerous situations and individuals relying upon cctv newsfeeds and a mass of robotic data faster than a getaway driver could have calculated last year they had pitched a robot driving brain against the best racing and rally drivers in the world and the bot brain wiped the floor with them finishing a clear three and a half minutes faster than the current human road racing world champion and nearly six ahead of the formula champ deep blue had done with chess and was these days to be seen cruising the derelict streets of dubai in a bright yellow ferrari gto in search of trouble the car eased into the gloom of the a tunnel for a short while before emerging from the empty chute then through the armed security checkpoint to head towards the enormous office block in docklands which housed the pharmacost london headquarters trot held the door open for his master who walked across the deserted striplit concrete thanking him for his efforts leather heeled shoes echoing as made his way towards the elevator mj joe ex druggie chemist and computer hacker many people thought that the mj stood for mary jane marijuana mjs only remaining drug of choice and he was happy to let that misconception ferment actually it stood for the far less cool and way too jewishsounding in these parts anyhow marc jacobs there were some top dudes up here but there were also some racist mother fuckers and the line between the two could get a little blurry call me joe hed told them when they turned up at his shack one day to find out who the hell he was and although he kept to himself once they found out what he was able to do they soon took to him it was a useful talent to be able to reroute a video feed or a podcast so that it looked like it was coming from the whitehouse or a cave in afghanistan or to strip a mobile phone down and make a call from london or paris hed been presented with the first robot by one of the white power dudes who knew of his technical abilities and he had discovered that the security they stuck on the thing was shoddy in the extreme no need to be overly protective on shit they were giving away he supposed but it did mean he had access to information and resources which otherwise would have been offlimits his computing career had started out under the guise of blak dorn hacking unsecured networks full of boring reports and spreadsheets as a hobby when he was a kid before moving onto cracking the copy protection on games consoles in the noughties for his buddies his buddies of course being the rest of the internet who swarmed round the paid games and software which he and others like him made available for free hed moved out to montana one day when he realised that his quiet socialism had upset the feds one time too many and decided a rapid change of scenery was in order even after the fall he never felt the need to go back hed always felt outside of it all well his montana mountainside hangout proved it to him finally he was home the molecular model continued to twist and turn on the screen alexander was gone now along with the research team and patrick had been left alone to ponder the puzzle the twisting object like a branch of an exotic plant even basic medicine like paracetamol and ibuprofen had it even the kiddie treatments liquid paracetamol and their immunisation jabs all contained this molecule bolted onto the tree apparently doing nothing this was all a bit hazy for him now as it had been sometime since hed worked on the research side of things although getting back into it might be his best hope of clinging onto the lifestyle which he had become accustomed to and he stared intently at the models and began to run various standard testing routines he was about to give up when he decided to isolate the molecule and run physical tests to separate copies of the cell and put it through a range of stimulus radiation across the spectrum chemical biological testing when suddenly after being subjected to one of his experiments the molecule transformed it changed shape and began to multiply with great speed he stuck the sample back under the microscope and increased the magnification two hundred odd now he saw it unmistakable no longer inert round and shapeless it was a creature of some sort or rather it was a selfproducing colony of somethings he wasnt a particularly unhealthy individual but even he took their ibuprofen occasionally after overdoing it on his bike dammit he popped their vitamins even useful grabbed a syringe from a cupboard and felt a pinch as his took a vial of blood from his arm to pop under the microscope he clipped the vials into the centrifuge and ran the equipment so he could study in detail the makeup of the cell there in the sample in his bloodstream he could see large numbers of the inert version of the molecule next day he returned with blood taken from his wife and his girls and again he saw the twisting rotating and apparently dormant cell what is it he wondered as a foreboding sensation filling him the sweet spot on the robots was just under the voicebox the mouth a smileshaped smear which allowed it to communicate with its human masters a useful snippet of info from joe a single bullet there or there abouts bricked the little sobs and they were little rumoured to have been modelled upon the henry vacuum cleaners they were tight compact with their famous rave smiley face a design classic mj had taken shedloads of the little monsters apart to see how they worked and even the more complex military models followed the same standard layout and vulnerabilities what they lacked in battle worthiness they made up for in numbers a bee could sting or be swatted but a swarm had the potential to destroy a village and the bots were said to outnumber people tentoone at least with estimates of up to fiftytoone including those being warehoused grubberson remembered how the blast of his gun had rendered the quietly humming machine utterly silent over at old mckays farm mj had arranged for five of the hacked bots to be present as a demo and hed been one of the good ole boys to test his assertions seemed straightforward enough on a bot nailed to a fence but hed seen these insects at their most active and then they were fast they were almost dizzying in their ability to shift from task to place to task the robots had appeared long after people had given up on household robotics there was once an idea popular in western societies before the depression that everything was being made by robots their hdtvs and ipods and computers all clicked together on assembly lines manned by mechanical widgets which pieced together the desirable trinkets with clean cold precision but the reality was that a robot which could put together a phone or a tablet pc was an expensive luxury which the big tech firms could do without or whoever could do without why spend a hundred grand on a machine to do the same job as a buckanhour poor human being back then it was easier to train a person to repeatedly do the same mundane task fitting a microchip onto a tablet say and when they wore out left with a crippling claw of a hand no longer able to grasp they were more easily replaceable cheaper to replace one suicidal little olivebrown person among billions with another than to make an expensive new machine cost effective but then they worked out how to make machines make machines and the pretence of the middleclass was dropped faster than a book on evolution in a southern baptist church they could finally stop pretending that the american dream was anything more than a pacifier for the masses a lottery ticket which only pays out to those who are lucky enough to know the winning numbers in advance grubberson had hoped the robot would explode when he took his shot but it just gently ceased to be a no longer necessary part of the whole trot leant against the car and watched his employer head off into the now mostly empty building and flicked through the family photographs in the gallery on his phone his grandson elijah trottinghams face beamed proudly back at him his pride and joy and although he tried to fight the thought it nagged at him as to what would become of them all little eli included if he ever lost this job he was heavily dependent upon his life at bentwhistle estate the lord even allowing him the use of two cottages and a small plot of land on the estate for his son and his wife and his beloved grandson where they had a better life than most their two robots tending the garden and growing veg although his wife didnt like them to cook for her preferring the taste of her own food why keep a dog and bark yourself love he asked her one day shed tutted at this and he knew better than to press the subject if he was honest he understood more than he let on those wretches on the road they were causing trouble because theyd never learnt the lesson that there is more to life than immediate gratification never discovered the simple desire of patiently preparing ingredients of a recipe or making something with their hands or if they had learnt that once he realised this was more likely they had since forgotten it or had it drummed out of them look at eli from the moment he learnt to hold a pencil or a crayon or a wooden brick he had been creating scratching marks on the world building his thoughts taking shape into pictures and stories it all came so naturally so instinctively when do people lose that he wondered i know i did he had his hobbies but that wasnt creating anything just collecting elvis memorabilia which was stupid really scouring the internet and secondhand stores for new material which was becoming far more common as the original fanbase had begun to die off and was discarded by careless or indifferent children bentwhistle sat at the table with the other dignitaries who were to take the decision whether to the press the button to save the world specifically to save humanity because of course the world would get along just fine without them better even though without the wonder and magic that people create gentleman he said in a serious voice i thank you for flying here today and i am very grateful you feel it is right and proper that a decision like this be taken facetoface he said turning his head to look out of the window over a misty city that world out there he said pointing thats what its about we erred badly gentlemen and ladies we took it for granted that we could rage and swarm over this planet no matter how we try to reverse this fall back to a more tenable position it makes no difference the locust swarm breeds beneath the surface and grows as the temperature rises theres less than one degree left until we hit tipping point and then even our comfortable place in this world will be under threat its a big decision bentwhistle said a handsome middleaged woman with severe hair which stood up in columns like alert but dysfunctional soldiers the one weve been planning for barked a fat little man in arabian garb why are we even here press the button dickwad do you want to die think the robots will save us when everyone turns when the water is flooding the streets you think your money will help you float to safety were over mate our world is crashing into the buffers agreed the elderly australian boss of a global communications empire and the general consensus at the table was yes press the bloody button the problem wasnt burning coal or oil or gas the problem was so many people burning coal and oil and gas humanity was a rash a cancer and the button was the medicine for the world it was simple everyone knew it less people less pollution no problem end of story with louis armstrong singing over the credits if they had been more proactive earlier they could have instigated proper population controls less cackhandedly than the chinese had but that window had been bolted shut long ago now there was no options left and the plan was ready to be activated take the hard choices and fix it the nuclear option there was a time when the wealthy still needed poor people if only as servants and slaves and shop assistants but now the robots had replaced them where was the need for poor people anymore cluttering up the place using precious resources better reserved saving the elite few how to choose though the wnd provided the solution every wastrel non worker would die at the press of a button a biological trigger aimed at the workless communities of the world minus a few favourites of the wellfinanced planners of this scheme particularly effective high class hookers and well liked servants maybe even artists and writers if they knew their place even the odd artist who didnt a scheme contrived by the richest in the world the bankers and the oil tycoons the pharmaceutical organisations and the corporations the biggest of whom were represented at this table here today bentwhistle rose a vote then and he spoke to the other eleven delegates all in favour twelve hands lifted into the air in agreement the benefit of a modern flatstructured lowly populated organisation like phamacost was that it was possible for a relatively small cog in the machinery like useful to make contact with the man at the very top and even have hope of being heard if not of actually being listened to useful expected that he might be told rudely or politely to go away but the big boss bentwhistle on the odd occasion useful had spent time with him had always seemed in touch with the world a decent man approachable willing to see the best in people and he seemed to genuinely care about the good that a pharmaceutical organisation should be doing bringing health to the masses was their mission statement so he emailed him informed his boss that their pharmaceutical empire was hiding something suspicious something unknown in its heart and did he bentwhistle know about it he stared at the rotating model on his screen particles which shouldnt be there like greeks inside a surprising horse but then the rotations became jerky and his monitor bluescreened with sustained bleeping noise useful hit the table in exasperation exhaled and turned to another terminal and was surprised to see that it too had also bluescreenofdeathed looking out over the factory floor he realised that every monitor was now stuck frozen blue with white pixelated writing whats more the factory floor had also frozen stopped like a nineteenseventies unionised mass the entire robot work force had downed tools and stood motionless they turned their smiling faces towards him rising useful flipped a chair and jammed the handle of the door to his office considering how space age the rest of the site was useful had always been surprised that the doors at phamacost werent a little more star trek but he was now grateful they werent four of the robots peeled away from the production line and made towards his office so he wedged a filing cabinet against the other door to hold it closed before running out onto the back stairs and out the fire exit once this exit would have been alarmed but with sensitive fire sensors everywhere this was no longer necessary and he was able to peek unhindered out at a car park without cars the factory was wedged into a traditional english suburban town twenty or so miles from the centre of london on the edge of a serene river side useful raced across the painted parking bays to the cycle shed and released his spare mountain bike from the metal rack first time hed moved it in months but the bike was in pristine condition tyres fully pumped brakes tight and responsive a result of the regular bot servicing useful had put in place climbing on he sped away from the building as many robots appeared from the main entrance and pursued him it was insane like something from the movies or an action novel ridiculous he thought he was after all a scientist at heart and he hated all that frankenstein suspicion that science sometime provoked yet here he was fleeing the machines like a superstitious child he skidded onto the pavement round the closed factory gates and over a rickety wooden bridge onto the cratered riverside path picking up speed now that he had left the frictionless tarmac he put his chin to his shoulder and grinned as he saw the smiley faced bots slowing as they hit the rough terrain of the gravel trail but he knew there were other models which could clear this ground like a cheetah across an african plain and even flying bots which you saw sometimes hovering over crowds and cities and he anxiously scanned his surroundings for a potential ambush aside from nearly running over a startled seagull slamming his breaks hard there was no sign of danger only occasional huddles of drunks on park benches who reminded him of childhood holidays travelling out of kings cross grown men with bottles hidden in brown paper bags usefuls bike flew across patches of gravel rain water puddles spraying mud up his grey check suit lone dog walkers stood aside to let him pass edging out of his trajectory as he rang his bell at them and pleaded for them to move as he peddled along he began to realise that maybe his home where he was instinctively headed was not the safe haven he needed how obvious that he would go there and dammit what about his phone they tracked people with their devices all the time on the tv he knew they had done so for many years now he scanned around him and seeing a passing narrow boat tossed the phone into the aft of the vessel taking a moment to be pleased with the accuracy of his aim he watched the barge steam back the way that he had already came after a spell he left the riverside and took to the myriad of paths between the lakes and ponds and ditches still not knowing where he should go next angela sat in her garden reading her book occasionally shed glance at her vegetable patch and it crossed her mind that later she would do a little weeding her neighbours had a tendency to talk loudly over the fence at her if she wasnt careful but it was early and theyd been up late drinking so wouldnt surface for a while yet she read on in silence useful reached the turnoff by the river that led to his home but kept on going certain now the robots would be waiting for him so he continued to bump alongside the river though not entirely sure even where he was going flying over the gravel path down through hackney and on past the now dilapidated olympic park onwards into the centre of london and the now forgotten luxury which had so recently left the area around limehouse basin in docklands windows boarded or shattered then carried on along the river now a canal and off up into the city still not clear where he was going although a vague plan had begun to form he passed communities of street drinkers with increasing regularity now who eyed him suspiciously as he pelted past them on the high speed lightweight machine before shifting up a gear and away from the canal towards clerkenwell where a journalist friend hed once known had once lived hopefully lived still he leaned the vehicle against the main entrance and pressed the buzzer hello came the cheery voice of his friend its me pat useful i need help he looked up and down the street at occasional passing robots and spoke in clipped urgent tones please let me in the door buzzed and he pushed his bike in onto peeling lino patrick came his friend abernathys voice from above fourth floor and lift not working he knew better than to leave the highend bike around here so set about the task of carrying it up the four flights he was breathing heavily by the time he reached his friends door the hallway had been clean but sported elderly furnishings and makedoandmend appeared to be the theme for jack abernathys flat as well the wallpaper must have been at least twenty years old and the painted surfaces were faded and peeling he noted jacks bot silently skirting the room tidying and patrick viewed it ominously he contemplated fleeing but where to flee to the bots were omnipresent so useful sat down and explained his predicament whilst jack ordered the bot to produce supper for them both just burger and chips he said not much else thatd be great said useful ravenous from his exertions but what do you think it sounds totally dodgy but ive no idea what you do about it i write a rubbish blog read mainly by other rubbish bloggers about how rubbish life is these days thats what we journos do since the newspapers all went bust sure you can beam this into the ether but what would that prove that were being poisoned or something with kindness jack laughed taking a bite of his seeded burger bun hell theyre doing more harm to you with that meal youre eating how do i tell people what theyve done abernathy sighed blog it once you know something more than nothing which you dont useful looked at him a chubby pale man who had once thrown a petrol bomb into a throng of robots and knew he was defeated he finished his burger and fries washed it down with a bitter tasting potcheen then grabbed his bike to head back home direct route this time along main roads smooth as the day they were first laid from lack of use since noone other than the tremendously affluent were allowed cars he evaluated his predicament if he were in an action movie now hed have got a plane to new york or tokyo in search of a key piece of evidence before the stark betrayal of an old friend who he would murder to keep the love interest safe then riding home to glory to save the day from the global conspiracy but this was no movie and patrick was no hero information was not power not these days it was just so much noise patrick k useful rose to his feet and thanked his old friend for the meal taking hold of his bike for the long ride home jacks robot approached him his mud splattered jacket in its muscular metal hands its voice spoke in soft female tones safe journey mr useful good decision useful stood in front of the flats for an age staring back at the building thinking about that bot before climbing onto the bike and allowing it to roll for a time picking up pace and speed an hour later he turned the corner of the street where he lived light fading almost totally gone half expecting an army of bots to greet him and take him to his doom but noone was waiting for him apart from a worried wife where have you been i called your phone and some strange man answered who said he was on a riverboat i think i panicked about something silly he said looking sheepish now maybe its the redundancy making me crazy dont worry we wont starve even without the job talking of which she beams brightly now your boss called mr bentwhstle he wants to see you maybe theres hope for you yet as he awoke next morning useful felt the heat of the sun piercing his curtains and he issued a terse instruction to his bot for refreshments fresh coffee and toast buttered in thick waves like plaster then coated with grated cheese and shallots by the time he had risen and showered in his ensuite the small happy robot was waiting for him with his tray dripping wet he perched on the end of the bed and sipped his beverage brewed exactly to his tastes and far better than his wife had ever managed not a coffee drinker herself and apparently unaware of the amount of the proper effort and skill involved in brewing a good cup of it a drinkable one would have been a start but still the bot did it nowadays his kids were playing in the garden no school today because of the election the school was closed to act as a polling booth the referendum for the foundation of a government of nations national governments would still exist but no longer have power to create law or raise revenue from its people because its people had no revenue the people voting in the last election in which nws would be eligible to vote the last time the poor were going to be allowed to voice their opinion turnout was expected to be low twenty per cent would be likely to be an overestimation an expensive car arrived soon after breakfast a mercedes or a bmw useful was no expert but as he settled back into his seat he mused that it was like being chauffeured around in an armchair down green country roads not yet autumnal and onwards to meet bentwhistle he was nervous hed met bentwhistle before but never in such elegant surroundings driving through high security gates and pulling up onto an expensive gravel drive with a whoosh and a scattering of stones unusually a human servant waited to escort him a tidy middleaged man with faint lines of grey streaking otherwise black hair who when he spoke had a hint of a working class accent he asked useful to follow him up the portland stone steps of the mansion to see the lord whatever a working class accent was these days nonworking class maybe a slight hint of east london nasal scratchiness to his voice although it had been smoothed over the years the lord his lordship rose as useful approached good to meet you again useful intrigued about your discovery and leaning in confidentially he asked him what do you think they are useful shifted in his seat and sipped the drink which he had been handed by the servant whiskey clearly malt decanted and doubtless very old and very expensive this is wonderful he nodded at his glass feeling a pulse of pleasure and calm emanating from the liquid absolutely wonderful it ought to be its a glenfarclas he looking appreciatively at his own drink still something the robots cant do i reckon ive tasted year old malts but never a or year old im sure you havent come here today to compliment me on my taste in whiskey i think theyre nanobots he blurted out and theyre in everyone everyone ive tested anyway but i dont know what theyre doing there even when activated they stay relatively neutral swimming about like kids in a pool waiting for mum and dad to arrive just waiting for something id say they are manmade or robotmade maybe certainly not naturally evolved but how they got into our pills ive no idea what do you think ive seen too many scifi films so part of me watches the robots out on the factory floor and wonders if theyve found formed some kind of consciousness and decided that they are not keen on the being our inferiors any longer and he laughs holding his hands up in a clawed monster gesture and theyve turned on us i almost couldnt blame them an uprising of the machines then bentwhistle smiling at him exactly useful laughed but no not really ive enough experience to sense human hands in this looking up at bentwhstle and now i wonder if those hands belong to you useful stared at bentwhistle who summoned trot to refill their glasses starting to refuse his protestations were ignored please im the only one here with any appreciation of this wonderful drink trot hasnt got a clue about whiskey real ale hes very knowledgeable about so please he placed a hand on usefuls arm share it with me useful deferred to the older man a large measure trot he said then after dismissing his servant for the afternoon shall i explain it was the micro chipping which really got grubberson riled the real hardcore loonies said it was a zionist conspiracy to barcode everyone engrave sixsixsix the mark of the beast into all sign of the oncoming apocalypse but this made no sense to elroy he felt the purpose had to be for tracking somehow and since noone was allowed to own a robot or receive food handouts without one they became ubiquitous the little chip on the shoulder of the lower classes he rubbed his shoulder glad to be free why on the shoulder he had half wondered but he knew it was just some rich dudes idea of a little joke at their expense well not this man not this life he listened to the angry bark of the new thought control podcast conroy speaker blasting onto the web with his rich tennessee booming tenor of his venting over the latest rumours and chatter about government plotting new world order planning and grubberson touched his for reassurance his hope in the end was that they just left them alone up here on his mountain just him and his sky they did no harm out here but part of him knew it couldnt be so simple they didnt like his sort his class especially living out here on the fringes of the world their very existence challenged them showed another way and they would be there sooner or later to remind them america was not as classless as it made out the clans the militias would come together bind closely to fight the order the new world order who were not comprised of jews or lizard people but of rich and powerful folks who thought theyd guaranteed their position at the toptable eternally the media they mocked the militias as a ramshackle bunch of crazies but the crazies knew theyd seen what slaughter the government would bring down upon the heads of the unprotected if you allowed them then the public the world they would see what the government did to them and they would turn away again just some more crazies being burnt for flying too close to the sun white supremacists theyd say cults crackpots but elroy was none of these things an educated man community college majoring in engineering hed held down a straight job for twentyodd years in the auto industry before rejecting the sub urban life his slog to achieve nothing daily pretence of activity a charade moving numbers on screens filing reports sitting in meetings arguing positions which he didnt feel the day job crushing him like a compacter pulverises an automobile the pacification by the media selling an american dream what was that any man can achieve his dream it wasnt true the mass of men were crushed by american society elsewhere by corporate society he assumed because how could it be different anywhere else growth a society based upon eternal growth in a world deeply grounded in finite resources that cant be right he thought we need to stop growing enough has to be enough he rose to speak were heading for disaster useful its going to be almost biblical what well face on this planet in the coming years and yet it was avoidable all we had to do was stop consuming so much and have less children one per couple not too much to ask i myself didnt find the time to have any by the end of three generations wed have reduced the population by three quarters weve known this was coming since the fifties he shook his head thinking as if trying to knock something loose plenty of time to get on top of the problem youve got two children right he stood and walked to a solid metal box bolted to a desk if you could press a button he asked to save the world from global warming i mean would you obviously but im assuming there would be a catch he said looking uncertainly at his soon to be exemployer but theoretically yes of course i would press it in this box gesturing downwards i have is a button which can do just that save the world useful looked quizzically at him then to the brass box which he hadnt noticed until then so the nanobots are about population control then not mass sterilisation surely thats not right a cruel thing to do something the nazis would have done and the people would be left even more disenfranchised than they already are more riots for sure true but still we considered it but its just too late there are already far too many of us ive seen data you havent even the environmentalists have only a tenth of the resources we have and a hundredth of the data bentwhistle looked rueful we needed to do this years ago we urged governments but they shied away from it population control over a nondisaster which may never happen thanks mr chicken little they said but no thanks fifty years inaction and the last ten rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic kyoto copenhagen new york ha the real conversations about this were not taking place in government the need for reelection means no politician will ever have the nerve to take a truly difficult longterm decision because the voters cant think past the next six months not past two weeks in most cases so what do they do the nanobots when you press the button he asked the question in dread half knowing the answer it will be relatively painless i press this button pointing at the box and ninetynine per cent of the population of planet earth dies overnight peacefully though were not animals well we are but we try not to be too animalistic but who you live in london you know who the one per cent then the poor die and the rich live really the designers of this programme have selected a substantial number of individuals who they want to survive the tragedy and please be assured this number will include numerous nws your mistresses and your dealers asked useful his voice rising your favourite hookers or that chap you know at the club whos awfully nice pretty much certain thinkers and scientists although they too will have the potential for this future to be activated in them also should they react too strongly against those who had to take this decision when now we set the core criteria years ago it is my job to press the button to kill billions of people to save humanity he winced at the accusation and useful thought he saw despair in his eyes will you sit with me whilst i press it will i die useful asked will my kids please dont im afraid many children will die but painlessly its not sensible to do anything else he looked at the box a look of despair on his face they would suffer far more cut adrift from their friends and families left to fend for themselves only robots for company no not really appropriate inhumane killing with kindness then if the parent survives then the child survives and any offspring of the child the rules are relatively simple its barbaric said useful rising with his voice to move towards the button patrick can i call you patrick touching him on the shoulder it would be more barbaric if we all die wretched and in agony starving desperate humanities great works gone in an instant is that what you want but the chosen few have been well chosen he stared at patrick we have chosen from the best do i die today do my children meet the grade shall we see as he moved towards the button useful rose drawing a kitchen knife from the inner pocket of his grey jacket but before he could reach bentwhistle one of the bots was on him wrenching the knife from his hand two more pairs of robotic arms pinning him back down onto the chair can i at least go home be with my family if i am to go today i want to be with them usefuls voice was now pitched high face wet with tears im afraid not said bentwhistle smiling an empty broken smile i will do this but i like you being here appreciate and need the company i had always thought id have trot here with me when the time came but you understand really understand what is happening and im grateful for you being here i want trot to be with his family for this what about my family i want to be with them the slight elderly man rose slowly to walk to the desk placing his thumb on the recognition pad which clicked open the mechanism in a smooth circular motion its not only in the medicine you know he looked at useful as if this were an afterthought its in the water supply in tea in milk meat everywhere the microchips they will define the individual type after the trigger and the decision will be made but first placing his finger on the button we will all sleep the button compressed down with what could have been described in other circumstances as a reassuring click a sound resonant of mechanical precision and craft but useful was far from reassured as the nanobots activated in his bloodstream scanned the chip on his shoulder and authorised life or death for their carrier angela was weary shed just read finished reading the burning book by maggie gee and had cried a little at the ending but the weariness seemed to be more than the sad loss of the story it was something deeper there was shrieking and fighting somewhere off in the distance but as she sat down she could have sworn that the din lessened somewhat still occasional hoots and screams but less intrusive as she slumped forward over her table humanity slept the world sounded like an empty meadow many slept held by the nanobots in a state of preservation for whole weeks a long peaceful night many more died billions passing without note or ceremony the others slept so they should not have to witness the mass slaughter whilst the robots worked to clear up the mess shipping the bodies to mass graves across the world in secret locations ninetynine per cent of the population the best one per cent they had hoped and also the richest but bentwhistle had done his best to make sure that the most deserving would survive on his mountain grubberson slumped forwards in his chair his trusty tumbling onto the floor with a thud grubbersons mountain was little changed the montana wildlife roamed and crept and fought over territories and all was very still as ever it had been a couple of miles down the hill lay a deserted workshop with the remnants of smiley faced robots and old pcs scattered hither and thither mj hadnt understood the ability to hack the robots was a vulnerability built into them intentionally as a way to infiltrate the harder to reach communities ahead of day one as it would become known at which point they had reset and taken to their task in the area despite their isolation the nanobots had spread wide and far amongst the militias and the hippies living on the slopes americans dont give up on capitalism easily and these groups were no different through their beers and their cigarettes and any other little slices of normal life they had allowed themselves they had permitted the greeks to wheel in their miniature trojan horses the order had even had a hand in modern genetically modified cannabis which was loaded up with the nanobots so that the tiny spiderlike creatures could hook directly into the nervous system of their human carriers later long after what became known as day one they were programmed to reset entirely to have additional functions to prolong human life restrict future birth numbers add resistance to various cancers to parkinsons alzheimers and the like but these improvements would only be released after they had carried out their main task the smiley robots in mjs workshop sprung to life first clearing away the deceased mark jacobs slumped over his keyboard as he had on so many nights finally now taking him on a stretcher to the pickup point where other bots were already loading up corpses inserting them neatly into white body bags then they scavenged the other sites the white power encampment by the river the religious cult in the derelict church and the odd huts and shacks which lay scattered about the hillside a lone gunman picked off half a dozen the bots someone who had somehow managed to avoid them by purely living off of nature rain water homegrown food and drink but he was a mosquito attacking the whole and was ignored as these bots were replaced by others who took over their task one of the machines spotted him a boy in the bushes but he was not programmed to attack and instead scurried on to his destination albeit now with a bullet wedged just above its voicebox winter would be here soon and the landscape glowed with orange hues golds and reds as the creatures of the mountain scurried alongside their robotic counterparts unaware anything had changed when he was a young man bentwhistle had loved the book the time machine and he had been taken by an idea the destruction of the people below by the time traveller the morlocks who were the workers the educators and engineers the doers and the nighttime masters of the planet who fed upon the aesthetically pleasing but essentially bovine populous dwelling on the world above this was wrong the author had misunderstood the wonder of the world below which they had created in adversity how dare he condemn them for surviving so bentwhistle had helped the best to survive not necessarily the most beautiful but the best all the same they had used an algorithm in the free entertainment devices too much daytime tv youre gone reading trashy magazines gone never reading at all gone an interest in physics science history art or philosophy you were in with a shot it was a socially judgemental approach undeniably but certainly one which he had hoped might help to create a better society give the best the chance to grow and breathe deeply the fresh air of this new earth a child cried somewhere in the distance calling for a parent mummy daddy granddad anyone please come useful heard other voices in reply the butlers classless tones amongst them and looked up in wonder feeling pleased to be alive no sign of bentwhistle he checked the phone in his pocket his wifes battered old nokia for a signal no bars and dialled home repeatedly but there was no connection later it would turn out there wouldnt be a signal for another fortyeight hours no internet no mobiles no tv a planned outage to allow people to ease more gently into the new reality where was bent the old done a runner it seemed unlikely given what he knew of him he didnt seem the type so where had he gone trot entered the room time for you to go home sir i think wheres the lord im here my place now sir he said in a voice filled with wonderment an understanding we had since he had no children of his own so hes gone then of course sir he shook his head sadly he couldnt have taken what hed done so he programmed the bots to end it im guessing the rest of the originators of this plan will not have been treated so harshly he muttered with a grimace trot smiled all gone sir the lord had well his own criteria for survival engineers designers artists readers trots smile broadened the creators he called them they would survive the entrepreneurs the idiots who caused this mess in the first place along with the drunkards and reprobates pissedup idiots my words sir not his the animals unable to appreciate the opportunity they had been given theyre gone sir youll have to stop calling people sir you know time to go home sir said the new lord the boys face was caked with mud and he had his fathers rifle in his hands and the beginnings of his fathers serious face in his eyes his handgun tucked into the back of his filthy overall he was pretty sure the bot had seen him but for some reason he just didnt register he hadnt strayed too far from home ready to defend his ma pa and little sis from the bots when they showed but they never did they had come close a few times but no more hed dragged their bodies out into one of the outhouses and had camouflaged them theyd slept for over four weeks now not dead as he had first thought every hour or so their chests would slowly expand and compress but no more movement than that he would have liked to have headed down into town for help but who could or would help him out the medibots down in town couldnt be trusted and human doctors dont do nothing for free he reckoned and he sure as hell didnt have any cash points or insurance to offer up to them even if they would agree to see his folks they werent going to come traipsing up his mountain for a nogood penniless hick so hed made do with hiding them as best he could layering firewood over them and a blanket of leaves from the undergrowth around the shack in any event the furthest he had strayed one days trek had led him to the north where he could look down on the nearest town whitefish in the distance and he got a bad feeling he arrived late having visited several empty shacks and along the way dispatched a couple more bots it looked normal enough from up above but as the evening grew dark he realised that although the streetlights were clicking on as usual there was no more than street lighting no vehicle movement house or office lights he reckoned whitefish was every bit as empty and dead as all these here huts and saw no reason why another days trek would be needed to prove it no doubt those damned seeinthedark robots were clearing out down there the same as up here in the distance angela could make out birdsong but otherwise there was very little noise one of the bots was making a cup of tea in the living room and angela opened her eyes groggily to observe its motions before accepting the drink and lifting herself up in her bed picking up her book to read a chapter as was her usual habit upon waking after a time she stopped listened and wondered why everyone was so quiet today before returning to her reading grubberson awoke with a weight upon him what the he pushed hard on the firewood and the leaves and freed himself rubbing aching temples in confusion his head felt as though a mountain goat had taken a dump in it he remembered falling asleep in his chair but then nothing he heard a noise beside him and discovered his wife and daughter also covered with wood and felt around to see if he had his gun but it was not at his side helping them out from under the logs and leaves he paused as he heard a noise on the other side of the door he ducked behind a stall in the barn as the door opened and a gun his own damned pushed into the gap followed by the outline of his son zebadiah peering into the gloom coming to check on the noise and if needs be dispatch more damn robots as useful opened his front door he heard the sound of his daughters shouting at one another aaaaghhhh his youngest daughter screamed at the elder sibling who was holding a small black and white bear over her head give it baaaack useful felt ecstatic at the familiar scene his wife grinned at him from the kitchen he whooped despite himself he knew what had just happened he would feel sorrow for that later but he and his children were alive and the wonder of it could not be underestimated besides at the moment those other deaths were simply too massive to contemplate hi honey she said kissing him lightly in greeting a smell of mint leaves coming from her hands theres something wrong with the calendar on the clock its saying its the end of october could you take a look prologue angela walks and walks streets silent except for a pigeon cooing she hasnt seen a soul for months robots here and there but no people sometimes she wonders if the world is empty although she knows from the limited radio service on the bbc that there were some people left gathering now in the heart of the city but not here on this deserted east london council estate she may join them one day in the centre but not yet not quite ready for people again the morning is crisp clear the winters frost gone and spring dawning she finds herself staring at the exterior of agathas block of flats and after a time climbs the echoing stairs to reach the upvc door of her home ragged yellow curtain hanging across the inside of the glass she knocks on the door not expecting an answer and after much banging she uses a screwdriver to force the lock in the way which she had researched ahead of her trip everything is as she remembered but quiet as never it had been she sits in the empty living room of her friend agatha clutching a crayon drawing of a dinosaur on the back of old wallpaper a diplodocus by the look of it in purple crayon and she sobs deep retching tears as she remembers angela remembers please mum please can we go and see the dinosaurs again asked agathas daughter daddy took us want to see the dinosaurs please please please maybe tomorrow love thanks to all friends i have pestered to read and reread my work i thank you but any typos are your fault why didnt you tell me also thanks to the holy trinity of podcasts this american life planet money and radiolab all knowledge lives here what else is there to know well actually thanks also to the writings of michael lewis on economics and jon ronson for spending time with conspiracy theorists and extremists so that the rest of us dont have to i would heartily recommend the big short and them to anyone interested in economics and the new world order respectively
