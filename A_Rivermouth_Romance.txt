a rivermouth romance by thomas bailey aldrich boston and new york houghton mifflin company copyright and i at five oclock on the morning of the tenth of july the front door of a certain house on anchor street in the ancient seaport town of rivermouth might have been observed to open with great caution this door as the least imaginative reader may easily conjecture did not open itself it was opened by miss margaret callaghan who immediately closed it softly behind her paused for a few seconds with an embarrassed air on the stone step and then throwing a furtive glance up at the secondstory windows passed hastily down the street towards the river keeping close to the fences and garden walls on her left there was a ghostlike stealthiness to miss margarets movements though there was nothing whatever of the ghost about miss margaret herself she was a plump short person no longer young with coalblack hair growing low on the forehead and a round face that would have been nearly meaningless if the features had not been emphasized italicized so to speak by the smallpox moreover the brilliancy of her toilet would have rendered any ghostly hypothesis untenable mrs solomon we refer to the dressiest mrs solomon whichever one that was in all her glory was not arrayed like miss margaret on that eventful summer morning she wore a lightgreen shotsilk frock a blazing red shawl and a yellow crape bonnet profusely decorated with azure orange and magenta artificial flowers in her hand she carried a white parasol the newly risen sun ricocheting from the bosom of the river and striking point blank on the topknot of miss margarets gorgeousness made her an imposing spectacle in the quiet street of that puritan village but in spite of the bravery of her apparel she stole guiltily along by garden walls and fences until she reached a small dingy framehouse near the wharves in the darkened doorway of which she quenched her burning splendor if so bold a figure is permissible three quarters of an hour passed the sunshine moved slowly up anchor street fingered noiselessly the wellkept brass knockers on either side and drained the heeltaps of dew which had been left from the revels of the fairies overnight in the cups of the morningglories not a soul was stirring yet in this part of the town though the rivermouthians are such early birds that not a worm may be said to escape them by and by one of the brown holland shades at one of the upper windows of the bilkins mansion the house from which miss margaret had emerged was drawn up and old mr bilkins in spiral nightcap looked out on the sunny street not a living creature was to be seen save the dissipated family cat a very lovelace of a cat that was not allowed a nightkey who was sitting on the curbstone opposite waiting for the hall door to be opened three quarters of an hour we repeat had passed when mrs margaret orourke nйe callaghan issued from the small dingy house by the river and regained the doorstep of the bilkins mansion in the same stealthy fashion in which she had left it not to prolong a mystery that must already oppress the reader mr bilkinss cook had after the manner of her kind stolen out of the premises before the family were up and got herself married surreptitiously and artfully married as if matrimony were an indictable offence and something of an offence it was in this instance in the first place margaret callaghan had lived nearly twenty years with the bilkins family and the old people there were no children now had rewarded this long service by taking margaret into their affections it was a piece of subtile ingratitude for her to marry without admitting the worthy couple to her confidence in the next place margaret had married a man some eighteen years younger than herself that was the young mans lookout you say we hold it was margaret that was to blame what does a young blade of twentytwo know not half so much as he thinks he does his exhaustless ignorance at that age is a discovery which is left for him to make in his prime curly gold locks cover foolish brains billing and cooing is all your cheer sighing and singing of midnight strains under bonnybells window panes wait till you come to forty year in one sense margarets husband had come to forty year she was forty to a day mrs margaret orourke with the baddish cat following close at her heels entered the bilkins mansion reached her chamber in the attic without being intercepted and there laid aside her finery two or three times while arranging her more humble attire she paused to take a look at the marriage certificate which she had deposited between the leaves of her prayerbook and on each occasion held that potent document upside down for margarets literary culture was of the severest order and excluded the art of reading the breakfast was late that morning as mrs orourke set the coffeeurn in front of mrs bilkins and flanked mr bilkins with the broiled mackerel and buttered toast mrs orourkes conscience smote her she afterwards declared that when she saw the two sitting there so innocentlike not dreaming of the comether she had put upon them she secretly and unbeknownst let a few tears fall into the creampitcher whether or not it was this material expression of margarets penitence that spoiled the coffee does not admit of inquiry but the coffee was bad in fact the whole breakfast was a comedy of errors it was a blessed relief to margaret when the meal was ended she retired in a cold perspiration to the penetralia of the kitchen and it was remarked by both mr and mrs bilkins that those short flights of vocalism apropos of the personal charms of one kate kearney who lived on the banks of killarney which ordinarily issued from the direction of the scullery were unheard that forenoon the town clock was striking eleven and the antiquated timepiece on the staircase which never spoke but it dropped pearls and crystals like the fairy in the story was lisping the hour when there came three tremendous knocks at the street door mrs bilkins who was dusting the brassmounted chronometer in the hall stood transfixed with arm uplifted the admirable old lady had for years been carrying on a guerilla warfare with itinerant venders of furniture polish and painkiller and crockery cement and the like the effrontery of the triple knock convinced her the enemy was at her gates possibly that dissolute creature with twentyfour sheets of notepaper and twentyfour envelopes for fifteen cents mrs bilkins swept across the hall and opened the door with a jerk the suddenness of the movement was apparently not anticipated by the person outside who with one arm stretched feebly towards the receding knocker tilted gently forward and rested both hands on the threshold in an attitude which was probably common enough with our ancestors of the simian period but could never have been considered graceful by an effort that testified to the excellent condition of his muscles the person instantly righted himself and stood swaying unsteadily on his toes and heels and smiling rather vaguely on mrs bilkins it was a slightlybuilt but wellknitted young fellow in the not unpicturesque garb of our marine service his woollen cap pitched forward at an acute angle with his nose showed the back part of a head thatched with short yellow hair which had broken into innumerable curls of painful tightness on his ruddy cheeks a sparse sandy beard was making a timid dйbut add to this a weak goodnatured mouth a pair of devilmaycare blue eyes and the fact that the man was very drunk and you have a preraphaelite portrait we may as well say it at once of mr larry orourke of mullingar county westmeath and late of the united states sloopofwar santee the man was a total stranger to mrs bilkins but the instant she caught sight of the double white anchors embroidered on the lapels of his jacket she unhesitatingly threw back the door which with great presence of mind she had partly closed a drunken sailor standing on the step of the bilkins mansion was no novelty the street as we have stated led down to the wharves and sailors were constantly passing the house abutted directly on the street the granite doorstep was almost flush with the sidewalk and the huge oldfashioned brass knocker seemingly a brazen hand that had been cut off at the wrist and nailed against the oak as a warning to malefactors extended itself in a kind of grim appeal to everybody it seemed to possess strange fascinations for all seafaring folk and when there was a manofwar in port the rattattat of that knocker would frequently startle the quiet neighborhood long after midnight there appeared to be an occult understanding between it and the bluejackets years ago there was a young bilkins one pendexter bilkins a sad losel we fear who ran away to try his fortunes before the mast and fell overboard in a gale off hatteras lost at sea says the chubby marble slab in the old south buryingground жtat perhaps that is why no bluejacket sober or drunk was ever repulsed from the door of the bilkins mansion of course mrs bilkins had her taste in the matter and preferred them sober but as this could not always be she tempered her wind so to speak to the shorn lamb the flushed prematurely old face that now looked up at her moved the good ladys pity what do you want she asked kindly me wife there s no wife for you here said mrs bilkins somewhat taken aback his wife she thought its a mother the poor boy stands in need of me wife repeated mr orourke for betther or for worse you had better go away said mrs bilkins bridling up or it will be the worse for you to have and to howld continued mr orourke wandering retrospectively in the mazes of the marriage service to have and to howld till death bad luck to him takes one or the ither of us you re a blasphemous creature said mrs bilkins severely thim s the words his riverince spake this mornin standin foreninst us explained mr orourke i stood here see and me jewl stood there and the howly chaplain beyont and mr orourke with a wavering forefinger drew a diagram of the interesting situation on the doorstep well returned mrs bilkins if you re a married man all i have to say is theres a pair of fools instead of one you had better be off the person you want does nt live here bedad thin but she does lives here sorra a place else the mans crazy said mrs bilkins to herself while she thought him simply drunk she was not in the least afraid but the idea that she was conversing with a madman sent a chill over her she reached back her hand preparatory to shutting the door when mr orourke with an agility that might have been expected from his previous gymnastics set one foot on the threshold and frustrated the design i want me wife he said sternly unfortunately mr bilkins had gone up town and there was no one in the house except margaret whose pluck was not to be depended on the case was urgent with the energy of despair mrs bilkins suddenly placed the toe of her boot against mr orourkes invading foot and pushed it away the effect of this attack was to cause mr orourke to describe a complete circle on one leg and then sit down heavily on the threshold the lady retreated to the hatstand and rested her hand mechanically on the handle of a blue cotton umbrella mr orourke partly turned his head and smiled upon her with conscious superiority at this juncture a third actor appeared on the scene evidently a friend of mr orourke for he addressed that gentleman as a spalpeen and told him to go home divil an inch replied the spalpeen but he got himself off the threshold and returned his position on the step its only larry mum said the man touching his forelock politely as dacent a lad as iver lived when he s not in liquor an i ve known him to be sober for days togither he added reflectively he dont mane a haporth o harum but jist now hes not quite in his right moind i should think not said mrs bilkins turning from the speaker to mr orourke who had seated himself gravely on the scraper and was weeping hasnt the man any friends too many of em mum an its along wid dhrinkin toasts wid em that larry got throwed the punch that spalpeen has dhrunk this day would amaze ye he give us the slip awhiles ago bad cess to him an come up here did nt i tell ye

married margaret what margaret cried mrs bilkins with a start margaret callaghan sure our margaret do you mean to say that our margaret has married that that goodfornothing inebriated wretch its a civil tongue the owld lady has any way remarked mr orourke critically from the scraper mrs bilkinss voice during the latter part of the colloquy had been pitched in a high key it rung through the hall and penetrated to the kitchen where margaret was thoughtfully wiping the breakfast things she paused with a halfdried saucer in her hand and listened in a moment more she stood with bloodless face and limp figure leaning against the banister behind mrs bilkins is it there ye are me jewl cried mr orourke discovering her mrs bilkins wheeled upon margaret margaret callaghan is that thing your husband yeyes mum faltered mrs orourke with a woful lack of spirit then take it away cried mrs bilkins margaret with a slight flush on either cheek glided past mrs bilkins and the heavy oak door closed with a bang as the gates of paradise must have closed of old upon adam and eve come said margaret taking mr orourke by the hand and the two wandered forth upon their wedding journey down anchor street with all the world before them where to choose they chose to halt at the small shabby tenementhouse by the river through the doorway of which the bridal pair disappeared with a reeling eccentric gait for mr orourkes intoxication seemed to have run down his elbow and communicated itself to margaret o hymen who burnest precious gums and scented woods in thy torch at the melting of aristocratic hearts with what a pitiful pennydip thou hast lighted up our little backstreet romance ii it had been no part of margarets plan to acknowledge the marriage so soon though on pleasure bent she had a frugal mind she had invested in a husband with a view of laying him away for a rainy day that is to say for such time as her master and mistress should cease to need her services for she had promised on more than one occasion to remain with the old people as long as they lived indeed if mr orourke had come to her and said in so many words the day you marry me you must leave the bilkins family there is very little doubt but margaret would have let that young seamonster slip back unmated so far as she was concerned into his native element the contingency never entered into her calculations she intended that the ship which had brought ulysses to her island should take him off again after a decent interval of honeymoon then she would confess all to mrs bilkins and be forgiven and mr bilkins would not cancel that clause supposed to exist in his will bequeathing two firstmortgage bonds of the squedunk e b co to a certain faithful servant in the mean while she would add each month to her store in the coffers of the rivermouth savings bank for calypso had a neat sum to her credit on the books of that provident institution but this could not be now the volatile bridegroom had upset the wisely conceived plan and all the fat was in the fire as margaret philosophically put it mr orourke had been fully instructed in the part he was to play and to do him justice had honestly intended to play it but destiny was against him it may be observed that destiny and mr orourke were not on very friendly terms after the ceremony had been performed and margaret had stolen back to the bilkins mansion as related mr orourke with his own skilful hands had brewed a noble punch for the wedding guests standing at the head of the table and stirring the pungent mixture in a small washtub purchased for the occasion mr orourke came out in full flower his flow of wit as he replenished the glasses was as racy and seemingly as inexhaustible as the punch itself when mrs mclaughlin held out her glass inadvertently upside down for her sixth ladleful mr orourke gallantly declared it should be filled if he had to stand on his head to do it the elder miss oleary whispered to mrs connally that mr orourke was a perfic gintleman and the men in a body pronounced him a bit of the raal shamrock if mr orourke was happy in brewing a punch he was happier in dispensing it and happiest of all in drinking a great deal of it himself he toasted mrs finnigan the landlady and the late lamented finnigan the father whom he had never seen and miss biddy finnigan the daughter and a young toddling finnigan who was at large in shockingly scant raiment he drank to the company individually and collectively drank to the absent drank to a tinpeddler who chanced to pass the window and indeed was in that propitiatory mood when he would have drunk to the health of each separate animal that came out of the ark it was in the midst of the confusion and applause which followed his song the wearing of the grane that mr orourke the punch being all gone withdrew unobserved and went in quest of mrs orourke with what success the reader knows according to the loveidyl of the period when laura and charles henry after unheardof obstacles are finally united all cares and tribulations and responsibilities slip from their sleek backs like christians burden the idea is a pretty one theoretically but like some of those models in the patent office at washington it fails to work charles henry does not go on sitting at lauras feet and reading tennyson to her forever the rent of the cottage by the sea falls due with prosaic regularity there are bakers and butchers and babies and taxcollectors and doctors and undertakers and sometimes gentlemen of the jury to be attended to wedded life is not one long amatory poem with recurrent rhymes of love and dove and kiss and bliss yet when the average sentimental novelist has supplied his hero and heroine with their bridal outfit and arranged that little matter of the marriage certificate he usually turns off the gas puts up his shutters and saunters off with his hands in his pockets as if the days business were over but we who are honest dealers in real life and disdain to give short weight know better the business is by no means over it is just begun it is not christian throwing off his pack for good and all but christian taking up a load heavier and more difficult than any he has carried if margaret callaghan when she meditated matrimony indulged in any roseate dreams they were quickly put to flight she suddenly found herself dispossessed of a quiet comfortable home and face to face with the fact that she had a white elephant on her hands it is not likely that mr orourke assumed precisely the shape of a white elephant to her mental vision but he was as useless and cumbersome and unmanageable as one margaret and larrys wedding tour did not extend beyond mrs finnigans establishment where they took two or three rooms and set up housekeeping in a humble way margaret who was a tidy housewife kept the floor of her apartments as white as your hand the tin plates on the dresser as bright as your ladyloves eyes and the cookingstove as neat as the machinery on a sound steamer when she was not rubbing the stove with lampblack she was cooking upon it some savory dish to tempt the palate of her marine monster naturally of a hopeful temperament she went about her work singing softly to herself at times and would have been very happy that first week if mr orourke had known a sober moment but mr orourke showed an exasperating disposition to keep up festivities at the end of ten days however he toned down and at margarets suggestion that he had better be looking about for some employment he rigged up a fishingpole and set out with an injured air for the wharf at the foot of the street where he fished for the rest of the day to sit for hours blinking in the sun waiting for a cunner to come along and take his hook was as exhaustive a kind of labor as he cared to engage in though mr orourke had recently returned from a long cruise he had not a cent to show during his first three days ashore he had dissipated his three years pay the housekeeping expenses began eating a hole in margarets little fund the existence of which was no sooner known to mr orourke than he stood up his fishingrod in one corner of the room and thenceforth it caught nothing but cobwebs divil a sthroke o work i ll do said mr orourke whin we can live at aise on our earnins who d be afther frettin hisself wid money in the bank how much is it peggy darlint and divil a stroke more of work did he do he lounged down on the wharves and with his short clay pipe stuck between his lips and his hands in his pockets stared off at the sailboats on the river he sat on the doorstep of the finnigan domicile and plentifully chaffed the passersby now and then when he could wheedle some fractional currency out of margaret he spent it like a crownprince at the wee drop around the corner with that fine magnetism which draws together birds of a feather he shortly drew about him all the neerdoweels of rivermouth it was really wonderful what an unsuspected lot of them there was from all the frowzy purlieus of the town they crept forth into the sunlight to array themselves under the banner of the prince of scallawags it was edifying of a summer afternoon to see a dozen of them sitting in a row like turtles on the stringpiece of jedediah rands wharf with their twentyfour feet dangling over the water assisting mr orourke in contemplating the islands in the harbor and upholding the scenery as it were the rascal had one accomplishment he had a heavenly voice quite in the rough to be sure and he played on the violin like an angel he did not know one note from another but he played in a sweet natural way just as orpheus must have played by ear the drunker he was the more pathos and humor he wrung from the old violin his sole piece of personal property he had a singular fancy for getting up at two or three oclock in the morning and playing by an open casement to the distraction of all the dogs in the immediate neighborhood and innumerable dogs in the distance unfortunately mr orourkes freaks were not always of so innocent a complexion on one or two occasions through an excess of animal and other spirits he took to breaking windows in the town among his nocturnal feats he accomplished the demolition of the glass in the door of the wee drop now breaking windows in rivermouth is an amusement not wholly disconnected with an interior view of the policestation bridewell is the local term so it happened that mr orourke woke up one fine morning and found himself snug and tight in one of the cells in the rear of the brick market his plea that the bullseye in the glass door of the wee drop winked at him in an insultin manner as he was passing by did not prevent justice hackett from fining the delinquent ten dollars and costs which made sad havoc with the poor wifes bank account so margarets married life wore on and all went merry as a funeral knell after mrs bilkins with a brow as severe as that of one of the parcж had closed the door upon the orourkes that summer morning she sat down on the stairs and sinking the indignant goddess in the woman burst into tears she was still very wroth with margaret callaghan as she persisted in calling her very merciless and unforgiving as the gentler sex are apt to be to the gentler sex mr bilkins however after the first vexation missed margaret from the household missed her singing which was in itself as helpful as a second girl missed her hand in the preparation of those hundred and one nameless comforts which are necessities to the old and wished in his soul that he had her back again who could make a gruel when he was ill or cook a steak when he was well like margaret so meeting her one morning at the fishmarket for mr orourke had long since given over the onerous labor of catching dinners he spoke to her kindly and asked her how she liked the change in her life and if mr orourke was good to her troth thin sur said margaret with a short dry laugh he s the divils own margaret was thin and careworn and her laugh had the mild gayety of champagne not properly corked these things were apparent even to mr bilkins who was not a shrewd observer i m afraid margaret he remarked sorrowfully that you are not making both ends meet begorra i d be glad if i could make one ind meet returned margaret with a duplicity quite foreign to his nature mr bilkins gradually drew from her the true state of affairs mr orourke was a very bad case indeed he did nothing towards her support he was almost constantly drunk the little money she had laid by was melting away and would not last until winter mr orourke was perpetually coming home with a sprained ankle or a bruised shoulder or a broken head he had broken most of the furniture in his festive hours including the cookingstove in short as mr bilkins said in relating the matter afterwards to mrs bilkins he had broken all those things which he should nt have broken and failed to break the one thing he ought to have broken long ago his neck namely the revelation which startled mr bilkins most was this in spite of all margaret loved larry with the whole of her warm irish heart further than keeping the poor creature up waiting for him until ever so much oclock at night it did not appear that he treated her with personal cruelty if he had beaten her perhaps she would have worshipped him it needed only that revolving margarets troubles in his thoughts as he walked homeward mr bilkins struck upon a plan by which he could help her when this plan was laid before mrs bilkins she opposed it with a vehemence that convinced him she had made up her mind to adopt it never never will i have that ungrateful woman under this roof cried mrs bilkins and accordingly the next day mr and mrs orourke took up their abode in the bilkins mansion margaret as cook and larry as gardener i m convanient if the owld gintleman is had been mr orourkes remark when the proposition was submitted to him not that mr orourke had the faintest idea of gardening he did nt know a tulip from a tomato he was one of those sanguine people who never hesitate to undertake anything and are never abashed by their herculean inability mr bilkins did not look to margarets husband for any great botanical knowledge but he was rather surprised one day when mr orourke pointed to the triangular bed of liliesofthevalley then out of flower and remarked thim s a nate lot o purtaties ye ve got there sur mr bilkins we repeat did not expect much from mr orourkes skill in gardening his purpose was to reform the fellow if possible and in any case to make margarets lot easier reestablished in her old home margaret broke into song again and mr orourke himself promised to do very well morally we mean not agriculturally his ignorance of the simplest laws of nature if nature has any simple laws and his dense stupidity on every other subject were heavy trials to mr bilkins happily mr bilkins was not without a sense of humor else he would have found mr orourke insupportable just when the old gentlemans patience was about exhausted the gardener would commit some atrocity so perfectly comical that his master all but loved him for the moment larry said mr bilkins one breathless afternoon in the middle of september just see how the thermometer on the back porch stands mr orourke disappeared and after a prolonged absence returned with the monstrous announcement that the thermometer stood at mr bilkins looked at the man closely he was unmistakably sober eight hundred and twenty what cried mr bilkins feeling very warm as he naturally would in so high a temperature eight hundthred an twinty degrays i suppose sur larry you re an idiot this was obviously not to mr orourkes taste for he went out and brought the thermometer and pointing triumphantly to the line of numerals running parallel with the glass tube exclaimed add em up yerself thin perhaps this would not have been amusing if mr bilkins had not spent the greater part of the previous forenoon in initiating mr orourke into the mysteries of the thermometer nothing could make amusing mr orourkes method of setting out crocus bulbs mr bilkins had received a lot of a very choice variety from boston and having a headache that morning turned over to mr orourke the duty of planting them though he had never seen a bulb in his life larry unblushingly asserted that he had set out thousands for sir lucius ogrady of ogrady castle an illegant place intirely wid tin miles o gardenwalks added mr orourke crushing mr bilkins who boasted only of a few humble flowerbeds the following day he stepped into the garden to see how larry had done his work there stood the parched bulbs carefully arranged in circles and squares on top of the soil did nt i tell you to set out these bulbs cried mr bilkins wrathfully an did nt i set em out expostulated mr orourke an aint they a settin there beautiful but you should have put them into the ground stupid is it bury em ye mane be jabbers how could they iver git out agin give the little jokers a fair show misther bilkins for two weeks mr orourke conducted himself with comparative propriety that is to say be rendered himself useless about the place appeared regularly at his meals and kept sober perhaps the hilarious strains of music which sometimes issued at midnight from the upper window of the north gable were not just what a quiet unostentatious family would desire but on the whole there was not much to complain of the third week witnessed a falling off though always promptly on hand at the serving out of rations mr orourke did not even make a pretence of working in the garden he would disappear mysteriously immediately after breakfast and reappear with supernatural abruptness at dinner nobody knew what he did with himself in the interval until one day he was observed to fall out of an appletree near the stable his retreat discovered he took to the wharves and the alleys in the distant part of the town it soon became evident that his ways were not the ways of temperance and that all his paths led to the wee drop of course margaret tried to keep this from the family being a woman she coined excuses for him in her heart it was a dull life for the lad any way and it was worse than him that was leading larry astray hours and hours after the old people had gone to bed she would sit without a light in the lonely kitchen listening for that shuffling step along the gravel walk night after night she never closed her eyes and went about the house the next day with that smooth impenetrable face behind which women hide their care one morning found margaret sitting pale and anxious by the kitchen stove orourke had not come home at all noon came and night but not larry whenever mrs bilkins approached her that day margaret was humming kate kearney quite merrily but when her work was done she stole out at the back gate and went in search of him she scoured the neighborhood like a madwoman orourke had not been at the finnigans he had not been at the wee drop since monday and this was wednesday night her heart sunk within her when she failed to find him in the policestation some dreadful thing had happened to him she came back to the house with one hand pressed wearily against her cheek the dawn struggled through the kitchen windows and fell upon margaret crouched by the stove she could no longer wear her mask when mr bilkins came down she confessed that larry had taken to drinking again and had not been home for two nights mayhap he s drownded hisself suggested margaret wringing her hands not he said mr bilkins he does nt like the taste of water well enough troth thin he does nt reflected margaret and the reflection comforted her at any rate i ll go and look him up after breakfast said mr bilkins and after breakfast accordingly mr bilkins sallied forth with the depressing expectation of finding mr orourke without much difficulty come to think of it said the old gentleman to himself drawing on his white cotton gloves as he walked up anchor street i dont want to find him iii but mr orourke was not to be found with amiable cynicism mr bilkins directed his steps in the first instance to the policestation quite confident that a bird of mr orourkes plumage would be brought to perch in such a cage but not so much as a feather of him was discoverable the wee drop was not the only bacchanalian resort in rivermouth there were five or six other low drinkingshops scattered about town and through these mr bilkins went conscientiously he then explored various blind alleys known haunts of the missing man and took a careful survey of the wharves along the river on his way home he even shook the appletree near the stable with a vague hope of bringing down mr orourke but brought down nothing except a few winter apples which being both unripe and unsound were not perhaps bad representatives of the object of his search that evening a small boy stopped at the door of the bilking mansion with a straw hat at once identified as mr orourkes which had been found on neals wharf this would have told against another man but orourke was always leaving his hat on a wharf margarets distress is not to be pictured she fell back upon and clung to the idea that larry had drowned himself not intentionally may be possibly he had fallen overboard while intoxicated the late mr buckle has informed us that death by drowning is regulated by laws as inviolable and beautiful as those of the solar system that a certain percentage of the earths population is bound to drown itself annually whether it wants to or not it may be presumed then that rivermouths proper quota of dead bodies was washed ashore during the ensuing two months there had been gales off the coast and pleasure parties on the river and between them they had managed to do a ghastly business but mr orourke failed to appear among the flotsam and jetsam which the receding tides left tangled in the piles of the rivermouth wharves this convinced margaret that larry had proved a too tempting morsel to some buccaneering shark or had fallen a victim to one of those immense schools of fish which seem to have a yearly appointment with the fishermen on this coast from that day margaret never saw a cod or a mackerel brought into the house without an involuntary shudder she averted her head in making up the fishballs as if she half dreaded to detect a faint aroma of whiskey about them and indeed why might not a man fall into the sea be eaten say by a halibut and reappear on the scene of his earthly triumphs and defeats in the noncommittal form of hashed fish imperial cжsar dead and turned to clay might stop a hole to keep the wind away but perhaps as the conservative horatio suggests t were to consider too curiously to consider so mr bilkins had come to adopt margarets explanation of orourkes disappearance he was undoubtedly drowned had most likely drowned himself the hat picked up on the wharf was strong circumstantial evidence in that direction but one feature of the case staggered mr bilkins orourkes violin had also disappeared now it required no great effort to imagine a man throwing himself overboard under the influence of mania а potu but it was difficult to conceive of a man committing violinicide if the fellow went to drown himself why did he take his fiddle with him he might as well have taken an umbrella or a german studentlamp this question troubled mr bilkins a good deal first and last but one thing was indisputable the man was gone and had evidently gone by water it was now that margaret invested her husband with charms of mind and person not calculated to make him recognizable by any one who had ever had the privilege of knowing him in the faulty flesh she eliminated all his bad qualities and projected from her imagination a mr orourke as he ought to have been a species of seraphic being mixed up in some way with a violin and to this ideal she erected a costly headstone in the suburban cemetery it would be a proud day for larry observed margaret contemplatively if he could rest his oi on the illegant monumint i ve put up to him if mr orourke could have read the inscription on it he would never have suspected his own complicity in the matter but there the marble stood sacred to his memory and soon the snow came down from the gray sky and covered it and the invisible snow of weeks and months drifted down on margarets heart and filled up its fissures and smoothed off the sharp angles of its grief and there was peace upon it not but she sorrowed for larry at times yet life had a relish to it again she was free though she did not look at it in that light she was happier in a quiet fashion than she had ever been though she would not have acknowledged it to herself she wondered that she had the heart to laugh when the iceman made love to her perhaps she was conscious of something comically incongruous in the warmth of a gentleman who spent all winter in cutting ice and all summer in dealing it out to his customers she had not the same excuse for laughing at the baker yet she laughed still more merrily at him when he pressed her hand over the steaming loaf of brownbread delivered every saturday morning at the scullery door both these gentlemen had known margaret many years yet neither of them had valued her very highly until another man came along and married her a widow it would appear is esteemed in some sort as a warranted article being stamped with the makers name there was even a third lover in prospect for according to the gossip of the town mr donnehugh was frequently to be seen of a sunday afternoon standing in the cemetery and regarding mr orourkes headstone with unrestrained satisfaction a year had passed away and certain bits of color blossoming among margarets weeds indicated that the winter of her mourning was oyer the iceman and the baker were hating each other cordially and mrs bilkins was daily expecting it would be discovered before night that margaret had married one or both of them but to do margaret justice she was faithful in thought and deed to the memory of orourke not the orourke who disappeared so strangely but the orourke who never existed d ye think mum she said one day to mrs bilkins as that lady was adroitly sounding her on the ice question d ye think i d condescind to take up wid the likes o him or the baker either afther sich a man as larry the rectified and clarified orourke was a permanent wonder to mr bilkins who bore up under the bereavement with noticeable resignation peggy is right said the old gentleman who was superintending the burning out of the kitchen flue she wont find another man like larry orourke in a hurry thrue for ye mr bilkins answered margaret maybe theres as good fish in the say as iver was caught but i dont belave it all the same as good fish in the sea the words recalled to margaret the nature of her loss and she went on with her work in silence what what is it ezra cried mrs bilkins changing color and rising hastily from the breakfast table her first thought was of apoplexy there sat mr bilkins with his wig pushed back from his forehead and his eyes fixed vacantly on the weekly chronicle which he held out at arms length before him good heavens ezra what is the matter mr bilkins turned his eyes upon her mechanically as if he were a great waxdoll and somebody had pulled his wire cant you speak ezra his lips opened and moved inarticulately then he pointed a rigid finger in the manner of a guideboard at a paragraph in the paper which he held up for mrs bilkins to read over his shoulder when she had read it she sunk back into her chair without a word and the two sat contemplating each other as if they had never met before in this world and were not overpleased at meeting the paragraph which produced this singular effect on the aged couple occurred at the end of a column of telegraph despatches giving the details of an unimportant engagement that had just taken place between one of the blockading squadron and a confederate cruiser the engagement itself does not concern us but this item from the list of casualties on the union side has a direct bearing on our narrative larry orourke seaman splinter wound in the leg not serious that splinter flew far it glanced from mr orourkes leg went plumb through the bilkins mansion and knocked over a small marble slab in the old south burying ground if a ghost had dropped in familiarly to breakfast the constraint and consternation of the bilkins family could not have been greater how was the astounding intelligence to be broken to margaret her explosive irish nature made the task one of extreme delicacy mrs bilkins flatly declared herself incapable of undertaking it mr bilkins with many misgivings as to his fitness assumed the duty for it would never do to have the news sprung suddenly upon margaret by people outside as mrs orourke was clearing away the breakfast things mr bilkins who had lingered near the window with the newspaper in his hand coughed once or twice in an unnatural way to show that he was not embarrassed and began to think that may be it would be best to tell margaret after dinner mrs bilkins fathomed his thought with that intuition which renders women terrible and sent across the room an eyetelegram to this effect now is your time there s been another battle down south margaret said the old gentleman presently folding up the paper and putting it in his pocket a seafight this time sure an they re allus fightin down there but not always with so little damage there was only one man wounded on our side pore man its sorry we oughter be for his wife an childer if hes got any not badly wounded you will understand margaret not at all seriously wounded only a splinter in the leg faith thin a splinter in the leg is no pleasant thing in itself a mere scratch said mr bilkins lightly as if he were constantly in the habit of going about with a splinter in his own leg and found it rather agreeable the odd part of the matter is the mans first name his first name was larry margaret nodded as one should say theres a many larrys in the world but the oddest part of it continued mr bilkins in a carelessly sepulchral voice is the mans last name something in the tone of his voice made margaret look at him and something in the expression of his face caused the blood to fly from margarets cheek the mans last name she repeated wonderingly yes his last name orourke dye mane it shrieked margaret d ye mane it glory to god o worra worra well ezra said mrs bilking in one of those spasms of base ingratitude to which even the most perfect women are liable you ve made nice work of it you might as well have knocked her down with an axe but my dear oh bother my smellingbottle quick second bureau drawer lefthand side joy never kills it is a celestial kind of hydrogen of which it seems impossible to get too much at one inhalation in an hour margaret was able to converse with comparative calmness on the resuscitation of larry orourke whom the firing of a cannon had brought to the surface as if he had been in reality a drowned body now that the whole town was aware of mr orourkes fate his friend mr donnehugh came forward with a statement that would have been of some interest at an earlier period but was of no service as matters stood except so far as it assisted in removing from mr bilkinss mind a passing doubt as to whether the larry orourke of the telegraphic reports was margarets scapegrace of a husband mr donnehugh had known all along that orourke had absconded to boston by a night train and enlisted in the navy it was the possession of this knowledge that had made it impossible for mr donnehugh to look at mr orourkes gravestone without grinning at margarets request and in margarets name mr bilkins wrote three or four letters to orourke and finally succeeded in extorting an epistle from that gentleman in which he told margaret to cheer up that his fortune was as good as made and that the day would come when she should ride through the town in her own coach and no thanks to old flinthead who pretended to be so fond of her mr bilkins tried to conjecture who was meant by old flinthead but was obliged to give it up mr orourke furthermore informed margaret that he had three hundred dollars prizemoney coming to him and broadly intimated that when he got home he intended to have one of the most extensive blowouts ever witnessed in rivermouth och laughed margaret thats jist larry over agin the pore lad was allus full of his nonsense an spirits that he was said mr bilkins dryly content with the fact that her husband was in the land of the living margaret gave herself no trouble over the separation orourke had shipped for three years one third of his term of service was past and two years more god willing would see him home again this was margarets view of it mr bilkinss view of it was not so cheerful the prospect of mr orourkes ultimate return was anything but enchanting mr bilkins was by no means disposed to kill the fatted calf he would much rather have killed the prodigal son however there was always this chance he might never come back the tides rose and fell at the rivermouth wharves the summer moonlight and the winter snow in turn bleached its quiet streets and the two years had nearly gone by in the mean time nothing had been heard of orourke if he ever received the five or six letters sent to him he did not fatigue himself by answering them larrys all right said hopeful margaret if any harum had come to the gossoon wed have knowed it its the bad news that travels fast mr bilkins was not so positive about that it had taken a whole year to find out that orourke had not drowned himself the period of mr orourkes enlistment had come to an end two months slipped by and he had neglected to brighten rivermouth with his presence there were many things that might have detained him difficulties in getting his prizepapers or in drawing his pay but there was no reason why he might not have written the days were beginning to grow long to margaret and vague forebodings of misfortune possessed her perhaps we had better look up mr orourke he had seen some rough times during those three years and some harder work than catching cunners at the foot of anchor street or setting out crocuses in mr bilkinss back garden he had seen battles and shipwreck and death in many guises but they had taught him nothing as the sequel will show with his active career in the navy we shall not trouble ourselves we take him up at a date a little prior to the close of his term of service several months before he had been transferred from the blockading squadron to a gunboat attached to the fleet operating against the forts defending new orleans the forts had fallen the fleet had passed on to the city and mr orourkes ship lay off in the stream binding up her wounds in three days he would receive his discharge and the papers entitling him to a handsome amount of prizemoney in addition to his pay with noble contempt for so much good fortune mr orourke dropped over the bows of the gunboat one evening and managed to reach the levee in the city he fell in with some soldiers and being of a convivial nature caroused with them that night and next day enlisted in a cavalry regiment desertion in the face of the enemy for though the city lay under federal guns it was still hostile enough involved the heaviest penalties orourke was speedily arrested with other deserters tried by courtmartial and sentenced to death the intelligence burst like a shell upon the quiet household in anchor street listening daily for the sound of larry orourkes footstep on the threshold it was a heavy load for margaret to bear after all those years of patient vigil but the load was to be lightened for her in consideration of orourkes long service and in view of the fact that his desertion so near the expiration of his time was an absurdity the good president commuted his sentence to imprisonment for life with loss of prizemoney and back pay mr orourke was despatched north and placed in moyamensing prison if joy could kill margaret would have been a dead woman the day these tidings reached rivermouth and mr bilkins himself would have been in a critical condition for though he did not want orourke shot or hanged he was delighted to have him permanently shelved after the excitement was over and this is always the trying time margaret accepted the situation philosophically the pore lads out o harums rache any way she reflected he cant be gittin into hot wather now and thats a fact and maybe after awhiles they ll let him go agin they let out murtherers and thaves and sich like and larrys done no hurt to nobody but hisself margaret was inclined to be rather severe on president lincoln for taking away larrys prizemoney the impression was strong on her mind that the money went into mr lincolns private exchequer i would nt wonder if misthress lincoln had a new silk gownd or two this fall margaret would remark sarcastically the prison rules permitted mr orourke to receive periodical communications from his friends outside once every quarter mr bilkins wrote him a letter and in the interim margaret kept him supplied with those doleful popular ballads printed on broadsides which one sees pinned up for sale on the iron railings of city churchyards and seldom anywhere else they seem the natural exhalations of the mould and pathos of such places but we have a suspicion that they are written by sentimental young undertakers though these songs must have been a solace to mr orourke in his captivity he never so far forgot himself as to acknowledge their receipt it was only through the kindly chaplain of the prison that margaret was now and then advised of the wellbeing of her husband towards the close of that year the great orourke himself did condescend to write one letter as this letter has never been printed and as it is the only specimen extant of mr orourkes epistolary manner we lay it before the reader verbatim et literatim febuary mi belovid wife fur the luv of god sind mee pop gose the wezel yours till deth larry o rourke pop goes the weasel was sent to him and mr bilkins ingeniously slipped into the same envelope the drunkards death and beware of the bowl two spirited compositions well calculated to exert a salutary influence over a man imprisoned for life there is nothing in this earthly existence so uncertain as what seems to be a certainty to all appearances the world outside of moyamensing prison was forever a closed book to orourke but the southern confederacy collapsed the general amnesty proclamation was issued cell doors were thrown open and one afternoon mr larry orourke with his head neatly shaved walked into the bilkins kitchen and frightened margaret nearly out of her skin mr orourkes summing up of his case was characteristic i ve been kilt in battle hanged by the courtmartial put into the lockup for life and here i am bedad not a haporth the worse for it none the worse for it certainly and none the better by no stretch of magical fiction can we make an angel of him he is not at all the material for an apotheosis it was not for him to reform and settle down and become a respectable oppressed taxpayer his conduct in rivermouth after his return was a repetition of his old ways margaret all but broke down under the tests to which he put her affections and came at last to wish that larry had never got out of moyamensing prison if any change had taken place in mr orourke it showed itself in occasional fits of sullenness towards margaret it was in one of these moods that he slouched his hat over his brows and told her she need not wait dinner for him it will be a cold dinner if margaret has kept it waiting for two years have gone by since that day and orourke has not come home possibly he is off on a whaling voyage possibly the swift maelstrom has dragged him down perhaps he is lifting his hand to knock at the door of the bilkins mansion as we pen these words but margaret does not watch for him impatiently any more there are strands of gray in her black hair she has had her romance
