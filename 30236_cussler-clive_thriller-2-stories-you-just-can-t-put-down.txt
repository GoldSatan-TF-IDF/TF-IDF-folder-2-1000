clive cussler edited by thriller stories you just cant put down an anthology of stories edited by clive cussler for gayle lynds and david morrell cofounders introduction what is a thriller its an interesting question when you consider so many of todays bestsellers fall into that category look at the top sellers any given month and you might find novels of suspense adventure tales paranormal investigations or even police proceduralsworks by writers who couldnt be more different from each other and yet their books share a common goal if not a specific language all these books push their readers just a little closer to the edge of their seats they cost their readers sleep get carried to the grocery store to be read while standing in line and are held tightly until the last page and even though the reader cant wait to see how its going to end a book like this gets closed reluctantly with a feeling of anticipation and longing for the next book that can quicken the pulse and fire the imagination as a reader thats a feeling i know well i grew up in the heyday of the pulps devouring stories about globespanning adventures one man facing impossible odds racing against time to save the world these were magazines and books that kept you up all night sometimes reading under your covers with a flashlight adventures that were simply thrilling thats really what i set out to do when i decided to try my hand at writing fiction over thirty years ago i wanted to write a thrilling story with a modern setting and contemporary characters in the tradition of the great adventure stories that kept me turning the pages when i was a kid i never imagined that one day my books would be translated into more than forty languages and read by millions of people around the world and now an entire generation later it seems that tradition lives on because many of the most successful and finest authors today are writing thrillers and this book youre holding now brings many of those writers together in a single volume this book is called thriller because as you probably suspect or already know there was another anthology entitled thriller that was edited by my friend james patterson the two books share a common source of inspiration so let me take a moment to explain how this collection came together the first thriller was the brainchild of an organization called itw which is short for international thriller writers barely five years old itws roster reads like a whos who of thriller writing with members worldwide and over books in print headed by current copresidents steve berry and james rollins its board of directors has included such notables as lee child tess gerritsen m j rose carla neggers douglas preston gayle lynds david morrell and david hewson this organization of which i am a proud member is dedicated to supporting the readers and writers of thrillers everywhere this anthology and its predecessor are collections of short stories written exclusively by itw members from around the world not only bestselling authors but also gifted writers you might not have discovered until you read this book but the two anthologies also differ slightly the first thriller included stories featuring wellknown or established characters from our writers novels and series sometimes seen in a new light but very recognizable to their fans thriller by contrast consists almost entirely of original stories featuring colorful characters youve never seen before for the rabid fan its a unique chance to discover another side of your favorite author for someone new to the world of thrillers this collection is a wonderful opportunity to discover someone who just might become your new favorite writer which brings us back to our question what is a thriller or more precisely what makes a story thrilling this collection attempts to answer that timeless question if not directly than by showcasing over twenty writers who delivered an extraordinary range of thrilling stories stories that shock you stories that cause your heart to skip a beat stories that might make you laugh and flinch at the same time stories that you finish and then read again in disbelief looking for the clues you must have missed the first time around there are many ingredients that go into an unforgettable thriller these stories use them all but each mixes them together differently every tale delivering a unique blend of thrills that sets it apart as a reader i can truly say this is one of the most consistently entertaining and eclectic collections ive ever read and as a writer im incredibly proud to have my name on this remarkable book that youre about to read i hope you find it as thrilling as i do clive cussler jeffery deaver the stakes are high and time is short in the weaponthe perfect story to begin the collection originally written for the stage the weapon demonstrates why jeff is considered a master of both the modern thriller and the short story when it comes time to write a critical scene jeff turns down the lights shuts his eyes and starts typing the room is either heavily shaded or windowless for some characters in the weapon such a dark room where devious scenarios are born would still be preferable to the bleak places they find themselves in shaped by todays headlines these characters are trapped in an intrigue as topical as it is thrilling keep your eyes open for this one sit in a welllit room with a window maybe even go outside and read where people can see you and you know its safe because jeffs stories are anything but the weapon monday a new weapon the slim man in a conservative suit eased forward and lowered his voice something terrible and our sources are certain it will be used this coming saturday morning theyre certain of that four days said retired colonel james j peterson his voice grave it was now pm on monday the two men sat in petersons nondescript office in a nondescript building in the suburban town of reston virginia about twentyfive miles from washington dc theres a misconception that national security operations are conducted in hightech bunkers filled with sweeping steel and structural concrete video screens ten feet high and attractive boys and babes dressed by armani this place on the other hand looked like an insurance agency the skinny man who worked for the government added we dont know if were talking conventional nuke or something altogether new probably mass destruction weve heard it can do quote significant damage whos behind this weapon alqaeda the koreans iranians one of our enemies thats all we know at this pointso we need you to find out about it money is no object of course any leads yes a good onean algerian who knows who formulated the weapon he met with them last week in tunis hes a professor and journalist terrorist he doesnt seem to be his writings have been moderate in nature hes not openly militant but our local sources are convinced hes had contact with the people who created the weapon and plan to use it you have a picture a photograph appeared as if by magic from the slim mans briefcase and slid across the desk like a lizard colonel peterson leaned forward tuesday chabbi music drifted from a nearby café lost intermittently in the sounds of trucks and scooters charging frantically along this commercial street of algiers the driver of the white van a swarthy local stifled a sour face when the music changed to american rock not that he actually preferred the oldfashioned melodramatic chabbi tunes or thought they were more politically or religiously correct than western music he just didnt like britney spears then the big man stiffened and tapped the shoulder of the man next to him an american their attention swung immediately out the front window to a curlyhaired man in his thirties wearing a lightcolored suit walking out of the main entrance of the aljazier school for cultural thought the man in the passenger seat nodded the driver called ready in english and then repeated the command in berberaccented arabic the two men in the back responded affirmatively the van a battered ford that sported arabic letters boasting of the citys best plumbing services eased forward trailing the man in the light suit the driver had no trouble moving slowly without being conspicuous such was the nature of traffic here in the old portion of this city near the harbor as they approached a chaotic intersection the passenger spoke into a cell phone now the driver pulled nearly even with the man they followed just as a second van dark blue in the oncoming lane suddenly leapt the curb and slammed directly into the glass window of an empty storefront sending a shower of glass onto the sidewalk as bystanders gaped and came running by the time the crowds on rue ahmed bourzina helped the driver of the blue van extricate his vehicle from the shattered storefront the white van was nowhere to be seen neither was the man in the light suit wednesday colonel james peterson was tired after the overnight flight from dulles to rome but he was operating on pure energy as his driver sped from davinci airport to his companys facility south of the city he read the extensive dossier on the man whose abduction he had just engineered jacques bennabi the journalist and parttime professor had indeed been in direct communication with the tunisian group that had developed the weapon though washington still wasnt sure who the group was exactly peterson looked impatiently at his watch he regretted the daylong trip required to transport bennabi from algiers to gaeta south of rome where hed been transferred to an ambulance for the drive here but planes were too closely regulated nowadays peterson had told his people they had to keep a low profile his operation here south of rome was apparently a facility that specialized in rehabilitation services for people injured in industrial accidents the italian government had no clue that it was a sham owned ultimately by petersons main company in virginia intelligence analysis systems ias was like hundreds of small businesses throughout the washington area that provided everything from copier toner to consulting to computer software to the massive us government ias though didnt sell office supplies its only product was information and it managed to provide some of the best in the world ias obtained this information not through hightech surveillance but peterson liked to say the oldfashioned way one suspect one interrogator one locked room it did this very efficiently and completely illegally ias ran black sites black site operations are very simple an individual with knowledge the government wishes to learn is kidnapped and taken to a secret and secure facility outside the jurisdiction of the us the kidnapping is known as extraordinary rendition once at a black site the subject is interrogated until the desired information is learned and then hes returned homein most cases that is ias was a private company with no official government affiliation though the government was of course its biggest client they operated three sitesone in bogotá colombia one in thailand and the one that petersons car was now approaching the largest of the ias sites a nondescript beige facility whose front door stated funzione medica di riabilitazione the gate closed behind him and he hurried inside to minimize the chance a passerby might see him peterson rarely came to the black sites himself because he met regularly with government officials it would be disastrous if anyone connected him to an illegal operation like this still the impending threat of the weapon dictated that he personally supervise the interrogation of jacques bennabi despite his fatigue he got right to work and met with the man waiting in the facilitys windowless main office upstairs he was one of several interrogators that ias used regularly one of the best in the world in fact a slightly built man with a confident smile on his face andrew peterson nodded in greeting using the pseudonym the man was known byno real names were ever used in black sites andrew was a us soldier on temporary leave from afghanistan peterson explained that bennabi had been carefully searched and scanned theyd found no gps chips listening devices or explosives in his body the colonel added that sources in north africa were still trying to find whom bennabi had met with in tunis but were having no luck doesnt matter andrew said with a sour smile ill get you everything you need to know soon enough jacques bennabi looked up at andrew the soldier returned the gaze with no emotion assessing the subject noting his level of fear a fair amount it seemed this pleased him not because andrew was a sadisthe wasntbut because fear is a gauge to a subjects resistance he assessed that bennabi would tell him all he wanted to know about the weapon within four hours the room in which they sat was a dim concrete cube twenty feet on each side bennabi sat in a metal chair with his hands behind him bound with restraints his feet were bare increasing his sense of vulnerability and his jacket and personal effects were gonethey gave subjects a sense of comfort and orientation andrew now pulled a chair close to the subject and sat andrew was not a physically imposing man but he didnt need to be the smallest person in the world need not even raise his voice if he has power and andrew had all the power in the world over his subject at the moment now he said in english which he knew bennabi spoke fluently as you know jacques youre many miles from your home none of your family or colleagues know youre here the authorities in algeria have learned of your disappearance by nowwere monitoring thatbut do you know how much they care no answer the dark eyes gazed back emotionless they dont they dont care at all weve been following the reports another university professor gone missing so what you were robbed and shot or the jihad brothership finally got around to settling the score for something you said in class last year or maybe one of your articles upset some danish journalistsand they kidnapped and killed you andrew smiled at his own cleverness bennabi gave no reaction so no one is coming to help you you understand no midnight raids no cowboys riding to the rescue silence andrew continued unfazed now i want to know about this weapon you were discussing with your tunisian friends he was looking carefully at the eyes of the man did they flicker with recognition the interrogator believed they did it was like a shout of acknowledgment good we need to know who developed it what it is and who its going to be used against if you tell me youll be back home in twentyfour hours he let this sink in if you dontthings wont go well the subject continued to sit passively and silent that was fine with andrew he hardly expected an immediate confession he wouldnt want one in fact you couldnt trust subjects who caved in too quickly finally he said jacques i know the names of all your colleagues at the university and the newspaper where you work this was andrews talenthe had studied the art of interrogation for years and knew that people could much more easily resist threats to themselves than to their friends and family andrew had spent the past two days learning every fact he could about people close to bennabi hed come up with lists of each persons weaknesses and fears it had been a huge amount of work over the next few hours andrew never once threatened bennabi himself but he was ruthless in threatening his colleagues ruining careers exposing possible affairs questioning an adoption of a childeven suggesting that some of his friends could be subject to physical harm a dozen specific threats two dozen offering specific details names addresses offices cars they drove restaurants they enjoyed but jacques bennabi said not a word you know how easy it was to kidnap you andrew muttered we plucked you off the street like picking a chicken from a street vendors cage you think your friends are any safer the men who got you are back in algiers you know theyre ready to do what i say the subject only stared back at him andrew grew angry for a moment he cleared his raw throat and left the room had a drink of water struggled to calm down for three more hours he continued the interrogation bennabi paid attention to everything andrew said it seemed but he said nothing goddamn hes good andrew thought struggling not to reveal his own frustration he glanced at his watch it had been nearly nine hours and he hadnt uncovered a single fact about the weapon well it was time to get serious now he scooted the chair even closer jacques youre not being helpful and now thanks to your lack of cooperation youve put all your friends at risk how selfish can you be he snapped silence andrew leaned close you understand that ive been restrained dont you i had hoped youd be more cooperative but apparently youre not taking me seriously i think i have to prove how grave this matter is he reached into his pocket he pulled out a printout of a computer photograph that had been taken yesterday it showed bennabis wife and children in the front yard of their home outside of algiers thursday colonel peterson was in his hotel room in the center of rome he was awakened at am by his secure cell phone yes colonel the caller was andrew his voice was ragged so whatd he tell you nothing the colonel muttered you just tell me what he said and ill figure out if its important thats my job he clicked the light on and fished for a pen no sir i mean didnt say a single word not aword over sixteen hours completely silent the entire time not one goddamn word never happened in all my years in this business was he getting close to breaking at least ino i dont think so i even threatened his family his children no reaction id need another week and ill have to make good on some of the threats but peterson knew they were already on shaky ground by kidnapping somebody who was not a known terrorist he wouldnt dare kidnap or endanger the professors colleagues let alone his family no the colonel said slowly thats all for now you can get back to your unit well go to phase two the woman was dressed conservatively a longsleeved blouse and tan slacks her dark blond hair was pulled back and she wore no jewelry since bennabi wasnt culturally or religiously conservative worked with women at the university and had actually written in favor of womens rights peterson decided to use claire for the second interrogator bennabi would view her as an enemy yes but not as an inferior and since it was known that bennabi had dated and was married with several children he was a clearly a man with an appreciation of attractive women and peterson knew that claire was certainly that she was also an army captain in charge of a prisonerofwar operation in the middle east though at the moment she too was on a brief leave of absence to permit her to practice her own skills as an interrogatorskills very different from andrews but just as effective in the right circumstances peterson now finished briefing her good luck he added and couldnt help reminding her that it was now thursday and the weapon would be deployed the day after tomorrow in perfect arabic claire said i must apologize mr bennabi jacquesmay i use your first name she was rushing into the cell a horrified look on her face when bennabi didnt reply she switched to english your first name you dont mind do you im claire and let me offer you my deepest apologies for this terrible mistake she walked behind him and took the hand restraints off there was little risk she was an expert at aikido and tae kwan do martial arts and could easily have defended herself against the weak exhausted subject but the slim man eyes dark from lack of sleep face drawn simply rubbed his wrists and offered no threatening gestures claire pressed the button on the intercom bring the tray in please a guard wheeled it inside water a pot of coffee and a plate of pastries and candy which she knew from his file bennabi was partial to she sampled everything first to show nothing was spiked with poison or truth serum he drank some water but when she asked coffee something to eat he gave no response claire sat down her face distraught im am so terribly sorry about this i cant begin to describe how horrified we arelet me explain someonewe dont know whotold us that youd met with some people who are enemies of our country she lifted her hands we didnt know who you were all we heard was that you were sympathetic to these enemies and that they had some plans to cause huge destruction something terrible was going to happen imagine what we felt when we heard you were a famous professorand an advocate of human rights no someone gave us misinformation about you maybe accidental she added coyly maybe they had a grudge against you we dont know all i can say is we reacted too quickly now first let me assure you that whatever threats andrew made nothing has or will happen to your colleagues or family that was barbaric what he suggested hes been disciplined and relieved of duty no response whatsoever silence filled the room and she could hear only her heartbeat as she tried to remain calm thinking of the weapon and the hours counting down until it was used obviously this is a very awkward situation certain officials are extremely embarrassed about whats happened and are willing to offer what we could call reparation for your inconvenience he continued to remain silent but she could tell he was listening to every word she scooted the chair closer and sat leaning forward mr bennabijacques i have been authorized to transfer one hundred thousand euros into an account of your choicethats tax free moneyin exchange for your agreement not to sue us for this terrible error claire knew that he made the equivalent of fifteen thousand euros as a professor and another twenty as a journalist i can order all of this done immediately your lawyer can monitor the transaction all you have to do is sign a release agreeing not to sue silence then she continued with a smile and one more small thingi myself have no doubt that you have been wrongly targeted butthe people who have to authorize the payments they want just a little more information about the people you met with the ones in tunis they just wish to be reassured that the meeting was innocent i know it was if i had my way id write you a check now but they control the money a smile isnt that the way the world works bennabi said nothing he stopped rubbing his wrists and sat back they dont need to know anything sensitive just a few names thats all just to keep the money men happy is he agreeing she wondered is he disagreeing bennabi was different from anybody shed ever interrogated usually by now subjects were already planning how to spend the money and telling her whatever she wanted to know when he said nothing she realized hes negotiating of course a nod youre a smart man and i dont blame you one bit for holding out just give us a bit of information to verify your story and i can probably go up to a hundred fifty thousand euros still no response ill tell you what why dont you name a figure lets put this all behind us claire smiled coyly again were on your side jacques we really are friday at am colonel jim peterson was in the office of the rehabilitation center sitting across from a large darkcomplexioned man whod just arrived from darfur akhem asked what happened with claire peterson shook his head bennabi didnt go for the money she sweetened the pot to a quarter million euros the colonel sighed wouldnt take it in fact he didnt even say no he didnt say a word just like with andrew akhem took this information with interest but otherwise unemotionallyas if he were a surgeon called in to handle an emergency operation that was routine for him but that no one else could perform has he slept not since yesterday good there was nothing like sleep deprivation to soften people up akhem was of middle eastern descent though hed been born in america and was a us citizen like peterson hed retired from the military he was now a professional security consultanta euphemism for mercenary soldier he was here with two associates both from africa one white one black peterson had used akhem on a halfdozen occasions as had other governments he was responsible for interrogating a chechen separatist to learn where his colleagues had stashed a busload of moscow schoolchildren last year it took him two hours to learn the exact location of the bus the number of soldiers guarding them their weapons and passcodes no one knew exactly how hed done it no one wanted to peterson wasnt pleased hed had to turn to akhems approach to interrogation known as extreme extraction indeed he realized that the bennabi situation raised the textbook moral question on using torture you know a terrible event is about to occur and you have in custody a prisoner who knows how to prevent it do you torture or not there were those who said no you dont that it is better to be morally superior and to suffer the consequences of letting the event occur by stooping to the enemys techniques these people say we automatically lose the war even if we militarily prevail other said that it was our enemies whod changed the rules if they tortured and killed innocents in the name of their causes we had to fight them on their own terms peterson had now made the second choice he prayed it was the right one akhem was looking at the video of bennabi in the cell slumped in a chair his head cocked to the side he wrinkled his nose and said three hours at the most he rose and left the office gesturing his fellow mercenaries after him but three hours came and went jacques bennabi said nothing despite being subjected to one of the most horrific methods of extreme extraction in waterboarding the subject is inverted on his back and water poured into his nose and mouth simulating drowning its a horrifying experienceand also one of the most popular forms of torture because theres no lasting physical evidenceprovided of course that the victim doesnt in fact drown which happens occasionally tell me akhem raged as the assistants dragged bennabi to his feet pulling his head out of the large tub he choked and spit water from under the cloth mask he wore where is the weapon who is behind it tell me silence except for the mans coughing and sputtering then to the assistants again back he went onto the board his feet in the air and the water began to flow once more four hours passed then six then eight drenched himself physically exhausted akhem looked at his watch it was now early evening only five hours until saturdaywhen the weapon would be deployed and he hadnt learned a single fact about it he could hardly hide his astonishment hed never known anybody to hold out for this long that was amazing in its own right but more significant was the fact that bennabi had not uttered a single word the entire time hed groaned hed gasped hed choked but not a single word of english or arabic or berber had passed his lips subjects always begged and cursed and lied or offered partial truths to get the interrogators at least to pause for a time but not bennabi again akhem announced then at pm akhem sat down in a chair in the cell staring at bennabi who lolled gasping on the waterboard the interrogator said to his assistants thats enough akhem dried off and looked over the subject he then walked into the hallway outside the cell and opened his attaché case he extracted a large scalpel and returned closing the door behind him bennabis bleary eyes stared at the weapon as akhem walked forward the subject leaned away akhem nodded his assistants took bennabi by the shoulders one of them gripping his arm hard rendering it immobile akhem took the subjects fingers and leaned forward with the knife where is the weapon he growled you dont have any idea of the pain youll experience if you dont tell me where is it who is behind the attack tell me bennabi looked into his eyes he said nothing the interrogator moved the blade closer it was then that the door burst open stop cried colonel peterson come out here into the hallway the interrogator paused and stood back he wiped sweat from his forehead the three interrogators left the cell and joined the colonel in the hallway i just heard from washington theyve found out who bennabi was meeting with in tunis theyre sending me the information in a few minutes i want you to hold off until we know more akhem hesitated reluctantly he put the scalpel away then the large man stared at the video screen on which was an image of bennabi sitting in the chair breathing heavily staring back into the camera the interrogator shook his head not a word he didnt say a single word saturday at am on the day the weapon would be deployed colonel jim peterson was alone in the office on the rehabilitation center awaiting the secure email about the meeting in tunis armed with that information they would have a much better chance to convince bennabi to give them information come on he urged staring at his computer a moment later it complied the computer pinged and he opened the encrypted email from the skinny government man hed met with in his reston virginia office on monday colonel weve identified the people bennabi met with but its not a terrorist cell its a human rights group humanity now we doublechecked and our local contacts are sure theyre the ones whore behind the weapon but weve followed the group for years and have norepeat noindication that its a cover for a terrorist organization discontinue all interrogation until we know more peterson frowned he knew humanity now everybody believed it to be a legitimate organization my god was this all a misunderstanding had bennabi met with the group about a matter that was completely innocent whatve we done he was about to call washington and ask for more details when he happened to glance at his computer and saw that hed received another emailfrom a major us newspaper the header reporter requesting comment before publication he opened the message colonel peterson im a reporter with the new york daily herald im filing the attached article in a few hours with my newspaper it will run there and in syndication in about two hundred other papers around the world im giving you the opportunity to include a comment if you like ive also sent copies to the white house the central intelligence agency and the pentagon seeking their comments too oh my god what the hell is this with trembling hands the colonel opened the attachment andto his utter horrorread rome may a private american company with ties to the us government has been running an illegal operation south of the city for the purpose of kidnapping interrogating and occasionally torturing citizens of other countries to extract information from them the facility known in military circles as a black site is owned by a reston virginia corporation intelligence analysis systems whose corporate documents list government security consulting as its main purpose italian business filings state that the purpose of the roman facility is physical rehabilitation but no requisite government permits for health care operations have been obtained with respect to it further no licensed rehabilitation professionals are employed by the company which is owned by a caribbean subsidiary of ias employees are us and other nonitalian nationals with backgrounds not in medical science but in military and security services the operation was conducted without any knowledge on the part of the italian government and the italian ambassador to the united states has stated he will demand a full explanation as to why the illegal operation was conducted on italian soil officials from the polizia di stato and the ministero della giustizia likewise have promised a full investigation there is no direct connection between the us government and the facility outside of rome but over the course of the past week this reporter conducted extensive surveillance of the rehabilitation facility and observed the presence of a man identified as former colonel james peterson the president of ias he is regularly seen in the company of highranking pentagon cia and white house officials in the washington dc area petersons satellite phone began ringing he supposed the slim man from washington was calling or maybe his boss or maybe the white house caller id does not work on encrypted phones his jaw quivering peterson ignored the phone he pressed ahead in the article the discovery of the ias facility in rome came about on a tip last week from humanity now a human rights group based in north africa and long opposed to the use of torture and black sites the group reported that an algerian journalist was to be kidnapped in algiers and transported to a black site somewhere in europe at the same time the human rights organization gave this reporter the name of a number of individuals suspected of being black site interrogators by examining public records and various travel documents it was determined that several of these specialiststwo us military officers and a mercenary soldier based in africatraveled to rome not long after the journalists abduction in algiers reporters were able to follow the interrogators to the rehabilitation facility which was then determined to be owned by ias slumping in his chair peterson ignored the phone he gave a grim laugh closing his eyes the whole thing the whole story about terrorists about the weapon about bennabiit was a setup yes there was an enemy but it was merely the human rights group which had conspired with the professor to expose the black site operation to the pressand the world peterson understood perfectly humanity now had probably been tracking the main interrogators ias usedandrew claire akhem and othersfor months if not years the group and bennabi a human rights activist had planted the story about the weapon themselves to engineer his kidnapping then alerted that reporter for the new york newspaper who leapt after the story of a lifetime bennabi was merely baitand i went right for it of course he remained silent the whole time that was his job to draw as many interrogators here as he could and give the reporter a chance to follow them discover the facility and find out who was behind it oh this was badthis was terrible it was the kind of scandal that could bring down governments it would certainly end his career and many others it might very likely end the process of black sites altogether or at least set them back years he thought about calling together the staff and telling them to destroy all the incriminating papers and to flee but why bother he reflected it was too late now peterson decided there was nothing to do but accept his fate though he did call the guards and tell them to arrange to have jacques bennabi transferred back home the enemy had won and in an odd way peterson respected that and make sure he arrives unharmed yessir peterson sat back hearing in his thoughts the words of the slim man from washington the weaponit can do quote significant damage except that there was no weapon it was all a fake yet with another sour laugh peterson decided this wasnt exactly true there was indeed a weapon it wasnt nuclear or chemical or explosive but in the end was far more effective than any of those and would indeed do significant damage reflecting on his prisoners refusal to speak during his captivity reflecting too on the devastating paragraphs of the reporters article the colonel concluded the weapon was silence the weapon was words blake crouch blake started writing stories in elementary school to scare his little brother at bedtime he has since perfected the craft of creating intense and insulated worlds in which unspeakable evil can exist a photograph blake took of a deserted road on the high desert plain in wyoming was the inspiration for his first book desert places the horrifying villain in that novel is shaped from the terrors blake thought might be waiting for him in that unforgiving landscape blakes story for this collection remaking is influenced by landscape in much the same way tragic events unfold in a snowy sleepy colorado town from the first scene in which a man sits alone in the cold watching a father and son in a diner you know something is about to go horribly wrong with a sickening sense of isolation magnified by the blanketing snow youll find your fingers getting numb from gripping the pages as you turn them inexorably toward the final scene remaking mitchell stared at the page in the notebook covered in his messy scrawl but he wasnt reading hed seen them walk into the coffeehouse fifteen minutes prior the man short pudgy and smoothshaven the boy perhaps five or six and wearing a longsleeved oshkosh bgoshred with blue stripes now they sat two tables away the boy said im hungry well get something in a little while how long is a little while until i say when are you gonna joel do you mind the little boys head dropped and the man stopped typing and looked up from his laptop im sorry tell you what give me five minutes so i can finish this email and well go eat breakfast mitchell sipped his espresso snow falling beyond the storefront windows into this mountain hamlet of eight hundred souls miles davis squealing through the speakersone of the lowkey numbers off kind of blue mitchell trailed them down the frosted sidewalk one block up they crossed the street and disappeared into a diner having already eaten in that very establishment two hours ago he installed himself on a bench where he could see the boy and the man sitting at a table by the front window mitchell fished the cell out of his jacket and opened the phone scrolling through ancient numbers as the snow collected in his hair he pressed talk two rings then mitch oh my god where are you he made no answer look im at the office getting ready for a big meeting i cant do this right now but will you answer if i call you back please mitchell closed the phone and shut his eyes they emerged from the diner an hour later mitchell brushed the inch of snow off his pants and stood shivering he crossed the street and followed the boy and the man up the sidewalk passing a candy shop a grocery a depressing bar masquerading as an old west saloon they left the sidewalk after another block and walked up the driveway to the antlers motel disappeared into the middle in a singlestory row of nine rooms the tarp stretched over the small swimming pool sagged with snow in an alcove between the rooms and the office vending machines hummed against the hush of the storm ten minutes of brisk walking returned mitchell to his motel the box canyon lodge he checked out climbed into his burgundy jetta cranked the engine just for tonight she asked yes thatll be with tax mitchell handed the woman behind the front desk his credit card behind her a row of hummels stood in perfect formation atop a blackandwhite television airing the price is right mitchell signed the receipt could i have or the old woman stubbed out her cigarette in a glass ashtray and reached for the key cabinet mitchell pressed his ear to the wood paneling a television blared through the thin wall his cell phone vibratedlisa calling again flipped it open mitch you dont have to say anything please just listen he powered off the phone and continued writing in the notebook afternoon unspooled as the snow piled up in the parking lot of the antlers motel mitchell parted the blinds and stared through the window as the first intimation of dusk began to blue the sky the noise of the television next door droning through the walls he lay down on top of the covers and stared at the ceiling and whispered the lords prayer in the evening he startled out of sleep to the sound of a door slamming sat up too fast the blood rushing to his head in a swarm of black spots he hadnt intended to sleep mitchell slid off the bed and walked to the window split the blinds heard the diminishing sound of footstepsa single setsqueaking in the snow he saw the boy pass through the illumination of a streetlamp and disappear into the alcove that housed the vending machines the snowflakes stung mitchells cheeks as he crossed the parking lot his sneakers swallowed up in six inches of fresh powder the hum of the vending machines intensified and he picked out the sound of coins dropping through a slot he glanced once over his shoulder at the row of rooms the doors all closed windows dark save for slivers of electric blue from television screens sliding through the blinds too dark to tell if the man was watching mitchell stepped into the alcove as the boy pressed his selection on the drink machine the can banged into the open compartment and the boy reached down and claimed the sprite hi joel the boy looked up at him then lowered his head like a scolded dog as though hed been caught vandalizing the drink machine no its all right you havent done anything wrong mitchell squatted down on the concrete look at me son whos that man youre with the voice so soft and high daddy a voice boomed across the parking lot joel it dont take this long to buy a can of pop make a decision and get back here the door slammed joel do you want to come with me youre a stranger no my names mitch im a police officer actually why dont

need to come with me ill get in trouble no only way youll get in trouble is by not obeying a police officer when he tells you to do something mitchell noticed the boys hands trembling his were too come on son he put his hand on the boys small shoulder and guided him out of the alcove toward his car where he opened the front passenger door and motioned for joel to get in mitchell brushed the snow off the windows and the windshield and as he climbed in and started the engine he saw the door to swing open in the rearview mirror you eaten yet no main street empty and the newly scraped pavement already frosting again the reflection of the high beams blinding against the wall of pouring snow are you hungry i dont know he turned right off main drove slow down a snowpacked side street that sloped past little victorians inns and motels joel buckled into the passenger seat the can of sprite still unopened between his legs tears rolling down his cheeks mitchell unlocked the door and opened it go on in joel the boy entered and mitchell hit the light closing and locking the door after them wondering if joel could reach the brass chain near the top it wasnt much of a roomsingle bed table cabinet housing a refrigerator on one side hangers on the other hed lived out of it for the last month and it smelled like stale pizza crust and cardboard and clothes soured with sweat mitchell closed the blinds you wanna watch tv the boy shrugged mitchell picked the remote control off the bedside table and turned it on come sit on the bed joel as the boy climbed onto the bed mitchell started flipping you tell me to stop when you see something you wanna watch mitchell surfed through all thirty stations twice and the boy said nothing he settled on the discovery channel set the remote control down i want my dad the boy said trying not to cry calm down joel mitchell sat on the bed and unlaced his sneakers his socks were damp and cold he balled them up and tossed them into the open bathroom staring now at his pale feet toes shriveled with moisture joel had settled back into one of the pillows momentarily entranced by the television program where a man caked in mud wrestled with a crocodile mitchell turned up the volume you like crocodiles he asked yeah you arent scared of them the boy shook his head i got a snake nuhuh the boy looked up uhhuh what kind its black and scaly and it lives in a glass box a terrarium yeah daddy catches mice for it it eats them uhhuh slinkys belly gets real big mitchell smiled i bet thats something to see they sat watching the discovery channel for twenty minutes joel engrossed now mitchell with his head tilted back against the headboard eyes closed a half grin where none had been for twelve months at pm the cell vibrated against mitchells hip he opened the case and pulled out the phone hi lisa mitch listen i want you to call me back in five minutes and do exactly what i say okay mitchell closed the phone and slid off the bed the boy looked up still half watching the program on the worlds deadliest spiders he said im hungry i know sport i know give me just a minute here and ill order a pizza mitchell crossed the carpet tracking through dirty clothes he shouldve taken to the laundry a week ago his suitcase lay open in the space between the dresser and the baseboard heater he knelt down searching through wrinkled oxfords and blue jeans khakis that had long since lost their creases it was a tiny wool sweatericeblue with a magnified snowflake stitched across the front hey joel he said its getting cold in here i want you to put this on he tossed the sweater onto the bed im not cold you do like i tell you now as the boy reached for the sweater mitchell undid the buttons on his plaid shirt and worked his arms out of the sleeves he dropped the shirt on the carpet and rifled his suitcase again until he found the badly faded tshirt hed bought fifteen years ago at a u concert on the way back to the bed he stopped at the television and lifted the videotape from the top of the vcr pushed it in no i wanna watch the well turn it back on in a minute he climbed under the covers beside the boy and stared at the bedside table waiting for the phone to buzz joel im gonna answer the phone i want you to sit here beside me and watch the television and dont say a word until i tell you im hungry the phone vibrated itself toward the edge of the bedside table ill buy you anything you want if you do this right for me mitchell picked up the phone lisa calling he closed his eyes gave himself a moment to engage hed written it all down months ago the script in the bedside table drawer under the gideon bible hed taken to reading every night before bed but he didnt need it hi honey mitch im so glad you stop dont say anything just hang on a minute he reached for the remote control and pressed play the screen lit up halfway through the episode of seinfeld he lowered the volume said lisa i want you to say im almost asleep what are you just do it a pause then im almost asleep say it like you really are mitchell closed his eyes im almost asleep were sitting here watching seinfeld he looked down at the top of joels head his hair brown with gold highlights just the right shade and length he kissed the boys head our little guys just about asleep mitch are you drunk lisa i will close this fucking phone ask how our day was do it how was your day you werent crying that night he could hear her trying to gather herself how was your day mitch he closed his eyes again one of those perfect ones were in ouray colorado now this little town surrounded by huge mountains it started snowing around midday as we were driving down from montrose if they dont plow the roads we may not be able to get out tomorrow mitch we had a snowball fight after dinner and our motel has these japanese soaking tubs out back full of hot mineral water from the springs under the town say you wish you were here thats not what i said that night mitch what did you say i wish i could be there with you but part of mes so glad you two have this time together there arent many days like this are there no now i just want to hear you breathing over the phone he listened he looked at the television then the boys head then the iceblue sweater mitchell held the phone to joels mouth say good night to mom alex good night mitchell brought the phone to his ear thank you lisa mitch who was that what have you he powered off the phone and set it on the bedside table when the boy was finally asleep mitchell turned off the television he pulled the covers over the both of them and scooted forward until he could feel the hard ridge of the boys little spine press against his chest in the back window through a crack in the closed blinds he watched the snow falling through the orange illumination of a streetlamp and his lips moved in prayer the knock finally came a few minutes after am and nothing timid about itthe forceful pounding of a fist against the door mitchell griggs mitchell sat up in bed eyes struggling to adjust in the darkness mr griggs more pounding as his feet touched the carpet griggs mitchell made his way across dirty clothes and pizza boxes to the door which he spoke through who is it dennis james ouray county sheriff need to speak with you right now little late isnt it he tried to make his voice sound light and unperturbed maybe i could come by your office in the what part of right now went past you mitchell glanced up saw the chain still locked whats this about he asked i think you

here then why dont you open the door let me confirm that so you can get back to sleep and we can quit wasting precious minutes trying to find this little boy mitchell glanced through the peephole glimpsed the sheriff standing within a foot of the door under one of the globe lights that lit the secondfloor walkway his black parka dusted with snow his widebrimmed cowboy hat capped with a half inch of powder mitchell couldnt nail down the sheriffs age in the poor lightlate sixties perhaps seventy at most he held the fore end stock of a pumpaction shotgun in his right hand ive got two deputies out back on the hill behind your room if youre thinking of im not just tell me if you have the boy a radio squeaked outside the sheriff spoke in low tones then mitchell heard the dissipation of footsteps a minute limped by before the sheriffs voice passed faintly through the door again you still there mitch yeah if its all right with you im gonna sit down i been walking all over town since seven oclock the sheriff lowered out of sight and through the peephole mitchell could only see torrents of snow dumping on the trees and houses and parked cars he eased down on the carpet and leaned against the door i was just speaking with your wife lisas concerned for you mitch knows why youre here she doesnt know any and so do i you may not know this but i helped pull you and your son out of the car never forget it been what about a year to the day drafts of frigid air swept under the door mitchell shivering wishing hed brought a blanket with him from the bed mitch lisas been trying to call you you have your cell with you its turned off on the bedside table would you talk to her for me i dont need to talk to her i think it might not be a bad i had a meeting the next

chance to scrape the pass i got a boy of my own hes grown now but i remember when he was your alexs age cant say id have survived if something like what happened to your son happened to him you got a gun in there mitch in the back of mitchells throat welled a sharp acidic tang like tasting the connectors of a ninevolt battery but all he said was yeah is the boy all right mitchell said nothing look i know youre hurting but joel mcintosh aint done a thing to deserve getting dragged into this boys probably terrified you thought about that or can you not see past your own of course ive thought about it then why dont you send him on out and you and me can keep talking i cant do that why not i justi cant mitchell heard footsteps outside the door he got up quickly glanced through the peephole just in time to see the battering ram swing back he stumbled toward the bed as the door exploded off its hinges and slammed to the floor two men standing in the thresholdthe sheriff with the shotgun trained on him a deputy with a flashlight and a handgun mitchell shielded his eyesspecks of snow blowing in luminescent where they passed through the led beamcouldnt see the man behind the light but the sheriffs eyes were hard and kind he could tell this even though they lived in the shadow of a stetson the sheriff said i dont see the boy wade mitchell let me see those hands mitchell took a deep trembling breath come on mitch let me see your hands mitchell shook his head goddamn son i wont tell you mitchell swung his right arm behind his back his fingers wrapping around the remote control jammed down his boxer shorts the room fired into blue by the illumination of the television the laugh track to seinfeld blaring wade screaming the sheriffs name as a greater light bloomed beside the lesser sheriff james flicked the light felt the breath leave him as he blinked through the tears he leaned the shotgun against the wall and stepped inside the bathroom the cheap fiberglass of the tub had been lined with blankets and pillows and the little boy was sitting up staring at the sheriff orange earplugs protruding from his ears the sheriff knelt down smiled at the boy pulled out the earplugs you okay joel the boy said a noise woke me up did he make you sleep in here mitchell said if i was a good boy and kept my earplugs in and stayed in here all night i could see my daddy in the morning he did huh wheres my daddy down in the parking lot well take you to him but i need to ask you something first the sheriff sat down on the cracked linoleum tile did mitchell hurt you no he didnt touch you anywhere private or make you touch him no we just sat on the bed and watched about spiders and stuff you mean on the tv yeah whats that the sheriff pointed to the notebook sitting on a pillow under the faucet mitchell said to give this to the people who came to get me wade walked into the bathroom stood behind the sheriff as he lifted the spiralbound notebook and opened the red cover to a page of handwriting in black ink what is it wade asked its to his wife whats it say the sheriff closed the notebook i believe thats some of her business he stood faced his deputy snow melting off his stetson get this boy wrapped up in some blankets and bring him down to his dad i gotta go call lisa griggs will do and wade yeah you throw a blanket over mr griggs before you bring joel out dont want so much as a strand of hair visible shield the boys eyes if you have to maybe even turn the lights out when you carry him through the room the deputy shook his head what the hell was wrong with this man you got kids yet wade you know i dont well just a headsupif you ever do this is how much they make you love them harry hunsicker harry hunsicker seems to know an awful lot about taking that short step from respectable citizen to flatout criminal his awardwinning series featuring investigator lee henry oswald is a highoctane tour of the seedier side of dallas his story iced has that same feeling of a world turned upside down the lead characters bear a shocking resemblance to people we might knoweven to ourselvespillars of society crumbling in an avalanche of bad decisions that seemed perfectly rational at the time all you can do as a reader is hang on and hope against all odds someone makes it out alive iced bijoux watsons body slipped underneath the muddy waters of the brazos river without a sound a mangled pile of flesh that had once been the biggest purveyor of black tar heroin in all of east texas chrissie and tom watched it float downstream both breathing heavily after dragging the remains to the edge of the water after a few moments the corpse rounded a bend and disappeared chrissie and tom looked at each other and smiled then they screwed right there in the mud and gunk tossing their clothes aside in a tangled heap their bodies sweaty tom felt the crystal meth theyd smoked an hour before course through his limbs like a bolt of sunlight his groin jonesing for chrissie and her tight body bijoux was finally dead when they finished they lay side by side on the dirt and listened to the cattle egrets trill overhead and the traffic lumber across the bridge going to bryancollege station the air smelled of water and decaying vegetation and sex chrissie dug a rumpled pack of virginia slims from the pocket of her denim skirt she lit one and blew a plume of smoke skyward i love you tom ran his index finger in a circular pattern around one of her breasts she sighed and pitched her cigarette in the river daddy always said dont get lovin confused with screwing tom felt needles cartwheel across his intestines as the last of the meth ricocheted across his battered synapses he tried to remember what sleep was like but baby you said bijouxs gone chrissie stood and brushed the leaves and dirt from her body thingsre different now tom tried not to cry as she dressed an enormous fatigue making his limbs as heavy and stiff as tree trunks his skin hurt and his vision turned black at the edges chrissie buttoned her skirt and tramped up the muddy slope without a word he lay there for a few moments thinking about chrissie and the way she contorted her face when she had an orgasm the sinews and tendons in her neck and how they came to the surface of her silky skin he thought about doing her again and about the last hit of ice the crystalized amphetamine in his briefcase in the car tom scrambled into his clothes and ran after her two minutes later he stepped off the path and onto the asphalt parking lot near the boat landing on the east side of the river bijoux watsons lemonyellow jaguar was the only car visible chrissie stood by the front passenger door with her arms crossed staring intently at the smudged and cracked windshield tom walked over and stood next to her explosive residue blood and liquified body parts coated the inside of the glass bijoux had been in the drivers seat a twokilo package of what he thought was mexican skag sitting between his legs when tom pressed the button detonating the ten blasting caps nestled in the bag of piggly wiggly brown sugar he and chrissie had been thirty yards away underneath a live oak tree with their cigarettes bijoux a loan shark pimp and dope dealer was a rabid antismoker tom said guess we didnt think this through no shit einstein chrissie closed her eyes and pinched the bridge of her nose town was ten miles away theyd ridden here with the dead man to make the transaction claiming the stuff was hidden by the river whats your plan now she said tom opened the front passenger door of the car a rank wave of hot air that smelled like blood and feces hit his face making him gag for a moment he took a deep breath and grabbed his briefcase dislodging what looked like a one of bijouxs testicles he plopped his carryall on the hood of the car opened it and rummaged through the contents until he found the foilwrapped nugget of methamphetamine the pipe lay underneath some loan documents due at the title company a week ago next to the glockcaliber pistol hed started carrying ever since hed gotten tangled up with bijoux watson his fingers fumbled as he jammed the drug into the bowl of the pipe with the battered zippo his father had carried in vietnam he ignited the crystalized narcotic two big lungfuls and all the confidence power and cojones on the planet coursed through his veins as thick and fast and strong as the muddy waters a few hundred feet away chrissie appeared at his side with a canvas bag shed evidently found in the trunk she opened it and pulled out a ziploc sack full of dirty brown powder bijoux always traveled with a stash she licked her lips and produced a needle and a blackened tablespoon from the bottom of the bag tom offered her the pipe she grabbed it and inhaled deeply then she set about cooking a dose of heroin baby dont do that tom said shits bad for you dirty needles and all that other stuff dont knock it until youve tried it she lowered her voice it makes sex incredible she pointed the needle at him gimme your arm tom looked at the syringe and then at chrissies face her eyes were wide with what he assumed to be anticipation he wanted to say no but because he had just ingested over a gram of primo ice and had all the confidence power and cojones in the world he stuck his arm out chrissie smiled found a suitable vein and slid the needle in giving him half the load she then injected the rest into a blood vessel in her thigh together they sat on the grimy asphalt and leaned against the side of bijoux watsons bloody jaguar tom felt like there was nothing he couldnt do no task or challenge he couldnt accomplish except for the fact he had no energy he thought at that moment he could climb mount everest chrissie fell against him and said that just as soon as they came down a little shed fuck him so hard his toenails would hurt later it could have been thirty minutes or thirty seconds tom heard the crunch of tires he opened his eyes as a county squad car pulled up and stopped a few feet from the jag a deputy got out tom recognized him and struggled to remember the mans name dean something dean jr had been in his wifes sundayschool class a couple of years ago tom is that you deputy dean squinted in the afternoon sun and leaned down to get a closer look whole towns looking for you you aint been to the bank in three days the deputy rubbed one hand over his mouth and his eyes got wide as he looked from chrissie back to tom you okay whats wrong with your pupils tom nodded and pushed himself off the ground the uppers and downers in his system making everything deliciously hazy and warm and happy dean its damn good to see you he enunciated each syllable with extreme precision the bank um yes the bank the bank they need these very important documents at the bank very soon dean can you help me with that tom turned his back to the officer and reached inside the briefcase uh yeah sure the deputy said anything you need tom remembered the mans last name chambers dean roy chambers his wife and two children lived in a doublewide on nine acres just outside of town toms bank had made the loan who is she the deputy said are you all right maam shes fine tom turned and smiled then he shot dean chambers in the cheek about a quarter inch to the left of his nose with thecaliber glock the bullet was one of those fancy armorpiercing hollowpoints the liberal guncontrol freaks loved to whine about it made a big hole exiting the back of the deputys head chrissie snapped awake as the blast roiled across the empty parking lot what the hell took care of the issue baby tom squared his shoulders and sucked his gut in goddamn thats what im talking about you fucking killed a cop chrissie stood up legs wobbly that aint taking care of no issues thats making new ones hed seen us together baby tom stuck the gun in his waistband his heart thumped a disco beat in his rib cage whump whump whump couldnt do anything else besides got us a ride out of here ah tommy youre the greatest she staggered toward the cop car tom grabbed his briefcase and ran after her ii love you baby why does any man begin an affair was it the impending fortieth birthday and the loss of vigor and sexual prowess traditionally associated with middle age or was it the utter banality of living with the same woman for the past fifteen years through the ups and downs of raising three children and a succession of overly precocious golden retrievers tom thought it something more profound the need deep inside every male to experience one thing to the fullest to nurture a spark into a roaring fire to throw away the rearview mirror of life and press the accelerator to the floor to be a man dammit chrissie sat in the passenger seat of the squad car knees tucked under her chin exposing the full length of her tanned legs tom tried to concentrate on the road and not her thighs she said where we going we need to get some more ice tom lit a marlboro light with one shaking hand then i figure we get the cash ive been giving bijoux and head south somewhere i hear you can live like a king in costa rica with plenty of gringo dollars do you even know how to speak mexican chrissie scratched her left breast were not going to mexico baby tom pulled around a slowmoving pickup loaded with hay were gonna be the king and queen of costa rica ill buy us one of those learntospeakspanish tapes and well be fluent in no time lets just get the ice and the money first huh chrissie drummed her fingers on the dash and looked out the rear window then well figure it out chrissie had arrived in town one month before on a oneway bus ticket from shreveport vague about her past except it involved a crazy ex with a mean right hook shed just gotten a job at the local vets clinic when tom had brought the dog in for a bath the attraction was instantaneous and electric beginning with furtive glances and then an accidental brush of their hands when tom handed over a check a volley of double entendres ended up with tom asking her to lunch to his horror and amazement she said yes hed persuaded the vet to keep the dog for the remainder of the weekend he then called his wife and told her an old college friend had gotten thrown in jail in waco and he was going to bail him out hed be home in time for dinner probably it was early saturday afternoon and he could tell by her voice she had started on the second bottle of white zinfandel and only really cared about number three they went to a barbecue joint one county over and then on to a room at the shangrila motel on highway six the first time they did it right as he started to come chrissie grabbed his balls and gave em a good squeeze tom had never felt anything as intense and pleasurable and thought he never would again that was before they met the next weekend and chrissie brought a foil package of ice the greatest substance known to mankind thirty days later tom was in a stolen squad car driving toward a tarpaper juke joint called jolies looking to score enough meth and money to get them to costa rica and a new life tom took a deep breath and smiled this is living man the squad car slid to a stop in the gravel parking lot of the bar midafternoon on a wednesday and there were only a couple of other vehicles present a smidgen of the drug remained in the bowl chrissie and tom split it sucking on the pipestem until their lungs hurt they hopped out of the auto and pushed their way into the neon gloom of bijoux watsons only legitimate business enterprise the place was empty except for an old man in overalls at the bar drinking a sixteenounce can of schlitz malt liquor and the mulatto bartender an expimp named teabag johnson the jukebox in the corner played marvin gayes sexual healing tom felt the meth track through his body and thought about how appropriate that song was to the situation at hand and how he sure would like to take chrissie back into bijouxs office and nail her on the desk right next to the safe which reportedly held enough dope to get half of texas strung out teabag wiped a glass dry and looked at the door behind them as if expecting the owner to arrive tom and chrissie sat at the bar tom ordered two miller lites and two shots of jose cuervo gold wheres bijoux the bartender set the drinks down yall give him the shit you supposed to hes beendelayed tom downed the tequila in one gulp said for me to get some stuff from his office he told you to get something out a his office teabag frowned and leaned against the bar yeah tom took a sip of beer to cool the fire in his mouth he nodded toward chrissie ask her she was there the bartender looked at chrissie i always thought you were pretty cute teabag she ran her tongue around the rim of the shot glass bet you know how to treat a lady right tom spluttered on a mouthful of beer teabag kept his face impassive i dont truck with no whores no more the preacher says thats the road to hell teabag reached under the bar yall is way messed up been smoking too much crack or sumshit toms vision blurred with anger the man called his baby a whore he reached into the waistband of his slacks and pulled out the glock teabags hand came out from under the bar with a sawedoff shotgun tom yanked the trigger and missed from three feet away chrissie threw her beer bottle at teabag and connected a solid blow to the forehead the bartender raised a hand to his face and pulled the trigger on the shotgun the weapon was pointed about a foot to the right of tom away from chrissie and only a small portion of the quarterinchdiameter pellets hit their intended target the noise was enormous like a thunderclap in a cave and tom felt a chunk of lead tear into his left bicep and another hit the fleshy part of his side just above the hip he jerked the trigger on the glock as fast as he could about half the bullets hit teabag in the chest and head the remainder colliding with the bottles of liquor on the shelf behind the bar for one brief surreal moment the area where teabag stood was a virtual waterfall of liquid a mist of blood and booze eerily illuminated by the neon beer signs on the wall the glock clicked empty teabag coughed once and fell to the floor dead tom placed his gun on the bar and clamped a hand over the oozing hole in his arm he felt no pain only a mild sensation of pressure deep inside the muscle the old man drinking beer was nowhere to be seen he shot me baby tom grabbed a bar rag and wrapped it around his arm itll be all right chrissie helped him tie the makeshift bandage we get in the office ill give you dose of medicine okay tom grabbed the gun stuck it in his waistband and picked up the bottle of cuervo from the bar together they headed to the office in the back two weeks after their first encounter at the motel bijoux watson resplendent in a pink warmup suit and enough gold chains to outfit an entire rap band showed up in his office at the bank he talked his way past the secretary and told tom he needed five grand or the whole county would know about his little split tail and their love shack over at the shangrila tom on the downside of a twoday bender put the banks chairman of the board on hold in midcomplaint about his presidents increasingly erratic behavior and said who the hell are you bijoux leaned back and put his reeboks on top of toms desk im one of those niggas you dont never see lest we cleaning up your house or serving you a drink at the country club tom hung up on the director i dont know anything about a motel your gals name is chrissie the man in the garish warmup suit pulled a piece of gum out of his pocket and stuck it in his mouth he dropped the wrapper on the floor that shit yall been smokin comes from me tom started to reply but the man held up his hand my place out by the lake jolies bijoux stood up you be there tomorrow noon with five large in cash that had been two weeks and two hundred thousand dollars ago money was missing from the bank and people were starting to ask questions three days before theyd hatched a plan to kill bijoux surprisingly he had fallen for their story that they had stumbled on some heroin and wanted to use it in lieu of a payment tom had said hed foreclosed on a property and hed found it when he inspected the place the rest of it the blasting caps and the remotecontrol devicewell its amazing how resourceful one could be when one had a couple of grams of pharmaceuticalgrade meth surfing through ones body now they were in the inner sanctum bijouxs office a place of utter depression for tom on his five prior visits they stood by the door for a moment there was a battered metal desk in the center on one wall was a set of bookshelves filled with grimy threering binders another wall was dominated by a bigscreen television set in the corner sat a large metallicgray safe tom took a swig of tequila the safe had a complicatedlooking combination lock it also had a small key sticking out of the middle of the dial toms brother had a gun safe similar to this one the key was to hold the handle of the safe in the open or closed position not nearly as secure as using the combo but without using the dial a lot easier to access the interior tom twisted the key then the spoke handle and tugged the door swung open a tiny light popped on and illuminated the interior of the safe exposing stacks and stacks of plastic bags and cash holy shit chrissies voice was low respectful tom gulped i bet its skag she grabbed a bag at random and slit it with a letter opener from the desk oh shit there must be twenty pounds in here uncut ill bet tom ignored her and pulled out a similar size pack but wrapped in darker plastic the contents crunched as he massaged it butterflies bounced across his stomach as he thought about what might be wrapped in the black covering he grabbed the opener from chrissie and cut the container exposing a couple of hundred tightly bound foil packages baby its ice his eyes filled with tears we got enough to get us through were gonna make it they laughed and cried and danced together until chrissie noticed the blood from toms wounded side let me fix that she pulled up his shirt and examined the damage uh yeah okay tom unwrapped one of the foil packages lets get high first they smoked the whole pack trading hits until the world was right again and theyd both forgotten about toms injuries its time to split chrissie paced the small room see whats out there tom piled cash on the desktop and nodded toward a metal door on the back wall of the office chrissie flipped open the dead bolt and peered outside theres a truckand it looks like some kinda road leading into the woods tom stopped shoving money into the small duffel hed found on the floor and joined her at the door its gonna work baby he hugged her his hand sliding up under her sleeveless shirt to the smooth flesh covering her rib cage his groin ached and his words spluttered forth as fast as the bullets from the glock well go to austin then well get new ids saw it on a movie on hbo one time about how people can do that then well get on the internet and find us a place to rent in costa rica and well buy some clothes aaand thats a real swell plan chrissie slipped from his embrace and faced him in the doorway but we need the keys to that truck out there unless the folks at banking school taught you how to hotwire a late model chevy they looked at each other for a moment and then raced back in the office the ice made quick work of it tom found a cigar box in a file drawer at the bottom was a gm key and a remote control he clicked it and the truck outside chirped they smiled at each other and slapped palms across the top of bijoux watsons desk chrissie found another duffel and filled it with the speed and heroin while tom finished loading the money when they were done tom poured them each a shot of jose cuervo they toasted themselves and their cleverness heres to us on the beach chrissie poured another round drinking little fruity drinks with parasols in em who would a thought it tom downed his fourth tequila of the last half hour and felt it burn all the way to his toes the ice kept him alert but not sober he looked at chrissies breasts beneath the thin cotton of her blouse and at her legs long and shapely underneath the dirty denim skirt he put his glass down and lurched toward her baby lets do it here before we leave sure tommy chrissie held up a hand and smiled but first we gotta take care of that hole in your gut tom looked at his left side and saw that it was wet with blood to the middle of his thigh sit here and ill patch you up chrissie pulled out the chair from behind the desk he did as requested chrissie pulled the shirt away and dumped some tequila in the wound the pain knifed through his side like a sling blade burning through the last of the heroin in his system he struggled not to scream chrissie patted the wound dry with a paper napkin she found on the floor she fashioned a bandage out of toms handkerchief and fastened it over the injury with scotch tape the movement and activity were agony and made tom nauseous he burped and tasted alcohol and cigarettes he wanted to nail chrissie but it hurt too much finally she was finished she fixed another hit of ice and held the pipe to his mouth he took a couple of puffs and felt the vigor return though not as strong as last time it hurts he said i know baby chrissie got out the spoon and dumped a thumbnail portion of heroin in it after a moments hesitation she added a little more using toms lighter she heated the drug until it was liquid then drew it into a syringe here you go tommy thisll make everything better she took his arm and injected the full load hed never felt anything like it in his life the alcohol speed and heroin combined to make him alert but nearly unable to move not like he cared to go anywhere he was warm and comfortable in the padded leather chair glowing with confidence and power and euphoria after a while he was vaguely aware of chrissie carrying the duffel bags outside he kept his eyes open but didnt really see anything until the television set across the room turned on chrissie dropped the remote control on the desktop the noise startled him he blinked and found himself staring at the talking head on the big screen she was one of the anchors for the station in waco the one with the bad permed hair the image on the screen shimmered and became the parking lot by the brazos a shot of bijoux watsons jaguar and a pair of emts loading a body onto an ambulance that dissolved into a photograph of tom his wife and their children their christmas card from last year iii love you baby tom looked at chrissie standing in front of the desk with the keys to the chevy in her hand his voice was barely above a whisper she didnt reply her image grew hazy in the dull light of bijoux watsons office tom managed to turn his head back to the tv the cameras showed his house the flowers in the front beds he and his oldest son had planted last month his wife appeared onscreen mumbling to the reporters words too indistinct to comprehend tom knew he should be sad but wasnt his breathing became shallow but it didnt matter tom summoned what energy he could and forced his head to make the long slow turn back to where chrissie stood but she was gone mariah stewart havent we all dreamed about revenge at one time or another

that night i can see myself poised at that exact moment in time i watch the story unfoldits like watching a movie you knowand i wish to god i could relive that instant when i did the unthinkable i wait for that split second when i could change what happened when i could do what i should have done even if it killed me dying that night possibly as a hero sure beats the shit out of living with the memory of my cowardice it always starts at the same time and place and try though i might to make it turn out differently it never does i see it as it happened over and over and over i am driving jessie home in my carnot the one i have now but the one i had that night the streets are quiet its almost two in the morning and we both have a pretty decent buzz on from all the drinks wed had that night jessie in particular shed left her car at the lot rather than drive herself and i offered to drop her off since we lived in the same town though several blocks apart we knew each other casually the way you know someone who works where you work but whos never worked with you wed always been cordial to each other but never really had all that much to say maybe if shed worked there a little longer wed have been a little closer i dont know in any event she was in my car because shed had more to drink than i had and the consensus among our coworkers was that her judgment was more impaired than mine a lot they knew so anyway in my minds eye i see my car drifting slowly through the night almost like a leaf floating downstream taking the corners carefully pulling up in front of her place and putting the car in park do you need help i ask her want me to come up with you or wait while you get the door open jessie looks out the window to the front porch of the threestory victorian house there are three mailboxes alongside the front door one for each apartment i know that jessie lives alone on the second floor i follow her gaze and notice that one of the lights attached to either side of the front door is missing a bulb but i dont mention it im okay ill be fine jessie holds up her keys and gives them a little shake just peachy not to worry she opens the door and swings it wide unbuckles her seat belt and slides to the edge of the seat thanks for the ride preciate it she pushes herself out of the seat and bends down to face me see you tomorrow i can pick you up in the morning if you need a ride i tell her but shes already slammed the door and is making her way up the sidewalk more steady on her feet than i would have expected out of habit i lock the doors then reach into the backseat and grab my bag and pull it by the strap and yank it to me and some of the contents fall onto the floor behind me rather than take the time now to scoop them up i plop the bag onto the passenger seat where jessie had been sitting in this brief time shes made it up the steps of the house and is at the front door i put the car into drive and start to lift my foot from the brake when out of the corner of my eye i first notice the shadow moving along a line of trees to the left of the house i turn my head and there are several more creeping through the dark toward the porch and i blink not sure if ive seen anything at all but then there the shadows draw closer to the house like wolves stalking in the night my hand falls to the door handle and i start to open it when i realize one of the wolves has remembered that my car still sits in front of the house with the motor running he turns and eases across the lawn and through the windows our eyes meet his are feral and small and his nostrils are flared like the animal he reminds me of i look back at the house and see that jessie is now completely surrounded shes striking out at them and in the dim light of the one bulb thats still lit i see them laughing at her the one on the lawn stares me down defiantly and i am frozen with fear and this is the part that i wish i could change this is where i wish i could go back in time and do what i should have done but we know that there are no such second chances right whats done is done you cant change the pastany cliché would fit right about here so every time its the same as it was when i finally react it is with the greatest cowardice imaginable i hit the gas and drive away pretending i did not see leaving jessie to be plundered by the wolves i know what i should doi know i knowbut i am shaking all over im afraid to stop and get out of my car to look for my cell phone in the backseat where it fell when my bag overturned besides if i call they will wonder why i have permitted a friend to be dragged away by beasts without doing something screaming blowing the horn calling the police right then and there but my mouth is dustdry and my brain seems unable to form coherent thoughts my heart is pounding out of my chest and my skin has gone icy cold i am sweating and crying as i drive around wildly looking for a pay phoneif i call from my cell theyll know wont they that i left her knowing what was about to happen to her finally in desperation i drive to a market thats open all night and i find a phone and with trembling hands i dial i whisper the words into the receiver anonymously and hang up and slink back to my car my face flushed with shame i start off in the direction of my apartment they found her where those animals left her after theyd done things to her that no one wants to even know about for some reason known only to god she was still alive i went to see her in the hospital but i never wanted to never wanted to face her after what id done but driven by guilt and shame i had to and i did if i told you i didnt have nightmares after that id be lying and if i told you that i did not see the accusation the burning hatred in her eyes when i came into her room id be lying about that too so i did the only thing i could do i leaned over and whispered in her ear ill get them jessie i swear to you on my life i will get every one of them and i will make them pay i know she heard me but she never reacted the look in her eyes told me that the very least i should do for her was to bring down the men whod traumatized her to the extent that she lost her ability to speak i spent every week night and every weekend day at a firing range i shot handguns of every caliber and every weight until i could hit a target dead center with every shot and even then i practiced until i knew there was no way id miss once i aimed and fired finally i felt ready it took me three weeks to discover the name of one of her assailants but truthfully one was all i really needed and i found him in the damnedest place in our small local paper where he was identified as a person of interest in the robbery of a convenience store daniel montoya age twentyfour had a history of arrests including assault with a deadly weapon and domestic violence up until now his criminal activities had been confined to shelton the small factory town ten miles away what had brought him into our town that night i could only guess in my darkest moments i believed that he was put there to test me a test i failed miserably but studying his photograph i knew his eyes were the ones that had taunted me that night and just as surely i knew it was my destiny to hunt him down once i had his name i had him his neighborhood wasnt hard to findand it wasnt anything like mine thats for damned sure a few easy bucks on the street bought me everything i needed to know daniel was a pool junkie played every night at tommys pool and suds on east seventeenth street in shelton the bar closed at two and by twofifteen he was on his way to his wheels in the parking lot the last thing he expected was to find a woman leaning against his drivers side door did he think perhaps i was someone he knew someone whose face was obscured in the dim light of the parking lot whatever whoever he thought i might be he was smiling as he walked toward me hello daniel i said in my sexiest voice hello you he replied never breaking stride as he walked toward me hey montoya one of his buddies called from across the lot tomorrow hey right man daniel called back never taking his eyes from mine tomorrow we stood staring at each other listening as the other cars were started and driven from the lot so pretty lady whats happening he asked youre happening daniel do i know you you know a friend of mine i said my right arm folded across my waist my hand hidden by the loose jacket i wore whos your friend he stepped closer sensing an easy score jessica fielding my arm started its slow move from beneath the folds of the jacket doesnt ring a i could tell the exact moment that bell began to ring his stare froze his mouth half opened and his expression went from seductive to panic in the blink of an eye dont think i know her sorry in less than a heartbeat my trusty little friend was pressed up against his temple should i describe her to you daniel should i remind you of the last time you saw her i had straightened up and now had him backed up against his front fender he was silent trying frantically i believe to find a way out of this a way to disarm me he wanted to grab for the gun i could see that in his eyes but he wasnt sure of my strength or my reflexes so he like a wolf was gauging my movements biding his time when he could move in for the kill he opened his mouth to speak thinking to distract me dont say a word i dont ask you to say i hissed jamming the gun into the flesh on the side of his face im going to ask you a question and you are going to answer it no bullshit understand one question one answer or i will shoot you now right now sweat beaded on his forehead and i was certain he understood the name of the others who were with you when jessie fielding was raped i dont know you werent listening daniel i will repeat this only one more time i ask a question you give me an answer or i do you right now i was beginning to sweat a bit myself i wanted this over with one last chance daniel who was with you when jessie was raped some of the guys i didnt know then some of them you did give me a name i began counting backward from ten when i got to six he said antonio antonio jackson is he from around here sweating profusely now he nodded hes my cousin where can i find him he lives over on chester avenue thank you daniel i smiled and for a moment he seemed to relax then i pulled the trigger i watched his body jerk then slide sideways onto the ground then satisfied i walked into the shadows and through the alley that took me eventually to my car parked two blocks away i heard the sirens as i started my engine a few minutes later i pulled to the side of the road to allow the speeding patrol car to pass me that night i slept straight through until morning for the first time since the night that changed everything one down jessie i whispered in her ear the next night daniel montoya one down i left her sitting in her wheelchair her eyes still trained on something beyond the window that no one else could see thered been no change in her expression but i know shed heard and understood exactly what i said ten days later in the parking lot of yet another bar antonio jackson and i came facetoface it had been remarkably easy to get his attention anytime a tall wellbuilt blonde beckoned men like jackson lost all caution even after what had happened to his cousin daniel antonio apparently never considered the danger once he saw me perched on the hood of his car my long bare legs dangling off to one side one name i told him just give me one name hed hemmed and hawed as i pressed the barrel of the gun to his throat he stalled and he pleaded and he cried but in the end he gave me the one thing i wanted from him eddie taylor thank you antonio i pulled the trigger and he dropped like a stone antonio jackson i told jessie the next evening two down it took me almost three weeks to find eddie taylor because hed been in the county jail for possession and had only been back on the streets for less than fortyeight hours when we finally met like an avenging angel i stepped out from the alley as he walked in i knew i had the right guy id spent every one of those twenty days staring at his picture on my computer one name id said emboldened by my previous success thats all i want from you eddie just give me the name of one of the other guys hed swallowed hard and tears streamed down his face awwwwww i mocked him scared eddie did jessie cry when she realized what you were going to do to her did she cry when you raped her listen let me one name eddie when he didnt respond i once again started counting backward from ten id found that to be universally understood kelvin anderson thank you eddie i shot him through the heart three down i told jessie the next night eddie taylor obviously the police were not oblivious to the fact that several young men from the same general neighborhood had been taken out by the same shooterhello same gun which thank god wasnt registered anywhere id been careful in that regard even while i may have seemed careless in othersbut they didnt seem overly interested in investigating too deeply after all at one time or another theyd arrested daniel antonio and eddie i began to think of myself as performing a public service when i realized that the rap sheets of the three of them would have reached halfway to pittsburgh in my own way i was proud of myself i was taking the steps necessary to ensure that no one would ever go through what jessied endured as for my conscience well after the night that changed everything do you seriously think my conscience bothered me over ridding the world of a couple of predators a month later i found kelvin anderson and he kindly supplied me with the name of yet another wolf frankie eden and i had a têteàtête in the front seat of his car and later that same night i was able to confirm to jessie that the count was now four down and two to go frankie edens eyes told me he knew who i was why i was there and where his next stop through the cosmos was going to be he gave up the last two without flinching and of all of them i have to say that frankie was the only one who died like a man bernie gunther and dominic large werent as easy to track down but in the end although it took several months id eliminated every one of them after id taken out the last of the sixthat would have been berniei went back to my apartment and took a long hot shower i slept straight through until one the following afternoon which barely gave me enough time to do what i knew i had to do before evening came after id completed my errands i took another shower and blew out my hair so that it hung in long soft waves over my shoulders and down my back i hadnt realized it had gotten so long id been so focused on the task id set for myself that id barely looked at my reflection in the mirror anymore i was surprised to see how gaunt i looked how pale and thin id become which had i suppose prompted all those questions at work id been brushing off how are you are you feeling all right have you been ill yes ive been ill i wanted to say sick to death of myself i wanted to say no im fine really id smile and make an effort to put a little spring back into my step but soonprobably by this time tomorrow i thoughteveryone will know the nature of my malady i typed up the letter id composed sealed it and walked the seven blocks to the home of my parents my father would still be at work my mother had gone in to the city to have lunch with some friends and would have spent the rest of the afternoon shopping i owed them the truththey deserved the truthbut ever the coward i was grateful to god that i wouldnt be around to hear what any of them would have to say i could not have borne my mothers look of shock and horror my fathers cold stare of disbelief and disappointment i walked back home feeling just that much lighter that at least in this id done the right thing i needed to make certain that neither of my parents would think that in anyway this was their fault that theyd failed me in some way i needed them to understand that the guilt the shame the failure was all mine i loaded the handgun and tucked it into my bag i looked around my apartment for the last time my gaze lingering on those possessions that had once meant so much to me the antique tables my grandmother had given me the sofa id saved so long to buy the candlesticks my mom had given me when i moved in theyd been a wedding gift from an old friend of hers and shed never used them neither had i i sighed and closed the apartment door for the last time looking at the lovely millwork that surrounded it i decided to leave the door unlocked so that when they came to search my place they wouldnt have to damage anything to get inside the drive to the nursing home seemed endless that night for the first time ever every light i approached turned red as if some cosmic something was telling me to stop but it was far too late for that id done what i had to do and now i was going to let jessie do what she needed to do i passed an old cemetery and thought for the first time about where theyd lay me to rest would i be permitted to be buried in the family plot once they learned what id done again the only emotion i really felt was gratitude that i would not have to face their horrified eyes when the truth came out it was still early evening when i arrived at the nursing home so i parked my car near the butterfly garden that some local school kids had planted for the residents and turned off the engine knowing i would not be needing them again i left the keys under the drivers seat and sat quietly for a few moments taking deep breaths and holding them for as long as i could to calm myself after my nerves steadied i got out of the car taking my bag with its special cargo with me i took the long way to the building going through the garden and soaking up the scents and the colors did ones sensory memories go with them to the afterlife i wondered i went up the handicapped ramp because it took me past the birdbath where not surprisingly for that hour no birds were bathing but the little fountain there still trickled water and i loved the sound i went through the big double doors in the front of the building in an effort to hold on to the music of the fountain for as long as i could walking past the guard i smiled and waved they were all used to seeing me now and so there were no questions asked while i signed in everyone knew me as jessies devoted friend i headed toward the south wing and jessies room trying to conjure up the words to dont fear the reaper which to tell you the truth i didnt for me dying wasnt nearly as bad as living with what id done and what i was i went into jessies room and found her sitting in a chair near the window her untouched dinner tray on the foot of the bed i knew how she felt there were times when the horror of the night that changed everything came back full force and filled me so that the thought of eating made me physically sick jessie i said seating myself on the chair opposite hers its done now theyre all gone all six i opened my bag and felt the butt end of the old handgun all cool metal hardness my fingers wrapped around the handle and i drew it out i know youve wanted to do this since the night it happened i took her hands and placed the gun in them its all right i told her i deserve this everyone will know the truth now no one will blame you and after its done you can come back jessie you can come back into the world once im gone from it i sat directly in front of her my back straight my vision clear my conscience for once subdued i was ready jessies gaze dropped to the gun in her hand and she stared at it for a long time before looking up at me again the gun raised slowly the barrel aimed at nothing in particular i tapped my chest right where i felt my heart beating with my index finger and told her aim here im ready when you are i closed my eyes and waited for the end to come and waited curious i opened my eyes just as swiftly so swiftly before i could take a breath or utter a sound or reach out to stop her jessies wrists twisted and suddenly the gun was at her temple and the room reverberated with the single shot i stared in horror as jessie slumped forward before falling facefirst from the chair onto the floor red like a fluid carpet flowed around her as if to cushion her fall no i screamed as the room filled with people suddenly nurses orderlies visitors residents everyone whod been close enough to have heard the shot crowded into the room even before the realization of what shed done completely sunk in oh my god jessie one of the nurses said what have you done what indeed so there i wasobviously id brought her the gun with which shed killed herself which made me an accessory my panicked brain recognized immediately that one i was not dead and two id be charged with a crime but since i was alive and jessie was not at that point copping to a charge of accessory to murder was definitely more appealing than admitting what id really done the story id tell swirled through my head bits and pieces tripping over each other as i tried frantically to put one together and id come up with a pretty damned good one if i do say so myself jessie couldnt face another day living with the memory of what had happened to her she begged mebegged meto help her to end it as her friend as someone who loved her as the only person to whom shed speak how could i deny her that release who would doubt that story knowing what shed gone through i could get off with a light sentence i knew once i explained no one would ever need to know the truth right i was just starting to breathe a little easier when the door opened and my father walked in hed seen the story on tvwho in the tristate area had notand hed come down to the station but hed not come to comfort me or even to ask me why his gaze was just as cold as it had been when as a child id disappointed him in some fashion i wasnt surprised frankly that thered be no attempt at understanding there never had been in the past in his hands he held a blue envelope the same blue envelope id left in his mailbox earlier daddy i said ever the coward holding out my shaking hands silently pleading for him to give it to me but judge lucas bradleyjudge luke hang em high bradleyhanded the letter over to you i guess there were other instincts that were stronger in him other bonds harder to break than the one that existed between father and daughter signed this date deanna jean bradley when detective mallory russo finished reading the last page of the statement she held it up in one hand and said you havent signed it i will the young woman held out her hand for the pen the detective and the once promising assistant district attorney stared at each other from across the table you could have come to me dee mallory told her you could have given me the information and we could have gone after these guys it didnt have to be this way yes it did mallory and may i remind you that none of you were too interested in them even as i was picking them off the ada shifted in her seat besides everything that happenedit was all my fault it wasnt your fight theyre all my fights mallory told her weve known each other for years dee why couldnt you have trusted me to take them down deanna shrugged her eyes shifting to the twoway window on the opposite side of the room is he still there watching my father judge bradley left an hour ago mallory rested her arms on the table you know he could have burned my letter he could have kept it and held it over my head for the rest of my life deanna bradley continued to stare at the mirror i still cant believe he turned against me your father has an unswerving sense of justice mallory reminded her hes always going to follow his conscience so will i mal deanna sighed so will i david hewson david hewson knows where to find the perfect black rice in barcelona the richest coffee in venice and how to kill a person in a thousand gruesome ways his wonderful series set in rome featuring detective nic costa and his standalone thrillers share an authentic sense of place characters with rich lives that began long before you picked up the book and a relentless sense of pacing that pulls you into their world the circle is a perfectly symmetrical tale that shatters our comfortable isolation from current events through the eyes of a young pregnant woman we see the world from a new perspective as a train carries her from a state of innocence into a state of fear hold on tight because like it or not every one of us is already along for the ride the circle the tube line ran unseen beneath the bleak unfeeling city around and around day and night year after year under the wealthy mansions of kensington the snaking track rattled through cuttings and tunnels to the bustling mainline stations of paddington euston and kings cross where millions came and left london daily invisible to those below the earth then the trains traveled on to the poorer parts in the east aldgate with its tenements and teeming immigrant populations until the rails turned abruptly as if they could take the poverty no more and longed to return to the prosperous west to civilization and safety before the perpetual loop began again the circle melanie darma had traveled this way so often she sometimes imagined she was a part of it herself today she felt tired her head hurt as she slumped on the worn grubby seat in the noisy rattling carriage watching the station lights flash by the faces of the travelers come and go tower hill monument cannon street mansion housesomewhere to the south ran the thick murky waters of the thames she remembered sitting next to her father as a child bewildered in a shaking train from charing cross to waterloo a stretch that ran deep beneath the old gray river joking hed persuaded her to press her nose to the grimy windows to look for passing fish swimming in the blackness flashing by on another occasion when he was still as new to the city as she was in thrall to its excitement and possibilities theyd both got out at the station called temple hoping to see something magical and holy finding nothing but surly commuters and tangles of angry traffic belching smoke this was the city a thronging anonymous world of broken promises people millions of them whatever the time of day lately with her new condition they would watch on the train as she moved heavily clutching the swelling bundle in her belly most would stand aside and give her a seat a few would smile mothers mostly she thought some men in business suits people from the city stared away as if the obvious extent of her state and the apparent nearness of her release from it amounted to some kind of embarrassment to be avoided she could almost hear them prayingif its to happen please god let it not be this instant when ive a meeting scheduled a drink planned an assignation with a lover anytime but now she sat the way she had learned over the previous months both hands curved protectively around the bump in her fawn summer coat which was a little heavy for the weather bought cheaply at a street market to encompass her temporary bulk her fingers felt comfortable there nevertheless it was as if this was what they were made for so much of her life seemed to have been passed in these tunnels going to and fro she felt she could fix her position on the circles endless loop by the smell of the passengers as they entered the carriage sweet cloying perfume in the affluent west the sweat of workmen around kings cross the fragrant sometimes acrid odor of the indians and pakistanis from the sprawling struggling ethic communities of the east once shed visited the museum in covent garden to try to understand this hidden jugular that kept the city alive uncertainly at times as its age and frailty began to show melanie darma had gazed at the pictures of imperious victorian men in top hats and women in crinoline dresses all waiting patiently in neat lines for miniature trains with squat smokestacks and smiling crews it was the first underground railway ever built part of a lost and entirely dissimilar age when the london bombers struck in they chose the circle line as their principal target through accident she thought not from any conscious attempt to strike at history fourteen people died in two separate explosions the entire system was closed for almost a month forcing her to take buses watching those around her nervously glancing at anyone with dark skin and a backpack wondering she might have been on one of those two carriages had it not been for her fathers terminal sickness a cruel cancerous death eked out on a hard cheap bed in some cold public ward one more body to be rudely nursed toward its end by a society that no longer seemed to care birth death illness accidentsudden fleeting joy insidious lasting tragedyall these things lay in wait on the journey that was life with ambushes large and small waiting hidden in the wings sometimes as she sat on the train rattling through the black snaking hole in the dank london earth she imagined herself falling forward in some precipitous headlong descent toward an unknown endless abyss did the women in billowing crinoline dresses ever feel the same way she doubted it this was a modern affliction it had a modern cure too work necessity the daily need to earn sufficient money to pay the rent for another month praying the agency would find her some other temporary berth once the present ran out there were two more stops before westminster the station she had come to know so well set in the shadow of big ben and the grandiose imposing silhouette of the houses of parliament the train crashed into the darkness of the tunnel ahead the carriage shook so wildly the lights flickered and then disappeared altogether the movement and the sudden black gloom conspired to make the weight of her stomach seem so noticeable such a part of her she believed she felt a slow sluggish movement inside as if something were waking the fear that thought prompted dispatched a swift guilty shock of apprehension through her mind the thought this is real and will happen however much you may wish to avoid it finally the rolling careering carriage reconnected with whatever source of energy gave it light the carriage stabilized the bulbs flickered back to life on the opposite seat sat a young foreignlooking man who wore a dark polyester jacket and cheap jeans the kind of clothes the people from aldgate and beyond seemed to like he had a grubby red webbed rucksack next to him his hand on the top a possessive gesture though there was no one there who could possibly covet the thing he stared at her openly frankly with a familiarity she didnt appreciate his eyes were dark and deep his face cleanshaven smiling attractive the train lurched again the lights flashed off and on as they dashed downward once more the young man spoke softly as he gazed at her and it was difficult to hear over the crash of iron against iron still she thought she knew what he said and that was they will remember my name she tried to focus on the book in her hands it came from the staff library the palace of westminster didnt pay its workers well but at least they had access to decent reading are you scared the young traveler opposite asked pleasantly nodding at the bump beneath her hands it was a book on philosophy she chose it for the image on the cover ouroboros the serpent that devoured itself if she squinted hard she could imagine the familiar london transport poster with its yellow rounded rectangle for the circle line transposed in its place not at all she answered immediately without taking her attention off the page there was a paragraph from plato a description of ouroboros as the very first creature in the universe the beast from which everything sprang and to which everything returned she felt a little giddy when she realized the words of some ancient greek who had been dust when christ was born made some sense to her it was almost as if she could hear his ancient cracked voice the living being had no need of eyes when there was nothing remaining outside him to be seen nor of ears when there was nothing to be heard and there was no surrounding atmosphere to be breathed nor would there have been any use of organs by the help of which he might receive his food or get rid of what he had already digested since there was nothing which went from him or came into him for there was nothing beside him it was impossible to concentrate melanie darma didnt want to ask not really but she had to who will remember before he could answer they clattered into temple the bright station lights made her blink the doors opened a burly scarletfaced man in a creased grubby dark suit entered the carriage looked at their half then the other and sat down in the seats opposite her as far away from the young man with the rucksack as he could she could still smell the rank stink of beer though and why she wondered the newcomer grunted pulled out a copy of the standard thrust his coarse face into it then he raised his head and stared hard at both of them as if theyd broken some kind of rule by speaking to each other across the chasm of a tube train carriage strangers conversing beneath the streets of london on a breathless july day i dont know what you mean the young man answered quietly perhaps shed misheard the train was noisy she didnt feel well but now he had his hands curled round the rucksack the way hers fell in place about her stomach and his eyes wouldnt leave her document bag from work the green canvas carryall bearing the insignia of the palace of westminster a golden portcullis crowned with two chains it sat in the seat next to her looking important though in truth it contained nothing important the train lurched into darkness once more for several seconds this time she wondered whether someone had moved during that time but when the lights returned they were both in the same seats the older man facedeep in his paper the younger smiling a little vacantly glancing in her direction she thought of the offices and who would be there waiting it was temporary work six months no more until herconfinement as one of the older women put it temps didnt get maternity pay even when they were forced to go through interminable interviews and vetting processes just so they could answer irate emails to mps she never met the men and women there were for the most part kind in an officious offhand way each day she would nod and smile to the policemen on the door place her bag on the security machine to be scanned her id card against the entry system reader to be checked nothing ever changed nothing ever happened behind the imposing ornate doors of the palace of westminster beyond the gaze of the tourists who snapped and gawped at the great building that sat beneath the tower of big ben lay nothing more than the world writ small little people doing little jobs leading insignificant lives just looking like her to pay the bills no one ever asked who the father was she was a temp there was of course no point she leaned forward needing to ask him something i was wondering she began the man in the creased dark suit glared at her swore screwed up his paper and got to his feet her heart leapt in her chest her hands gripped the shape beneath her fingers more firmly it was the middle of the day violence on the tube at that hour was rare but not unknown dont do anything she heard herself murmur there was an exchange of intemperate words and the thickset man stomped off to sit in the far end of the carriage the train burst into embankment with a deafening clatter one more stop to go in her early days working at the houses of parliament she had sometimes abandoned the train here and walked the rest of the way along the embankment she enjoyed the view her left side to the river and the london eye on the opposite bank ahead the familiar outline of westminster bridge and the great iconic symbol of big ben beneath whichand this had long ceased to astonish hershe worked humbly tapping away at a computer there was no possibility that she could walk such a distance anymore she kept her eyes on the grimy carriage floor and said nothing else at westminster station she got up and left the train without looking at anyone the day seemed brighter than when she first went underground she glimpsed up at the impossibly tall clock tower to her right blinking at the nowfierce sky then patiently as she always did because that was how she was brought up she waited at the first pedestrian crossing until the figure of the green man came and it was safe to walk it was only a few hundred yards from the mouth of the tube station to the heavily guarded gate of the palace of westminster close to the foot of the tower the entrance she had to use as always there were police officers everywhere many carrying unsightly black automatic weapons in their arms cradling them as if they were precious toys no one looked at a pregnant young woman out on the street in london they were all too busy to notice such a mundane sight she walked over the final stretch of road when the last pelican crossing allowed wondering who would be on duty at the security post that day there was one nice police officer a friendly sergeant tall with close cropped gray hair perhaps forty or a fit fifty it was difficult to tell she knew his name kelly everyone else among the staff who scrutinized her bag and her id card from time to time asking pointless questions picking curiously at her belongings was still a stranger twenty yards from the high iron gates of the security entrance she turned and saw him the young man from the train had his rucksack high over his head he was running and screaming something in a language she didnt understand he looked both elated and scared there were policemen beginning to circle him fumbling at their weapons melanie darma watched all this as if it were a dream quite unreal a spectacle from some tv show that had perhaps been granted permission to film in the shadow of big ben though this was she felt sure improbable she walked on and found herself facing the tower of big ben again kellysergeant kelly she corrected herselfwas there yelling at her he didnt have a weapon he never carried one he was too nice for that she thought and wondered why at that moment she chose quite consciously not to listen to his hoarse anxious voice melanie the bright angry sky shook the horizon began to fall sideways she found herself thrust forcefully to one side and felt her hands grip the shoulder bag with the golden portcullis close to her out of habit not fear since all it contained was the book on ouroboros a few bills a purse containing and a few coins falling she clutched the canvas to herself defending the tender swell at her stomach as she tumbled toward the hard london stone two strong arms were attempting to knock her down to the ground she broke the fall with one knee and felt his chin jab hard against her skull as the jolt took him by surprise her stockinged skin grazed against the paving she felt a familiar stabbing pain from childhood loose flesh damaged by grit tears pricked at her eyes she was in someones arms and she knew immediately whose she couldnt see him but he was still on her tight arm around her throat when she looked up three men in black uniforms circled them weapons to their shoulders eyes fixed on a target that was she understood as much her as it was him halfcrouched and gasping for breath she could see the iron security gates were just a few short steps away security a safe private world guarded so carefully against violent young men carrying mysterious rucksacks someone came into view face in darkness initially since she was now in the shadow cast by the gigantic clock tower and the day seemed suddenly almost as dark as the mouth of the tube from which she had so recently emerged dont shoot me she said quietly and realized there were tears in her eyes dont her hands stayed where they were on her stomach somehow she couldnt say the words she wanted them to hear dont shoot us the grip on her neck relaxed just a little she caught the eyes of the man in front of her sergeant kellyshe had never known his second name and feared now she never wouldhad his hands out in front showing they were empty his face was calm and kind unflustered that of a gentle man she thought one for whom violence was distasteful it doesnt need to end this way he pleaded quietly what way the voice behind her demanded badly the policeman said and moved forward so that they could see his eyes let the young lady get to her feet cant you see shes hurt laughter from an unseen mouth his breath hot against her scalp she found the courage to look the old red rucksack was high in the air from its dirtstained base ran a slender black cord dangling down toward the arm that gripped her tight in his fingers lay some small object like a television remote control she couldnt count the black shapes gathering behind sergeant kelly they wore heavy bulletproof vests and soft caps black ugly weapons stood in their arms tight to the shoulder the barrels nodding up and down like the snouts of beasts sniffing for prey shes pregnant the sergeant went on you see that cant you the unseen man sighed softly a note perhaps of hesitation she felt there was some flicker of hope reflected in sergeant kellys eyes get up the foreign voice ordered she stumbled to her feet her knee hurt her entire body seemed racked by some strange unfamiliar yet not unwanted pain her captors young face was now just visible he was looking toward the tower of big ben were going in there he insisted nodding toward the black iron security gates if you try to stop meshes dead he nodded at the armed officers circling them them or me whats the difference she wondered how long the men with guns would wait whether they were already gauging how wide to make the arc of their circle so that they might shoot safely in order to guarantee a kill yet not be subject to their own deadly fire when the moment came it will be soonshe thought and found her hands returning to her belly as if her fingers might protect what was there against the hot rain of gunfire someone thrust aside the barrel of the closest weapon it was the sergeant again swearing furiously not at her assailant but at the officers with guns harsh words harsher than shed ever heard him speak before there are choices sergeant kelly insisted as he pushed them back hands high empty face still calm determined he wheeled around to confront the man who held her choices the policeman repeated quietly shes pregnant isnt there he shook his head struggling to locate the right words some rule that says its wrong to kill an unborn child sergeant kelly shrugged for me there is and i dont believe in anything much except what i can see and touch if you believe his right hand swept briefly toward the sky something isnt it the same you are not my preacher policeman the voice behind her spat at him no sergeant kelly was so close that she could feel the warmth of his breath on her face and it smelled of peppermints and stale tobacco im no ones priest but tell me this what will your god say of a man who knowingly takes the life of an unborn child he leaned forward bending his head to one said as if listening curiously will he be pleased or a stream of angry foreign words filled the air the london policeman stood there his hand out beckoning she doesnt belong here he said let her go with me after that he shrugged youand they the way he nodded at the others the men with the guns shocked her it was as if there was no difference between them and the one who had snatched her out in the bright stifling day in parliament square you can do what the hell you like silence followed by the distant caterwauling of sirens this was she knew the moment i beg you melanie darma murmured not knowing to whom she spoke the grip on her neck relaxed a choking sob rose in her throat she stumbled forward out of the young mans grip still clutching the bag with the portcullis logo close to her stomach quickly the policeman ordered beckoning she lurched forward slipped her knee went to the ground once more the pain made her shriek made her eyes turn blurry with tears one set of arms released her another took their place she was in the grip of sergeant kelly and the smells of peppermint and tobacco were now secondary to the stink of nervous sweat hers or his she didnt know and didnt care she fell against him his arms slipped beneath hers pulling dragging demanding they were close to the gate she found herself falling again turning her head around she had to it was impossible to stop the young man from the tube had his hands in the air he was shouting words she couldnt understand foreign incomprehensible words a lilting chant that seemed to veer between anger and fear imprecation and beseechment melanie the police sergeant muttered as he pulled her away dont lookdont it was futile no one could not watch a scene like this it was a kind of theater a staging a play in real life performed on a dirty stone stage in the heart of london for all to see not far away there were men with cameras people holding cell phones recording everything not running they way they should have been that puzzled her she fell to one knee again and felt glad the pain made her wake made her pay more attention the darks shapes with the rifles were around him again more close this time screaming obscenities and orders in equal measures yet his eyes were on the sky on something unseen and unseeable the rucksack flew from his hand the ugly black metal creatures burst into life in the arms of their owners and began to leap and squeal she watched the young man she had spoken to on the tube twitch and shriek at the impact dancing to their rhythm as if performing some deadly tarantella his bag tumbled through the air falling to the ground the wire that linked device to owner flailing powerlessly like a snapped and useless tendon that part of the performance was over it was the dance now nothing but the dance sergeant kelly didnt drag her at that moment like melanie darma he realized the bomb or whatever it was had refused to play its part like her he could only watch in shock and terrified wonder she closed her eyes gripping her stomach firmly intent on ensuring everything there was normal as it ought to be as she half knelt there feeling the policemans strong arms on her shoulder she was aware of two thin lines of tears trickling slowly down her face and something else melanie sergeant kelly murmured looking scared she looked at him there was worry concern in his face and it was more personal now more direct than such a vague and ephemeral threat as explosives in a young mans bag following the line of his gaze she saw what he did blood on the pavement not that of the man from the tube hers a line of dark thick liquid gathering around her grazed knee pooling as it trickled down her leg the wailing of sirens grew louder vans and police cars seemed to be descending upon them from every direction men were shouting screaming at one another a couple were bent down over the broken body leaking onto the ground a few yards away before she could say another thing he bent down looked in her face breathed deeply then scooped her up in his strong certain arms theres a nurse inside sergeant kelly muttered a little short of breath as he carried her through the security gate past the door and the gawping wideeyed officers next to their untended machines and on into the cool dusty darkness of the houses of parliament she knew the medical room could picture it as he half stumbled half ran along the narrow corridors in the very foot of the tower a clean and windowless cubicle with a single medic in attendance always twice shed stopped by for advice for support only to be told to see her own doctor instead of troubling the private resources of the palace of westminster except in emergencies sergeant kelly turned down the final passageway one that led into the very core of the building the stonework was so massive here it scared her trapped beneath several hundred feet and untold tons of grimy london stone an insignificant creature like some tiny insect in the bowels of a towering anthill she felt herself carried into the brightly lit room lifted onto a bed there placed like a specimen to be examined it was the same nurse thickset ugly fierce the place smelled of drugs and chemicals the lights were too bright the walls so thick she couldnt hear a note of the chaos that must have ensued outside the nurse took one look at the drying stain on her ankle and asked when are you due next week her flabby face contorted in a scowl and youre coming to work good godlets take a look she was reaching for a pair of scissors casually with no panic no rush it was as if life and death cohabited happily in this place one passing responsibility to the other the way day faded into night he was still there as the woman came toward the hem of her dress with the sharp shiny instrument staring at the palace of westminster bag that she continued to clutch tight against the bump as if it still needed protection you dont need that anymore sergeant kelly said halfamused reaching down for the carryall in her hands she let go and released it into his grip the nurse advanced again with the scissors aiming at her dress sergeant melanie darma objected suddenly anxious im a london copper love he answered laughing a little theres nothing i havent seen i dont want you to see me she told him firmly the nurse gave him a fierce stare sergeant kelly sighed held the bag up for her to see and said ill look after your things outside as he opened the door the faint wail of sirens scuttled inside then died as he closed it again it wasnt like an anthill she thought more akin to being in the foundations of a cathedral feeling the weight of ages the massive load of centuries of tradition of a civilization that had at one time dominated the known world bearing down on her remorselessly the doctor might be a man love the nurse said as she cut the fabric of the cheap dress in two all the way up to the waist then she stepped back eyes wide with surprise unable to speak it was all there the plastic bag with the fake blood and the telltale path it had left down the side of her leg after she burst it with her fingers and the bulge the hump the being she had brought to life daybyday out of stockings and underclothes napkins and tea towels until that very morning the morning when something else took its place she knew the wires every one because hed told her about each as he placed them there around the soft fat wad of material theyd given him the night before there was she wanted to tell the nurse no other way to penetrate this old and wellprotected inner sanctum of a world she had come to hate no other means to escape the attention of the electric devices the sniffers the security people prying into everything that came and went in this great palace a place that meant so much to so many im sorry she murmured reaching for the band of yellow cable taking the tail to the mouth as shed learned and practiced so many times in her small fusty bedroom of the apartment she could barely afford the foreign phrase he taught her wouldnt come they were in any case his words not hers codes from a set of beliefs she did not share what she did know was the circle it seemed to have been with her forever since the moment she first set foot in the dark world beneath the ground hand in hand with her father as he took the first step on the journey to his bleak cruel end by accident she had woken the slumbering beast one cold morning when she first met ahmed on the stairs a weak impressionable creature defined by nothing but his aimless anger he was its slave too not that he ever knew her mind could not dismiss the image of ouroboros at that moment the picture of the serpent devouring itself or the words of the book that was now in the hands of sergeant kelly who was perhaps a little way away outside even eyeing the shattered body in the street the living being had no need of eyes when there was nothing remaining outside him to be seen nor of ears when there was nothing to be heard and there was no surrounding atmosphere to be breathed and all that he did or suffered took place in and by himself from nothing to nothing round and round with unwavering hands melanie darma held the wires above her belly like a halo bringing together the ends with a firm and deliberate motion and as she did so she was filled with the deepest elation that this particular journey was at an end r l stine r l stines story roomful of witnesses clearly demonstrates that while truth isnt always stranger than fiction the strangest fiction always contains a kernel of truth based on a real place this twisted tale could only have been written by r l stine and reveals his wonderfully offkilter look at the world best known for the nearly three hundred million childrens books sold he has an uncanny ability to write pulsepounding stories that keep you turning the pages without ever losing that childlike obsession with the gory details why do so many kids love everything this man writes turn the page and find out roomful of witnesses what happened to leon is a dirty shame i never liked the guy ill admit that i thought he was lower than a squirrel beneath a truck tire bad blood between us maybe but no one can pin this thing on me no way i didnt do itand ive got a roomful of witnesses you heard me right a roomful of witnesses the day didnt start too bad yeah i woke up in the staff bungalow with the same joy aches and pains in all the usual places and a wet hacking cough to remind me i was down to my last pack of smokes what else is new the sheets on my cot were damp from night sweat i stood up and stretched no bones cracking or creaking hell im only thirtyeight i know my hair is a little thin in front and my cheeks have crisscross lines in them charlene says i have old mans eyes well what do you expect no one ever built a haven for wayne mullet the top dresser drawer stuck again and i tugged it so hard i pulled something in my right shoulder groan the louisiana humidity doesnt agree with furniture at least not the cheap piney stuff they bought for our rooms i rubbed the soreness from my shoulder coughed up something nasty and blew it out the window then i pulled on the uniform baggy green cotton pants and lab coat white rubbersoled shoes ha they make the staff dress like doctors which always gives me a chuckle wayne your momma would be so proud i crossed the back lawn to the kitchen a promising day morning clouds shielding the sun although the back of my neck was prickling by the time i reached the big house and what were those bugs so many of them swirling in such a tight circle they formed a dark pillar reaching high above my head and im sixthree leon maloney is superstitious as all getout i hoped he didnt see this bug thing hed probably say it was an omen leon is always running on and on about omens sometimes i have to show him the back of my hand to make him stop he told me his momma had some kind of fortuneteller booth at the back of a saloon in the french quarter and she taught him everything you need to know about omens and bad luck he says she never taught him anything about good luck yeah leon can be a bitter dude why cant he just keep it to himself okay hes had some real bad luck i mean last year for example one of the old guys pulled out leons left eyeand leon was just trying to serve him some goddamn soup i had to slap a few bugs off my face as i pulled open the screen door and stepped into the kitchen some kinda swamp flies i guess dont know how they got way out here in the woods think maybe they flew wayne i like to give myself a hard time keeps me sharp you know but dont you try it yeah you might say im a little touchy momma used to say id snap at a gator if i had more teeth hey i grew up on the bayous and i got swamp water in place of blood and i saw a lot of things pulled up from the brown water a kid probably shouldnt see well why get started on that speaking of brown water the coffee smelled good and they had egg sandwiches this morning on toasted english muffins and the bacon wasnt burned as usual so how bad could things be leon was already finishing up he raised his head from his grits bowl and flashed me a goodmorning scowl leon has long wavy blond hair hes into metal music and ive seen him go nuts on air guitar making his hair fly around til he was red in the face he says he could be an allman brother if theyd let him in the family some kinda joke right i never know with leon its hard to read a guy with only one eye what a loser dr nell made him promise to stop blasting his music in the staff dorm because it got the old folks all riled leon nodded his head and agreed but i saw that twitch in his stubbly cheek that meant he was angry i wouldnt want to cross leon hes quiet and goes about his business taking care of the retired folks here but once when he had a big knife and was slicing up the fruit salad for lunch he told me he cut someone once cut them pretty good and didnt feel bad about it afterward he was holding the knife in front of him and had this weird smile on his face after he told me and i think he meant it as some kind of warning or threat leon and i had some runins back in the day when we were guests ourselves guests of the louisiana state prison system thats when i learned to keep an eye on him i mean two eyes ha ha anyway i finished breakfast drained the coffee cup and crushed it in my hand leon had a stain on the front of his lab coat but i wasnt gonna be the one to tell him about it i followed him to the kitchen to start making the breakfast for our guests we got two hundred old guys living here so that meant two hundred fruit smoothies just for starters leon and i are slicing and dicing the fruit and jamming it all into the smoothie machine and im filling up glasses we staff guys get paper cups but the guests get glass of course and charlene fowler comes in all red lipstick and that bleachblond hair glowing under the fluorescents green eyes wrinkled into smiles shes not in uniform instead a magenta midriff top and white short shorts with enough skin showing to let everyone see her flower tattoos she breathes on me and rubs one long purple fingernail down my cheek all flirty or you might say slutty like the two of us are something only were not i know shes banged leon more than once im sure but shes always coming on to me too just to cause trouble and make things even more tense between us ill give her this shes a sexy thing especially for this place leon told me to stay away from her once but he didnt want to fight me he said it kinda quiet and didnt look me in the eye we both know we gotta be careful dr nell always has her eye on us and we want to keep these jobs like i said we both did time in the prison on the other side of the woods from here those stone walls poking up from the trees are a close reminder we know weve got it good here at the haven charlene stays in my face her perfume smells like oranges or maybe its the fruit im putting in the smoothies did you forget everyone is leaving this morning she says all breathy like shes saying something dirty you two boys are on your own i shrug my shoulder still aches from the dresser drawer we can handle it charlene leon chuckles you never know whats gonna strike him funny dr nell says dont forget ida is still getting the antibiotics charlene says and no snack bars for wally hes put on some pounds she says to keep your cells on shell check in from town charlene gives us this devilish grin it fits her face fine guess dr nell doesnt trust you boys leon raises his eye from the bananas hes slicing you trust me dont you char about as far as i can throw you why dont you stop rubbing your tits against him leon says his voice suddenly as hard as hickory come over here and give me some sugar charlene sticks her head out like she wants to get it chopped off and the green eyes sparkle why dont you make me leon doesnt give charlene any warning he grabs her by the neck the way youd choke a chicken pulls her over to him and pushes his mouth against hers charlene starts to struggle and spit and i dont think i mean i shoulda just stood there and let em work it out instead i lose it i grab leon s arm lower my shoulder and bump him away from her that surprised even me what did that mean that i wanted charlene or i just wanted an excuse to fight leon no time to think about it leon lets out a roar like some kind of swamp creature he tackles me to the floor and before i can catch my breath were wrestling and rolling around on all the fruit peelings and garbage hes sitting on top of me doing a little jackhammer action with both fists to my ribs powerful for a little guy im not surprised and those bony hands hurt luckily charlene is no shrimp somehow she manages to pull him off me and step between us im on my back massaging the ribs leon jumps to his feet like a cat ready to spring but then i see his shoulders sag he looks away and i know hes thinking what im thinking weve gotta back off here and be cool our jobs aint the greatest but theyre all we got i stand up and raise both hands like truce man leon nods and backs up to the kitchen counter i turn and see this grin on charlenes face and her eyes are still sparkling like excited oh my she says in a girlie voice did i cause that she even giggles was that really over me just kidding around i mutter we were just waking ourselves up leon says stretching do i have to tell dr nell about this charlene asks teasing i sure hope you boys can be trusted on your own she doesnt wait for an answer shes out the kitchen door and about a minute later i hear the staff jeeps crunching down the gravel drive which means leon and i are all alone in charge of two hundred residents we can work together no biggie most of the old folks here at the home are pretty nice and dont give us much grief ida is my favorite poor things been sick usually shes as flirty as charlene the old thing likes to grab me by the ears pull my head down and smooch me on the lips but the last few days shes been lying around moaning acting pitiful as an old hound dog leon and i brought out the smoothies on a tray and began passing them out around the front room a couple old dudes were glued to the tv already they sure love those cartoons the louder the better i handed frankie his glass he raised his gnarly hands and signed thank you i signed your welcome how are you today his fingers moved slowly i feel a little old leon makes fun of me for talking to the guests but almost all of them can talk really well and i dont see any reason not to chat with em a bit they always like it frankie taps my shoulder and signs cookie cookie i laugh and sign back later frankie is one of the oldest guests and the least trouble he used to work in some kind of science lab in texas his pal frannie worked in the same lab next upour least favorite dudes sweeny and bo these two guys were in show business big deal right but they act as if they own the place try to cross them andwell that son of a bitch sweeny bit me twice believe it theyre nasty and badtempered and are always getting the other guests all riled talk about bad news the only time their eyes light up is when theyre causing trouble leon and i each had one smoothie left on our trays sweenys and bos hands shot out theyre grabby as weasels in a chicken shack i started to hand sweeny his drinkthen pulled it back hey sweeny watch this dude i said i tilted the glass to my mouth and drank it down i wiped juice off my mouth with the back of my hand mmmmmm that was good man leon laughed were in charge today guys he said no one to give you bad boys a break boo hoo he copied me gulped bos smoothie down in front of the old guy then licked his lips sweeny and bo looked at each other like they didnt believe it then bo pointed at us and rubbed his two pointer fingers against each other shame shame thats what that means when they rub their pointers back and forth its not your day i told them everyone went to town to celebrate a birthday know what that means leon and i get a little payback time then leon went too far as usual he gave bo a little slap across the face not a hard slap but it seemed to stun him leon laughed think you havent been asking for it again i couldnt just stand there i pulled his arm back careful leon dont hurt em he snickered what are they gonna do about it leon raised his hand and gave sweeny a slap it made a loud smack and the old guys head snapped back this wasnt good leon and i have been working here ever since we got out of the can six or seven months taking care of these guys so far wed done okay i didnt like these dudes any more than leon did but why look for trouble now leon gave sweeny a slap on the cheek hows that feel buddy sweeny lowered his head sadly and rubbed his fingers together shame shame leon laughed and raised his hand to give bo another face slap leon youd better not i started but i didnt get to finish my sentence cuz bo grabbed leon s arm up by the shoulderand yanked him off his feet i let out a cry as he whipped leon over his head and sent him sailing into the wall leon groaned as his body slammed hard into the wall the whole house seemed to shake and a stack of dvds toppled off their shelf onto the floor leon climbed up slowly looking kind of green and before he could catch his breath sweeny jumped off his bench shot forward and headbutted leon in the gut leon went ooof just like in the cartoons and his face turned from green to blue breath knocked out definitely these old chimpanzees weigh about pounds theyre over five feet tall you know and adult chimps are several times stronger than humans theyre big and ugly and dangerous which is why people send them here to the haven theyre only cute til theyre six or so then they turn into big hairy monsters i guess it was some lamebrain in washington who had the idea to open a retirement home for chimpanzees back in the louisiana woods when we heard about it in the prison we laughed at first then we started to get angry thinking about these chimps living in luxury with their dvds and widescreen tvs their playrooms three meals a day served to them on trays in their puffy armchairs and five acres of woods to play in behind their house that made us angry when we looked around at what we had the ugly old chimps were living high on the hog all right and every day we got the slops did leon and i have a chip on our shoulders when we started working here like i said we just needed jobs but now some bad feelings were out in the open and we had to tie things up and push em all back like trying to get toothpaste back in the tube leon was still kinda purple wheezing and holding his chest i had to deal with these monkeys i stepped forward thinking hard trying to look tough but what looks tough to a monkey bo glared at me a big toothy grin on his ugly face waiting for me to make a move i guess or planning his next one behind us the other chimps were going nuts leaping up and down screeching and howling heaving their smoothie glasses at each other i saw frankiegood old frankiecrouch down and take a big dump on the living room floor guess he was upset pretty soon i knew the shit would be flying holding his stomach leon pulled himself to a sitting position he was moaning and groaning you wouldnt like it either if a pound monkey took a dive into your belly wayne we gotta get help he choked out cant let this getout of control we had an agreement with the prison it was in our rule book call em up in an emergency and theyll send the guards running but i knew those dudes believe me i knew them too well theyd come shooting like it was the first day of deer season i dont know about you but i always think its good to avoid a bloodbath before lunch if you can we can control em leon i said i started to tug him to his feet he groaned again rubbing his middle i had him standing up teetering a little when i saw bo and sweeny leap out the open window one followed the other and they didnt look back no we dont have bars on the windows cuz this isnt a cage remember its a haven besides what chimp in his right mind would ever leave a cushy setup like this ohmigod ohmigod leon kept slapping his forehead and staring at the window ill kill em ill kill the both of em bad attitude i was about to tell leon that his bad attitude got us in this mess to begin with for a moment i couldnt decide whether to start packing my suitcase or go after the two fugitives but im a hopeful kinda guy and i really wanted to stick around so i motioned for leon to follow me we can bring em back they re probably waiting for us in the garden leon glanced all around crazily i dont know what he was looking for a weapon then he narrowed his eye like he was trying to focus on the situation in hand and he followed me out the front door the screen door slammed behind us sounded like a gun going off and i jumped i took a breath and told myself to cool out because i had to be the thinking one the heat hit us like a tidal wave and i felt the first trickle of sweat at the back of my neck the air felt thick and steamy they aint waiting in the garden leon said there they go i pointed just as the two chimps disappeared into a stand of red mangrove trees leon and i took off jogging after them we ran right through the whirring column of buzzing swamp flies and kept going i could hear the two chimps chittering to each other all excited like i knew thatd make it easy to follow them one small break wait leon said pulling back on my shoulder we need something like what i said he didnt answer ducked into the little white garden shed i heard him banging around in there leon theyre getting away i shouted if we lose their trail leon came running out carrying a longhandled shovel in front of him like a spear whats that for i asked convincing them leon said i sighed we have to bring em back in good shape leon no bruises or nothing so dr nell and the others cant tell anything went on first weve gotta bring em back leon said he swung the shovel head to part the tall grass and we stepped into the shade of the trees i couldnt see them but i could hear sweeny and bo clucking to each other somewhere up ahead leon led the way over the snaky mangrove roots and through the tangles of tree trunks and low limbs i decided to try a simple approach i called to them hey sweeny bo come back here that didnt work i shouted their names some more but i could just as well have been shouting at the birds in the trees i swatted a fat mosquito off my forehead leon s face was red his blond hair was matted wetly to his head he carried the shovel on one shoulder now like a soldier marching to battle the shovel head kept rattling low tree limbs but he didnt seem to notice theyre heading to the ravine he said he spit angrily thats bad i replied they could get caught in the leaf bed at the bottom of the ravine the dead leaves from cedar elms are piled five or six feet high it was just a natural pit not manmade or anything even if it didnt bury them it would make it almost impossible to pull the two big jerks out gotta catch em before they get stuck in there i said i ducked my head under a low vine pushed between some palmetto palms tilting as if they were windblown and started to trot faster leon was breathing hard i could see he was having trouble keeping up dude kept groaning and rubbing his sore belly as he tried to run we ran into a circle of cedar elms a small clearing with tall grass in the middle three scrawny brown rabbits hightailed it over the grass in different directions i stopped because i realized i didnt hear sweeny and bo anymore i listened i could hear tree frogs all around in the high limbs no chimp sounds did they already bury themselves in the ravine not too likely it was still pretty far up ahead leon leaned on the shovel breathing hard his shirt was stuck to his body soaking wet which way he muttered wiping his forehead with his sleeve he stared into the trees straight ahead maybe i said pointing i shook my head we came this far we cant lose them we just cant sure i sounded desperate but i didnt care i was thinking about consequences losing our jobs was one thing but what if the big chimps escaped and got messing with people and hurt somebody or did some real damage that could be major consequences for me right i heard a low growl close behind me and then a grunt i turned and saw two pairs of dark eyes glowing in the shade of some cedar elms another growl like a warning two lumbering figures stepped slowly into the clearing its them i murmured look leon they made a circle and theyre creeping up behind us the two chimps stepped forward hunkered low tall grass up to their knees they pointed at us snarling pulling back their lips and showing us their big teeth i took a step back leon raised the shovel but he took a step back too sweeny bo lets go back i shouted they kept their teeth bared they lumbered forward one step at a time i felt a chill run down my spine leon i said softly see whats going down here theyre stalking us he tightened his grip on the shovel handle he held it in front of him with both hands his teeth were gritted his cheeks were twitching i knew what leon had in mind stand our ground and fight it out with them but that wasnt my idea try to fight two angry pound beasts id give us better odds at wrestling a cottonmouth follow me leon i said let em chase us let em chase us right back to the house he squinted at me huh just keep backing up i said stay with me act like youre afraid start backing up we can lead them right back to where we want them it sounds crazy but thats what we did we backed over the grass and into the trees retracing our steps and the growling monkeys stalked us keeping their distance but coming slowly and steadily letting us know this wasnt going to end in a friendly way my only question was when were they going to make their jump at us if they decided to take it to us before we reached the yard leon and i could be chimp meat in seconds so leon and i backed our way through the trees i cant speak for leon but ill confess i never was so scared in my life if you could see the anger boiling off those monkeys faces youd know why and i can tell you how happy i was to see the house and the front yard come up behind us almost there now what leon demanded how do we get em in the house i have an idea i said can you keep em busy he spit on the grass you being funny the chimps backed leon toward the front wall of the house he raised the shovel holding it against him like a shield through the window i could hear the chimps inside chittering and wailing and screeching and carrying on like holy hell deal with that later wayne i told myself first get our two runaways safely inside i thought i knew what might pull sweeny and bo in breakfast i ran down the hall past the front room i ignored the screams and hollering of the rioting chimps i knew leon and me could get em soothed once we got in into the kitchen still a mess from breakfast of course when did leon and i have time to clean up i fumbled in the fruit bin til i found what i wanted i pulled two bananas from the bunch and holding one in each hand went running back to the front i held the bananas out the screen door the chimps were closing in on leon bumping up and down on their haunches like movie chimps ready to make their attack leon get inside i said he slid along the wall till he came to the door then practically dove into the house i held open the screen door with my hips and raised the bananas come and get it dudes breakfast a special breakfast for my favorite buddies the chimps stopped hopping and stared at the bananas like they were actually thinking about what was the best thing to do come on i urged waving the bananas at them come onpleaseplease is it working leon called from behind me in the hall think so i said im gonna beat em to death when they get in here leon said he clanged the shovel head on the floor no youre not i said softly no more talk like that i mean it leon were gonna keep our jobs and were going to forget this ever happened leon stepped up beside me i dont believe in forgetting he said i waved the bananas the chimps finally took the bait they stepped toward the door reaching out their arms i pulled back a step the chimps followed back a step into the hall yes sweeny and bo stepped in through the door yes into the front room the other chimps fell silent as if stunned to see their pals again yesyeswelcome back come on boys here are your lovely bananas sweeny took his banana he examined it like hed never seen one before then he raised it high over his headand with a real powerful thrust jammed it deep into leon s good eye leon staggered back his hands shot up to his face he didnt make a sound at first then he began to howl like a swamp dog caught in a gator trap he dropped to his knees he gripped the banana in both hands and pulledand the eye came out with it i guess i froze or something it was just so sick i dont know if i could have done anything about it or not but i didnt i just stood there with my mouth hanging open as bo took the shovel pulled way back on it and slammed the back of the blade into the side of leon s head i heard a crack and saw leon s neck snap back leon made a sound like a hiccup then red stuff started to pour out of the side of his face like what happens when you squeeze a tomato leon folded up and dropped onto his side on the floor all bent and twisted blood puddling under his head i knelt down beside him shook him a bit but it didnt take long to see he was dead was i next struggling to breathe i jumped to my feet before i could back away bo handed me the shovel oh thank god i thought but i didnt have much time to feel relieved cuz the screen door flew open and in came charlene followed by dr nell and a bunch of other staff workers charlenes eyes went to the floor and she saw leon and all the blood and his messedup face then she let out a scream that hurt my ears oh no oh no i had a feeling i shouldnt leave you two on your own i saw what dr nell was staring at the bloodstained shovel in my hand now wait i said i didnt do it really it wasnt me i got a roomful of witnesses i waved my hand around the room i gestured to all the chimps that sat there watching the whole thing i didnt do it i said ive got a roomful of witnesses the chimps stared at me you guys can all talk i said i know you can tell dr nell what happened here the chimps stared at me they didnt move they didnt even blink i turned to bo and sweeny tell em i said tell em the truth tell em who did this come ontalk bo and sweeny lowered their eyes to the floor like they were sad then they pointed their fingers at me and began to rub their pointer fingers together back and forth phillip margolin the house on pine terrace shows why every one of phillip margolins books has hit the new

phillips many interesting jobs over the yearsa teacher in the bronx peace corps volunteer in liberia criminal defense attorneyhave clearly provided remarkable insight into how ordinary people react to extraordinary circumstances this is no more evident than in the house on pine terrace where every character seems to do the unexpected and yet it all makes perfect sense in the end the house on pine terrace there was an intercom attached to the icewhite wall and i used it to call up to the house on pine terrace the voice that answered was the voice on the phone he sounded just as pleasant now as he had then not uptight like i expected a john to be while we were talking i heard an electronic hum and the iron gate swung inward we broke off and i drove my ford along a winding drive past stands of palm trees the house was at the end of the drive my father left my mother when i was too young to remember him from a remark here and a remark there ive figured out that it was no big loss i do remember that we were always dirt poor mama was part of a crew that cleaned houses you dont get rich doing that but you do get to see how the other half lives a few times when she couldnt get anyone to watch me she risked getting fired by bringing me with her the only place she brought me that i remember clearly was the house on pine terrace when i was little mama called me princess she said someday i would marry a prince and live in a castle and be rich ive never been married im working on rich and this is the castle id live in if i had my way i dreamed about this house fantasized about it when i was alone and feeling lazy wished for it when i was younger and really believed i could do anything the house was so white the rays of the sun reflected off it it was long low modern and perched on a cliff with a view of the pacific that was so breathtaking youd never get tired of it there was a rollsroyce silver cloud parked near the front door farther down the drive was a sports car so expensive that someone in my tax bracket couldnt even identify it i looked at my ford thought about the small singles apartment i lived in and suddenly felt like a visitor from another planet what i saw when the front door opened confused me daniel emery iii was one of the handsomest men id ever seen he was sixone ortwo broadshouldered and tanned a warm brown color that made you think of tropical beaches he wore a yellow cashmere vnecked sweater and tight white jeans there were no gold chains diamond pinky rings or the other swinger jewelry turnoffs he was in other words the male equivalent of his dream house and i wondered what in the world a guy like this with a place like this wanted with a call girl youre tanya he asked using the phony name id given when he phoned in response to the ad in swingers weekly and you must be dan i answered pitching my voice low and sexy he nodded as he gave me the onceover i was sure he would like what he saw his smile confirmed my belief you certainly fit your description in the ad youre surprised a little i figured thered be a bit of puffing i smiled to show him that i appreciated the compliment can i get you a drink he asked no thanks i said starting to hate what i was going to do and we should get the business part out of the way so it wont interfere with your pleasure sure the money dan said one thousand in cash you said ive got it here he handed me an envelope and i thumbed through the ten crisp hundreddollar bills inside it one more thing i said what do you expect for this he looked puzzled sex what kind of sex do you want straight sex or head anything kinky i thought you said youd do anything i wanted and would stay the night for a thou he was starting to look worried thats right and you understand theres no rough stuff thats not my style now have we got the business out of the way unfortunately no i said flashing my badge i could hear the trunk of the ford open as my partner jack gripper got out im a policewoman mr emery and youre under arrest for prostitution what a waste i remember thinking i meet the guy of my dreams who lives in the house of my dreams and instead of balling him i bust him life can sure be cruel then he phoned officer esteban he asked sounding just as pleasant as hed been during the ride to the station house yes this is dan emery you arrested me for prostitution three weeks ago oh yes i remember i didnt bother getting a lawyer you had me dead to rights i just faced the music and pled guilty about twenty minutes ago good for you i hope the judge wasnt too tough the fine wasnt much but the process was pretty humiliating hopefully it wont happen again thats for sure so the reason i called actually i wanted to call you before but i thought i should wait until my case was over otherwise i was afraid it would sound like a bribe what would my dinner invitation five years as a cop had taught me how to stay cool in the tensest situations but i was completely flummoxed i dont know i started look youre probably thinking im some kind of weirdo what with answering that kinky ad and all but really im not like that i did it as a lark honest i havent been with a prostitute since college and ive never had a call girl i dont even subscribe to that paper i picked it up at my barber while i was waiting for a haircut it just seemed like fun really im very embarrassed about the whole thing and i have been punished you have no idea what its like for a guy to admit he had to pay for sex in a courtroom packed with giggling people i laughed good he said ive got you laughing now if i can just get you to go out with me ill be batting a thousand what do you say i said yes of course and dinner was everything id hoped it would be even if the restaurant was elegant enough to make me feel a little uncomfortable and i didnt recognize half the dishes on the menu dan turned out to be a perfect gentleman with a sense of humor and none of that macho bullshit that im used to from the cops ive dated the only thing that bothered me that first nightand i say bothered only because i needed a word here not because i really gave it any thought thenwas his reluctance to talk about himself he was an artist at steering the conversation back to me whenever id try to find out a little about him but i was so used to guys who only wanted to talk about themselves that it was actually a bit of a relief i didnt sleep with dan after our first date or our second i didnt want him thinking i was an easy lay the third time we dated he invited me to his house instead of going to a restaurant and he cooked a dinner to die for we ate on the flagstone patio the air felt like silk the view was spectacular and not having sex with him seemed downright silly the next two months were like a fairy tale we couldnt keep our hands off each other and i missed him every minute we were apart sergeant groves couldnt figure out why i was being so nice to him he knew how upset id been when he took me out of narcotics and put me into the callgirl sting operation id yelled sex discrimination and he asked me who else he could use as a call girl the whole thing was supposed to be temporary anyway during those two intense months i learned a little bit more about dan and everything i learned made me like him more dan was an orphan whose parents had died in a car crash on vacation in the south of france during his sophomore year at usc hed been living in an apartment on his own and continued to stay there until he graduated even though hed inherited the house on pine terrace dan told me that hed been very close to his parents and the house contained too many memories it had taken a while before he could stay there without being overcome with sadness the family lawyer had provided dan with advice and an allowance until he turned twentyone and was allowed to control his inheritance even though he was rich enough so he didnt have to work he was employed as a stockbroker at a small exclusive brokerage house run by an old college friend at one point he confided that he was doing well enough at work to keep up his lifestyle without having to tap into his inheritance i didnt go out of my way to tell anyone about dan but its hard to keep secrets from your partner the john jack gripper said unable to keep the surprise out of his voice yeah i answered sheepishly its the house isnt it wed passed the house once on the way to interview a witness and id told jack how id been in it as a kid and how it was my dream house after arresting dan hed asked me if the house was the one id told him about and id said it was geez jack why dont you just come right out and call me a gold digger hey im not casting any stones gripper really is nonjudgmental i guess that comes from being a cop for so many years and seeing as much of life as he has after our brief discussion about dan and me he never brought up the subject again and i didnt either we were in bed when dan first told me he loved me i hadnt pushed it just being with dan was enough ive always kept my expectations low like i said id grown up poor and id fought for everything i had my apartment was the nicest place id ever lived in most of the guys id dated hadnt lived much better i was starting to build a nest egg but i could have done what i was doing for the rest of my life and never put away enough to live like dan i dont want you to think his money was everything but money is always important if you grow up without it i want to think i was in love but im not sure i know what love is i never saw it in my mothers relationship with the occasional man she brought home working the streets ive seen enough women with split lips and enough men with stab wounds to know that love isnt what its cracked up to be ive never seen shooting stars or heard bells ring with anyone i dated not even with dan but he did feel comfortable and he was sure good in the sack and i guess i felt as close to him as ive ever felt to anyone when he said theres something we have to talk about my first thought was he was going to call it off so talk i said trying to make it sound like a joke the full moon hanging over the ocean made seeing in the dark easy enough dan rolled over on his side he looked troubled weve been together what two months sixtyone days twenty hours three minutes and one arrest i answered still trying to keep things light but whos counting dan smiled but it was only for a second then he looked sad my little flatfoot he sighed whats wrong i love you but i dont know if i can trust you that got my attention and i sat up what do you mean you cant trust me i snapped hurt and a little angry how much of a cop are you monica and how much do i mean to you i thought about that more the second part of the question than the first hed just told me he loved me what was he leading up to i thought about living here driving the rolls wearing clothes like the clothes i saw on movie stars i love you too dan and im not so much of a cop that you cant trust me with anything thats what i hoped youd say look ill level with you dating a cop was as much a kick at first as dialing a call girl im not sure there wasnt even a little bit of a revenge motive in it you know getting you in bed after youd arrested and embarrassed me i started to say something but he held up his hand no let me get this out its not easy for me thats how it started but thats not the way it is now when i said i love you i meant it but im not sure youll want to stay with me when you hear what i have to say you like this house and the cars and my lifestyle dont you thats not why ive been seeing you i answered defensively i didnt say it was arent you curious about how i can afford to keep them up you told me that youre doing well at work and about your inheritance besides its none of my business you really dont have any idea of how much it costs to live like i do do you where is this going i asked suddenly growing a little concerned if you learned something bad about me that i was doingthat i was dishonest what would happen to us i answered confused as a cop would you turn me in i looked at him and i thought about us like i said i wasnt sure i loved him but i liked him enough to know my answer i dont turn in my friends then ill say what i have to say and you can decide what you want to do i havent been completely honest with you about my financial situation dan looked embarrassed a look i had never seen before not even when id busted him i always thought my parents were loaded and i assumed id inherit what they had so i never really applied myself in school im pretty brightive got a good iqbut college was one big party and i graduated without many practical skills soon after my parents died i had a rude awakening this house a vacation home a trust fund and some stocks were all i got it wasnt peanuts but i learned that they werent as welloff as id thought it never occurred to me that id have to pay property taxes the upkeep on a house like this and all the other expenses parents worry about but dont discuss with their children the lawyer who probated the estate taught me the financial facts of life i held out for a while but eventually i had to sell the vacation home then i used up my trust fund and sold off a lot of my stocks to keep up this lifestyle like i said i have no marketable skills what about the brokerage i asked oh thats real and i am doing okay but what i earn just about covers the property taxes and expenses for a place like this why dont you sell it dan looked me in the eye would you if you had a house like this wouldnt you do whatever you had to do to keep it i didnt say anything what could i say i knew id kill to keep this house if it were ever mine dan smiled sadly he reached up and touched my cheek the heat of his hand felt so good that i missed it when he took it away i knew youd understand thats why i love you were so different but were the same in the ways that count if you dont make enough to affordeverything and you didnt inherit enough to keep it i asked dan broke eye contact theres no way to sugarcoat this monica ive been dealing narcotics i said stunned he nodded cocaine mostly no heroin i wouldnt do that some marijuana im careful i sell to select customers friends mostly some of my clients its actually the only thing ive ever done well on my own i got out of bed and walked to the window i didnt know what to say why are you telling me this i asked do you have any idea of the spot youve put me in i do appreciate the moral dilemma ive created for you but its not going to be a problem anymore i love you and i knew i couldnt keep seeing you if i didnt come clean about this i respect what you do being a cop i dont ever want to compromise you i turned back toward the bed well you have i should bust you after what youve confessed to me you dont have to monica i told you so there wouldnt be any secrets between us and the reason im telling you now is that its all going to stop i had to make a choice between you and dealing and it wasnt even close but i didnt know how youd feel about that if youd still want to stay with me why should i object if you stop selling dope you dont understand if i stop dealing this he said waving his hand around the room is all going to endthe house and the cars and the restaurants andeverything what do you mean what i said without the cocaine i cant afford the lifestyle and there wont be any more cocaine because of me thats the biggest part of it but theres also a practical reason if i was religious id see the hand of god at work dan smiled i knew i loved you soon after we met and i knew id have to stop dealing if i wanted to keep you but i didnt know how i was going to get out of the life the people i worked for are very dangerous i was afraid of what theyd do if i told them i wasnt going to deal for them anymore and they found out i was dating a cop and they would have found out these guys are very connected iwell i worriedreally worriedthat they might hurt you or threaten to hurt you if i told them i was going to quit jesus dan i said really worried because i knew what he said was true there are dealers that wouldnt think twice about killing a cop its okay monica you dont have to worry he laughed talk about your acts of god he smiled the week before we met my connection was busted then right after you arrested me the dea arrested the head of the cartel he worked for who was he alberto perez id heard about the bust perez was big they got him in miami with millions of dollars worth of coke and they got most of his organization too its finito your connection didnt sell you out i worried about that a lot when we started dating i was waiting for the other shoe to drop but it didnt and i think i know why im small potatoes the feds arent going to waste time on someone who deals at my level you know that besides id sold all my product i was supposed to get some more from the shipment they confiscated so im clean thered be no hard evidence i was a dealer even if they wanted me its been two months now more since my connection was arrested so im guessing im safe i turned back to the ocean but i didnt see it i was thinking too hard about how much i trusted dan and what i was willing to do to keep him so what will you do i asked to stall for time ill have to sell most of what i have i can get a bundle for the house the cars will have to go i sat down with my accountant ill be in good shape if i watch my money but the life youve seen me lead thats over the house i couldnt bear it to be this close to living the life id dreamed of living for so many years and then to have it snatched away dan was talking but i wasnt listening i was upset but theres this thing about me i can wall off my emotions when i need to make a serious decision it comes in handy as a cop and it was coming in handy now i had a good idea of how i could save the house but i wanted to think before i said anything to dan there was too much at stake so i got back in bed and i wrapped my arms around him and kissed him i love you dan i said i want to be with you youll be okay well be okay well be working stiffs thats not so bad ive been one all my life youll see well be fine dan rested his head on my shoulder you dont know what this means to me i was so worried youd leave me when you found out how big a phony i am youre not a phony you just got hooked on this lifestyle the way your customers got hooked on coke and its not like youll have to go cold turkey were going to do fine once you sell this stuff and it is only stuff i said but i didnt mean that i was still working the callgirl sting and busting johns kept me away from dan for a week i didnt like the work to tell the truth it made me feel sleazy most of the poor bastards we arrested had never been in trouble with the law before they looked so pathetic when i flashed my badge i guess it was the futility of it all that got me we were never going to stamp out prostitution it was the worlds oldest profession for a reason i felt the same way about drugs people were always going to want something to make them feel better even if it was only for a little while and they were going to buy coke or a hooker even if it was illegal i thought they should legalize drugs and prostitution and let us concentrate on murderers con men and armed robbers but no one in the state legislature cared what i thought so i spent most of the week after dan told me about his problem dressed like a highpriced tart i spent the other part checking up on dan i cared for him but im not naive hed lied to me about dealing and i wanted to know if hed lied about anything else i used the usual internet sources to find out what was on the web he was quite the socialite and the history hed given me checked out then i ran a check on the house his cars and everything else he had ever owned everything hed told me checked out there too finally i used my computer to tap in to federal and state law enforcement files that are only available to cops all i found was a dui from his sophomore year in college that was resolved when dan went into a diversion program all in all i was satisfied that dan was being straight with me so i set up a meeting with some people i know i told dan my idea after dinner at an inexpensive mexican restaurant in my neighborhood dan joked that i was trying to break him into our new life but i really liked the place and i liked being able to wear jeans to dinner and not having to worry about not knowing what the dishes on the menu were i kept the conversation at dinner about police work telling dan war stories about some of the weird things cops encounter on the job and i waited until we were back at the house on pine terrace before i told him what id been doing hows everything going i asked hows what going you know selling the house the rolls he looked sad ive talked with a few realtors to get an idea of what it will bring the rolls and the lamborghini will go next week maybe not i said what do you mean i felt as if i was standing on a ledge about to jump i had no idea how dan would react to what i was going to propose or whether wed still be together after i had my say there may be a way to save the house and everything else im not following you i might be able to put you in touch with someone im still not following you youre not the only one with secrets i said nervously ive been doing a few things i shouldnt too dan stared at me openmouthed you dont mean im not gonna be a cop all my life ive seen how cops live and what cops make i want to be someone dan i was working narcotics until we started this callgirl sting about a year ago i was involved in a big bust peter pride you were in on that i nodded pride walked yes he did want to know why dan didnt say anything key evidence disappeared and i started a swiss bank account nothing huge but something for my old age didnt some cop get busted for that i thought i read i nodded that was the one part i didnt like bobby marino i had nothing to do with that pride hated him and he set him up it doesnt matter now and theres nothing i can do about it but i can fix you up with pride what do you say dans tongue flicked out and he wet his lips i dont know these guys i was dealing withthey were bad but prides a killer theyre all killers dan but prides a killer who pays well ive been tipping him off for a year now he likes me you need this i said waving my hand at the view and i need you what do you say let me think pride is a whole new ball game dan called me a week later and we met for lunch while we waited for the waitress to bring our order he held my hand ive been thinking about pride and ill do it oh dan i said because its all i could think to say he smiled and tightened his grip and i squeezed back i was that happy one thing though he said whats that from now on youre out i started to protest but he cut me off i mean it i didnt like getting arrested even for a misdemeanor like prostitution i dont even want to think what would happen if they arrested a cop for what youre doing im a big girl dan ive never doubted that but im sticking to my guns from now on im the one taking the risks or the house goes on the market as planned sergei kariakin was russian mafia which meant he didnt just kill babies for fun he ate them too the only place he was called sergei or kariakin was on his rap sheet where his name was followed by aka peter pride sergei loved america which he called the land of criminal opportunity and he had adopted an alias he thought sounded like the name of a movie or rock star the fact that he was as ugly as his crimes and couldnt carry a tune didnt faze him and no one dared point out these problems normally there were several firewalls between peter and the narcotics and sex slaves that were his bread and butter but hed made a mistake two years ago and had faced certain conviction until the key evidence in his case disappeared from the police evidence locker i had a gambling problem back then and someone had told peters lawyer about it one evening a very polite gentleman who never gave me his name made me a proposition within a week my gambling debt had been retired and peters problem had been solved i stopped gambling cold turkey but i stayed on peters payroll dropping timely tips about raids and snitches when i could get away with it my meeting with pride took place in the dead of night in a deserted industrial park neither of us could afford to be seen socializing with the other at first peter was reluctant to bring dan into his organization even if he hadnt been picked up after alberto perez was arrested pride worried that dan was on the deas radar screen i told him id poked around and as far as i could tell the dea didnt know dan existed i pitched dans upperclass clientele and the opportunity it presented to pride to broaden his market a week later dan and i met peter in an abandoned warehouse at three in the morning the meeting ended with peter agreeing to front dan a kilo of cocaine if everything went well there was a promise of more to follow i was so pumped up on the way back to pine terrace that i didnt feel the effects of being up for more than twentyfour hours as soon as we were inside the house i started ripping off dans clothing i dont even remember how we got from the entryway to the bedroom the next afternoon i was so beat i had trouble keeping my eyes open i staggered into police headquarters and found a note asking me to see sergeant groves groves was a handsome black man with a trim mustache and a serious demeanor it was rare for him to lighten up and he looked even more tense than usual when i walked into his office and found him sitting with jack gripper and a man and a woman i didnt recognize shut the door monica groves ordered i did and he motioned me into the only available seat youre in deep shit he said there was a dvd player on groves s desk he hit the play button and i heard myself telling dan how id helped peter pride beat his case my heart seized up the conversation had taken place in the bedroom of the house on pine terrace i wanted to ask how theyd recorded it but i was too frightened to speak that confession will send you away groves said my throat was as dry as the sahara i knew i shouldnt say anything without a lawyer but i still asked what do you want pride answered the woman i was in shock but part of my brain was running through my alternatives you cant use that tape youd have to have bugged the house we can use it if we planted the bug with the permission of the owner she said and i felt myself die a little dan had been arrested the day after his connection was busted jack gripper had been in on the arrest and he remembered what id told him about the house bobby marino had gone down for stealing the evidence in prides case but i became a suspect when a snitch in prides organization told the police that hed heard a woman took the evidence one of the tips id given pride had been a setup sergeant groves had given the location and time of the raid only to me when there was no one at the house that was raided they knew i was guilty gripper and i were switched to the callgirl sting and dan was told to give me a call nature took its course after that when i found out that dan had betrayed me i went from shock to anger to bitterness i saw him once more after my arrest when we were preparing for the setup that eventually put peter pride away he told me he was sorry and really did love me but hed had no choice i dont believe he loved me but even if he did i knew hed forget about me when the next woman came along someone who wasnt serving the sentence that would keep me in prison for at least seven years there is no view from the cell i share with sheila crosby a yearold embezzler but i can still see the view from dans bedroom when i close my eyes sometimes i imagine that i walk out of prison and dan is waiting for me in the rolls we ride to the house on pine terrace and i take a shower to wash away the jailhouse stench after the shower we make love when dan is asleep i walk out onto the patio and watch the approach of a storm thats been brewing in the pacific its a magnificent storm and when it passes i am as untroubled and serene as the pacific after that storm and i am married to my prince and i am rich and i live in a castle on pine terrace marcus sakey on his web site marcus sakey gives us a glimpse into his creative mind when he says i love traveling especially if theres a chance of hurting myself im a wicked good cook i never miss the golden gloves i like bourbon neat food so spicy the guy sitting next to me catches fire and the occasional cigar in very few lines hes given us a clear picture of himself a skill he applies to his own characters by the time youve finished reading the desert here and the desert far away two army buddies cooper and nick will seem to live and breathe even though youve only known them for a few pages the characters and their shared history drive this story relentlessly toward an ending that is as surprising as it is inevitable the desert here and the desert far away the stones are on the stereo and you are wondering what youre doing here in this dingy las vegas bar with a man you last saw wearing combat bdus half a world away cooper has his head in his hands as he says he cant believe how fucked he is a mistake man thats all you dip a chicken wing in ranch and strip the flesh from it cooper makes a hysterical little sound vance is going to kill me he wants to make an example and you laugh because it sounds funny something out of a movie not something people really say to each other cooper gets that look a half sneer like an older brother about to pound you only you never had an older brother just cooper im serious okay you say and dump the chicken bone nick he says and puts his palms together like hes praying and for a second youre back in the front room of a shitty cinderblock apartment watching cooper make the same gesture at you over a bloodstained body nick nick nick nickie i need you brother and you sip your beer and listen to mick jagger tell you that tiiiime is on your side and think about the best night of your life there is the smell of popcorn and nachos the growl of hundreds of people talking and betting and shouting the meaty thump of boxers warming up with their trainers onetwoback fists quick and feet flickering a ring girl five feet nine inches of toned grace in tight jeans and a black bodice chatting up the muscled soldiers at the army booth this is the golden gloves and tonight is the finals and you are fighting next you stand beside the ring legs moving like a jogger at an intersection gloves up savoring the good looseness of your muscles there is fear but you picture a tiny basement room with a bare bulb dangling and shove your fear in and lock the heavy oak door from the front row your girlfriend cheers as you slip between the ropes your opponent has tattoos around both biceps and two inches of extra reach you saw him last year and he is good for a moment your fear bangs on the door the hinges straining and frame rattling you dance the first round land a jab then a hook then take one coming out sudden stars and black spots the crowd roar is static singing loud as the adrenaline in your blood when the round is over you spit water into a bucket and it comes out pink the second goes badly and a split appears in the center of that door your trainer rubs your shoulders tells you its not over yet you just have to believe the third and final round your opponent comes out mean his eyes look through you you block one punch juke out of another your shoulders scream and your body has that hot trembly feeling of failing muscles you throw a jab but he bats it away and steps forward winding up a swing that will knock you back to grade school but you remember what your trainer said and you think of her in the front row and instead of dodging you step forward with a left hook to the belly that steals his wind he pauses just for a moment but its enough you cock your right and let yourself believe then the other guy is on the ground and though he gets up quick the ref counts him standing and stares into his eyes and then shakes his head the bell rings and the fight is yours and the crowd goes crazy and finally you can hear it not as static but as hundreds of voices yelling in joy for you surrounding you making you part of something and a rep from pipefitters local hands you a trophy and the photographer shoots a picture the flash bright even under the lights you with one arm up and the trophy in your other hand and your girlfriend in the background long brown hair flying as she runs to the ring you have never felt this good before its unbearable to think that this will fade leave you nothing but a cheap trophy and a job at the shell station and so you walk over to the recruiting tent where the soldiers slap your shoulders and call you a man and say it was a hell of a fight and that they need men like you guys who believe and wont quit and you sign up you pt until you puke you hurry up and wait you learn close infantry tactics and arabic phrases and the name of every component of your weapon you watch war movies youve already seen a hundred times but this time is different youre part of something a soldier a lean mean killing machine ready to kick ass for your country a group of you go for tattoos crossed rifles and slogans and deaths heads you cant decide think of backing out a tall funny kid named cooper puts his arm around your shoulders says come on buddy dont let us down you get an american flag on your bicep later looking in the mirror you flex arms grown thick with muscle and the flag seems to wave and you feel a surge in your chest a soft fluttery feeling like a girls fingers brushing your skin so how much do you owe this vance guy cooper shrugs ten grand you blow a breath i dont have that much wouldnt matter if you did he shakes his head i heard through a friend vance is sending a guy to waste me wants to show that even a soldier isnt exempt can your buddy help hes just a friend not a buddy what about the guy whos coming after you ive never met him but hes got a bad reputation you lean forward put your boots on the bar rail you wear jeans and a tshirt these days but the boots are a hard habit to quit the thing the army it gets into you its designed to to teach you to walk and talk and shit the army way to break you down and make you part of a larger whole that was what you liked about it you say maybe you should get out of town cooper stares at you hey nick he says softly fuck you and the heat rises in your cheeks as you remember cooper behind the m bravo fingers pulsing in tight clenches that rip the air with explosions fighting for his country shouting and firing as you stand next to him readying the next ammo belt and trying not to panic your first firefight is nothing like you expected not like the movies youd watched or video games youd played you dont feel like a lean mean killing machine not even a little bit there is a flash and then a rocket hits the vehicle ahead knocking it sideways in a wave of flame you point to where the man had fired and cooper swings the machine gun the bullets tearing chunks from walls and kicking up dust when its over you walked through the humming distance of things amidst rubble and trash and thousands of spent shell casings the forward vehicle survived but the rocket killed two soldiers immediately and though the ringing in your ears muffles sound its not enough to shut out the screams of a third whose belly was opened and the funny thing is that its in the aftermath that the fear really hits as you realize that it was just chance that their vehicle was in front not strategy or fate or a plan just chance a matter of which driver had pulled out first that the difference between life and death was measured in feet and in seconds fear burst the door of its basement cage and seized you and didnt let go not then and not since sorry you say and dont explain what for and dont have to the two of you sit in silence when the door bangs open you jump and even though its been six months reach for a weapon that isnt there it only takes a second to come back to the bar but when you do you see that cooper jumped too he gives you a sheepish grin spreads his hands its funny he says people ask what it was like and i cant remember not really too big too much after a while it started to feel like nothing beyond computation you sip your beer and nod the guy vance is sending cooper says they say he cuts your ears off first he looks at you and in the neon light of the bar you can see fear twist in his eyes like a trash bag in a dark ocean current thats not going to happen you say the m stryker is twentythree feet long by nine wide and features an eightbyeight suspension tires that can adjust pressure on the fly and roll for miles after being blown and a hp caterpillar engine capable of driving the seventeenton vehicle at speeds of sixty miles per it looks like an olive drab duck with too many legs and the inside smells of the sweat and farts of eleven men it is the most beautiful thing you have ever seen you are the assistant gunner for the rear weapons team you wanted to be the primary even though youre not sure you have what it takes to pull the trigger on a living breathing person still at the zeroing range you nailed more targets than anybody figured you had it in the bag but the sergeant picked cooper as the primary you saw the two of them talking coop gesturing at you and he says that he was telling the sarge you should be gunner but walking around the stryker that will be yours the one you will share with ten other men the one in which you will serve your country it doesnt matter you run your hands gently along the armor would you look at that cooper stands in the doorway he nudges the soldier next to him i think we got ourselves a true believer he smiles to let you know hes just busting balls hey you sure its your arm got the flag tattooed on it after you leave cooper in the bar you drive for a while watching the sun set the sky on fire its that hour when the shadows are soft and everything is lit from within tourists wander the strip holding threefoot souvenir glasses people in business suits talk on cell phones a cute girl steps out of whole foods carrying bags stuffed with freerange macrobiotic whatever everyone is happy on vacation or on their way home for a second you want more than anything to turn the wheel of the bronco hard and jam on the gas and blast right through the bright front window of the grocery store you clench and unclench your fists take deep breaths a car behind you honks and you move along from the corner market you get a cheesesteak and a sixpack you go to the room you rent and turn on the tv and eat dinner sitting at your counter the news you arent watching running in the background you think about what cooper said how life over there had been too big to grasp to hold you remember a conversation with a soldier who was reupping how when he talked about getting back to iraq he slipped and called it home you light a cigarette and think about the girl who watched you win at the golden gloves about the way her hair always smelled clean and a moment a lifetime ago lying in bed when she looked up with eyes like june and said she loved you the body on the floor of the mosul apartment has half a dozen wounds hes on his belly one arm out like he was reaching for something head cocked sideways and part of his face missing you recognize him hes one of the men who frequently hangs around the forward operating base selling miami cigarettes other things too the rumor goes cooper kneels beside him bent over the body at an awkward angle as though he is going to hug it the image sticks with you comes back sometimes months later along with the abruptness with which cooper straightens as you come in and how the first words out of his mouth are i had to you narrow your eyes say what are you doing checking for a pulse the fear is in you has been since the firefight sometimes you feel your fear wears you like clothing today is bad a dangerous assignment the squad split up and working the houses separately poor procedure but that was the order and so when you heard the shots you were alone in the alley and came running jumping piles of trash and discarded water bottles it occurs to you that the rest of the house is not secure that there may be others and the fear spikes again then you notice wheres his weapon cooper winces and looks at the body and then back at you i told him to get down but he came at me and i thought you reach for your radio wait cooper takes a step forward wait he puts his palms together like hes praying if they realize he wasnt armed we have to call on this i know but he rocks his clasped hands back and forth stares in your eyes i was scared nickie everyone is scared but no one says so and when you see cooper looking at you that way something in you shivers it could have been you alone in here could have been you who pulled the trigger you think of basic him putting an arm around your shoulders and telling you not to let everybody down did anyone your voice comes out a croak and you cough start again did anyone see you come in here just you you nod look again at the body on the ground the way he is twisted the blood is thickening on the woven rug another darkskinned man dead in another shitty room you try to make yourself believe it matters then cooper says please nickie please in the movies former soldiers wake up in a sweat fresh from nightmares of a war that never ends not you you dont dream at all these days you stretch make coffee shower pull on your boots kill a couple of hours at a coffee shop staring out at nothing the bronco you stored in your parents garage while deployed is sunfaded and the air conditioner doesnt work but driving it you feel something like your old self cooper is waiting on the corner hands tucked into the front pouch of a hoodie the day is already too warm for he climbs in pulls a cd from his pocket slayers reign in blood you know it well maybe in vietnam it was wagner but in the desert it was always heavy metal you ask where a parking garage he gives you the intersection im supposed to meet him with the money in an hour figured wed get there first scope it out the garage is off the strip set amidst warehouses being converted to lofts for whoever lives in lofts the ramp spirals up through six stories the top floor is open to the sky a handful of expensive vehicles are scattered far apart car fetishists terrified of every ding and scratch you park forty feet from the stairwell on the far side of the ramp the sun is brutal burning the sky white the windows are open and the sweat slicking your chest feels familiar its good cooper nods how many at least two armed he nods again you take a breath look around electricity crackles and snaps between your fingers the same old feeling you used to get as the squad mounted up with terrain like this theres no reason even to discuss the plan okay you say cooper opens the door pauses turns to look at you nick forget it you say the two of you share the kind of look that only men whove gone to war together can then he slides out of the car and walks over to the stairwell leans against the wall you sit behind the wheel for a moment listening to the relentless hammer of the heavy metal guitars remembering fritz the gunner for your strykers forward weapons team a skinny kid with a missouri twang and a pinch of skoal perpetually in the pouch of his lip two hundred and ten beats a minute hed said and smiled at the time youd thought he was talking about his heart you turn off the engine and get out stand for a moment in the sun the same sun that lights the other side of the world you twist the passenger mirror up at an angle then take a breath go prone and wriggle underneath the truck it isnt long before you hear a car climbing the ramp the sound gets louder fainter then louder again as it winds to the top you take a deep breath and remember the best night you ever had how you mastered your fear and let yourself believe the problem with the best moment of your life is that every other moment is worse the car is a bmw it cruises up the ramp smooth and soft you keep your face pointing down watching out of the corner of your eye trying to picture a basement room with a dangling bulb and a heavy door the car parks about twenty feet away near the stairs where cooper stands with his hands in his pocket gently you slide out from under keeping the truck between you and the men using the mirror to see two of them one in a suit no tie the other bigger in jeans and a muscle shirt muscle shirt gives a casual scan of the parking lot he doesnt look concerned lacks the edgy readiness of a man expecting trouble still when he turns his back you see a pistol tucked into his belt cooper raises one hand in greeting says something you cant hear keeping low you ease around the back of the bronco your heart slams in your chest and you can taste copper you slide one foot forward then the other the distance is only twenty feet a couple of car lengths it seems like miles you feel strangely naked with your hands empty step beat step the man in the business suit says something to cooper you screen it out fifteen feet ten the sun fires jagged glints off the polished bmw youre almost to the man in the muscle shirt when he turns around the stars in the desert night were unlike anything youd ever seen they flowed across the sky like god had spilled them growing up in chicago the stars you saw were manmade skyscrapers turning the night purple even when you went camping out in wisconsin it was nothing like this sometimes when things got bad you closed your eyes and thought of those stars imagined yourself on a rise alone arms out a figure cut from the sky looking upward waiting to be pulled into them hoping muscle shirts eyes go wide and he starts to speak but you dont hesitate just take three quick strides and snap off a jab that catches his chin your bare knuckles sing adrenaline howls in your blood the fear is gone you feel better than you have in months you throw another jab and he gets his hands up in a clumsy block and then you crack him hard in the side of the head near the temple a wildly illegal blow his eyes lose focus and his legs wobble but its in you now the rage the anger that swelled every time a mortar landed on the fob every time a man in a terroristtowel stepped out of an alley leveling an ak every time the counselor at the va said that what you were experiencing was typical that it would pass you swing again and again his head snaps back and blood explodes from his nose and hed fall if only youd let him a loud gasp pulls you from your trance you forget muscle boy turn to the man in the suit and start his way and in a panicky voice he says cooper what is this and then you break his nose he whimpers and drops to his knees he looks up with wide scared eyes one hand on his nose and the other up to ward you off like a child menaced by a bully the anger and power vanish you lower your fists then cooper pushes past you flips muscle shirt over grabs the pistol from his belt and comes up fast the man in the suit screams you say no and then there are three explosions and the man stops screaming cooper turns to the one on the ground and fires three more times two bullets in the center of mass and one in the head just like they taught you in basic and you stand there hands trembling a shattered body on either side of you as the sun beats down nick cooper says you stare i had to its done now he takes off his hoodie and uses it to wipe the sidearm clean he drops it next to one of the bodies then starts for the bronco you look at whats left of their heads then cooper says nick his voice sharp come on move your feet soldier he walks around to the other side of the bronco and opens the door you bend and do something without really thinking about it and then the sun carves your shadow in concrete as you walk to your truck the drive out of las vegas is a surreal falling away first the casinos and bright lights then the subdivisions that spring up overnightall those houses all those people all the sameand then retail and then diners and then garages and then warehouses and then nothing just dirt and sun on either side of us cooper is all energy the window open and fingers tapping his whole body vibrating like a tuning fork fuck that was intense he says grinning i knew youd boxed but you beat the shit out of those guys your fingers on the wheel are raw and dark with drying blood he slaps the side of your truck in time with the heavy metal screaming through the tinny speakers where we going chief you press the power button on the stereo cooper looks at you a long stare some of the energy falls away i had to you say nothing i had to show vance that coming after me is a bad idea that it will cost him he scratches his chin now we can deal ill even pay him when i get the money the guy you say hot dry air roars in the open windows he knew your name who on the parking deck so what you told me youd never met him but he said cooper what is this he shrugs vance must have told him it sounded like he knew you he didnt your hands tighten on the steering wheel you wait you know cooper silence he cant take finally he laughs ah shit okay you got me he turns to you i did know him but the rest of what i said it was true and nickie thank you i mean it i always knew i could count on you you nod it was true he had always known that you ride in silence for another couple of moments then pull off at a lonely gas station im thirsty get me something would you in the minimart you snag a couple of gatorades and a pack of beef jerky and a can of lighter fluid the woman behind the counter is as old as death when she counts out your change the motion of her lips fractures her cheeks like sunbaked mud in the bronco cooper has his feet on the dash as you put the truck into drive he opens the jerky says you got a destination in mind or we just cruising because the chicks man theyre the other direction the highway is nearly empty cars strung out like beads on a necklace you open the gatorade and take a long pull after a few minutes you take the exit for us a twolane straight into the cracked brown american desert seriously nick where we headed what were you doing when i came in what his eyebrows scrunch came in where in mosul the apartment when i came in you were bending over the guys body what were you doing he cocks his head i was checking for a pulse ive thought about that a lot since i got back the way you were bent over him it was strange you set your drink in the cup holder you werent looking for a pulse were you you were going through his pockets thats crazy you say nothing just look at him sideways put it all in your eyes for a moment he keeps it up the facade the cooper show then he says huh and the mask falls away when did you know i guess i knew then in mosul i just wanted to believe you cooper nods see i knew i could count on you what i want to know is why he sighs i had a sideline going with the guyweed methbut he got unreliable always talking about allah you know he shrugged and today well i really did owe vance ten grand that why you shot him he was the one in the suit right you dont miss a trick nickie why bring me into it i couldnt be sure how many guys hed have no why me what do you want me to say he shrugs because you buy the whole lie you win the golden gloves and to celebrate what do you do get drunk and nail your girlfriend not you you join the army you used me you let yourself be used i could go to the cops theyd arrest you too but you know what he shakes his head that doesnt matter you didnt do that in iraq and you wont here thats why i came to you because youre predictable nickie you never change the moment stretches you remember your trainer saying all you had to do was believe remember the feeling of being part of a team a soldier and what it got you a diagnosis of ptsd and a rented room in a city you hate and a raw and formless anger that seems some days more real than any version of you that you once thought might be the real thing and then you raise the pistol you took from the parking deck and put it to coopers head and show him hes wrong your knuckles hurt and your lips are chapped theres a line from an old leonard cohen song running through your head something about praying for the grace of god in the desert here and the desert far away sometimes youre thinking of cooper sometimes youre not thinking at all when the sun slips below the horizon you get up off the boulder youve been sitting on all day a quiet corner of searing nowhere at the end of an abandoned twotrack brown rocks and brown dirt and white sky and you the broncos passenger window is still open you reach in your pocket and pull out the can of lighter fluid and pop the top and lean in the window to spray it all over your friend and the front seat and the floorboards the smell rising fast you squeeze until nothing else comes you think you might be crying but youre not sure the butane catches with a soft whoomp and a trail of blueyellow flame leaps around the inside of the truck you once loved the upholstery catches quickly and coopers clothing within a minute greasy black smoke pours out the windows and a fierce crackling rises you stand on the ridge of the desert and watch another truck engulfed in flame beneath another burning sky and you still standing still watching and then you turn and start walking alone carla neggers throughout her extensive career carla neggers has excelled not only at creating vivid characters but also at placing them in circumstances where mother nature is as much of a threat as the killers they face whether in the lush irish ruins of the angel the frozen mountain range of cold pursuit or the salty maine air of the harbor the protagonists in carlas stories must confront not only the harsh realities of their situation but also the brutal conditions of their environment in this sense on the run is both a classic adventure story and vintage carla neggers on an isolated trailhead in the unforgiving mountains of new hampshire gus winter and the fugitive holding him at gunpoint will grapple in a lifeanddeath struggle the temperature is dropping and both men are feeling the colds embrace when this story begins on the run this is where they died gus winter shook his head no another half hour at least the fugitive shivered in the cold drizzle that had been falling all day ironic that youll die up here too he said if i die then youll die help wont arrive in time to save you just like it didnt arrive in time to save them them gus kept his expression neutral theyd stopped in the middle of the rough narrow trail for the fugitive to catch his breath he was compact thickly built and at least twenty years younger than gus but his jeans and cotton sweater werent appropriate for the conditions on the ridge his socks were undoubtedly cotton too he didnt wear a hat or gloves he carried a hip pack but hed already consumed his small bag of trail mix and quart of water three hours ago hed jumped from behind a giant boulder just above a seldomused trailhead up cold ridge stuck a gun in guss face and ordered him to get moving now they were on an open stretch of bald rock at three thousand feet in the white mountains of new hampshire on an unsettled october afternoon the weather would get worse soon gus looked out at the mist fog and drizzle the hardwoods with their brightly colored autumn leaves had given way to more and more evergreens at just over four thousand feet he and the fugitive would be above the tree line gus said most hypothermia deaths occur on days just like today that right it doesnt have to be below zero to die of the cold the fugitive hunched his shoulders as if to combat his shivering he had a stubbly growth of beard which made sense given the story hed told gus about escaping from a federal prison in rhode island two days ago his dark eyes showed none of the discomfort he had to be feeling gus wasnt winded and he was warm enough in his layers of moisturewicking fabrics and his lined waterproof jacket he wore a wool hat windresistant gloves wool socks and waterproof hiking boots his backpack was loaded with basic supplies but he couldnt reach back for anything take it off unzip a compartment if he did the fugitive had said hed shoot him the fugitive coughed still breathing hard sweat trickled down his temples into his threeday stubble im not dying of the cold try not to sweat gus said sweating is a cooling mechanism the water evaporates on your skin and promotes heat loss you dont want that you want me to freeze to death no i want you to give yourself up walk back down the mountain with me the fugitive stepped back behind gus and waved his gun acaliber smith wesson that he must have picked up somewhere between prison and new hampshire get moving its a good idea to keep moving but not so hard and fast that you sweat its easier to stay warm than to get warm shut up gus started back along the trail and heard the crunch of small stones as the fugitive fell in behind him the trail dropped off sharply to their left and in the valley below the bright orange leaves of hardwoods managed to penetrate the gray every autumn leafpeepers flocked to northern new england to see the stunning foliage today in the rain and fog they would be gathered in front of fires at cozy inns and restaurants or headed home gus realized it wasnt his bad luck that the one person in the white mountains with a gun had found him the fugitive had targeted him watched for him why before long the valley would disappear in the fog and low cloud cover and dusk came early this time of year even with the flashlight he had in his pack gus knew it would be increasingly difficult perhaps impossible to see from one trail marker to the next the fugitive wouldnt find his way on his own he didnt know cold ridge gus did hed lived in its shadows hiked its trails his entire lifenot counting his two years in the army hed come home at twenty expecting to get married have a couple of kids things had worked out differently because of the ridge and its dangers theres a shoottokill order out on me the fugitive said matteroffact no such thing liar gus stepped over a smooth slippery rock the purpose of deadly force isnt to kill its purpose is to stop yousomeonefrom killing or seriously injuring someone else its about public safety its not about killing the fugitive snorted why not shoot me in the knee shoot you in the knee and you can still fire off a round or stab someone apply deadly force and you cant but if you livethen you live the purpose was to stop you not to kill you youd shoot to kill me if you had the chance toss your gun off the ridge although he wasnt known for his patience gus kept his tone reasonable persuasive lets walk back down the trail together keeping your gun pointed at me puts you at risk of getting shot yourself if the police see you its just you and me up here and the ghosts dont try to fool me i know were almost there yes gus thought as he led the fugitive around a familiar bend in the trail they were almost there he slowed his pace mindful of the slippery rock and the fugitive moved in closer youre picturing yourself firing your glock into my chest arent you gus didnt own a glock im picturing you wrapped up in a blanket in front of a nice fire in a woodstove safe no worries about tripping and falling up here no worries about hypothermia no worries about getting yourself shot acaliber glock the fugitives teeth chattered but derision had crept into his voice isnt that what you carry mr senior deputy us marshal winter gus maintained his steady pace he saw now what had happened three hours ago the fugitive believed hed snatched a federal agent specifically guss nephew nate winter a senior deputy us marshal visiting from washington he and gus had similar builds and were just thirteen years apart in age wearing a hat carrying a pack gus could understand how someone could think he was nate he didnt correct the fugitives mistake the trail became steeper and the drizzle turned to light rain behind him gus could hear the fugitive shuddering and shivering cursing at the cold youre in firststage hypothermia gus said shivering is your bodys way of trying to get warm your core temperature is already below normal youre still conscious and alert but you wont stay that way im fine keep walking as your core temperature drops below ninety your coordination will become more and more impaired youll become weaker lethargic confused youd like that wouldnt you youll stop shivering gus had explained the stages of hypothermia to countless hikers over the past thirty years youll be at an increased risk of cardiac arrest it wont happen it is happening its happening to you right now ill take your gear and leave you youll freeze long before i do you need me to get you off this mountain alive gus said calmly all i have to do is go downhill its not that simple youre in a wilderness area the main trails are to the south even if you managed to avoid falling off a cliffeven if you didnt run out of potable waterand you made it off the mountain youd still be miles from the nearest help the fugitive was breathing hard now more lies im just telling you how it is gus said and no matter what you doleave me take me with youyoull still be wet and cold itll be dark soon do you know how to protect yourself from the cold overnight stop talking gus pretended to stumble slightly on the trail and deliberately ran into a halfdead spruce tree a sharp sticklike lower branch dug into his cheek and drew blood he gave an exaggerated yelp of pain and let a few drops of the blood drip onto the gray granite at his feet hold up the fugitive shoved his gun into guss back and sniffled but he didnt stop shivering the blood clean it up use your glove do a good job squatting down on one knee gus used the thumb of his black windproof glove to wipe up the blood which was already mixing with the rain water the fugitive stood over him think im stupid i know what youre doing youre leaving a trail for your marshal friends he squinted down at the cleanedup blood spot back on your feet dont try that again gus shrugged as he rose up straight no one would notice a few drops of blood in this wilderness a search dog would gus pressed a gloved finger to the cut on his cheek as if he didnt dare let more blood fall onto the trail but as he started back up the trail he noted the snapped branch on the spruce with satisfaction a searchandrescue team wouldnt miss it just as they wouldnt miss the other clues hed left during the past three hours his breadcrumb trail hed participated in enough mountain rescues over the years to know how they operated by now nate and his wife and his two sisters and their husbandsall gathered in cold ridge for a long weekendwould have realized guss quick walk up the trail had gone bad theyd do a fastandeasy search for him before notifying the authorities whod launch an official search were they thinking even now that hed simply gone off trail and fallen or were they aware that an armedanddangerous fugitive was in the area did they know his name what he wanted the fugitive coughed his shivering constant now all right stop he said abruptly take off your pack and set it on that rock there nice and slow gus complied aware of the smith wesson pointed at him the fugitives hands had to be stiff from the cold his fingers wet and slippery if he just dropped the gun fine but gus didnt want him accidentally firing off a round unzip the main compartment and dump out the contents the fugitive said again nice and slow dont do anything stupid i want to see what youve got in there gus did as instructed shaking out three energy bars a water bottle an emergency whistle waterproof matches dry clothes a compass trash bags that could be used as an emergency shelter the fugitive toed a trash bag with his wet sneaker thats a lot to carry for a day hike isnt it gus shook his head i always pack more than i think ill need if i use everything i know i didnt pack enough wheres your gun not here youre a federal agent you go armed youre supposed to have a gun gus didnt know if that was true or not he and nate had never discussed those kinds of details the fugitive had frisked him for weapons in the first minutes after hed jumped out from behind the boulder but gus hadnt realized it was at least in part due to mistaken identity why didnt you check my pack for a gun sooner he asked i didnt need to touch it and you were dead anyway let you carry the extra weight of a gun his logic made sense do you want to change into dry socks at least no give me your water before gus could comply the fugitive reached down with his free hand and grabbed the plastic bottle from among the dumpedout contents he used his teeth to open the fliptop and drank deeply even with his chattering teeth he shoved the bottle at gus close it dont drink any once again gus did as requested youre older than i thought youd be the fugitive said whats with the white hair hard life i hate marshals gus said nothing how much farther now the fugitive asked to to where your mummy and daddy froze to death gus pushed back a surge of anger and gazed down toward the village nestled in the valley below cold ridge lost now in the gray clouds and fog he could see his nephew and nieces on that cold awful night thirty years ago nate seven antonia five carine three waiting they got caught in an unexpected ice storm it was all over the papers the fugitive sounded amused now can you imagine a young couple with three little kids freezing to death up here gus rose up straight hed been twenty and newly home from war hed looked at the faces of his young nephew and nieces and wished he could have died up on the ridge in the place of his brother and his wife instead hed become the guardian to their three orphans they were all married now antonia and carine had little ones of their own nate and his wife sarah were expecting their first child in a few weeks a boy if he died up here today gus thought the little oneslike grandchildren to himwouldnt remember him they werent old enough there was some consolation in that the wind picked up and swirled the gray horizon creating a wavelike effect that had a tendency to disorient even nauseate novice hikers as an outfitter and guide gus had encountered hikers of all descriptions in the mountains most were eager and wellmeaning determined to enjoy their experience while taking proper precautions the fugitive poked his gun into guss back well answer me how much farther fifty yards maybe a little more we need to be careful in the fog we dont want to walk off the edge of a cliff he glanced back slowing his pace you dont need your gun ill take you wherever you want to go i wont run or mislead you i dont want you to hurt anyone else i want your coat the fugitive said suddenly get it off gus paused and shrugged off his pack and coat the fugitive took it with one hand and put it on over his wet sweater taking care to keep his gun at the ready he zipped up the coat and gave a shudder of obvious relief i dont know why i waited this long because you underestimated how cold youd get it happens all the time gus noticed raindrops already collecting on his navy sweater but its thick wool was a better insulator when wet than the fugitives cotton whats your name fred it wasnt his name what are you looking for up here fred the fugitive didnt answer his shivering had lessened but it wasnt necessarily a good sign he motioned with his gun still clenched in his halffrozen hand and gus started back along the trail the fog wasnt going to lift the wind wasnt going to let up the rain wasnt going to stop lets get to where you want to go he said wearily they came to the spot where his brother and sisterinlaw had died hed been a firefighter shed been a biology teacher these days weather reports were more accurate but even so people died on cold ridge theres a rock formation just past where your folks died it looks like a toaster the fugitives words were slightly slurred but he continued do you know it i do gus stared into the shifting fog and clouds he could walk right past the toastershaped rock formation and the fugitive would probably never know it then what shoot gus in the back drop dead from the cold but as he continued along the trail his legs heavier now the pack grinding into the small of his back gus knew he wouldnt mislead his captor hed just take him where he wanted to go the wind was steady at least fifty miles per hour with higher gusts he had hiked up all fortyeight peaks in the white mountains over four thousand feet and hed experienced hurricaneforce winds but nothing had prepared him for the jumble of emotions he felt at being hereon the ground where his brother and the woman hed loved had died his brother had taken him up this same trail before gus had left for basic training be safe gus ill be here when you come home he pushed back the memory and nodded to a rock outcropping just ahead barely visible through the shifting gray there thats it it looks just like a toaster the fugitive stepped up next to gus and pulled the coats hood over his head it would help break the wind but otherwise wouldnt do much good his hair was wet he wasnt shivering at all anymore pal gus said listen to me you need to get warm let me help you you dont want to die up here do you he waved the gun still clenched tight in his right hand behind the rocks go gus sighed and made his way off the trail the wind going through his layers the rain soaking his layers he pushed through scrubby balsams clinging to the thin soil and climbed over a tumble of boulders to the granite formation it jutted ten feet out of the ground below a rounded knoll the fugitive panted stumbling on the boulders as he followed gus behind the outcropping they were out of the wind now at least i knew id make it back here the fugitive said gus could hear the wind whipping through the valley up onto the open ridge he shivered he preferred to keep moving but he followed the fugitives gaze to a mound of dirt and rock between the base of the rock formation and the knoll a shallow grave whos buried there gus asked smuggler he tried to cheat the wrong man meaning you the fugitive didnt answer his eyes gleaming with excitement as with a burst of fresh energy he got onto his knees the rain let up now too and he set the smith wesson next to his right knee and started moving baseballsize rocks with his red frozen hands youve stopped shivering but its not because youre warm gus said your core temperature has dropped to the point that your body is focused just on keeping your vital organs working i know what im doing do you youre slurring your words as hypothermia worsens you get more and more confused your mental state shut up the fugitive glared up at gus im digging for gold was he digging for gold or was he hallucinating despite his slurred speech he sounded perfectly lucid he continued to grab rocks and toss them aside keeping his gun close by as he worked gus stood back he became aware of another presence up on the knoll in the wind and gray his teeth were chattering now his hands were shaking he wasnt sure if he could trust his senses was he so far gone with hypothermia himself that he was imagining things my coats not enough youre wet he said ive rescued a lot of people off the ridge who were in better shape than you are now the fugitive looked up at him his eyes were still focused even as he struggled to speak youre not the marshal gus shrugged never said i was he kicked the fugitives pile of wet rocks creating a distraction and a man swooped down from the knoll nate he leveled a gun at the fugitive hands in the air now do it gus told the fugitive dont make him use deadly force the fugitive raised his hands and gus grabbed the smith wesson he thought he saw a flicker of fear in the fugitives eyes and shook his head im not going to shoot you he said handing the gun to his nephew the situation doesnt call for deadly force not anymore two more men appeared behind the rock outcropping antonias husband a us senator and former rescue helicopter pilot and carines husband an airforce pararescueman they too were armed then came antonia a physician and carine a nature photographer who knew the white mountains at least as well as gus did maybe better he hadnt imagined them we werent going back down the mountain without you nate said his voice catching i wasnt losing you before my baby boy gets to know you gus sank against the wet rock wall im wornout he said and im cold nate nodded to the fugitive what did he want gold and a dead marshal you didnt tell him he had the wrong guy you werent the right guy either a searchandrescue team arrived with stretchers and made gus get on one but he climbed off after a hundred yards and walked the rest of the way down off the ridge it was dark and cold the sky clear when gus and his nephew and nieces and their spouses and little ones gathered at the cold ridge lakeside home of a federal judge her name was bernadette peacham and gus had known her since kindergarten she hardly spoke as he helped her get a pile of blankets from the shed and spread them out on a tarp laid on the wet ground in front of her big outdoor stone fireplace a fire was roaring there were marshmallows and hot cocoa beanie as gus had called bernadette for decades dried off an old adirondack chair you could have died up there she said as she plopped down if nate hadnt spotted your traili dont want to think about it alls well that ends well the fugitives name was frank leonard two years ago nate had recognized him at a hardware store in the village of cold ridge his mug shot was on the usms web site and nate had a good memory for faces leonard was wanted for failing to appear in court on a federal drug charge and running in to nate was especially bad timing for himhed just killed a fellow smuggler up on the ridge theyd met there to divide the gold bars theyd received as payment for smuggling drugs and arms over the canadian border picking the toasterlooking rock formation near the spot where nates parents had died had been leonards idea on the way down the ridge restrained in his stretcher hed told gus that even then he didnt like marshals theyd been after me for weeks they never let up i thought it was funny picking that spot funny he and his partner in smuggling argued and leonard killed him and buried him as best he could then hiked back down the ridge to clean up loose ends the gold bars were heavy and awkward and he wanted to get his ducks in a row before he went back on the ridge fetched the gold and disappeared a rich man only nate had discovered him first when he escaped from prison two days ago he headed straight to cold ridge but he couldnt remember how to get back to the spot where hed buried his colleague and the gold and he wanted revenge against the marshal whod recognized him he couldnt believe his luck when he spotted gus on the trail and mistook him for nate bernadette picked up a long sharpended stick as gus settled into the chair next to her for a while hed wondered if hed ever get warm again but he was downright hot now the flames licking up in the black sky why did you go

tree root almost fell sweat rolled down his face his hands ducttaped together behind his back soon briggs grabbed the accountant by the hair and gave his head a shake how soon he jammed the barrel of the magnum against the mans nasal septum you may like tramping around in the great outdoors but me i just want to shoot you and get into some airconditioning ii appreciate your discomfort said the accountant blood trickling from his nose but junior wants my ledger detailing his financial transactions for the last eight years so he dripped blood onto his gray suit a soft pale man with calm eyes

to them dont answer me five minutes later the accountant turned to briggs are you saving your money whats that supposed to mean said briggs a simple interrogatory said the accountant his yellow necktie crusted with blood i wanted to know if you saved a portion of your money or lived paycheck to paycheck briggs swatted at the mosquitoes darting around him i do okay i could give you some suggestions said the accountant something that would allow you to defer taxes and put your money to work for you taxes briggs laughed you dont pay taxes said the accountant sean shook his head me neither big mistake said the accountant you dont want to fool with the irs how much farther demanded briggs i kind of like the idea of my money working for me sean said quietly like having a maid or a slave he made a motion like he was cracking a whip good for you sean the accountant tried to scratch his nose with his shoulder now youre thinking i can give you some tips you think this is a fucking seminar said briggs move is that how you got this place sean said to the accountant making your money work for you absolutely said the accountant ive got fortyfive acres here owned free and clear

had a partner ten years agohe might have accommodated you if you force me to wet myself mr briggs i can promise you with absolute certainty that i will not lead you to the ledger no matter what you do to me said the accountant briggs punched the accountant in the side of the head knocked him onto the ground you sure about that he kicked the man in the chest then grabbed the accountants bound hands jerked him to his feet bones popping you sure the accountant didnt say a word briggs lifted the accountants hands higher and higher the man bent forward silent tears rolling from his eyes onto the dirt still silent briggs finally released him out of breath damn briggs said sean i believe him yeah panted briggs so do i he wiped sweat off his forehead with the back of his hand so grab his joint and help him take a piss me said sean briggs shrugged i cleaned up after the two software geeks they must have had the combo platter at el jaliscos but you never heard me complain while you were oohing and aahing over their fancy laptops i was mopping out the car im not doing it said sean you were the one who forgot the handcuffs said briggs thats why i had to use the tape i dont care said sean gentlemen said the accountant decide did i share on the last job said briggs i didnt have to but i did he glanced at the accountant last job we foundi found a halfkilo of smack in mr unluckys dresser i didnt have to share it with you but i did the smack was stepped on and we probably should have turned it over to junior anyway said sean gentlemen sean stared at briggs you know its fair said briggs sean jabbed a finger at the accountant i aint touching it with my bare hands he walked around until he found a tree with wide leaves tore a couple off and strode back to the accountant dont say a fucking word he unzipped the accountants trousers fumbled out the mans penis holding the leaf around it then pointed it into the brush hurry up the accountant closed his eyes come on said sean giving the accountants penis a slight shake im trying said the accountant youre the one who had to go so bad said sean oh sean drawled briggs i caint quit you that aint funny sean looked at the accountant im going to be hearing that for the next week the accountant sighed ii cant do it its justi cant fine sean stuffed the accountants penis back into his trousers didnt even bother zipping him up the leaf sticking out of his fly just take us to the damn ledger so i can blow your brains out and forget this ever happened im sorry said the accountant its not easy you know sean wiped his hand on his pants if it helps said the accountant were almost there about time briggs looked down at the patches of standing water all around them getting really muddy lot of rain lately said the accountant walking ahead the ground sucking at his shoes its really beautiful here after a storm all kinds of flowers popping up he walked slightly off the trail splashed through a puddle see that tree up ahead he pointed with his chin the one with the split trunk the journals in a waterproof container under a large flat rock briggs pushed him aside stalked across a mossy clearing toward the tree right through the water he was in past his ankles trying to highstep free before he stopped and looked back by then it was too late he was up to his knees and sinking fast dont move said the accountant get me out of here shouted briggs sean pointed a pistol at the accountant you did this theres underground springs all over this part of the woods the accountant said to sean ignoring the pistol nobody knows where theyll pop up next hey called briggs the muddy slurry almost to his waist now quit struggling briggs youll only sink faster said the accountant stepping slowly into the clearing stay calm how about we trade places and you stay calm motherfucker said briggs perfectly still now sean go find a long tree branch the accountant said gently hurry sean crashed into the underbrush imim still sinking said briggs a cloud of mosquitoes floating around his head the accountant watched him stuck there the lateafternoon light seeping through the trees sean rushed back dragging a long dry branch is this okay perfect said the accountant hold it out in front of youbut be careful where you step im scared said sean fucking do it sean cried briggs sean edged carefully into the clearing one foot in front of the other testing the ground under the water to make sure it was solid he waved the dry branch at briggs youll have to get closer said the accountant sean took another few steps started to sink the watery muck level with his hightops he reached out with the branch briggs lunged for the branch missed it by at least three feet his movements drove him deeper into the slurry chesthigh now closer its okay sean said the accountant just a little farther lean forward with the branch sean hesitated took another step toward briggs bent over the branch extended as far as he could the accountant put his foot against seans ass and pushed sent him sprawling sean screamed facedown spitting out muck as he fought to get out but only got sucked in deeper and deeper he grasped at the tree branch it snapped the accountant watched them struggle sean weeping frantic mud in his mouth sinking fast briggs moved slowly trying to work his way toward the edge of the clearing there really is a natural spring under there said the accountant hands still taped behind his back been that way since i was a boy deep too no matter what you throw in it just gets swallowed up i tossed a neighbors new bicycle down there one time shiny red schwinn with streamers on the handlebars and a chrome fenders never did like that kid briggs reached for a tuft of grass but it came apart in his hands he tilted back the slurry past his chest now sean made a final choking sound and slipped under the surface if you can hold your breath long enough briggs maybe you can find that bike on the bottom said the accountant see if you can ring the bell briggs reached down fumbled for something the movement pushing him deeper his head was under the surface when his hand broke free just his hand holding the he blindly got off three shots with the revolver before his hand disappeared along with the rest of him one of the shots had been close enough that the accountant heard it zing past his ear but he hadnt flinched just smiled you take your chances he stepped back from the quicksand deftly slipped his bound hands under his feet and in front of him he worked at the duct tape with his teeth took him ten minutes the clearing was still by then the accountant rubbed his wrists bringing back the circulation he adjusted his necktie then pulled out his cell and called junior its done said the accountant it go down like you wanted said junior a breeze stirred the grass around the edges of the quicksand pretty much nothings going to come back at us no the accountant watched a muddy bubble pop not a thing i cant abide thieves said junior i need to be able to trust the people work for me the accountant studied a couple of iridescent green dragonflies hovering over the surface of the water never understood why you dont just do things the easy way said junior the accountant pulled the leaf sean had used out of his fly zipped up his pants wheres the fun in that he snapped the phone shut and started back toward his house joe hartlaub when hes not practicing law joe hartlaub is a highly respected book reviewer so hes no stranger to what makes a good thriller come to life crossed double shows how sharp dialogue can make you feel like youre not just reading a story but also eavesdropping on the two people at the table next to you in a restaurant the characters in crossed double might be made of questionable moral fiber but they are not without their own code of honor as a father tries to explain to his wayward son you could say that this story is a parent lecturing a child about right and wrong but this is a thriller so make that wrong and wrong crossed double ct is unhappy he shouldnt be he has time on his hands money in the bank and pussy on the side he has breakfastcoffee cream fried egg sandwich cheese and sausage on a toasted bagel crunchy but not dark if you would be so kindsitting in front of him at lisas his favorite diner in columbus his son andy is sitting across from him and its still like looking in a mirror even though a quartercentury separates them all should be well except for the story that andy is telling him ct has to keep his hands on the table to keep from smacking the stupid out of the kid which ct thinks would take about three weeks once he started eight years out of high school and still fucking up like a threeyearold andy is telling ct that he borrowed money from kozee who is a whackjob everyone knows it hes a dlrdoesnt look rightand only a wet brain or someone fresh off of a greyhound bus would ever do business with him even the girls who troll the ohio state north campus bars with their trampstamps and thongs showing and who shave once a week whether they need to or not find kozee a little too outside of the box for what they have in mind kozee fills a doorway wide and high all muscle bald head cold blue eyes veins running up and down his arms like one of those transparency pictures in a medical school textbook he looks like hes waiting to catch a ride from one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse any one will do he gives off a primal odor of trouble of danger of death a long and slow one devised especially for you the greenbrier project boys who cruise the washington beach grid with impunity and occasionally venture into the glen echo maze step off when they see him shamble round the way there are a hundred stories about kozee told in alleys that run behind noname bars on east fifth on street corners in hawaiian point in doorways of shabby apartments in those sections of the short north where the gentrification begun twenty years ago hasnt quite reached and andy borrowed money from this guy even after hearing how kozee had gotten into the unsecured loan business a mex named jeffe had been running the corner action on fourth and eleventh kozee had started hanging around and jeffe having missed the memo about kozee got into his face about it being bad for business having a crazylooking fuckedup white boy hanging around scaring business away kozee hadnt said a word just headbutted the silly beaner breaking his nose and then biting it off like it was a tootsie roll or something spitting it back on him more or less in place one of jeffes crew tried to help him up but kozee said to stay away from him just let him roll around screaming in the parking lot let jeffe figure out if that was good or bad for business kozee was back on the corner the next day not saying it but everybody knew it was his corner now wasnt anyone there that was gonna argue with him least of all jeffe so nobody is fucking with kozee he is as they say shitting behind the tall cotton kozee is like a mutual fund hes involved in enough different enterprises so that if one dries up another usually picks up kozee took up a loansharking operation a few weeks ago when the mayor of columbus a high yellow with moviestar looks and the requisite ability to look competent without having a clue declared a hapless war on drugs so kozee drops drugs and starts lending money at an interest rate that makes chase visa look like a benevolent enterprise you dont want to be late with kozee he doesnt hire some bitch to call you every day and inquire about your payment he breaks your door down and beats your ass and this is the guy andy goes to for a loan andys thing with kozee however is only part of the elephant pissing on cts morning andys stupidity isnt limited to a business transaction with a psycho no andys wires are crossed worse than that as becomes evident when andy starts talking about rakkim ct knows rakkim a big guy an underachiever in his midthirties who for seven years has been delivering pizza for midnight crisis a twentyfourhour north campus pizza joint midnight crisis has been described as employing the unemployable since and unemployable certainly applies to rakkim who up until a couple of months ago was a quiet guy who walked around oblivious as if listening to an ipod through headphones or something except that he doesnt own an ipod the only time that ct had seen him at all animated was in the midnight crisis party room at rakkims thirtieth birthday party which featured cake liquor and a redheaded hooker from a high street strip club who gave rakkim a lap dance and a blow job while those assembled including the womans husband howled in beery approval according to andy however rakkim has been acting like a little bitch for the last few months some thirdstring ohio state tailback had given rakkim shit about paying for a large pepperoni and slapped him across the face rakkim totally out of character had jacked the guys jaw breaking it all of a sudden rakkim becomes a legend in his own mind acting out among other thingsand this according to andy is the cause of his instant problemrakkim hasnt paid for a nickel bag that jeff had fronted for him the month before ct remembers jeff from when andy was in high school a quiet kid who wouldnt say shit if he had a mouthful according to andy rakkim has no complaints with jeff about the quality of the bag or shorting on the weight andy solemnly assures ct that jeff would never do such a thing andy is pretending to be oblivious to the eye fuck that ct is giving him across the table at him ct wondering how do you know this now andy says rakkim just wont pay jeff or return his phone calls hes just ignoring jeff blowing him off jeff according to andy is not a bigtime dealer like a lot of the washington beach guys who deal small and local he sells only to his friends with just enough markup for his own stash and to make his rent and lights its a fragile street economics model that collapses if someone in the chain doesnt come through and rakkim didnt come through what has ct ready to play whackamole with his sons head in lisas is that andy has interjected himself into this mess a couple of months ago jeff for whom budgeting is a science on the order of quantum physics had been short for his rent andy being a bro and not wanting jeff to interrupt his dealing had slid a few benjamins to jeff now jeff is telling andy that since rakkim had stiffed jeff jeff had to stiff andy the result was that andy was short so i went up to see kozee andy says ct is looking at andy across the dining table as if he was a turd floating in cts coffee lisas café is quiet only the two of them as customers ct listening to this utter bullshit and torn between fatherly love and disgust he begins mentally ticking off the various problems herethe borrowing of money the drug involvement the total fucking stupidity he is hearing come out of his sons mouthand shakes his head as he looks out of the front window traffic on indianola is quiet this early in the morning and the sun is out promising the first decent day after months of a bitterly cold and depressingly gray winter ct had his breakfast sandwich cut into neat little squares and its now gone though he cannot remember having eaten any of it he is as is his custom dressed all in black mock turtleneck and pants shoes and socks hat and leather coat he sticks out at lisas like a stiff prick at a county fair he can tell that the owner of the restaurant a grayhaired hippie who hasnt changed his spectacles or his jeans since george mcgovern ran for president isnt sure whether he likes ct and andy coming here or not their hood ambience not fitting in with the peace love and brotherhood vibe of the place they sit and mind their own business and never raise their voices so fuck him and besides what is the guy going to say dont come here anymore youre scaring away my nader for president traffic for just a minute ct wishes he was somewhere else on a hotel balcony overlooking the atlantic ocean lying on a chaise lounge and reading a novel while two twentysomethings in bikinis flip a coin to see who will give him warm head first ct shakes his head and looks at his son you remember brandos first line in the godfather andy ct says looking at him over the top of his coffee cup andy shakes his head says no ct widens his cheeks by grimacing then does a more than passable don corleone asking andy why didnt you come to me first instead of going to a stranger andy laughs still amazed at twentyfive at his dads talent for mimicry its an uncomfortable question however and ct is serious andy shakes his head again i wanted to get this one done on my own i cant keep coming to you all of the time i understand ct says it takes an effort for him to keep his voice level but the last guy you want to have anything to do with is kozee you know how when you step in dogshit when youre wearing crosstrainers and it stays in the cracks forever and you need a knife to dig it out but theres always some left thats what dealing with kozee is like he takes another sip of coffee but i dont get why this was your problem it was jeffs problem and jeff is now your problem he borrowed the money from you but hes got money now and you dont he still has money for dope he hasnt been evicted or anything hes not an orphan and i saw him last night in the surly girl trying to pick up what i think was a woman who regardless was out of his league so hes got money your money ct watches andy sip on his soft drinkhow can anyone drink that shit at am its beyond himand waits for whats next andy hasnt changed since he was ten years old when he gets caught in the juices of his own lies hell slough deeper into the stew until hes neckhigh in his own bullshit andy surprises him though coming at it from another direction how do you know he asks andy should know better having heard enough stories about his dadhell he saw enough of them happening while he was growing upthat hes aware that little happens on the north and east sides of town that his dad doesnt know about but he has to ask how do you know he asks again ct ignores the question long enough to take a last sip of coffee wondering how anyoneeven an old hippieoutside of a police precinct house can fuck up a cup of folgers he motions for the check how about he says as he pulls a twenty out of his pocket to pay the bill ill show you jeff opens his eyes and he is looking up a big tube the tube is hard metal because when he starts to jump up he hits his forehead on it and considering all of the alcohol he drank the night before at the surly girl his head doesnt need any more aggravation aggravation is what he has though hes got two guys in his bedroom locked door notwithstanding both of them wearing ski masks jeff starts to jump out of bed but his forward progress is impeded by the barrel of the gun that is now pressed up against his left eye good morning starshine says the guy holding a gun the guy nearest his bed the guy wearing a gray ski mask and a blue peacoat jeff opens his mouth to scream but only a strangled little rasp comes out before the gun barrel is jammed between his teeth and down his throat the guy with the gun says wudda wudda in a singsong voice and wags his finger from side to side which for some reason scares jeff more than the gun the only thing i want to hear out of you is information my friend where are your benjamins no screams no bullshit no excuses just where they are and well be down the road jeff feels the gun barrel ease out of his mouth so he can talk but its still pointed at him pressed directly against his forehead hard his eyes are crossing trying to look at it he feels his bladder let loose under the covers first its warm and then almost immediately cold and hes embarrassed though the two guys dont seem to notice jeff tries to scream but his throat constricts and he cant manage much more than a hysterical whisper the back of the closet on the floor theres a suitcase full of dirty underwear its in there gray keeps his eyes on jeff but jerks his head at the other guy the one wearing a black ski mask and nods toward the closet black steps over to the walkin and begins digging through the mess on the floor and finds the suitcase he opens it up and hesitates for a second he doesnt want to stick his hand into the underwear which is so filthy that its almost twitching but he does anyway and after rooting through it for a couple of seconds he pulls out a thick wad of bills folded over with a rubber band around it he doesnt say anything just takes it over and holds it in front of grays line of vision gray sticks his chin out and nods and black peels off ten bills making sure that theyre not going to walk out of there with a michigan roll jeff is terrified he looks like linda blair in the exorcist sweating and his eyes all wild his head is pinned to the bed by the gun but his body is twitching uncontrollably that money is promised to some nasty folks and if it turns up missing jeff will be better off being shot the situation puts him next door to stupid and thats why almost before he knows that hes doing it he grabs for the gun trying to shove it away as he sits up thinking that somehow the two guys will be distracted enough that he can get away he hears a shout and then for just an instant the pain in his head gets a thousand times worse and then it all goes black fuck me ct says leaning back in the drivers seat of his car andy next to him theyre parked out toward the street in a medical building parking lot off of cleveland avenue in westerville just a couple of guys who look like theyre waiting for a wife or a girlfriend getting an mri or pap smear or some fucking thing two ski masksone gray one blackare sitting on the console between them fuck me who would have figured jeff for captain america yeah well captain america died last year and jeff is still alive andy says you think hes awake yet i dunno when he does wake up he needs to go down to university hospital and treat himself to a neurological ct shakes his head i smacked him pretty hard stupid asshole good thing the gun wasnt loaded theyd be finding little pieces of jeff all over washington beach for the next year ct takes his pistol out of its pocket holster and begins reloading the mm hollow points back into the clip keeping an eye on the parking lot so as not to give anyone walking by a heart attack arent you glad it wasnt loaded though andy asks not really ct slips the clip home and ratchets a round into the chamber if he had come out from under the covers with a derringer or something wed both be laid out on a cooling board down at schoedingers right now instead of taking in the local ambience ct wipes his hand across his face inhaling deeply watching a middleaged and grossly overweight couple walking in their general direction looking like a pair of twin dirigibles that have come untethered at a macys thanksgiving day parade now ct said gesturing lets see what our involuntary benefactor has bestowed upon us andy hands the wad of bills to his dad it is indeed not a michigan roll at all its just the opposite in fact a roll of fifties on the outside and the rest benjamins how much did you loan jeff ct asks three hundred you dumbshit ct starts pulling bills off the roll would you like that in fifties or hundreds sirrah fifties ct looks at him please andy says ct counts off six bills next time remember the first national bank of dad youll deal with a higher class of lender he begins counting the rest of the roll while doing an eerily ontarget impression of a stonedout jeff gee andy i dont have any moneyfive hundredya see dude rakkim really fucked me over man i dont have any moneyseven hundredim sorry andy but its rakkims fault and my rent is due and i dont have any moneynine hundred fiftymaybe you can stall kozee for a few days but im tapped out i dont have any moneyone thousand three hundred fifty ct exaggerates shuffling the wad into a neat pile and tapping it imitating oliver hardy i should drive back there and shoot that little cunt myself for being a lying sack of shit and causing my heartbeat to race what are we going to do with the rest of the money andy asks were going to donate it to the sisters of the poor claires andy is staring at ct incredulously what do you think were going to do with it were keeping it interest on your loan collection feeswhy by the time we total everything up jeff may still owe us some money ct puts the rest of the money in his pocket and says now look you need to keep bugging jeff about what he owes you if you stop asking him itll look strange and hell wonder about your sudden largesse but whats the lesson here andy shrugs but answers i should have come to you ct shakes his head that too but remember what i said about your problem being jeff hes not your friend he hung your ass out to dry ct shakes his head again shit hippies drug dealers fucking kozee what are you doing with these people anyway i taught you better than that andy doesnt say anything he has no answer not one that will make ct happy anyway he does have a question though what about kozee ct stares out the windshield for a minute then starts the car up ill take care of that freak he says kozee is laughing ct doesnt think hes said anything funny but kozee is mightily amused he throws his head back now really into it laughing his ass off for being a whackjob kozee has taken really good care of his teeth ct thinks a few fillings here and there but otherwise everything is straight and white and sparkling ct can see all the way back to kozees second fucking molars the guy has his mouth open so wide kozee and ct are sitting in what used to be a eleven its a blind pig now not even officially a store but there are some chips and loosies on the counter and beer in the cooler the fortyouncers that the mulies love and that are sold with impunity the candy on the counter appears to get dusted once a year whether it needs it or not theres an occasional rustle in the dark corners of the store and in the aisles and ct thinks that at some point a year or two ago orkin should have been called in he and kozee are behind the counter at a small table the only people in the store the rest of kozees crew is outside because after all ct is older and softlooking and if kozee had muscle in the room with him it would look like he couldnt handle things right kozee at the tail end of a laugh leans forward yknow everyone says youre straight up but youre out of your mind your sonandy rightowes me five three on the loan and two on the vig and im gonna lend him money again and again and again ct is trying to keep it calm its been a long day and its not even half over worse he is in danger of missing that allimportant oneoclock feeding he is thinking of how easy it would be for him to kill this goon it would cause more problems than it would solve but he is within a minute or two of past caring he says i dont like repeating myself kozee half rises out of his chair and leans over into cts face ct can see that it registers with kozee just with an eye blink but still it registers with kozee that ct doesnt lean back or give ground listen you old fuck you dont tell me what i do i didnt get all this he pauses for a second because ct is looking around at the halfempty shelves while kozee is talking to him looking at the paper on the floor that seems to move on its own the dust everywhere and his eyebrows slightly raised like hes thinking whoopeeshit disrespecting him this pisses kozee off he pokes his finger toward cts chest to get his attention back at least he tries to kozee suddenly cant move his finger ct has grabbed kozees finger in midpoke he thumps it down on the table thats between them and he comes up with some sort of little knife out of nowhere it looks like one of those guillotine blades and hes wearing it like a ring the blade is pressed against kozees pointer finger right where the finger meets his right hand i dont like being interrupted either ct says softly now sit down slowly and ill talk you listen ill walk out of here with a promise from you and youll still have your hand in the same shape it was when i walked in so you wont have to explain to your crew of little pussies how the head pussy got his finger cut off by an old man kozee slowly sits down this old fuck hes pulled a knife out of nowhere caught his finger and had it down on the table so fast it would take longer to tell about it like that fat old blind guy on the reruns of kung fu kozee for the first time since he was ten years old before he started hitting his growth spurt is actually scared now listen to me ct says slowly like hes talking to a cat youre not to lend money to my son anymore his credit is no good here you give him no reasons no hassles you just tell him no in return you get to keep your finger and as a show of good faith i keep quiet about that strapon hooker you visit the one in the secondfloor walkup on hudson and mcguffey with the lifesize naked dummy she keeps in the window to tell her clientele that she be open for bidness kozees eyes at this point are wideopen nobody is supposed to know about that shit he cant believe the shit that this old fuck knows how he talks how he acts not even breaking a sweat and the guy is serious he will take kozees finger kozee wants to kill this clown but the guy is reading his mind again yeah i can read your mind ct says and its the shortest book in the library if im struck by lightning or a car or something the mpeg of you and your whatever winds up on muchosuckodotcom and a halfdozen other web sites before my bodys even cold and ill take more than just your finger if you come after me are we solid kozee nods he is furious and scared and is thinking that he will kill this old guy if he ever gets the chance but at the same time he knows hell never get the chance oh ct says one other thing dont even look at my son youll pray for st joseph to give you a quick and happy death he runs the edge of the blade softly almost gently across kozees finger before he releases his grip and then he snaps his finger and the blade disappears like hes a sideshow magician or something kozee looks down and sees a thin line of blood at the joint and for just a second hes afraid to lift his hand off of the table for fear his finger will still be lying there ct gets up and throws three bills on the tableone two and threeand looks around again a contemptuous look on his face he walks through the door without looking back and gets into and starts up his car like hes just left church or something and he has nothing else to do for the day kozee is furious hes trembling so badly he doesnt think hell ever stop one of his boys comes in to use the bathroom and as he walks by the table he is staring at kozees hand the finger kozee sees is still bleeding three days later andy calls ct at am in the morning guess who wants to talk to you jeff ct says theres a long silence on the line did he call you too andy asks no did he say what he wanted he wants andy pauses and tries to contain himself but he cant help laughing for you to help him with a problem thats what i do ct says have him call me the following tuesday ct and jeff are sitting in lisas jeff has a circular bruise in the middle of his forehead from where ct while wearing his ski mask had pressed his special and another lump along the right side of his head where ct had pistolwhipped him ct has been listening to jeff lay everything out from rakkim ripping him off to borrowing money from andy to getting robbed by a couple of heavyduty mokes who are now apparently in the wind when hes done ct doesnt say anything for a minute just sits and sips his coffee then asks the waitress for a refill before he starts in on jeff first of all you tried to pull a game on andy jeff starts to protest but stops when ct raises his hand like a traffic cop dont ever do that again when were done here youre gonna pay andy back his three hundred and another hundred for his troubles jeff doesnt look happy but nods his head ct says i cant fucking hear your brains rattle is that a yes or a no yes yes sir im sorry jeff says ct waves it away okay we understand each other ct takes a sip of coffee and looks at the waitress for a moment bending over a table across the room the woman is new at lisas maybe her midthirties probably too young for him but she looks good in a pair of jeans bent over a table taking an order she is the type of slum goddess that the clintonville neighborhood has attracted by the busload for decades he imagines her for a moment on a hotel balcony kneeling in front of him then turns back to jeff now your problem isnt these mokes who ripped you off your problem is rakkim he owes you money you get it from him what he owes you and then some for your trouble how i am supposed to do that jeff says ct takes another sip of coffee and stares at jeff over the rim of the cup the coffee he thinks is really good this morning the old hippie who owns the place is home where he belongs so he cant fuck it up ct looks at the waitress again and she smiles over her shoulder at him ct smiles back at her then smiles at jeff how about he says ill show you lawrence light lawrence light is no stranger to the world of financial skullduggery that his character karen glick tackles in too rich to live and fear and greed as an awardwinning reporter covering wall street larry writes about the world glick investigates his reallife experience has given him insider information on the corrupting force of greed and has given him his own share of enemies along the way the lamented takes a slightly different turn as it examines the toll greed can take on the human conscience even in characters who seem to lack one of their own when their past pays them a visit some unsavory individuals discover how easily the line between reality and imagination is blurred but when all is said and done payback is as unavoidable as it is deadly the lamented when the man hed killed a year ago walked into the bar joe dogan was surprised so surprised that he fell off his stool dogan lay on his back on the sticky floor his eyes as rounded as the moon and mouthed words silently his glass rolled away from him trailing bourbon brad acton dead a year now smiled showing his fine teeth brads wellcut suit fit just right on his trim tall body and his wellcut blond hair flopped just right down his noble forehead brad seemed delighted to be here even though this had to be the seediest bar in camden new jersey arguably the nations seediest city when he was alive he had been perpetually delighted and everyone was delighted by him with a smile as bright as the day outside brad took a step toward where dogan lay sprawled dogan managed to make a sound noooooooooooo he closed his eyes and shook his head it must be the booze a few times before after tipping too many wet ones hed had hallucinations slowly warily dogan opened his eyes the bar was empty again the light from the revolving beer sign was the brightest thing in this dark place it twinkled off the treasury of neatly shelved booze bottles the afternoon shined beneath the door the bartender wobbling dogan climbed to his feet he steadied himself with a good strong grip on the edge of the bar i need a drink he bellowed where the hell was the bartender the little weenie had diligently poured his drinks without complaint even when dogan drove the two other customers out threatening to kill them if they didnt stop yapping about politics his lay on the bar dogan hefted the gun and admired it in the light from the revolving beer sign nice powerful weapon oh yeah the bartender left after dogan had waved the in his face dogan remembered now couldnt the jackass tell that dogan was only kidding around thats the gun you killed me with dogan gulped painfully as if he were swallowing an entire lemon down his suddenly parched throat he turned around with elaborate jawclenched care its in better shape than you are brad said pleasantly enough he stood a mere two feet from joe the breezy confident way brad actedthis could have been another election campaign stop for him dogan tried to say you cant be here instead it came out as yaaaacunbur why not brad said it was a year ago tonight dogan was breathing at a marathoners tempo he could hear his heart slamming wildly inside his rib cage as though it wanted to escape joe joe joe what am i going to do with you that noshow county job that robert stagg arranged for you isnt doing wonders for your character drinking in the middle of the day your job is supposed to be on the roads hard work but honest work iiiiiiiiiii brads smile grew still more incandescent robert and you and i really must get together tonight makes sense hows tonight for you he reached out to shake joes hand like any masterful politician brad was a skillful and eager shaker of hands dogan screamed and backpedaled in panic he knocked over several barstools and fell hard on his butt he lost his hold on the gun it went spinning off on the floor making wounded animal noises dogan crawled away from the bar with hands and knees scurrying he did not dare look back at brad robert stagg only paid you ten thousand to kill me brad said im worth a lot more than that ten thousand chicken feed too bad the justice department is going to bag him and on a corruption charge not for my murder how is that justice dogan stopped crawling when his head hit the jukebox fortunately for him drink dulled the pain the collision jolted the juke to life it played an old michael jackson tune the one with vincent price he slumped against the machine staring at the fading tattoo that decorated his thick forearm a heart pierced with an arrow fearfully dogan raised his gaze he brought his fingers sticky from the filthy floor to his stubbly cheeks skankys tavern was empty once more dogan clasped the jukebox to get up he moved unsteadily whether from the shock or from the bourbon to the bar en route he successfully stooped to collect his from the floor he knew he had to leave before brad appeared again but first dogan trudged behind the bar and hoisted the bourbon bottle he glugged down torrents of the blessed stuff burning his gullet and soothing his nerves the bottle emptied dogan threw it against the wall it shattered satisfyingly checking around for brad dogan stalkedactually weavedout of skankys he shoved the into the pocket of his ratty jacket the early spring sun assaulted his retinas he stumbled as the pink purple and green circles swirled then they disappeared and he could see again with his head tilted back the first thing he saw was the soaring mass of the benjamin franklin bridge over the wrecked rooftops his chin fell to his chest two small kids maybe around nine or ten were messing with his motorcycle one had the stones to sit on it his pipestem arms extending to the handlebars vroom vroom he cried with joy as he twisted the throttle in imaginary acceleration dogan pulled out the keys to his harley but dropped them on the stained sidewalk get off my damn bike you little bastards he roared at them then he slowly reached down for the keys taking care not to fall over you drunk as a monkey shouted the one sitting on the bike both kids tittered the keys retrieved dogan drew himself upright he didnt like kids he didnt like blacks the truth was he didnt like anybody and he doubledisliked anybody messing with his bike even christ himself had no business messing with joes bike and christ hadnt been to camden in a long while dogan struggled the gun out of his jacket pocket the sight was caught in some fabric he ripped it free white mans packing the kid on the bike cried out and he jumped off agilely laughing the two of them ran away stewed as he was dogan realized he shouldnt be brandishing his weapon on the street not for fear of cops who were as scarce as a brontosaurus in the fossilized ruins of camden this neighborhood dogan knew was mister mans turf called h town for heroin to the north was dope city and to the south was crackville but in this swath of camden mister man was the absolute ruler his power akin to kim jongils in h town no one pulled out a piece unless mister man okayed it mister man had the monopoly on firepower here dogan stuffed his back into his pocket and jerkily mounted his bike he kickstarted the harley night rod into life in a flash of chrome he sped his rpm screamer through the rutted roads of h town past the unending series of boardedup graffitimarred row houses and stores past the dry fire hydrants past the dead streetlamps he headed for wilson boulevard where he could open her up if a cop stopped him he had the juice to skip away free robert stagg would ensure that what joe dogan needed was wind through his hair what he needed was to wipe out the daytime nightmare of brad acton dead a year now the memorial ceremony for brad acton droned on ad nauseam the marbled colonnaded lobby of the county courthouse overflowed with worshippers recalling how their beloved brad had been snatched from them a year ago today the courthouse sat on market street a drab strip of bailbond offices and pawnbroker shops it was the largest employer in camden make that the largest legitimate employer a concrete depressionera monument to the futility of government to bring about a civil society in camden the courthouse was festooned with too many blownup photos of the late great brad robert stagg a highlevel county official sat in the front row and suffered through the sentimental twaddle about the historic acton legacy both new jersey us senators and the governor were on hand up at the podium was that moron denny shaughnessy blathering about how brad was the best freeholder this county has ever seen a few seats down from stagg was dennys wife crying bitterly brad had been screwing her for years brad wouldve been our next congressman from the first district denny was saying then a year ago at midnight some son of a bitch gunned him down on his own doorstep in haddonfield for gods sake denny a fellow freeholder from the suburbs was offended that a crime would occur in wealthy haddonfield violence was too gauche to be permitted there it was as if haddonfield had become camden to staggs right was brads widow who still looked great if you didnt look closely she wore a donna karan suit that needed dry cleaning her knees were spread like a schoolgirls she chewed her brunette hair everyone had been dismayed that stagg had married diana acton so soon after brads death but since brads murder had devastated her they got used to the idea take me home robert diana said in that littlegirls voice she had adopted lately this is all stupid if they ever find the coward who murdered brad denny ranted i want him to swing from the highest tree this will be over in a moment stagg whispered to his wife containing his exasperation at her at denny at the whole idiotic ceremony he wanted it to be over too theres no need for it diana went on stagg shushed her gently he had always treated her gently even when he shouldnt i played football at haddonfield high with brad and thanks to him we won the state championship two years in a row denny said calming down some with rancor stagg recalled his service as team manager when he waited on brad like a servant when he was the target of the teams jokes and pranks when even brad called him stagg the bag for his shapeless body once brad became a freeholder he started to turn around our county seat denny said if hed lived camden would be cleaned up brad always kept a promise the countys white bucolic suburbs surrounding camden pretended to be impressed by that pledge stagg remembered ruefully the truth was the wealthy suburbanites didnt care about blighted innercity camden the countys shameful dark heart a drugridden gangrun hell when brad agreed to back stagg for the board of freeholders the countys governing body stagg bravely said hed campaign on resurrecting the city of camden too brad told him not to bother he had that covered so denny shaughnessy nattered away sheila shaughnessy sobbed and diana actonshe insisted on keeping the name from her first marriagetwiddled her thumbs in her lap robert stagg wished she had taken a bigger dose of halcion his attention wandered around the lobby transformed nauseatingly into the saint brad cathedral he knew almost everyone in the crowd and he liked that they gazed at him with respect much as they had with brad he had been asked to speak of course yet had demurred out of concern for diana he needed to be at her side constantly staggs eyes bugged out there in the crowd by the elevators standing tall the blond hair over his forehead smiling as if every day was his birthday staring at stagg stagg whimpered involuntarily whats wrong freeholder stagg asked jimmy sparacino the democratic partys county chairman who sat to staggs left nothing nothing nothing the vision of brad had vanished in the throng i wish youd spoken today sparacino whispered you were brads best friend i understand about poor diana but sparacino liked to refer to brads widow as poor diana luckily for her new husband diana was far from poor she had inherited a load from her rich family and brads fortune had passed to her also now it was staggs stagg thanked the chairman for his concern this is a rough day for her he said in a low voice she couldnt hear all the memories rushing backits hard to handle when brad chose stagg to run sparacino had objected saying staggs fat hes bald hes ugly the only reason to vote for him is hes your gofer since brads death sparacino had changed his mind and come to value staggs brains as he should having none himself at long painful last the ceremony ended the dignitaries stood up to greet gab and guffaw smiling is to politics what dribbling is to basketball but stagg wasnt in the mood to play the game today he took dianas arm and led her out he passed the us attorney javers who was flanked by his young dobermans in their brooks brothers suits they regarded stagg hungrily well see you tomorrow morning at nine freeholder stagg javers said from somewhere above his bow tie sharp stagg couldnt meet the mans eyes and instead looked to the side toward the crowd talk to my lawyer mr javers not me as they reached the crowded door diana said in her nursery school cadences what did that meanlooking man in the bow tie want some nonsense justice department fishing expedition about the widening of salem turnpike in lindenwold i pushed it through the board stagg didnt mention to her that the road project benefited a monster shopping mall that went in a year later or let on who owned the mall diana walked like her old regal self perfect posture proud stride too bad she didnt talk like her old self the ceremony was stupid stupid stupid stupid whatever you say diana in fact this was dianas only sensible utterance in a long time i know this was difficult for you its stupid because brad is alive alive her laugh was one hed never heard before almost like a crows cawing he was here today i talked to him why have a memorial ceremony when hes alive stagg grimaced youre mistaken diana i myself saw someone in the crowd who looked a lot like brad but brad is dead were all on edge today as they reached staggs volvo parked in his designated spot his cell phone rang the display read homey the clown he groaned and flipped it open freeholder stagg he said full of entitlement and selfassurance brads come back for me diana said getting into the car a barry whitedeep voice came on the line hello neighbor the gangster got a kick out of his recent move to a haddonfield mansion from his old camden row house are we good for tomorrow or are we bad the confidence in staggs voice faltered the us attorney has nothing to link you and me and salem turnpike this is a crock javers cant enough neighbor mister man said i be checking is all while youre at it check where my money is my banker in luxembourg says not one red cent has arrived this month from you like brad mister man was ruffled by nothing and no one always with you and the money brad acton never mentioned the money he had class up the ass neighbor you not just a freeholder you a freeloader well said brad the classy guy what an original viewpoint now if that will be all i need to take my wife i got me another reason to call we got us a problem wheres brad diana called from the passenger seat stagg sagged oh no now what that crazymother whitetrash boy of yours the one with the noshow job on the county road crew the drug lord sounded angry that drunken hunk of human garbage named joe dogan he be in one of my bars in h town today skankys pointing his piece at my peeps like he the frito bandito customers and bartender went running then he aimed the gun at two little kids can you believe that oh lord not dogan stagg shook his head fine ill give him hell again i know dogan took care of our problem with brad acton neighbor but i am sick of his presence on this earth im not gonna give him hell im gonna send him to hell i mean little kids do what you want with him im tired of dogan too when stagg settled his copious behind into the drivers seat he saw that diana was smiling and humming im glad youre back in a good mood diana he said hed come to the house tonight dianas strange grin widened he looks wonderful brad is back i am very very happy the moon was a tight white fist overhead by nightfall joe dogan was getting very frustrated not to mention very drunk he sat on a bench in a deserted park by the cooper river a full sixpack of beer was beside him sweating still cold the other sixpack was almost gone only one can remained in its plastic yoke cursing he fished his phone out of his pocket and for the umpteenth time stabbed redial he got staggs cellphone voice mail as usual call me back you fat sack of crap dogan snarled hed left the identical message the time before and the time before that stagg had told dogan never to contact him unless there was an emergency like the cops asking about brad actons death or if dogan got into a jam that would interest the law and dogan was never to go to where stagg lived a year ago that had been in a garden apartment in cherry hill now dogan knew from the scuttlebutt stagg lived in acton s palatial house and was married to the widow what a babe like diana acton saw in a piglet like robert stagg was beyond dogan must have a wart on the end of it dogan muttered as he popped open the last brewski in his first sixpack wait in his wallet he had a scrap of paper with brad actons home phone number it was unlisted stagg had given him the number a year ago so he could call and be sure acton was home dinner was a horror show the latest cook refused to set a place for brad when diana screamed at herfor not whipping up brads favorite dessert peach cobblerthe woman stormed out stagg tried to settle diana down in front of the tv in the cinemalarge entertainment center a discovery channel show on hunting was playing a deer fled through the woods with baying hounds in pursuit but she wouldnt stop chattering about brads miraculous return to life stagg tried to watch the show but her comments grew more and more irritating brad was the loveliest man and you have no money really i make plenty of money how all you ever did was puppydog behind brad she gave a brittle laugh oh i know you are taking bribes from that gangster who moved to haddonfield thats why the mean man in the bow tie wants to put you in prison slumping even deeper into the huge overstuffed chair stagg said diana maybe you should go to bed have you taken your meds this behavior was new shed been mostly lethargic in recent months the doctor said to be careful if she became delusional the risk of suicide was small but couldnt be shrugged off stagg kept the kitchen knives locked up ditto the german luger which brads father had brought back from world war ii since brad is back we should get our marriage annulled i cant be married to you you arent brad i only married you because i needed someone to take care of me but you are nothing how thoughtful of you to say im going outside brad will take care of me again stagg fetched a large sweater and poured himself a modest measure of chivas it was a bit chilly on the patio but better than listening to her insanity he sloshed scotch around in his tumbler standing next to the empty pool with its deadleafcoated bottom the plastic rope with the floats which divided the deep end from the shallow lay coiled on the greening lawn like a dead snake staggs memory fell back to high school days brad always had a pool party here for the football team stagg as team manager was also invited senior year to everyones delight brad and denny swung little stagg by his ankles and wrists and tossed him into the pool stagg couldnt swim that was even funnier the night after that party stagg stayed hidden among the trees and spied on brad and diana the virgin queen of haddonfield high it was the apex of his life up to then seeing brad deflower lovely naked diana poolside another big worldbeating memory how tending to the stunned diana in the wake of brads death he brought her groceries in on a night as starkly moonlit as this one how diana rose from the swimming pool water glistening on her bare skin her fortyyearold body as taut as a teenagers how under that hunters moon she had smiled at him diana naked for him that night was the true apex dianas shrill cry broke the reverie she stood in the french doors to the study you have a phone call stagg trundled inside the landline phone display read joe dogan wonderful that dirtbag must have kept the unlisted number from a year ago what do you want diana was climbing the stairs im tired wake me up when brad comes dogan had ingested his usual royal portion of spirits you gotta help me out had dogan heard that he was on mister mans priority boarding list for evacuation from the planet im getting sick of this you idiot you think youre smarter than everyone dogan slurred well im not the idiot youre the idiot brilliant comeback stagg said repartee worthy of dorothy parker never met the bitch dogan said we got a problem we do huh let me guess you got another drunkdriving arrest on that stupid motorcycle and i have to fix things with the cops no your supervisor on the county road crew called and you told him youd kill his children if he didnt back off no you were drunk and groping women at tgi fridays happy hour and one called the cops ive bailed you out so many times for so much asinine behavior that im losing track with a moan dogan said have you seen him who brad acton came to me in a bar in h town this afternoon he said he wanted to see us both tonight stagg sighed my wife had the same hallucination her high on meds you high on booze astute observers the two of you he was real man i mean not like a ghost i couldnt like see through him i can see through you you are a serious alcoholic go get dried out he knew how much you paid me to do him plus the noshow job on the county roads how could he know that because it is in your drinkaddled head today is the anniversary it brings back the trauma makes you imagine things you dont have to be freud to understand that he knew you are gonna get a barbedwire enema from the feds mister man pays you off stagg everybody knows it you know nothing stagg snarled brad was ten times as dirty as me he came from family money but wanted more he introduced me to mister man then when javers came sniffing around brad wanted me to be the fall guy he wanted me to take mister man down too i remember every minute from a year ago meantime king brad stays simonpure well haha brad for the first time in your pampered life you lost dogan didnt seem to be listening anymore i tell you he seemed like flesh and blood like you and me i bet i could put another bullet in him and thatd be that check yourself into rehab you cretin i dont want to face him alone tonight man stagg slammed the phone down a wind came up and blew about the budding branches of the ghostly trees winter and summer warred in the sudden draft off the river and dogan shivered what was he doing sitting here like a frozen pond toad dogan got on his bike and blasted away from the riverfront park in a jiffy his harleys loud engine was invading the smooth quiet roads of haddonfield brad actons hometown in haddonfield trees flower first and their perfume seeped down from the elegant mosaic of branches that covered the old lanes the harley brayed down kings highway the towns main street where subtly lit colonial storefronts displayed chic clothing and leather goods tomorrow the slender blond women of the marvelous men of haddonfield would float past those storefronts browsing blasé a year had gone by and beer had fuzzed his thinking hence dogan took a while to find brad actons house he clattered through the lovely streets until he saw the right landmarks left at the threecenturyold church right at the giant whiteboard mansion left onto cypress avenue front yard carriage lamps shed soft glows on the brick and flagstone walkways flowing from the smooth road to the fine wood doors that guarded the aristocratic stone houses through the latticed windows of those handsome homes came the lamplight of the haddonfield elite who ran the world acton s house though lay in darkness girded by vigilant firs watched over by towering oaks it seemed almost uninhabited then dogan saw the two cars parked to the side staggs volvo and diana actons jaguar he killed the bikes motor and dismounted it had been a year ago around midnight about now his watch said he couldnt stand there forever hypnotized by the house the night the clock dogan walked cautiously up the sloping wellbarbered lawn bathed in intense moonglow the wind a devilish mix of warm and cold made small gasps among the trees flowers a shadow shimmered among the tree trunks dogan gave a start and yelped he yanked his out of his coat pocket tearing more fabric killed you once ill kill you twice bastard he said through bared teeth his gun moved in small semicircles pointed at where the movement had been as he marched up the lawn with his attention fixed on the trees he missed seeing the anklehigh miniwall bisecting the lawn in front of him dogan went down hard swearing hell last year making this same approach hed tripped on the miniwall he had been drunker then but this couldnt be a coincidence the wind came again colder now and enveloped him with a harsh sense of dread was he reliving the same night from a year ago the castlelike front door loomed in front of him dogan punched the doorbell button and heard sweet chimes inside as he had a year ago he hit the button again as he had a year ago somehow he smelled burnt gunpowder as he had a year ago stagg had clumped wearily up the stairs left his clothes on the floor of his dressing room and climbed into his pajamas he heaved into the broad bed where diana lay asleep good no more nonsense from her he had barely slipped into sleeps welcome oblivion when the doorbell chimes rang repeatedly diana was screaming dont go down there brad dont go he was fully awake im robert dammit finally dogan heard footsteps beyond the door a muffled voice asked him who he was and what he wanted just like a year ago he replied the same its me joe dogan roberts guy its about mister man an inside light went on the bolt slid open the door swung inward a man was in the threshold brad acton stood there in his nice suit with his nice hair smiling no one could smile like brad dogan raised the gun and pulled the trigger the first shot splattered that handsome head he pumped bullet after bullet into the body as it lay on the persian rug he stumbled down the lawn he needed a drink was he out of beer a mercedes slid to the curb beside the parked harley a large black man in a white suit and fedora climbed out he glanced at the motorcycle then spotted joe dogan weaving toward him joe carried a gun in the moonlight mister man could see the slide was back and the weapon was empty im on my way home and i see that this human garbage has blown into haddonfield they dont allow your punkass kind here i killed brad again dogan said do tell a lotta killing going around mister man pulled his glock out of its shoulder holster and blew a large hole in worthless joe dogans chest the fool fell backward onto brad actons fine lawn and began to bleed on it mister man turned to his car then stopped when he glimpsed the silhouette of a man up in the acton house a tall man standing in an upstairs window taking in all that had happened on the moonbright lawn a witness was it stagg mister man had better find out the state of play before the neighbors called the cops of course the lots here were far apart and the refined folk nearby may not have heard the gunfire or if they did hear they wouldnt know what it was this was haddonfield not h town he had a little time he figured mister man loped up the lawn glock at the ready the tall fellow in the window waved he was blond welldressed and familiar then he stepped out of sight the front door gaped open mister man stepped gingerly inside oh sweet jesus a pajamaclad robert stagg lay on the fine carpet in a lake of blood his bald head was a mass of goo bullet holes riddled his globular body he was as dead as camden s hopes you cant come in here this is brad actons house a womans voice mister man looked up diana acton lovely in a diaphanous nightgown stood in the hall she held a luger in a twohanded grip it was pointed at mister man he held out a conciliatory hand and advanced toward her speaking low lets be cool i was in business with your husband both of them diana opened fire mister man keeled over and landed on staggs body the gangster twitched a few times the blood stained his white suit whether it was staggs blood or mister mans own blood was hard to tell she dropped the gun robert stagg joe dogan and mister man were all dead diana was pleased brad always kept a promise diana turned she had heard a voice say her name im coming brad darling she called with a radiant smile im coming to bed she ran up the stairs lisa jackson lisa jackson is known for her legion of fans and for her fascination with the motives of her characters her stories explore the puzzle of complex relationships and

her voice trembled was no big deal the original drama queen that was mom i have to go okay i yelled my response through the closed bathroom door in the upper hallway i wasnt going to put up with her overhyped paranoia not that she didnt have a reason to be frightened terrified even but hey someone had to get the job done and that someone had to be me no one else was volunteering you should call the police there was that nice detectivewhat was his name kent something i cant remember noah kent i thought noah way noah police not this time forget it mom hes still on the force of course he was

parker ace detective handsome as sin and a major prick of course i still had his number oh yeah thats what id do give parker a call ill handle this on my own i wasnt about to be budged i put on my bra which gently padded added two cup sizes to my breasts giving my slim frame a little bit of a curvelike hers then i slipped on a sleek black dress one with a nippedin waist and wide neck a little on the sexy side for my taste but tonight it would do nicely i thought critically eyeing my reflection in the vanity mirror and besides the invitation had indicated everyone was to wear black just as there were those all white parties silvio damato had gone with a black theme all the better after pulling my hair away from my face and securing it i donned a dark auburn wig which curled softly under my chin and brushed my shoulders spidery eyelashes much longer than my own highlighted my eyes which were now a deep shade of brown compliments of tinted contact lenses a little padding tucked into in my cheeks helped with the transformation my teeth were a little offnothing i could do about that but keep my mouth closed i added a tiny spot of color under my cheekbones and blended it with my foundation making my complexion appear seamless carefully i brushed on a touch of smoky eye shadow the effect was amazing i was barely recognizable no one at the party would suspect my true identity which was perfect i stepped out of the bathroom made my way down the hall in threeinch heels then discarded them for a pair with a shorter heels that didnt pinch my feet so much besides they were easier to walk in considering the fact that id be holding a glass of champagne while mingling with the other guests on uneven flagstones the second pair just made more sense especially if i needed to run and of course i snagged a pair of leather gloves that i tucked into my purse once in the hallway again i paused for a second at the open door to ians room a cold sense of déjà vu settled over me like a shroud everything was as it had been a set of transformers action figures displayed upon a bookcase with a few legos picture books his twin bed perfectly made the dinosaur motif evident in the curtains of the wide windowoh god the window my throat tightened as i stared at it the innocentlooking panes overlooking the garden and farther away over the tops of other houses on the hill the bay with its blue waters turning dusky as night approached i closed my eyes leaned against the doorjamb thought of him ianonly fivepoor poor baby are you all right mothers voice floated up the staircase from the floor below i had to pull myself together no matter how much pain blackened my soul tonight i had to act as if i were carefree as if i truly was the woman i was pretending to be i took a deep breath before clearing the thickness from my throat im fine mom i lied sounding cheery be down in a second now just do this at the top of the secondfloor landing i stared down the curved steps and faced dear old mom who on her scooter gasped as she saw me ohmygodii cant believe it i forced myself down the long flight think ill be able to pull this off i asked making my voice breathy and low and twirling at the top of the landing ii youre in shock that was encouraging very encouraging ill take that as a yes i hurried down the stairs where my mother sat dumbstruck in the marble foyer soft light from the chandelier bathing her in its kind illumination at somewhere north of seventy she still looked great her hair a shimmering platinum shade only a few slight wrinkles visible her petite body if not as svelte as it once had been damned close if it hadnt been for the scooter she would seem a decade younger than her age you cant do this she said desperately gnawing at her lower lip you wont get away with it just watch me seriously look mom no one will recognize me and shell be there thats why you cant go mom was in a near panic good lord the woman was highstrung dont worry if anything goes wrong ill call and you can dial to your hearts content no reason to be snide she sniffed then let it go in the front hall closet i found a long black coat and a scarf both of which i donned as mom fiddled with the cross dangling from a chain around her neck no doubt she was whispering a dozen hail marys to save my wretched vindictive soul little did she know that my own heart was beating as wildly as a timpani being pounded by a frantic heavy metal drummer my hands were clammy and adrenaline spurted crazily through my veins justbe careful i will i promised i reached for the doorknob but stopped and faced my poor mother once more you know i have to do this she killed ian you cant be certain i know she did it i was there i found him in the garden i pointed frantically to the side of the house the area id loved as a child with its dark foliage creeping vines and gravel paths leading to secret private hiding places where squirrels nested and owls roosted i hated that place now i fought the urge to break down completely i saw her in the window looking down but she tried to blame me i said and you mom nodded slightly unable to meet my eyes as the ancient grandfather clock near the door ticked off the remaining seconds of our lives he was just a child i reminded her gently your only grandson moms eyes closed she swallowed back tears and rubbed the gold cross for all it was worth this isnt the way its not right her lower lip quivered an eye for an eye mom its in the bible wait she was confused an eye for an eye but i thought you were just going to talk to her damn just an expression anger burned through my blood again the same quiet rage that overtook me every time i thought of my babys senseless death my outrage and pain hadnt always been silent id wailed and screamed shouted oaths and sworn vengeance when id found my sons body broken from a horrible push through his bedroom window id come apart at the seams had been forced into seclusion drugged and analyzed and then of course accused of being out of my mind id actually had to suffer accusations that i had shoved my son through the window to his death on the garden path below it made me sick to think about it even now i swallowed back the bile that rose in my throat and shuddered at the image scored in my memory ians tiny broken body lying upon the cold stones of the manor black rage poured through my soul i thinki think youwe should let it go mom said blinking to stave off tears its been five years and she got away with murder your grandsons murder oh please dont do this too late mom i just want to talk to her let her know that im on to her give her a good jolt why would she confide in you because they always do murderers want to crow to brag about their accomplishments orif it truly was an accident ill see her guilt her remorse she wont be able to hide her emotions you think clearly mom was skeptical from the hallway near the den came moms little dog peppy a brownandwhite terrierchihuahua mix toenails clicking on the polished marble the beast gave me its usual responsea nasty little snarl peppy stop that the dog jumped into moms lap and continued to growl as it regarded me with dark suspicious eyes time to leave dont worry ill be back soon i brushed a kiss over her brow leaving a lipstick mark and rubbing it out before peppy had the chance to lunge then i dashed out the door my heels clicking on the brick walkway that curved to the front gates ferns and rhododendron shivered in the breath of wind and rising mist mom really pissed me off i love her to death but she has never been one to take action ever while dad was alive she let him push her around just so she could live in this grandiose house perched high on the hill the old dickens estate with its four floors brick facade and glittering beveled glass windows had an incredible view of san francisco bay the angular rooftops of victorian mansions and the golden gate bridge nice house but was it worth the verbal and physical abuse shed had to endure until dad finally decided to end it all by hanging himself in his private den i didnt think so in the garage i found my old nearly forgotten bmw and climbed behind the wheel then saw her mercedes barely used parked in another bay wouldnt the benz be a better choice arrive in a shiny luxury car and have it valet parked rather than screeching up in the old three series with the dent in one side of course it would mom kept her keys in a crystal dish on a small louis xvi table near the front door and the gun the damned pistol id forgotten to pack it in my purse it was up in my bedroom where id left it earlier but id have to make some excuse to run back upstairs luckily mom couldnt get that decrepit old elevator to move fast enough to chase me down even if she wanted to i checked my watch no doubt id be late even with the valet parking but so be it i hurried back inside bolstering myself to go one more round with lorna and her insipid dog security detail what a laugh lucas parker walked through a twohundredyearold breezeway that was part of this aging monastery the monks were long gone the archdiocese having sold off the stucco and stone buildings and rolling acres to ernesto damato over a century before nowadays the vines theyd so carefully cultivated produced some of the best grapes for syrah in the country making damato winery worldrenowned thus silvio damato junior was currently the king of syrah if you believed his overblown press parker didnt in fact he didnt give a rats ass about any kind of wine not that it mattered he was just the hired help tonight an excop from the local police force here to ensure that the snobs and wannabe snobs sipping the famed wine and nibbling on overpriced cheese and razorthin crackers were safe and why wouldnt they be located in the hills surrounding the quaint tourist town of sonoma in the valley of the moon damato monastery estates had never to date had a breakin not one bottle of their prizewinning syrah had been reported stolen never even a trespasser discovered not so much as one grape missing parker thought hiring security was overkill yet here he was wearing a tux with a collar that was far too tight his shoulderholster properly hidden feeling useless hed retired from the force a couple of years back early retirement thanks to a stakeout gone wrong and a stray bullet that had lodged in the lumbar region of his spine the bullet had been surgically removed and parker had learned to walk again but active duty was out his partner noah kent still felt like shit that he wasnt able to stop the bullet that had nearly severed parkers spine like so many cops kent thought he was superman your name isnt clark kent parker still told him kent was still on the job and parker was a pi one with a very slight limp and sometimes a lot of pain and hed known he should never have taken this job unfortunately hed been chosen for this detail by silvio damato junior himself silvio just happened to be parkers brotherinlaw well technically exbrotherinlaw as resa a few years back had decided that living with a cop just wasnt her style trouble was parker had known it wouldnt work a long time before shed come to terms with the truth theyd married over silvio seniors objections then divorced over his shame no one in silvio damatos lineage had ever been divorced parker could still hear the old man ranting that fake italian accent rumbling as he called theresa resa my bambina resa how could she do this to me i am blessed with six children and my youngest brings shame to the family it breaks my heart there was plenty of that going around parker thought as he shot a look toward silvio senior who had passed the family business to the hands of his namesake a couple years ago silvio seniors dark eyes were huge behind his spectacles as he pressed a plump manicured hand onto juniors shoulder whispering always whispering in his ear when parker had married resa hed had no clue how enmeshed a family could be each member tied into another torn and tortured loyal and yet longing to escape from silvio juniors need to please and outdo his father right down to the seething jealousies of mario and antonio that they had not been the chosen ones the family was rotten with dysfunction anna now collecting appetizers would no doubt head to the restroom to purge soon julianna who was greeting guests at the door had gone under the knife so many times that parker was convinced her eyes wouldnt close at night only theresa his resa had survived the family unscathed or so hed once thought add to that the sick rivalry between silvio senior and his brother alberto damato bad relations that didnt even die with alberto awhile back parker had learned the hard way that the damato familia was one sick clan in the end hed found it ironic that resas old man had bulked so much over their divorce while the rest of the family was quietly going to hell according to family lore the divorce had nearly caused resas ailing mother octavia to die of mortification however octavia had survived and was now holding court in the garden a bejeweled cane at her side and a blanket on her lap she was attended by one of her sons antonio the happily married father of four who couldnt keep it in his pants octavia didnt notice parker as she sipped from a glass that didnt so much as quiver in her elegant long fingers the matriarch forever diamonds dripped from her ears and encircled her throat wrists and fingers not one to hide her wealth was octavia damato all six of her children were in attendance parker caught sight of mario and anna two of resas siblings schmoozing up clients near the flowering vines that had overtaken a wall of the old cloister he told himself he was prepared in case resa showed he tried not to think about her about how hard hed fallen or how fast it had been unlike him until theresa damato he hadnt believed in love at first sight or being obsessed with a woman or even settling down but resa with her smoky brown eyes and naughty knowing smile had caught his attention she was coy and smart and when she threw her head back and laughed that throaty little chuckle he was doomed dark coppery hair long legs a tight butt and firm breasts that filled his handsyou get the picture getting her into bed hadnt been difficult shed been as hot for him as hed been for her and their lovemaking had been nothing short of mercurial until it had gone cold stone cold on the heels of ians death oh hell his heart twisted and he forced his mind to the present to the damato winery and the party where he was supposed to be sharp and steady the heat even though he was no longer a cop what the hell was he doing here why had silvio asked for him by name but parker knew parkers duty was not so much to keep out terrorists thugs or wouldbe thieves but more to ensure that the riffraff specifically anyone connected to silvio seniors brother alberto did not make an appearance years ago silvio senior had scammed half the family fortune from the significantly less clever alberto his younger brother alberto had died a few years back but his progeny had survived and they all had long memories fueled by acrimony parker walked through an arbor wrapped in grape vines and about a billion sparkling lights the evening was cool bordering chilly but the party was in full swing knots of guests clustered outside on the flagstone patio an open garden area that had once connected the cellarium a storage area for the monastery and the chapter house where the monks had met to mete out chores and discuss their sins rumor had it that some monks had been buried beneath the flooring though parker thought that sounded like something damato had made up to give the place more mystique along one wall inside the alcove surrounding the garden a string quartet was playing classical pieces that parker vaguely recognized silvios attempt at culture damatos garage was open his array of vintage cars from the s s and s all parked on a gleaming tile floor their glossy exteriors polished to a high almost liquid gloss past the courtyard and through the main house a waterfall cascaded into an infinity pool that shimmered turquoise amid mosaic tiles and thick fragrant shrubs everywhere liveried waiters passed out stemmed glasses of the most famous of the damato vintages on the far end of the courtyard was a raised dais complete with arbor lights and microphone silvio junior was slated to speak to the group a handpicked assortment of bigwigs invited to sample his latest vintage a bunch of crap parker thought and checked his watch a big black guy with a shaved head stood with his back to one aged pillar oscar silvios personal bodyguard and leader of his security team looked even more uncomfortable than parker felt his collar pinched tight around the thick muscles of his neck and he was three hundred pounds if he was fifty the mans going to be speakin in a few everyones got to have their cell phone turned off he glanced at the open door where a thin blond woman in fiveinch heels and shimmery silk dress paced the foyer cell phone pressed against one ear an unlit cigarette in her free hand everyone here in the courtyard parker clarified oscar shook his head everyone period including you no way thats what he said im just passin it on ill be behind the stage you take the front okay parker wasnt going to let the phone thing drop security needs phones we have walkietalkies he reminded him ancient technology silviohes not exactly hightech now i can carry a loaded sidearm in here but no phone oscar rolled his palms up to the starlit sky i just follow the rules i dont make em and then he spied the blonde in the foyer and took off on a mission parker watched him go no way in hell was he turning off his phone he switched it to vibrate left it in his pocket and decided that was good enough silvio would have to deal with it the way parker figured it silvio damato was lucky parker was here at all at that moment silvio junior appeared on the dais all eyes turned toward the robust man with the shock of silver hair and thick black eyebrows though barely fiveeight silvio had a presence about him that was only enhanced by his armani suit and italian leather shoes he appeared strong and confident a man to be reckoned with rightful heir to all fortunes damato planting his back to a brick column parker scanned the old monastery grounds with a critical suspicious eye old rambling structures like this could be a nightmare to secure though the walls and adjacent structures had a fortresslike appearance they were filled with dark nooks and deep crannies unseen hiding spots there were shadowy caverns cut into the hillside to house the wine barrels as well as a maze of underground tunnels that could easily become routes of escape should anyone want to take a shot at the top runner for the wine countrys vintner of the year there was access through the grape receiving platform and shipping dock a bell tower loomed high above the tasting room which had once been the church the tower itself was dark now the staircase leading upward secured and yet he glanced up at the highest point of the turret focusing on the belfry that dark open space under the roof for a second he thought he saw movement weird hed checked the lock himself so he knew it was secure probably a bat as it was a little past twilight when bats and owls and insects stirred squinting he saw no dark shape hunched near the railing no assassin setting up a highpowered rifle aimed at the stage and silvio damatos cold heart but really who would want to harm silvio or this his pride and joy a question hed asked silvio when his exbrotherinlaw had strongarmed him into this gig we all have enemies parker you know that just as we all have secrets his brown eyes had darkened and hed taken a sip from his glass of pinot secretsanyone entangled with the damato family got the crash course on family skeletons should i be watching for someone from uncle albertos side of the family or have things been quiet on that front parker had asked silvio junior although silvio let the question drop the vein pulsing in his forehead had provided all the answer parker needed just do the job im paying you for silvio had snapped but it wasnt money that drew parker here tonight though he was loath to admit it parker couldnt stay away he hoped to see resa again call it idle curiosity or something deeper but hed never been able to resist a chance to be near her resa he was on alert for her as he walked the perimeter and observed the guests all talking laughing and sipping rubyred wine he recognized more than a few facesrelatives or business partners hed met at family todos when hed been married to resa a lifetime ago after a brisk stroll past the chapter house and the former dormitory he did a perimeter check of the garden area but found nothing that warranted a second glance the cellars seemed secure the kitchen and dining room were occupied by a frenzied staff that had been screened and cleared before the event and then he saw her at least a glimpse resa his heart clutched hed known there was a chance shed show up but had thought that if silvio had mentioned that hed be there she might have passed apparently not so he caught a glimpse of her walking down a long hallway lit by candles her dark hair sweeping her shoulders or maybe hed been mistaken that woman didnt seem to move with the same grace he remembered of resa or was that his imagination had he made her more of a sensual enigma with the passage of time just as wives who died suddenly were often elevated to sainthood in the surviving husbands mind maybe his perception of resa was imbued with sexual mystery get it straight remember how it played out he reminded himself yes shed set her sights on him yes shed come on to him lured him yes shed used him to rebel against her family and yes shed tossed him aside when the going got rough but had he created an image of a woman who had never really existed the woman with auburn hair joined a group and he realized it couldnt be her with resa there was always that tug in his gut that chemistry he couldnt let himself be distracted whether resa was at the event or not he had to pay attention silvio was taking the stage smiling welcoming people to the damato monastery estates and the crowd seemed rapt all eyes turned toward the dais so far so good he turned away from the dais and saw her againthis time closer to the old chapter house doorway instinctively he eased toward her moving around the edge of the crowd and along the passageways of the cloister remembering how theyd come together how theyd been ripped apart though she didnt look over her shoulder she slipped through the doorway to the old library behind him silvios voice boomed through the speakers our unique blendoaky with just a hint of pear parker barely noticed he told himself that he wasnt following his exwife just to talk to her but that there was something secretive and restless about her something that required soothing as if resa is going to do anything desperate come on parker you know better get back to your job forget her but he followed her through the library to the dormitory and the night stairs which were originally used by the monks in the evening to get from their rooms to the church but theyd been locked right hadnt oscar said theyd all been secured hell she was ahead of him walking swiftly stirring the flames of candles flickering in wall sconces all part of the ambiance of the party into the stairwell she went and he held back the urge to shout or startle her at the stairs to the church she stopped turned and sent him a sizzling glare that melted his bones what the hell are you doing here she demanded he approached smelled the scent of gardenias a perfume hed always equate with her and those incredible nights of twisted sheets sweaty muscles and pure heaven i was hired what about you invited im family remember youre not not anymore he ignored the barb so why arent you out celebrating and lifting your glass to your brother her smile twisted wickedly being part of this family is a dubious honor at best listening to silvio she rolled her expressive eyes and turned a slim palm toward the heavens come on talk about boring then why show free drinks she said then laughed at her own joke he was caught again quick as lightning he was trapped in that invisible but steely hold she had over him and she knew it he saw it in the warm liquid brown of her eyes the curve of her mouth its good to see you the words slipped out before he could catch himself i dont know why her brown eyes met his and he felt locked in her gaze lost in her scent a mixture of gardenias and fresh rain nothing has changed lucas we cant fix whats shattered he wanted to tell her that it didnt matter he was willing to settle for the things that remained wholea pair of brown eyes so warm they could ward off a winter night a hint of gardenia and spring rain but before he could find the words the moment had passed the window closed lifting an eyebrow she said if youll excuse me im on my way to the ladies room she turned on a heel then looked over her shoulder and youre definitely not invited a reference no doubt to the times hed sat on the rim of the tub while shed bathed in mounds of scented bubbles and allowed his hands to wander under the piles of foam and through the deep water to touch her in the most intimate of places there had been candles surrounding the tub and theyd sipped wine damato chardonnay and shed moaned in pleasure until hed lost control and joined her water and bubbles had sloshed onto the floor the candles had flickered and some had sizzled out but theyd made love in the clawfoot tub filled with warm soapy water their bodies slick and hot and wanting even now he remembered that passion how exciting sensual and fierce it had been before it had died so suddenly killed by a lie damn caught in the memory he watched her go as his cell phone vibrated against his leg he pulled the phone from his pocket saw that his old partner noah kent was calling not unusual it was friday night and sometimes after a few drinks at the local watering hole kent would phone he could wait parker slid the phone into his pocket again then looked up to spy resa walking through the library then turning left at the far doorway waitthe restrooms were to the right she should have known that to the left was a dead end the locked stairwell led up to the bell tower and down to the catacombs where barrels were stored in the hillside behind him silvios voice droned on about the hints of vanilla from french oak barrels in his latest creation the speech was background to the pulse beating hard in parkers ears as he pursued her did she go up or down should he follow no go back to the party do your job then get the hell out who cares what shes doing its obviously some sort of catandmouse game the kind you know is dangerous and she knows you cant resist but he heard something above the scrape of a shoe hell he tried the door and it was unlocked he found his walkietalkie tried to raise oscar but got only loud staticladen feedback so much for stealth switching it off he entered the staircase and considered taking his gun out of its holster why its resa you saw her come into the stairwell and shes not a threat not to anyone but you setting his jaw he waited ears straining did she go upor down toward heaven or hell he turned toward the lower stairs as another footfall scraped overhead slowly he began the climb up the spiral staircase the only sound the thudding of his own heart why the hell was resa luring him up here surely shed known hed follow up up up nerves tightening with each step something about this wasnt right not right at all he reached into his shoulder holster pulled out his glock released the safety and set his jaw no way would he fire at resaor the narrow opening was just over his head he squinted upward weapon drawn ascending slowly knowing he was an easy target she was there leaning over the railing standing alone in the darkness he relaxed for a second whatre you doing up here he asked lowering his pistol she turned then her face in shadow and in a breathy voice whispered im waiting for her voice trailed off and she stiffened something wasnt right he felt it ive been waiting for five years the voice was different now low dangerous in a heartstopping instant he knew his mistake saw the gun he swung his weapon up bam light flashed from the muzzle of the gun pointed straight at his heart parker hit the deck as he pulled the trigger firing wildly too late hot agony seared through his gut he stumbled still firing crazily as he fell backward on the steep stairs beginning to tumble he caught the smallest glimpse of his assailants face the wild fury of ringed brown eyes haunted by the pale light of the moon his gun clattered out of his hand falling into the gaping hole where the ropes hung clunk his head smashed a wooden riser hard pain exploded behind his eyes as he slid and rolled gravity pulling him downward each wooden step catching his body bruising him he heard something cracka rib and all the while the lifeblood oozed out of himhot sticky it smeared the dusty wooden steps he threw out a hand grabbed the railing stopping his crazy descent on the small landing before the stairs turned again there were noises people screaming the rush of footsteps he tried to stay awake to remain conscious but the blackness pulled him under the last thing he saw in the periphery of his vision was his attacker jumping down into the center of the tower bong bong bong his brain was nearly crushed with the thunderous peal of bells clamoring so loudly the stairs shook resa he called weakly resa and then he slipped under the veil of darkness parker lucas parker had shown up of all the rotten dumb luck i was furious seething as i slid down the bell ropes i tried to think clearly she was supposed to have followed me up into the tower i was sure shed spot me and be intrigued enough to climb the stairs then fall to her death just as poor ian had fallen it would have been such a fitting ironic end perfect in every detail but lucas had spoiled it all i couldnt think about that now i dropped the pistol letting it fall to the floor below my only consolation was that i was free to end this all another time as long as i escaped which wouldnt be too difficult in the ensuing chaos already there was a nearriot going on people screaming and running panic sizzling like an electric current through the hallowed walls of the winery the gloves frayed as i zipped downward the friction from the old ropes heating my palms and fingers just as it had when id been a child and first discovered i could slide quickly from the top of the belfry to the floor as soon as my feet hit the ancient stones i took off down three flights of stairs to the lowest level of winery the cellar that had once been my playground alone very much alone i knew these old caverns and tunnels better than anyone and of course i still had the keys squired away from when i was a kid the locks hadnt changed silvio my skinflint cousin was too damned cheap but there was pandemonium above scurrying footsteps shouts horrified screams dont think about them or her just keep running i moved by instinct but my brain was pounding why the hell had that son of a bitch shown up hed been divorced from resa airbrushed out of family portraits and what the hell had happened to her just two minutes ago i saw her enter the library id planned everything so perfectly spent the last five years in that place plotting the perfect moment for my revenge and then lucas parker had to show up id caught a glimpse of him earlier and couldnt believe it the former cop stalking the perimeter of the monastery walls my feet moved soundlessly through the dimly lit corridors my breathing regulated from years of running i clutched an aura of calm despite my fury that my plans had been ruined down a long shadowed corridor illuminated by a single string of lights past barrels stacked high around the far corner and up an old flight of stairs to a door id already unlocked i raced the door opened to the old infirmary where sick monks had once been treated now the small rooms were filled with supplies for the winery the muted sounds of chaos within the winery walls mixed with the scream of sirens from outside someone had called the police that part id planned i tore off my wig dress and padded bra kicked off the stupidass shoes cleaned my face with some of those sanitized wipes peeled off the eyelashes and pulled the stuffing out of my cheeks then i opened the bag id left here earlier grabbed my jeans and shirt and yanked them on along with a pair of beatup running shoes and a dark jacket the kayak was waiting on a bank beneath a eucalyptus tree and the nearby river flowed rapidly away from the winery to a small town where i could catch a train into the city i planned to take my resa clothes and dump them into the bay i would fling them from atop the golden gate with a little luck id escape once again and disappear for a while three days later parker woke up mad as hell in a hospital bed a stern nurse told him hed been out for three days an iv dripped some kind of painkillers into his arm but it wasnt working on a scale of one to tenwith the nurses stupid chart of little happy and frowny faces indicating pain levelhe was at eight maybe nine where the red face was frowning but no longer shouting expletives but he didnt give a damn the surgery had been a success the bullet removed his intestine repaired his dislocated shoulder snapped back into place his ribs only bruised the concussion had been slight hed been lucky the doctor had said lucky my ass he closed his eyes for a second trying to figure out how to get out of here pronto in his experience hospitals were dangerous places full of the sick and dying lucas her voice came to him in a dream soft and breathy but this time no sound of laughter or lightness disbelieving he opened an eye and saw her in the doorway she looked frail and frightened unlike the woman whod turned his life upside down there were dark smudges beneath her eyes and her lips trembled slightly he blinked thinking she might be a vision a figment of his imagination even a hallucination from the drugs but no she was there he tried a smile and failed but she saw he was awake howhow do you feel worse than i look from her guarded response he suspected he looked pretty damned bad his mouth tasted foul and as he shifted on the hospital bed his entire body screamed in pain he winced but she didnt seem to notice theyre going to arrest me she said and swallowed hard fear gripped her casting dark rings around her brown eyes the police have been following me butbut i was able to lose them and sneak in here how he asked before he thought twice resa was nothing if not quick and clever she ignored the question the police they think i tried to kill you theyve been putting together a case a few people claim that they saw me in the belfry right before the shots were fired he tried to lift his head but the ache sucked his strength hadnt he seen her there in the bell tower and theres more they think i killed aunt lorna that night too butbut i think theyre having more trouble proving that aunt lorna he repeated albertos wife the cobwebs in his mind stretched thin fading theythey found her in her house i heard on the news that she felloff her scooter and down the stairs but the police think she might have been pushed oh god lucas i didnt do it you have to believe me resas face was drained of color and a small tic had developed at her temple slow down start over i dont have an alibi i was home alone about the time aunt lorna died i was getting ready for the party i knew youd be there and i wasi was excited anyway i went to the party hung out for while then i saw you do you remember our conversation in the library i remember that much was clear you went up i went down to the wine cellar thinking youd follow then i heard gunshots and ran up the stairs but you were alreadyalready she looked at him and shook her head jesus she stepped forward touched his hand and all the warmth and passion that theyd once shared came back to him it clouded his mind like a drug nohe couldnt go there now he reminded himself of the many times resa had deceived him the way shed masked the truth to protect her family to cover up the transgressions committed behind those sacred walls gritting his teeth he drew his hand away you have to help me lucas she said pleading i cant be put away for a murder i didnt commit and there it was between them the lie the one they both knew existed from the hallway came the sounds of the hospital whispers softly rattling carts and gurneys the ding of a bell announcing that an elevator car was about to arrive do they have any other evidence he asked the gun the one they found in the belfry it was mine lucas it was the you gave me he hardly dared breathe your pistol it must have been stolen she said looking over her shoulder i didnt shoot you i swear it i know his voice was faint but the image was solidifying in his head mad dark eyes in the moonlight a square jaw braced in fury and a complexion nubby from the scrape of a razor the face of a man it wasnt you he said weak with relief i know it wasnt tell the police that will you please its going to be okay resa please ill take care of you i can protect you no she stepped back as if stung by his suggestion there is no protection in this world i learned that with ian you cant protect me lucas and you cant change whats happened no one can escape the past fighting tears she backed toward the door resa wait he shifted in bed and fighting the pain levered himself up onto his elbows but she was already gone you look like hell noah kent said cordially dont try to cheer me up it had been less than three hours since resa had left parker had tried and failed to get dr woods to release him from the hospital still kent was a welcome sight dressed in pressed slacks a blazer and shirt and tie as if he were on his way to court they letting you out of this place nah but im going anyway not a smart move one of many parker said wincing against the pain in his belly kent cut to the chase she came to see you didnt she she was here earlier who dont mess with me okay theresa damato was caught on camera in the parking lot hospital security has been on alert for her since you checked in when parker didnt respond kent went on okay two guns both registered to you were found at the scene one the glock has your prints on it the other a has theresas i gave it to her years ago but she wasnt in the belfry that night parker said who was he frowned iim not sure think real hard hed been picturing that face all morning he could see the shooter turning to him a face so like resas but so different its a little blurry kent eyed him critically no more bullshit parker i know you lied when the kid died and i know youre lying now so stop yanking my chain and give it to me straight was theresa damato in the bell tower not in the belfry no then who who shot you ii think it was someone who was trying to look like her i only saw the face for an instant and it was dark but he swiped a hand over his forehead a bead of sweat there i think it was frankie damato her cousin parker knew it sounded nuts but hes in a mental hospital not anymore something shifted in the hospital roomthe tiniest drop in temperature in that heartbeat with his partner hesitating parker sensed what was coming and it scared the hell out of him i tried to call you about that kent said it was him parker gaped frankie damato kent leaned forward in his chair frankie damato walked away from the hospital friday sometime no one knows exactly how it happened but they think he slipped into scrubs then pilfered some poor nurses locker probably walked out of there decked to the nines parker felt his entire life beginning to unravel frankie damato theresas cousin had been institutionalized in a mental facility for five yearsever since ians death and on the day of the escape what happens frankies mother lorna is found dead at the base of the stairs a convenient accident if you ask me then youre shot in the belfry of the damato monastery estates at a gala hosted by frankies uncle coincidence kent shook his head clasped a hand over one knee i dont think so youre serious dead and he was gone was any twinkle in his eyes someone worked real hard to make it look like theresa was in the tower octavia and a few other guests swear they saw resa in the belfry then theres a pistol registered to you that was found on the floor as if someone had dropped it not resa well her prints are on it i gave her that gun a long time ago kent nodded i knew youd defend her lucky for you weve got some evidence that leads in another direction we found hairs at the scenesynthetic a wig and pieces of leather in the bell rope the escape route the attacker used gloves parker whispered remembering his assailant sliding past him on the ropes thats right so if the assailant was wearing gloves thered be no new prints on the gun it was frankie parker said i think so shoe prints are larger than theresas and a silver mercedes registered to lorna damato was left with the valet who remembers the woman who dropped it off someone who looked a lot like resa but the valet thought a little larger even though frankies small for a manfivesixit would be tough to look as petite as theresa what about resas car parker asked didnt the valet see her too she parked in the familys private lot didnt want to get stuck in all the hoopla it wasnt resa parker insisted were looking at all possibilities but right now frankie damato is our prime suspect the guys got lights on upstairs but nobodys home he knows the winery well was raised there before alberto was pushed out then theres the matter of albertos suicide was it and lornas death down the stairs parker sensed what was coming then theres ian damato lets not go there why because you lied in your deposition lied to protect resa parker ground his teeth together at the notion at the time hed thought he was protecting the woman he loved but the lie had actually only fanned the fires of hell that were the damato code of secrecy frankie swore theresa pushed the kid to his death that he witnessed the whole thing she was with me i know you alibied her parker but that never really hung together for me a dull roar like the sound of the sea in a cavern began in parkers head you would believe a mental patient over me im not saying i believed frankie i dont think i ever heard the true story on that incident which had to have affected resa deeply she was the kids mother yes parker hissed everyone knew this much and yet she let her aunt lorna raise him thats kind of odd dont you think she was young unmarried even so kent continued theresa allowed her child to be raised by an aunt and uncle who were at odds with her side of the family they offered and why was that parker closed his eyes wishing for escape it happened before my time we know that you didnt meet theresa until a year after the kid was born and married her a year after that then three years later when the boy was five he dies and you get a divorce soon after i dont see what this has to do with sure you do parker no more bullshit the roar was getting louder the surf pounding through his brain theresa didnt kill ian then who did parker didnt answer so this is the way i think it went down theresa goes to her aunts house to take the kid away the nanny is out probably with alberto and the kid is supposed to be in his room theresa sneaks up the back stairs and goes into ians room but hes not alone is he parker waited knew what was coming frankies there with the kid and she freaks apparently no one told her about how frankie got kicked out of three prep schools for deviant behavior all a family secret so back in the kids room a fight ensues and somehow the boy falls out the window frankie always insisted theresa pushed him you and theresa testify that he was playing too close to the edge so the death is ruled an accident and frankie snaps it smacks parker for the second time that daythe lie it was a terrible tragedy parker says quietly noah kent stared at his expartner as if parker were a moron youre sticking to that story its what happened and so frankie gets sent away and he spends the next five years plotting his revenge maybe he knew you would be there at the winery maybe not but somehow hes going to set theresa up to take the fall so shell have to be locked away and suffer as he has since the kids death sounds like youve got this one sewn up kent folded his arms hey after all these years i ought to be good at this if youll excuse me i got a perp to track down he started for the door then stopped just one more thing who was ians father the question iced over parkers aching head theresa never said yeah rightand the kid was cremated right convenient it would be nice if there was some chance of running his dna parkers heart nearly stopped the way i figure it kent said frankie damato might just have been the kids father thats why the boy was being raised by alberto and his wife they were ians grandparents just like silvio senior and his wife octavia parker didnt agree though his partner had it right kent had obviously spent some time puzzling it all out who knows how it played out my guess is that frankie raped theresa and the family kept it hushhush on the day ian died frankie probably found her there in the room with the kid and freaked out close buddy kent was so close to the truth he had insisted in accompanying theresa that day when she went to take the child away from the damatos san francisco mansion ian had begun to turn inward and resa suspected abuse shes seen no alternative but to remove her son until she was sure the environment was safe but upon entering the childs room resa came upon a horrific scene the abuse obvious frankie had snapped turning his wrath on resa and in the ensuing struggle ian had climbed to the windowsill and pressed himself into the corner edging away from frankie that was the scene parker came upon when he rushed up the stairs responding to the sound of frantic voices parkers sole mission was to get the boy away from the window and out of harms way stay right there he had told the boy gently moving stealthily so as not to startle him dont be afraid no ones going to hurt you but frankie had snarled swinging at parker then lunging toward ian who gasped in fright galvanized by fear the boy scooted back hunkered at the edge of the window for a second then quietly slipped out there was a family history of abuse alberto damato frankies father had trouble keeping his hands to himself too so for frankie to pass it on kent shrugged like father like son that sound about right parker looked away if i knew then what i know now hell lucas weve all got regrets but sooner or later if you dont let some of it go its going to eat you up kent shoved his hands in his pockets looked down at the floor thoughtfully that whole family is bad news man real bad parker couldnt argue hed heard it all before from his own damned conscience he should have intervened earlier he should have saved resas kid from frankies abuse he should have wrung frankies skinny neck the slimy predator he should have known what was going on but he didnt too little too late resa could not forgive herself frankie blamed her for everything that went wrong she had been his victim since childhood do you have any idea where frankie damato is parker asked the frankie he knew would not drop his vendetta which meant resa was not safe he had to protect her kent shook his head but well find him he sent parker a cutting glance especially now he went after one of our own retired parker muttered same thing parker groaned i got to get the hell out of here sign me out will you kent rested one fist on the doorframe promise me youll stay out of bell towers for a while thats an easy one parker rubbed the back of his neck but it didnt ease the ache in his head resa was right about not being able to escape the past there was no escaping it but maybe it was enough to survive it survive the past and damn well try to get a handle on the future he swung his legs to one side of the bed and took the first step one painful step at a time tim maleeny mel brooks once said tragedy is what happens to me comedy is what happens to you this couldnt be better illustrated than in suspension of disbelief tim is an awardwinning author who knows that even in the darkest moments humor can be found this story takes a sideways glance at the complex relationship between a bestselling writer and his editor fortunately most authors experiences with editors have not been quite as unusual as those of the fictional megaauthor featured in this story but the familiar tension between art and commerce was clearly the inspiration for this fantastic tale tim takes the conventions of a classic thriller and twists them hard until we are left with a punch line that is simultaneously funny and disturbing suspension of disbelief give us the manuscript or well kill your wife jim masterson stared at the narrow man threatening him trying to remember when theyd first met a long time ago before jim was married at least a year before he was published a lifetime all we want is the book jim its not finished thats why im here jim watched his editor of more than ten years help himself to one of the overstuffed chairs in front of the desk carefully setting his briefcase on the hardwood floor carl ransom had always dressed immaculately even in the old days today it was a gray suit and cream silk shirt the halfwindsor tight enough to squeeze any last vestige of humanity from his narrow frame carl leaned forward to slide a computer out of his briefcase a sleek titanium notebook that opened like a thinly veiled threat where did we first meet carl the question threw the editor for a moment he blinked a few times before the corners of his mouth turned the four seasons breakfast i was a junior editor at the time and you just got my first publishing contract carl nodded as he busied himself with the laptop feeling nostalgic jim he unceremoniously pushed a row of pencils to one side jesus after all these years i still cant believe you write with those things my readers havent complained jim scooped the pencils up protectively and arranged them closer to his side of the desk ten number twos each sharpened to a perfect point arrayed next to ten red bic pens jim evenly spaced the pens and set them next to the neatly stacked pile of manuscript paper carl reached into the briefcase again then slid a small plastic card into a slot in the laptop tap tap tap they have these things called computers now the internets distracting carl snorted listen to you for your next book remind me to get you a walker maybe a hearing aid jim ignored him listening to the susurrus of traffic three stories below his office door was closed as was his habit when writing normally his only company was the classical music from his stereo and the view but today hed made a mistake hed let someone inside his sanctuary voilà carl spun the laptop around and slid it forward what do you see jim squinted at the monitor where a rectangular window on the screen showed a video of a woman in a dress walking across a manhattan street he looked closer the view was from several stories up maybe four or five the woman carried a briefcase in her left hand the briefcase didnt have a shoulder strap and looked heavy as if it were overstuffed with anything and everything a busy woman might need over the course of a day it looked all too familiar jim felt a knot tighten in his gut as his heart stopped thats emily bravo carl brought his hands together with a languid clap clap he leaned forward his right index finger was poised over return on the laptops keyboard and for bonus points what do you see now the skin under his nail turned white as he mashed the key a red circle with two lines intersecting it appeared over the image of the walking woman as she made her way through a throng of pedestrians even as she dodged a man with a stack of boxes on a handcart the animated crosshairs stayed on her a team of snipers is tracking her progress for the next fortyfive minutes carl rubbed his hands together we know her routines her regular appointments he made a theatrical turn of his wrist so unless we get the final pages infortyfour minutes emily will be shot in the head how a trickle of sweat started down jims spine as he looked at his editors ascetic face searching for a smirk some sign that a punch line was on its way but jim had never known carl to have a taste for practical jokes as utterly mad as it seemed he knew this was real amazing what they can do with computers nowadays isnt it the tech department pulled this togetheryou should see what theyre doing with our web site virtual chats with authors interactive short stories you really need to embrace technology jimbo jim started to rise from his chair not so fast cowboy carl tapped more keys and three additional windows appeared on the screen each with a different view of lower manhattan a shifting crosshair at the center of every one emily moved through the upper left screen oblivious a duck in a pond covering the upper left is bob my assistant editor hes an exmarine which comes in handy upper right is a buddy of his i forget his name but weve used him before an expert marksman this one here is stevehe normally handles the romance writers and this carls finger circled the crosshairs in the lower right quadrant thats the summer intern youre full of shit am i carl slammed the top of the laptop down you have any idea how many books we sold last year with your name on them i didnt write most of those books spittle almost oozed from the corners of carls mouth take a guess jim shrugged millions youre off by a factor of ten carl took a deep breath and forced a smile pried open the laptop and youre correct you only write one book a year per your contract but we put your name on those other books in much bigger type than your cowriters want to know why because im a writer whos sold a lot of books because youre a brand carl blew out his cheeks you like being rich jim looked around the spacious office visualized the rest of his threestory town house one of several he owned in cities around the world he knew it was a rhetorical question let me put it in perspective carl pulled a sheet of paper from his briefcase and glanced at a row of numbers you are the face of a franchise that generated hundreds of millions of dollars over the past decade so so people get killed for a helluva lot less this isnt some corner crack deal were talking about here you think im happy about this jim tried to remember the last time hed seen carl happy an image flashed across his mind of a young editor sitting across from him at breakfast just two guys talking about writing and books until their eggs got cold what the hell happened to you i moved on carl worked the muscles in his jaw i became the caretaker of the house that jim built while youyou stayed behind that damn desk youre insane jim pick up a pencil and start writing again the flourish with the watch weve pissed away seven minutes i cant finish the book in half an hour bullshit two months ago you showed me a rough draft with only one chapter to go i know how fast you write you could bang out the ending with your eyes closed jim selected one of the pencils and rolled it back and forth trying not to look at the computer screen i dont know how the story is going to end call it writers block if you writers get blocked brands dont carl steepled his hands together besides we know how its going to end we already discussed it it doesnt feel right jim stole a glance at the screen emily had moved into the upper right quadrant her long brown hair was loose around her shoulders as she hefted the briefcase the characters wouldnt dont start with that writer crap about the characters telling you what to do carl looked as if all the acid reflux in the world was holding a convention somewhere deep in his esophagus the characters arent alive but your wife isfor now this book will have my name on it jim said deliberately no one elses this is a thriller carls nostrils flared hero saves the day the guy gets the girl or the girl gets the guy whatever oh and the bad guy gets his comeuppance that doesnt seem very thrilling you give the people what they want thats your fucking job maybe they want something different something unexpected youve become a fantasy writer now what world do you live in you write the damn ending believe me i would carl pushed his wireframe glasses up on his nose but like you said this book will have your name on it the one book a year that gets scrutiny from the critics the one that sets the standard for all the books to come and that book my friend that book needs your voice carl said the last word as if it tasted bad his own voice bitter around the edges those jarring juxtapositions those evocative metaphors that youre known for jim felt sweat on his upper lip and looked at the computer screen emily was in quadrant three as she walked she brought her hands up and pulled her hair back away from her face so jim could clearly see her profile he forced himself to breathe carl sighed im not a writer we both know that i handle continuity eliminate redundant phrases clean up the mess you leave on the page jim watched emily step off a curb into traffic her heels just visible beneath her slacks he always wondered how women could walk in those things he took a deep breath and turned his gaze back to carl i need a week carl shook his head were on deadline and this time the emphasis is on the first half of that word he picked up a pencil and held it between his thumb and forefinger finish the damn book itll feel forced every month this book is delayed costs us carl waved his arm around the room a gesture that encompassed the known universe you me the publishing house the chain stores you think im ruthless try negotiating with the chains whats the value of a human life when youre operating on that scale every month costs us millions jim millions this is the entertainment business partner timing is everything jim kept his eyes on carls fighting the urge to track emilys progress youre bluffing excuse me carl spun the computer around and tapped a few keys then turned it back toward jim the four live screens had been replaced with an article from one of the daily newspapers lifted off their web site despite himself jim began to read the headline out loud local author kills himself after murdering his family carl shook his head tragic he was one of ours paranormal gothic romance we made a fortune during the vampire years kill meor emilyand theres no more books actually theres one more carl hit another key and an image of a book cover popped onto the screen i had the boys in the art department work this up whattaya think jim blinked at his own face a publicity photo from last year an easy smile next to lurid type his name across the top in bloodred letters its true crime of course carl shrugged not as big a market but itll cover our investment after that we turn someone else into a franchise franchise you think youre the only thriller writer in the world carl tapped another key and the book cover disappeared give em the shelf space plenty of guys could sell a ton of books jim almost started laughing but the sweat on his palms made him stop how long have you been planning this remember a few months ago when we sent you with two other writers to that police firing range research for the next book exactly how many rifles did you fire that day wasnt there a hunting rifle with a scope a sniper rifle a couple of others how many jim looked at the quadrants on the computer screen and felt his blood congeal four with your fingerprints all over them itll never hold up carl smiled an expression that looked like it hurt famous author of serialkiller novels writer known for gruesome torture scenes dont you think a jury would agree that you fit the profile ill tell them the truth were talking about the law here the truth is irrelevant face it jim youre fucked finish the book live happily ever after you cant seriously be thinking that if we dont pull the trigger today there wont be tomorrow or the next day have you read the book lately carl the question momentarily disarmed the editor what do you mean the ending we talked about it just wont work people will see it coming you havent changed in over ten years people want to see it coming it wont be believable since when does that matter suspension of disbelief is the cornerstone of a thriller buddy you should know that better than anyone you think james bond can really survive all those explosions without messing up his tuxedo but this characterhes different he doesnt always do the right thing your books have a moral compass said carl thats what were selling reassurance faith in the outcome so have a little faith and start writing or well kill your fucking wife okay jim lifted the manuscript and removed the bottom page glancing nervously at the clock but i dont think i can finish in time show me something and ill go away just get a few words on the page and maybe i can buy you some time we can always kill your wifeor someone else close to youanother day let me show you what im talking about jim turned the page around so it was facing his editor he carefully selected one of his red pens and took the cap off circled a paragraph near the top of the page read that carl slid the laptop to one side just as the image of emily jumped to the lower right quadrant jim took a deep breath and held it wondering if he loved his wife more than his characters thinking about all the things that had changed since he first sat down in his chair behind this scarred desk and started writing so many years ago he thought about continuity and the suspension of disbelief and he wondered whether any of that mattered in the end as long as you told a good story so whats your point carl adjusted his glasses as he looked up from the page i read it its great so what happens next this the pen shattered the lens before puncturing the right eye jim shoved it forward with an underhand motion rising out of his seat as he forced it deeper into carls brain the overstuffed chair flipped backward and carls head hit the wood floor like an overcooked egg his legs kicked once twice and then he was dead jim came around the desk and knelt next to his editor there was surprisingly little blood and he made a mental note to get that right the next time he wrote a murder scene he stood and ran his hands through his hair willing his heart to slow down took a deep breath then another opened the door to his study and prayed he hadnt written himself into a corner the town house was quiet but there almost beyond hearing tiny voices from downstairs jim felt a surge of adrenaline and bounded down the stairs two at a time emily was sitting on the couch watching television she smiled when he cleared the threshold and jim felt his heart explode before she could say anything he was across the room with his arms around her he kissed her and let it linger until she gave him a squeeze and stepped back to look at him its nice to see you too i didnt hear you come in i knew you were writing silly i never disturb you when your door is closed you look nice jim let his eyes wander across his wife from head to toe her simple cream blouse and brown skirt a nice complement to her hair he thought about how shed been wearing a dress in the upper left quadrant on the computer and then slacks in the third one how shed been lugging a heavy briefcase in one frame and then running her hands through her hair in the next they must have shot the video on different days or perhaps it was some other technical wizardry amazing what they can do with computers nowadays continuity and attention to detail did matter but not as much as knowing your characters hed known his editor for a long time and could tell when he was lying when to suspend disbelief emily never came into his study hed wait until she went to sleep then move the body into the garage a cop hed interviewed for a story last year told him about a pier on the west side where the mob guys liked to dump bodies something about the currents pulled the body under then took it out to sea hed keep carls cell phone and make random calls to restaurants and airlines over the next couple of days make it seem like carl was still alive then break the phone into pieces and throw them in the trash did you cut yourself jim glanced down at the red smear across his right hand he forced a smile and wiped it across his jeans just ink you and your pens emily stepped over to an end table where an answering machine sat its light blinking your editor called and said he might be coming over want me to play the message no thanks i already talked to him what did he want the usual deadlines you finally get that ending figured out jim rubbed his fingers together where after years of writing ink the color of blood had left its mark yeah he said i think im happy with how the story is going to end sean chercover this former pi has the experience to infuse his writing with a heavy dose of authenticity his realistic portrayals of both cops and the downandouters of the world have garnered sean high praise and welldeserved awards his first novel big city bad blood even gets praised on the fbis web site for its accurate depiction of law enforcement his writing has been compared to steve hamilton lawrence block and dennis lehane but as his readers know sean has a powerful voice all his own seans intense love of scuba diving is sometimes reflected in his fiction so its fitting that his experience in the waters of the caribbean can be felt in a calculated risk tom bailey the main character uses his deep passion and understanding of the water and boats to make a living hes brushed up against the wrong side of the law many times before but this job takes him firmly over the edge the real question iswill he be able to come back a calculated risk tom bailey turned the wheel over to starboard and guided his fortytwofoot power catamaran zombie jamboree just inside the coral reef relying on the lower helms depth finder and nightvision monitor he stole a glance at the luminous hands of his submariner forty minutes until dawn perfect timing the man who called himself diego said hows our timing perfect better be a threat or just a common expression the mans tone was even carried no particular menace it was hard to tell and because they were running dark bailey couldnt read anything in the mans face but he was tempted to say or what he said dude you came to me i didnt come to you he checked their gps coordinates cut the engines the tide would take them in quiet from here twelve minutes and well be right on labadee beach labadee was a private beach within a walled compound on the north shore of haiti royal caribbean cruise lines owned the beach and the compound the whole place would be empty until the next cruise ship arrived on thursday this was tuesday the zombie jamboree drifted in on the tide and the men didnt speak until they arrived at labadee right on time can we get close enough shes a cat she draws three feet said bailey about thirty feet from shore bailey said you jump in now youre about up to your nipples tides behind you you can wade in from here they walked out to the aft deck bailey carrying a flashlight with a red lens to deaden the light the other man carrying a black pelican case about the size and shape of a thick briefcase but made of injectionmolded plastic with orings and strong latches and a oneway purge valve watertight the man who called himself diego stopped on the swim step looked up at bailey he said you remember what i told you bailey smiled dont worry about me even in the dim light the mans eyes shone with contempt i have to worry about you he said you are the one part of the plan i cant control i know i wont fuck up i plan everything down to the minute and then i execute with precision i leave nothing to chance the only chance of failure is if you fuck up bad logic said bailey if i fuck up then you fucked up by hiring me dude bailey didnt usually say dude this often but he could tell that it bothered his client and he didnt like his client the man looked to the deserted shore back at bailey and launched into it again for the seventh time you head straight for dominican waters you stay there go fishing go diving work on your tan whatever you dont go ashore you dont get drunk you dont smoke grass you put down anchor at the end of the day like youre settling in for the night you go dark you stay dark you return here at eleventhirty tonight right here yes yes diego bailey waved the flashlight toward shore and i signal with three flashes at threeminute intervals all right the man let go of the railing sunk until his feet hit the sandy bottom he was about up to his nipples he started walking toward shore the black pelican case floating out in front of him on the calm water its handle in his left hand starlight glittered silver off the black water creating a gossamer wake behind the man as he waded in there was the gentle hiss of the tide kissing the sand and the everpresent treefrog music floating on the sweet island breeze and that was all not a soul on the beach to witness the arrival of the man who called himself diego bailey jabbed at the purge valve of his regulator then stuck the regulator in his mouth he put his right hand over his face applying pressure to both mask and regulator left hand holding the spear gun pressed against his chest rolled back plunged into the caribbean sea like falling into a warm bath beneath the surface was where he felt truly at home at peace he needed the time down here and tried to get a dive in every day he kicked his fins got some depth pinched his nose through the silicone mask and cleared his ears kicked again in the direction of the anchor line the top of the coral reef was fortytwo feet from the surface and bailey added a little air to his bc as he arrived he floated along the top of the reef pulled the rubber tubing back to ready his spear gun tried to concentrate but his mind was busy replaying the initial meeting with his client your monkey cannot come along said the man and gestured to the vervet monkey that sat on the starboard bench devouring a mango the monkey mistook the mans gesture let out a piercing shriek and scooted back a foot clutching the mangled mango to her chest relax i dont want your fucking mango said the man then to bailey see hes loud the wake of a passing yacht caused the zombie jamboree to rock ever so slightly and the man overcompensated with his leg muscles like a subway virgin almost stumbled but corrected in time the man was clearly not possessed of sea legs and bailey didnt relish the idea of a seasick passenger he decided to charge extra bailey took his feet off the gunwale and planted them on the deck stubbed out the joint he was smoking she what she bailey repeated shes loud her name is miss judy he took a swig of dos equis then rubbed the cold bottle against his bare chest anyway she doesnt live aboard shes just a friend shes not my monkey shes not anybodys monkey he hit the man with a goofy smile the man waved baileys words away impatiently i dont give a shit boy monkey girl monkey your monkey not your monkey the monkey is not to come with us on this trip understand sure no monkey bailey didnt like this man but then again he didnt like a lot of his clients liking your clients was not part of the peoplesmuggling business most of baileys clients were rich americans sneaking into the bahamas to engage in some extramarital recreation or to drop some cash at the local casinos the smarter ones came to stash money in offshore accounts bailey didnt smuggle things just people there was too much risk when you started moving unknown cargo across international borders you might get boarded and find yourself holding fifty keys of coke or guns or anything it wasnt worth it if you got caught and even if you didnt there were moral considerations where were the guns going would they be used to liberate people or enslave them were the drugs going to middleclass suburbanites or would they contribute to the rot of the inner cities so bailey saved himself the headache people were easy easy to move easy to hide and peoplesmuggling had always seemed morally uncomplicated free people moving about freely the idea held great philosophical appeal at least it used to things changed after but bailey was a good judge of people and he knew hed never smuggled a terrorist not yet lately he had started to consider the merits of retirement of going legit he could continue to run the zombie jamboree as a fishing charter simply knock off the undeclared cashonly side business but if he were going legit it wouldnt be as a fishing charter too much stink and all his time spent on the surface and too many asshole customers who blame the captain when the fish dont bite no the plan for going legit went like this move to an island where he wasnt knownan island with a good economy and stable political climate barbados was perfect buy a small dive shop there and hire a couple of young guys to help run the place maybe even move ashore and charter the cat for pleasure cruising or hire a local captain to babysit the fishing tourists that was the plan but it was a plan with a significant price tag especially on an island like barbados if he stayed with the peoplesmuggling sideline he might make the nut in a couple years but if he went legit as a fishing charter what with the cost of fuel these days it could take another decade so a couple more years of peoplesmuggling and out hed still be a few years on the right side of forty when he reinvented himself yet again this time as a lawabiding diveshop operator he might even meet a nice woman fall in lovehave a kid or maybe he was kidding himself but what the hell hed come a long way on this ongoing journey of personal transformation might as well buy in to the whole dream stranger things have happened the man who called himself diego was no terrorist but neither was he simply a playboy looking for a good time or a tax dodge whatever he was he was a hard guy dangerous not weightlifter hardthose bodyproud posers were only dangerous to themselves like bailey this guy had a lean and flexible musculature his hardness was a mental hardness hence dangerous whatever this guy was he was a bad dude he knew it and he knew that you knew it and he never made any effort to convince you of it thats the way it is with truly dangerous men they never try to convince anybody they just are if youre an even halfway bad dude youll recognize it if you dont youre not worth worrying about bailey recognized it hed been a bad dude himself in a former life but that was before the first reinvention these days he was known to those who thought they knew him as a friendly expat american who liked rum and reefer diving and women in approximately that order among the caribbean s expat liveaboard set there were two distinct groups there were those like bailey who never talked about their former lives and there were those who never shut the hell up about their former lives all you had to do is pull up a stool next to them at the beach bar and youd hear all about it in excruciating detail dotcom millionaires who struck gold with an ipo and then dumped out just ahead of the bust stockmarket daytraders whod had the discipline to quit while they were ahead software developers venture capitalists real estate speculators doctors and dentists whod diligently saved their money and retired while still young enough to live the rest of their lives chasing after jimmy buffetts bliss the stories were all different and all the same and of course there were the trustfund babies their former lives consisted mostly of homogenous boarding schools and ski trips in the alps and absent parents and kindly nannies bailey preferred the secondgeneration trustfund babies they seemed to have accepted their lot with a little more grace than their furiously idle parents baileys groupthose who didnt talk about their former livesconsisted of retired arms dealers drug runners mercenaries whitecollar embezzlers and bluecollar thugs a growing number of russian businessmen also scattered around the caribbean were former civil servants mostly of the us and uk some of france and a few israelis civil servants true but not the kind that ever saw the inside of a cubicle bailey had worked for uncle sam in his former life the man who called himself diego didnt seem to fit any of these categories he used the name diego and spoke with a slight accent but bailey guessed that the accent was no more authentic than the name he lacked the olive complexion and while he had a good tan it looked like it had been recently acquired in a salon bailey guessed the man for an american but he couldnt be positive baileys initial dislike of the man only intensified while they talked although the man made no effort to act tough ego asserted itself in a pronounced attitude of superiority an attitude that says im smarter than you and everyone else on this island and i resent having to deal with men of lesser competence still there was no concrete reason to turn the man down the gig was easy enoughpick the guy up at the flying fish marina in clarence town get him to haiti drop him off before sunrise pick him up the same night deliver him back to the marina the next day the first pickup and final dropoff would happen in full view and bailey would have the boat set up like a regular fishing charter fighting chair in place rods prominently displayed and the money was good ten thousand american dollars plus fuel expenses cash always in cash bailey returned to labadee beach at exactly eleventhirty that night he cut the throttle down to idle and scanned the shoreline through nightvision binoculars nothing he grabbed the big flashlight with the red lens pointed it toward land flicked the switch on and off three times glanced at his watch three minutes later he did it again still nothing another three minutes and then the flashlight dance again where the hell was this guy after the fourth flashlight signal went unanswered bailey moved to the aft decks portside throttle controls and eased the cat closer to shore he checked his watch again fifteen minutes something was very wrong i plan everything down to the minute and then i execute with precision i leave nothing to chance and now the guy was late bailey reached for the flashlight again but before he hit the switch there was a rustling of bushes at the top of the beach the man who called himself diego burst into view ran down the beach and splashed into the water the pelican case in his left hand bailey swung the boat around as the man waded out in a jog he cut the throttle and moved to the swim step keeping his eye on shore the beach was empty nobody giving chase the man clambered aboard there was blood on the front of his shirt a lot of blood ill get the firstaid kit stop bailey stopped turned back he looked the man over no evidence of injury the man stared him down said i had a nosebleed right just get us out of here fast fast or quiet said bailey you cant have both fast you got it bailey climbed up the ladder to the flybridge helm hang on he jammed the throttles forward and the twin diesels roared up from idle his bloodsplattered passenger grabbed the ladder for support but stayed down on the aft deck as they came around the reef automatic weapons fire rang out from shore pappappappappappap the man who called himself diego flattened against the deck but the gunfire sounded more like protest than attack and it died rapidly at this distance with only dim starlight and no moon with the boat running dark at thirty knots the men on shore mustve known they couldnt hit anything theyd be aiming at the sound of the engines and their bullets would be well off the stern still bailey felt adrenaline leak into his bloodstream and blew out a long breath haiti had a meager coast guard and bailey didnt think theyd be able to scramble a boat out in time but he stayed up on the flybridge where he could spot any unwelcome company just in case no boat appeared outside the protection of the reef the sea rose up and the swells grew to about seven feet no challenge to the stability of the cat but bailey wondered if an unexpected storm was in their future hed checked the marine forecast earlier in the day but conditions change quickly in these parts he switched on the radio no storm on the way small consolation no moon i leave nothing to chance damn bailey had noticed that it would be a moonless night when hed checked the tide calendar it shouldve raised a red flag but hed been too busy thinking about the ten thousand dollars too busy chasing his dream and now everything had gone to dog shit bailey told himself to take it easy cut out the selfflagellation and focus on the present situation yes his client was wearing someone elses blood and yes thered been men with automatic weapons on the beach but automatic weapons were relatively easy to come by in haiti the men on the beach couldve been gangsters as easy as cops and then the radio rendered baileys rationalizations impotent the caribbean news agency was reporting that dominic martelthe leader of haiti s prodemocracy movementhad been shot to death that evening as he dined with his family in a restaurant in the town of cap haitien cap haitien was only six miles southeast of labadee beach shit bailey felt his stomach turn over his client was an assassin still no boat appeared and he realized that there would be none theyd gotten away clean but now he had bigger things to worry about now he had to worry about his client it was time to start being active instead of reactive time to put the old skills to work there was no boat giving chase but down on the aft deck the man who called himself diego could not see over the swells bailey set the autopilot grabbed the flashlight and moved to the ladder as if in a hurry we got company he called down to the man get inside he came down the ladder at speed and ushered his client into the pilothouse the man didnt argue bailey opened a trapdoor in the cabin floor and climbed down a steep set of metal stairs into the port hull just ahead of the engine room it was hot and loud down there he flipped a switch and fluorescent lights flickered to life in the ceiling come on come on he said waving at the man he pressed on a false wall and it opened revealing a small padded closet just large enough for one person there was a builtin seat also padded the man came down the stairs clutching his case he looked dubiously at the custombuilt peoplehider bailey said its safe it has its own ventilation if we get boarded they wont find you the man stepped inside but he didnt look happy about it bailey pushed the false wall back into place he climbed up the stairs got a water bottle and a box of extrastrength gravol from the galley returned and pressed on the wall here he said and handed the bottle to the man he held the box of gravol up for the man to see then popped a couple of pills free of their blister pack take these the man did not reach for them listen bailey said im gonna have to cut across the swells to lose these guys and its gonna get rough down here you dont take these youre gonna be puking all over yourself in about ten minutes i cant afford to have you choking on your vomit while im up top the man swallowed the pills bailey shut the secret door at the lower helm station bailey shut off the autopilot and switched on the running lights he turned the wheel and pointed the boat so that the swells hit sideways instead of headon the boat rocked side to side then he reached forward and flipped a toggle switch shutting off the ventilation to the peoplehider he thought things through the man who called himself diego had taken a brief nap after bailey had picked him up at the marina but had not slept on the overnight journey from long island to haiti and bailey doubted that sleep had been on his agenda during his time ashore so hed been awake at least thirty hours shutting off the ventilation wouldnt kill the man but the oxygen level in the peoplehider would deplete between that and the extrastrength gravol bailey figured the man would be unconscious within the hour bailey pressed on the secret door and eased it open he was greeted by a beautiful sound snoring the man who called himself diego was asleep reclined on the seat his head resting against the padded wall the pelican case had slipped from his grasp and lay on the floor bailey took the case and gently closed the door up in the lounge bailey flipped the latches and opened the case he withdrew a map that showed a section of haiti s north shore from labadee to the town of cap haitien beneath the map was a semiautomatic pistol he lifted the pistol from the case smelled it cordite he put the recently fired pistol aside there was money in the case american money about bailey fished around under the cash found a passport a us passport he took it out of the case and opened it his blood ran cold staring back at him was the standard passport photo of the man who called himself diego but the name on the passport was tom bailey i leave nothing to chance so the man who called himself diego wasnt done killing or thought he wasnt bailey could take care of this threat without breaking a sweat the man was asleep and bailey had his gun easiest thing in the world to walk downstairs and put a bullet in the mans head with his own gun end of threat he could weigh down the body with an anchor and some line dump the body at sea along with the gun done finished pretend it never happened but then bailey thought about it from the other mans perspective a change of identity would mean relocating it was an expensive proposition it would mean a significant sum of money waiting for him in his new destination had to but there was nothing else in the case to say where and that led bailey on a new train of thought was this a crazy idea a reckless bet no he decided it was time to go legitnowand this could set him on his new path the man had an ego problem he would play on that this was a calculated risk he would have to put the case back the way he found itpassport under the money gun on top and the map covering the gun then return the case to the peoplehider with the man and switch the ventilation back on sunrise was breaking over a calm sea when the man emerged from below the case was in his left hand the butt of the pistol peeked out from his waistband good morning said bailey cheerful where the hell are we almost home we made it bailey gestured out the windows to a speck of land on the horizon thats long island yup ill have you back on dry land in half an hour you got an extra shirt i can have no problem bailey got a tshirt from the stateroom in the starboard hull when he returned the man was pointing the gun at him he tried to look surprised take it easy diego he said if you dont like the shirt ill get you another one thats actually very funny the man said he was no longer affecting an accent he gestured with the barrel of his gun to the aft deck outside bailey put his hands up even though the man hadnt asked him to do so he walked out to the aft deck sat down hard on the portside bench braced his hands on his knees and shook his head diego i delivered my end of the bargain you dont have to do this its not the smart play actually it is the man kept the pistol aimed at baileys chest im an accessory before and after the factyou know i wont talk no you wont killing me is only going to raise questions i turn up dead itll only bring more heat youre making a stupid move here really stupid the man smiled a cruel smile but youre not going to turn up dead youre just making a move bailey shook his head like he didnt understand and leaned back with his hands planted on the bench behind him i dont understand where am i moving grand cayman its lovely there theyve got private banking in cayman the mans smile broadened i know please you really dont have to do this no i really do have to do this im telling you dont be stupid the man pulled the trigger click the man snorted derisively clever he said he dropped the pistol on the deck and reached behind his back and came up with a throwing knife as bailey slid his hand under the bench cushion and came up with the preloaded spear gun hed stashed there a couple hours earlier both men froze mexican standoff said the man who called himself diego not really said bailey you may be good but no arm can match the velocity of this thing youll lose he locked eyes with the man but instructed his peripheral vision to watch for any twitch in the mans knife hand poised to throw what do you propose ill give you a choice if you really think you can beat me fire away or you can take a swim youre kidding i dont think so ill never make it to shore no you wont youll tread water for a while then youll get tired and drown you could get lucky a boat may come along and pick you up but thats unlikely you have a choice to make either way its a calculated risk the man thought for a second nodded to himself the knife hand moved forward bailey pulled the trigger the knife clattered to the deck at baileys feet the man groped for the metal spear sticking out of his chest he made a horrible gurgling sound staggered backward his arms flailed in the air as he toppled over the gunwale and into the caribbean sea bailey crossed over to where the man who called himself diego had stood picked up the gun and tossed it overboard he stuck his hand in his pocket pulled out the bullets and dropped them into the sea then he went inside and poured himself a long drink of rum cayman thats where hed find the money it would be waiting for him in a bank account in his own name he plotted a course for grand cayman and sipped his drink a calculated risk and it had paid off javier sierra spanish writer javier sierra is known for seamlessly weaving history and science together in stories that not only entertain but which attempt to solve some of the great mysteries of the past his meticulous research has taken him across the globe and his knowledge of faraway places and forgotten cultures is abundantly clear in the fifth world when murder and mysticism meet tess mitchell is left with only a yellow butterfly found at the feet of her slain professor the mayan calendar and its prophecies had always seemed academic to the young woman but in javiers chilling and believable style they come alive in uncertain frightening new ways the fifth world youve gotten yourself into a quite a mess young lady tess mitchells blue eyes flashed at the precinct commander as he entered the interrogation room where she had been placed in isolation she had seen his face before on the local tv in tucson my name is lincoln lewis and im in charge of this precinct he said with a sneer his overall manner however was entirely professional i know youve spoken with some of our agents already but it would be a real help if you could clear up a couple of things from your statement of course for one thing i need you to tell me what exactly you were doing at four oclock this afternoon in professor jack bennewitzs office you mean when i discoveredthe body the policeman nodded tess swallowed hard well we had been working together on a project connected to his field of investigation i was doing research for him and this morning i came across some data that i thought would interest him observational data technical things i see and what was it that professor bennewitz taught theory of the solar system sir did you have an appointment with him a blush suddenly came over tesss cheeks and unable to conceal it she cast her eyes downward at the steelandwood table to be honest i didnt need one she explained he let me come and see him whenever i had to and since i knew that he had office hours for his students around then i just decided to go by thats all and what did you find when you got there miss mitchell i already told your colleaguesthe first thing i noticed was how silent it was in building b jack always spoke in such a loud voice whenever he yelledwhich was oftenyou could practically hear him at the other end of campus he was a very intense kind of person you know but i noticed something else toothere was a very odd smell in the waiting room it even drifted out into part of the hallway a very strong acidic odor really awful tess made a face at the thought of it before continuing so i went in without knocking and what did you find tess mitchell closed her eyes trying to conjure up the scene in her head the image of her friend jack bennewitz lying back in his leather armchair his face contorted and his eyes fixed on some indeterminate point between the plaster ceiling and the case filled with his chess trophies flashed through her mind for a brief moment despite the fact that his jacket was fully buttoned there was no way to miss the chocolatecolored stain that had soaked through the shirt underneath there was no sign of a struggle books and papers were meticulously organized and even the coffee that he must have poured himself shortly before ending up in that gruesome state remained in a mug on his desk cold and untouched did you touch professor bennewitzs body did you make any attempt to revive him officer lewis insisted good god no the young woman exclaimed of course not jack was dead dead dont you get it didnt you notice anything at all out of the ordinary something that might have been missing from the office tess mitchell pondered these questions a few seconds before shaking her head no there was no way she thought that the wooden box containing a butterfly with giant yellow wings that she had found at jacks feet could be of any use to the investigation she had put it in her bag almost instinctively she had no idea why a prominent theoretical physicist like bennewitz would have been an insect collector even though she herself was a real aficionado may i tell you something miss officer lewis said in a conspiratorial tone of voice jack bennewitzs death is one of the strangest ive ever seen and since you were the person who phoned it in ill have to ask you to remain in the precinct a while longer youre our only witness is it absolutely necessary im afraid so miss mitchell you may not know this but the majority of all crimes are solved using information gathered in the first few hours of the investigation no one would ever recommend the area around the museo de américa in madrid as a place for a midnight stroll francisco ruiz glanced at the dark pathway that stretched out from the moncloa tower and checked his watch realizing that it was already past pm he stepped up his pace so that he could get across that part of the walkway as fast as possible neither the empty echo of the christmas carols nor the distant christmas lights that framed the entrance to the city could dispel the pervading sense of total solitude that surrounded him temperatures had dropped considerably and almost instinctively he pulled up his coat collar and began walking even faster where are you going in such a rush professor ruiz recognized the voice right away of the many places to be caught by surprise in madrid this was by far the most forbidding the man speaking to him had the same central american accent as that of the individual who had been making threatening phone calls to his house for the past two weeks you he said in a distressed whisper despite his arrogant facade ruiz was a coward are you going to tell me for once and for all what it is that you want from me dont play tough with me man not with me the shadow that had intercepted him took a few steps forward and was now standing directly beneath the only streetlamp that shed any light at all on the area and ruiz was perplexed by the image that now stood before him the man was far shorter than he had imagined and his face was graced by the most perfect mayan features aquiline nose sharp cheekbones tanned skin and a braid of hair so black that it blended right into the wretched night a row of exceedingly white teeth glinted in the middle of his dark eagles face he went on i saw that you didnt listen to me professor the article you were working on came out in the paper and why would you care about that oh i care a lot professor more than you imagine in fact you know what the reason im here now is to make sure that you dont publish the second part of that article you mentioned you made the same mistake before about nine years ago you know im amazed in all this time you havent learned anything have you what the hell are you talking about francisco ruiz clung tightly to the folder in his hands which contained the documents he needed to finish the groundbreaking article he was writing on the soho project in the past few days he had met with several experts in prehispanic history in an effort to lend his piece which was purely scientific in nature a more startling angle that was why he had gone all the way to the museo de américabut now that he thought about it the harassment had begun at the same time that hed started meeting with these historians this little mayan man with the fierce gaze barely five feet tall had really managed to make him nervous by now he was within inches of ruizs face so close that if ruiz took two steps forward he would bang right into him his hands buried deep in the pockets of his polar fleece jacket seemed only to confirm ruizs hunch that he was up to no good you must be the worst journalism professor in the entire university said the mayan man his accent was getting stronger and stronger his voice becoming increasingly vehement or have you already forgotten about yk don francisco a lightbulb suddenly went off in his head so that was what this was all about a reader who had been disappointed by an article of his ruiz had been one of europe s fiercest proponents of the hypothesis that after midnight on december computer systems the world over would simultaneously collapse because their internal calendars would be unable to make the leap from to since the very earliest computers used twodigit date formats was was and so onsome people became convinced that at the dawn of the year operating systems would identify as the year instead of which would in turn cause everything to go haywire in his columns francisco ruiz had envisioned a kind of cyberapocalypse airports and hospitals in total meltdown bank accounts and transactions on the blink pensions unpaid power stations nuclear plants and gas and oil lines completely cut off by the dysfunctional computer system to say nothing of world financial systems satellites nuclear weapons and streetlights which would all become deprogrammed at the very same instant caught in the throes of his millennium fever he had actually advised his readers to stockpile extra cash and provisions before new years evejust in case but of course january had come and gone and none of the predicted calamities ever came to pass francisco had moved on to other topics in his columns and quite soon the world forgot about the crisis that never was soho is different he found himself saying its quite a bit more serious yes i know its serious retorted the mayan everything that has to do with the sun is serious thats why im here soho shorthand for the solar and heliospheric observatory was one of the technological playthings that had recently given nasa and the european space agency some of its most promising moments from the day it was launched in soho had sent the goddard space flight center in maryland literally billions of data regarding the sun its magnetic storms sunspots and coronal mass ejections soho had even found the time to identify no less than comets that were not visible from earth the sinisterlooking mayan however did not seem the least bit interested in these achievements before francisco ruiz could change direction and escape his inconvenient interlocutor suddenly pounced upon him like a bulldog the impact which caught ruiz totally by surprise sent the two men rolling downhill the mayans determination to immobilize him along with his quickened breathing now had ruiz scared for his life the next thing he felt was a hot sensation in his chest followed by a dreadful noise like a drain gulping down the last mouthfuls of filth spilling out from a broken pipe it took a few moments for francisco to realize that the noise was in fact emanating from him from his solar plexus then everything felt cold as if someone had taken off his coat a sharp pain followed cloudy vision darkness then everything went black the precinct commander at the stone avenue station in tucson arizona served himself another cup of coffee from the vending machine in the corridor without taking his eyes off of tess mitchell the young woman with the blond braids and frightened eyes couldnt stop fidgeting in the uncomfortable metal chair you sure you wouldnt like something to drink young lady she shook her head lincoln lewis had just informed her that federal agents were going to take over the case of jack bennewitzs death apparently on his computer they had found some interesting links between her physics mentor and various university professors in central america the middle east and europe one of them juan martorell from the university of mexico had been murdered not twentyfour hours earlier in mexico city his body thrown from the seventeenth floor of the hotel reforma in the best interests of his investigation the police chief withheld this last bit of information you and jack were close he asked tess nodded they had known each other for four years together they had visited the most important telescopes in the us and had even made a few trips out of the country to arecibo in puerto rico and mexico city just a month earlier together they had gone to the pyramids at teotihuacán the oldest astronomical observatory in the americas as bennewitz had admiringly called it did they tell you how jack died at this point tess had been in the police station for five hours answering the same questions over and over again to a parade of different agents it was clear that they had no leads just her and she also knew as the policeman she had seen on tv seemed to suggest that they were prepared to put her through hell for as long as they could the young woman shook her head in response a gunshot fired at him pointblank she guessed aloud im afraid not tess they tore his heart out in one fell swoop they did it with some kind of very sharp object a blade or a prod that they sunk into him in a single motion slicing directly through his arteries the young womans eyes widened with fright now she understood that dark stain on professor bennewitzs shirt we know it wasnt you the police chief assured her you wouldnt have the strength for something like that plus jack bennewitz died at least two hours before you got to him in all likelihood the murder did not even occur in that office we found no traces of blood whatsoever there except for the stains on his clothing they must have brought him there after they did it sat him down and left him for someone else to find him really the police chief nodded tell me where were you at two oclock this afternoon tess didnt hesitate i had just left the kitt peak observatory she said swallowing air as if muffling a sob i was there all morning gathering information from the main telescope when i found what i was looking for i went to jacks office to show him from the observatory it takes about ninety minutes to get to tucson so i would have been on the road at around that time right now since you werent on campus when the crime occurred i wonder if you could tell me if you or any of your friends saw anything unusual on campus today either this morning or later this afternoon anything at all that struck you as unusual tess said nothing she bowed her head as if trying to extract a memory any kind of recollection at all that might offer the police some kind of clue to aid their investigation the matter of the butterfly seemed irrelevant and anyway she was too embarrassed to admit that she had taken something from a crime scene so she just put it out of her mind in a matter of seconds she replayed her arrival at the university the hamandcheese sandwich shed eaten in the building b cafeteria her thoughts about the university lecture they would be attending that afternoonof course she suddenly exclaimed the university lecture thats it suppressing an incipient smile she searched the police officers eyes wewell she stuttered i dont know if this means anything but jack bennewitz was going to give a very important lecture this afternoon in the auditorium of the main building his students were all very excited about it he was going to announce a major discovery go on please well professor bennewitz was going to announce the results of his latest worka theoretical model capable of predicting highintensity solar storms and eruptions xclass eruptions and even higherlevel ones it was rumored that the scale might have to be raised to zclass he was especially concerned about a storm that could reach zclass he called it the big one lincoln lewiss eyes opened wide he had heard the techies in his department mention precisely those words big one just minutes earlier several folders on the victims computer were filled with references to it the big one on the sixth floor of the united states embassy in madrid eileen garrett and bill dafoe of the intelligence unit were having a heated discussion about those two words the spanish national police had just been asking them about it after a journalism professor at the complutense university had been found dead in the neighborhood of moncloa with a briefcase full of internet printouts about the big one as well as original documents that bore the letterhead of the goddard space flight center the professors folder was now sitting open on a conference room table at the embassy apparently what the local police had found so unusual was the way the body had been mutilated the aggressors had removed the mans heart and while he was still alive thrown his body down onto the entrance to the la coruña road from the overpass between the moncloa tower and the university rectors office so do you have any idea what the hell this big one is bill eileens eyes bore into the back of her colleague who could scarcely tear his eyes away from the most recent science supplement of the spanish newspaper el país wellit turns out that just yesterday this ruiz character published an article explaining it he said smacking the paper with his index finger are you serious really listenin a solar eruption sparked one of the most significant plasma expulsions documented by astrophysicists to date they classified it as an xclass flare and discovered that it had sent a proton cloud into space that took several hours to reach earth when it finally did a magnetic storm shifted the planets field by eight degrees shortcircuited telephone and power lines in canada and caused aurorae boreales in nonpolar zones sixteen years later in january another xclass flare showered earth with a proton stormhighfrequency transmissions in the us and canada collapsed and this time the aurorae were visible in arizona fortunately none of these sudden flareups directly impacted the earththey only struck us laterally the day we receive a frontal impact the consequences of the big one will be devastating wow it sounds like an ad for a horror movie well ruiz took all of this very seriously and get thisat the end of the article it says that tomorrows paper will include part two of the article in which the author promises to give readers a probable date for the big onethe news desk at the paper confirmed for me that they were expecting the article this afternoon excellent do you think this has something to do with his death it doesnt matter what i think eileen washington s already asked us to follow up until a few days ago only a handful of people in the entire world had ever even heard of the big oneand now it looks like theres someone out there who wants to eliminate them one by one as soon as tess got back to her tiny apartment on lester street she opened her laptop she had received instructions not to leave the city without alerting chief lewis but they hadnt said anything about suspending her professional activities nervously she opened a search engine typed in the words big one and waited the fraction of a second it took for the first results to appear she took a deep breath interestingly the search engine produced only three news items related to the term for the moment it seemed nobody knew about what she had discovered at kitt peak not even the police had bothered to ask her about her work the minute they sensed the hint of a technical explanation they seemed to lose interest the articles google produced were as follows nba signs roger williams basketballs new big one she dismissed that one madrid journalism professor murdered while researching article on solar storms the legacy of juan martorell a life dedicated to the maya tess clicked on the second item and read through the article without blinking it was a chronicle of events that briefly described the death of a spanish professor whose heart had been ripped out and his body thrown from the top of an overpass the police had no leads but were speculating that it was some kind of ritual murder they said that the victim had achieved some notoriety in the hours before his death because of an article he had written in which he speculated that the imminent arrival of a magnetic storm from the sun might plunge civilization into a predigital era and cause severe damage to the cellular composition of a number of animal species he had named this storm the big one when she read the professors name she suddenly became agitated she had heard jack talk about this francisco ruiz on several different occasions in fact jack had been supplying ruiz with information about the soho satellite and its discoveries for several months before his death distressed tess clicked on the third article although the mayans were not a subject of particular interest to her she wanted to make sure the article didnt contain any more surprises as it turned out the details of this piece were even more astonishing than the last another professora historian this timehad also been murdered after giving a seminar on the mayan calendar and the decline of the mayan civilization according to martorell the mayan culture disappeared after a series of sudden natural disastersdroughts hurricanesswept through mexico in the tenth century according to the professor the mayan people foretold the advent of their own apocalypse through meticulous observation of the sun they came to believe that every fiftytwo years the sun experienced a rebirth and that this mutation necessarily affected them as well according to their belief system every fiftytwo cycles of fiftytwo yearsin other words every yearsthe world disappeared completely and gave way to an entirely new one in fact said the professor this was the only possible explanation for the mysterious and abrupt manner in which the mayan people abandoned their pyramids and cities as documented by archeologists according to this odd logic the final cycle which would herald the arrival of the fifth world would come to an end at midnight on december december repeated tess in a whisper exactly nineteen hours away the facade of the institute of anatomical forensics on the campus of madrid s complutense university flashed and twinkled beneath the glow of its christmas lights it was an odd sight to behold a gray somberlooking edifice so gaily illuminated at eight oclock in the morning but despite the early hour the activity contained within its walls was at full pitch eileen garrett had found her way to the building in a sleepy haze unaware of why she had been summoned with such urgency doctor aguirre was waiting for her at the entrance to the building with a folder in his hands im sorry for waking you in the middle of the night miss he said he seemed like a circumspect sort of man last night the police asked us to phone the embassy as soon as we completed the autopsy on ruiz yes well the doctors pause banished the last traces of slumber in garretts head to tell the truth we dont know quite what to say what do you mean the method used to remove the heart of this poor man we believe it was done with an obsidian knife under the microscope we identified a few particles of the volcanic rock whats so odd is that this is the kind of weapon used by primitive cultures like the mayans or the aztecs the skill with which it was used requires a tremendous degree of strength are you trying to tell me doctor that this man was stabbed with an aztec sacrificial knife i know it sounds bizarre miss but theres no doubt in my mind and it was done by someone who knew exactly what he was doing four people in the world knew all the details of the big one all four were connected to jack bennewitzincluding juan martorell according to the article tess had found on the internetand three of them had been found dead victims of some sort of ritual murder in the last few hours the only one left alive was tess mitchell who spent a fitful sleepless night thinking that before midnight on this new day of december her name would be added to that macabre list she had to do something to stop it from happening anything something that would keep her hidden from a bunch of murderers who just like the ancient aztec sunworshippers believed that the end of the day would mark the end of the world could this really be happening or was she just going mad it was barely four in the morning when tess quickly packed her laptop and notes in her car along with the images she had obtained from the kitt peak observatory and headed for nogales for a moment she thought if she could cross the mexican border within an hour or so and then get herself to mexico city it would be very hard for anyone to locate her in a city of nineteen million she did not warn the police nor did she realize that what was behind the deaths of jack juan and francisco was about to crash onto her with all the weight of the laws of physics what tess did know however was that at noon on december a massive solar eruption or coronal mass ejectioncmehad been recorded on sunspot at approximately west longitude perfectly aligned with earth the resulting proton storm picked up by the monitors of the national astronomical observatory was heading toward earth at that very moment and would crash into the planets surface in a short period of time this waswhat else could it bethe first sign of the big one that professor bennewitz had been talking about for years an indeterminate sequence of solar eruptions with a subsequent magnetic emission that was heading straight for planet earth tess had little trouble seeing that the sheer force of the event would be enough to plunge half the planet into total darkness paralyze radioelectronic emissions in the hemisphere where it landed and destroy no less than eighty or ninety basic communications satellites in its path but it was also possible that this occurrence might be the sign of something far worse it still remained to be seen what exactly the relationship was between those proton storms and certain climate and chromosomal alterations that was why she had gone to jacks office that morning that was why his death had left her so perplexed as she drove her gray ford mustang onto interstate and headed south for mexico she had no idea that she was being followed the vehicle tailing her was a modern red nissan quest minivan with a yucatán license plate tess drove for the remainder of the night as did the red minivan when the young physics student finally stopped to sit down to a hearty breakfast at a roadside restaurant near ciudad obregón in sonora state the men following kept an eye on her from afar there was no way she could have known it but the apathy with which she gazed at the cybercafé across the way from the restaurant saved her life she was far more transfixed watching cnn on the television set there to date power outages have been reported in seven european countries to greater and lesser degrees for reasons that are still unknown announced the voice of morning newscaster terry white jolting her out of her ruminations and in addition to what appears to be the most significant simultaneous blackout in the history of europe we are now receiving reports of problems with telecommunications trains and air traffic we are now advising anyone with plans to travel to the mediterranean coast area holy mary mother of god exclaimed an old indigenouslooking woman who crossed herself as she looked away from the television despite the early hour she was already nursing a tall glass of tequila did you see that young lady thats just the beginning the beginning tess swallowed hard she spoke very little spanish just enough to maintain a short conversation the beginning of what maam come on honey are you the only person in the world who doesnt know about whats going to happen tonight what is supposed to happen the end of the world honey thats what the mayan prophecies predict and from the look of things she said pointing to the television its already started in europe the land of our executioners two sharp beeps emanating from her cell phone forced tess to turn her attention to the liquid crystal display of its tiny screen it was an rss message from the kitt peak observatory sunspot has entered into eruption again colossal the cme are increasing in number now the cell phone went dead ive found something eileen luckily before this damn blackout cut off our access to the internal network bill dafoes face was radiant despite the fact that electricity lines in spainand along with them those of portugal france italy belgium switzerland and hollandwere completely down the embassys emergency generators had given him a window of time to finish what he had been working on he went on to explain to eileen that he had been nosing around the archives of madrids complutense university in search of information on francisco ruiz when he hit upon the professors emails which included a number of messages to a certain professor bennewitz who had been murdered in tucson at almost the exact same time as ruiz and in the very same manner so bennewitz was working with a talented student by the name of tess mitchell ive been trying to locate her but last night she disappeared from her apartment and her neighbors havent seen her since the tucson police interrogated her a few hours earlier but found no reasons to name her as a suspect in the murder theyre searching for her now though do you think she left town well bill still had another piece of information in his possession according to border control in nogales a vehicle with her license plate left the us and entered mexico at around fivethirty this morning eileens face suddenly lit up we have to find her bill that girl knows something ill put out a search order for her right away the drive to mexico city dragged on until well after pm the vehicles radio oddly enough was unable to tune in to a single radio station just a lot of empty static tesss cell phone had lost reception as of ciudad obregón and none of the electronic signs on the road to mexico city were working though these were clearly the symptoms of the fallout from the first proton storm the physics student decided not to overestimate their importance as she approached the highway into the mexican capital tess mitchell decided that it would be more practical for her to find a hotel somewhere near the teotihuacán archeological complex there at least she could be sure of finding a room and she knew the area relatively well she had spent an entire week there visiting the ruins with a research team from the university and jack bennewitz had shown her some of the best and cheapest places to stay in the vicinity as she turned off the ignition in front of the albergue san juan she was overcome by a torrent of mixed emotions her evening strolls with jack along the avenida de los muertos in the heart of the pyramid complex gazing up at the milky way his explanations of the relationship between each of those monuments and the planets known in prehispanic times even his remarks about how the people who built teotihuacán believed that they were feeding the sun with every heart they pulled from someones body all these memories passed through her mind more vivid than ever how ironic that jack would surrender his life to the sun in the very same way that people did all the way back then she thought are you tess mitchell an indigenouslooking man nearing forty with a thin beard and a face weathered by the sun yanked her out of her thoughts as he stepped out of a red minivan that had just pulled up alongside her car he wore a brightly colored poncho with geometric motifs that she could barely make out because his headlights were still on how what how do i know your name he smiled a good friend of yours told us professor jack bennewitz as he spoke two other men stepped out of the minivan and walked over to her she had a difficult time seeing them because despite the clarity shed by the firstquarter moon the hotel lights suddenly went out and with them all the lights in the neighborhood tess jumped with a start you dont have to be afraid anymore miss the indigenous man said anymore whats that supposed to mean that time has reached its end and the cosmic clock has done its job we have just crossed the threshold from the twentyfirst to the twentysecond of december then he added welcome to the fifth world miss mitchell tess shook her head please dont be afraid yesterday we paid a visit to your physics professor to convince him not to publish the information he had regarding the solar storm that the two of you detected the same information that you are carrying right now in that laptop of yours youyou were the ones who killed him tess was incredulous more than reproach what echoed in her voice was fear oh come on we only sped up his passage miss mitchell the man said without a trace of emotion we couldnt risk allowing doctor bennewitz to reveal his findings to the scientific community because without realizing it he would have prevented the sky from opening up as it just did i dont know what youre talking about im sure you understand the scientific jargon better than i do miss but what just happened though you and many other people may not realize it is that the planet earth has experienced a blast of cosmic energy so powerful that it produced a dimensional leap our position in the universe has shifted and just as was foretold thousands of years ago a new world has been born thats ridiculous replied tess who are you people where did you come from we are the survivors of the mayan people miss descendants of those few people who remained on this plane of reality when our ancestors transcended dimensions at the end of the third world the world that just left usforever in factwas the fourth well ii havent noticed a thing oh really the mans ironic smile fixed on his face made her wary have you tried to make a phone call you wont be able to he said laughing as he watched tess unsuccessfully dial the emergency number from her cell phone have you heard anything at all on the radio in the past few hours no and from now on you wont not ever again have you tried plugging anything into an outlet you might as well say goodbye to all that forever in the fifth world none of that will work anymore the sun has altered the electrical balance in the ionosphere and as such in the entire planet just like that look one of the other men with them pointed upward the night sky had transformed into something phantasmagoric surreal the silvery sky seemed to have morphed into a spongy substance that flowed as if dragged by the wind it was a kind of aurora borealis one that was nothing like anything any human had ever before seen on earth now do you believe us the man asked everything is mutating even you you dont realize it but your entire molecular structure and dna are changing at this moment right she said quivering so what do you want from me weve come to deliver you a messageprofessor jack bennewitz is waiting for you at the teotihuacán ruins he wants to explain everything jack tess was unable to finish her sentence for the umpteenth time bill dafoe checked but without luck the conventional communications grid including the highresolution microwave signal was down the order to search for tess mitchell hadnt made it beyond the four walls of the embassy instinctively he leaned out the window of his office on the sixth floor of the building to his surprise all the christmas lights lining serrano had gone dark not a single bus traveled down this street one of madrids main arteries and even the many santa clauses that just a few hours earlier had been clogging the sidewalks of this commercial zone had disappeared into thin air the city seemed deserted i have to check something he said to eileen and bounded down the stairs the elevator along with all the electricity in the building had gone dead as well when he arrived at the buildings front gate the marine corps guards and the national police in charge of watching over the embassy precinct were in a state of distress everything had stopped working evenand this was the strangest thing of allthe diesel engines of the two assault tanks that the spanish police used to guard the surrounding streets bill now thats funny shouted the officer responsible for allowing outsiders to gain access to the building he knew dafoe from their years as schoolmates back in lexington kentucky with this damn blackout i had no way of calling up to let you know youve got a visitor in the waiting area a visitor yeahlets see he said automatically glancing down at the embassys entry and exit list his name is francisco ruiz and he says that you and your partner have a folder of his that hed like to pick up francisco ruiz a solemn atmosphere pervaded the ceremonial complex of teotihuacán the grayish silhouette of the massive pyramids and the hulking magnificence of cerro gordo on the horizon shone dramatically beneath the powerful glow of the moon next to the smallest pyramid in a plaza adorned with reliefs of the quetzal a curious cross between bird and insect tess just barely made out the familiar image of a man dressed in white it seemed as though hed been standing there for a millennium waiting for her the best place in the world for us to find each other again tess jack bennewitzs booming voice reverberated between the empty structures tess mitchell didnt understand anything and her face showed it right at that moment she was tempted to think that everything she had been through in the past few hours had been nothing more than a bad practical joke its mejack he said opening his arms wide i dont know what the boys told you but this is real at midnight the planet entered into a totally new vibrational phase all matter including dark matter has begun to resonate at a frequency that was unknown up until now do you understand tess butyoure alive she exclaimed alive deadwhat does it matter those are states of being that belong to the old world were in a new dimension now the young womans hands stroked the soft white cotton of jack bennewitzs suit it had to be an illusion come on tess okay maybe i didnt enter this dimension voluntarily but the men who killed me knew that they were just speeding up my passage by a few hours they even left you a sign so that you wouldnt worry they didnt leave me anything she protested stepping away from him yes they did tess they left you a quetzal butterfly like the ones on these reliefs dont you recognize it for the people that built teotihuacán as well as the ancestors that established the mayan calendar the butterfly symbolized the passage of time the shift from one dimension to another i just stopped being a larva before you did but now both of us are like them the young woman touched her handbag feeling around for the little box she had taken from jacks office jack looked at her content and the rest of the world jack whats happening to them are they all butterflies now too the rest of the world too tess little by little theyll all begin to realize it jack bennewitz put his arms around her shoulders before saying anything else his touch was real physical just as it had always been you know something he said its funny that your instinct brought you here to this place tonight a night of such transformation funny whats so funny about it well tess you should know that teotihuacán means the place where men become gods and now that you and i have died thats precisely what we have become how does it feel to be a god tess gary braver before settling in a teaching position at northeastern university gary braver worked as a soda jerk newspaper reporter tech writer foundry laborer and project physicist a job that taught him lab work wasnt for him but teaching and writing were and his doubleduty as both a teacher and student of the art of writing gave him exceptional insight that he uses to great effect in ghost writer some thrillers tap into that part of our subconscious where the worst mistakes from our past linger waiting for an opportunity to come back into the light gary s compelling portrayal of a disillusioned author asks a question that we all must answer eventually are we the authors of our own destiny or is our fate already written turn the page to find out ghost writer i dont ghostwrite stories i write my own books geoffrey dane uttered those words and felt as if he were chewing gravel he hadnt sold a story in five years professor dane please dont be offended the young woman said but its really a terrific idea and i think youre the best person to do it im not offended but he was offended and bitter bitter that he wasnt what she had assumeda still actively published bestselling author offended because if she were the fan she claimed shed know he was a hasbeen i just dont write other peoples material they were in the english department lounge where he had been sitting sunk in a couch reading student stories since he was parttime he had no office of his own rather a room he shared with other adjuncts and tasa space so cramped and noisy he did his paperwork in the lounge a comfortable space usually empty that was where this lauren grant had found himthis student with the scrubbed good looks the pricey clothes and a gold movado watch with diamond baguettes as she continued to plead with him resentment rose up like acid here he was a fortynineyearold former new york times list resident now teaching workshops for a pittance and entertaining some rich woman half his age offering to pay him to ghost her novel i thought it might be something you could do between your own writing projects yeah rewrite after rewrite that your agent cant place with a fucking vanity press whispered a voice in his head either this woman had no idea about him or the publishing business or she was patronizing him im sorry but im really not interested but its really a terrific idea she insisted really and i think youd agree the details we could work out in your favor but basically i provide the idea and you write the book with whose name on it mine i know i cant pay you enough but im hoping youd accept a reasonable fee no she couldnt pay him enough he had spent the last four years struggling unsuccessfully to write himself back into print and was barely making ends meet it didnt help that maggie his exwife kept squeezing him for alimony maggie the very thought of her made his stomach grind of course wed work out the contractual matters with your agent his agent he hadnt talked to his agent in over a year when she had told him that another house had passed on his previous manuscript its really a terrific idea that was the third time she made that claim and he could see how eager she was to share it im sure so why dont you write it yourself because i dont have the talent i cant even come up with a decent ending maybe you should take a workshop i tried to enroll in yours this semester but it was full same in the spring im scheduled to offer it again next fall and the following spring and the fall after that he thought in fact that was how he regarded the remainder of his pathetic lifeone continuous workshop until the day despair finally stopped his heart or better a bullet from his smith wesson i could take a hundred workshops and it wouldnt be good you wont know if you dont try i have tried believe me but i dont have the gene i read your works and im in awe of how you create characters with depth and dialogue that sounds like real people talking and the narrative thrust that keeps the pages turning blah blah blah he thought as she prattled on frankly its too good an idea to be wasted on me or some hack writer you can create the tension and sense of dread that it needs only because i have a paranoid personality lady only because deep down im a frightened little man who writes thrillers to get bigger than the things that scare me really you have what it takes no i used to he thought geoffrey daneboy genius they called him on his first novel brings class to the thriller genre now adult wannabe cant write shit plus you always have great surprises at the end thats what i love best those twists we never see coming really youre a modern o henry he could feel himself begin to soften to the conviction that lit up her eyes but her flattery only made his heart slump even more everything she said was truebut in the past and the thought of being a ghost writer made him want to vomit he also didnt care to hear her idea because if it was good hed wish it were his own furthermore he had no interest in entering complicated contractual arrangements with a perfect stranger plus she couldnt pay him enough he glanced at his watch thanks for thinking of me but i really have to go oh im sorry you have a class but will you think it over think what over you havent said what the idea is if i can get a commitment ill be happy to tell you he packed the student stories into his briefcase and got up to leave so we can talk again she was wearing a black shearling coat that probably cost more than the book value of the elevenyearold bmw he drove ill think about it her face looked like a lacquered apple thats great she chortled thank you thank you as they walked out of the lounge and into the hall she handed him a card on it embossed in gold script was her name cellphone number and email address no mailing address probably to be on the safe side given the rise in identity thefts and sexual stalkings i really appreciate this her eyes were sparking with expectation okay to call you next week yeah then he looked back at her by the way what kind of story is it a ghost story a ghost story he didnt write ghost stories and he didnt ghostwrite ghost stories especially for students what a bloody insult the weekend passed and he had spent it at his placea small cape at the end of a culdesac in carleton ten miles west of boston from dawn to bedtime he tapped away on his keyboard producing little more than a page of uninspired narrative he was four chapters into another novelthe last two sitting in mailers on the shelf cover letters from editors inside apologizing that the book was not right for their lists the story was outlined but he did not like the direction it was taking and he could think of no decent alternatives he had hit an impasse he could of course just quitblame the blockage on the imp of discouragement and take the selffulfillingprophecy route havent written anything saleable in years cant do it again he really didnt believe in writers block that was nothing more than a phony excuse a handy copout for laziness as if it were a legitimate pathology like viral pneumonia or hepatitis but jesus he was blocked nothing decent was comingno plotadvancing ideas no narrative thrust no belly fire all that kept coming were bills from visa verizon allied fuel carleton mortgage co and emails from maggie to pay up it was december and the houses on the street were decorated for christmas and through the woods behind his place was a path around spy pond he liked its frozen bleakness so he broke up the keyboard hours with long walks to open his mind to any inspiration that might wing by yet he returned with nothing but a chill he spent the next several days teaching his classes and reading student stories on thursday he received a voice message at his work number hi professor this is lauren grant its been nearly a week im just wondering if youve thought over my proposal proposal the word jumped out at him talk about paranoid she was probably afraid hed steal the idea so she had refused to reveal the story line until he signed a contract even if he wanted to it was ridiculous strategy since you couldnt copyright ideas only their execution instead of getting back to her he stopped by the office of his chairman lloyd harrington you know a student by the name of lauren grant lauren grant yeah shes a parttimer auditing courses here and there what about her she came to me the other day asking if id ghost a story for her oh yeah shes been shopping that around for weeks asking anyone in greater boston whos ever published a thriller to take her on geoff felt his stomach leak acid the little bitch she had come on to him as if he were the one author in creation born to pen her tale when she came in i suggested you i hope you dont mind no thats fine but he did mind did she say what the idea was not really something about a ghost whoopie lloyd said if its something youre interest in pursuing thats your business not the universitys okay thanks geoff started out the door in case youre interested lloyd added i think she comes from money for the rest of the day that phrase echoed and reechoed in geoffs brain that evening while sitting at his desk at home he sent her a brief email to say he was interested and wanted to hear more the curtness implied that out of politeness hed suffer her another meeting before outright rejection he suggested they meet in the student center wondering just how much money she came from the food hall was a large open space filled with tables and chairs and flanked with several fastfood takeouts because it was midmorning the place was halfempty he bought them each a coffee and they took a table in a quiet corner okay but before we get to the story i think we should discuss the ugly stuff ugly stuff writers fee that caught her off guard sure of course then from her briefcase she pulled out a manila envelope if you dont mind i contacted a literary agent and had a contract drawn up youre way ahead of the game because i want everything to be aboveboard then lets be straightyouve been to other writers with this right he didnt want to betray lloyds confidence i mean there are dozens of published thriller and horror writers in greater boston she studied his expression for a moment and her eye did an involuntary twitch as she rummaged for a response i considered others but decided that the quality and style of your writing best fits my story idea bullshit he thought shes saying that none of the others were interested and she bottomedout with you okay if you agree you will be paid a flat feetwenty percent up front the balance upon acceptance acceptance by whom by me so theres no stipulation that it has to be placed with a publisher first no just to write an acceptable synopsis and then an acceptable book a synopsis yes i know from other students and your own web site that youre big on writing a synopsisthat you dont start a novel until youve got a slam dunk summary as you say this way ill see how everything fits into place and how it ends when thats done to my liking youll be paid the advance he let that sink in humiliating as it was okay and if i write the book and it sells what about royalties well actually no royalties just the flat fee which i hope youll accept but your name on the book yes and the copyright under my name he could hear the advice of her agent cutting through her nervousness and what if you dont like it i will because i will be reading it as you go along jesus this was like his workshops in reverse he writes installments and submits them to a student for approval and what if you like it and your agent cant place it she smiled selfconsciously first that wont happen since youre too talented for the book not to sell second selling it is his problem you will still be paid no matter what he wondered about her agent youd be putting a lot of trust in me thats right she nodded and smiled warmly he wished shed stop that the geoffrey dane she kept fawning over was all but dead how long a synopsis ten pages what he suggested as maximum on his web site and what exactly do you have in mind for a total fee one hundred thousand dollars jesus where do i sign he thought trying to contain his astonishment thats a lot of money the advance alone could get him out of hock with his creditors and maggie for months ten pages he couldnt write a decent novel anymore but if her story line was viable he could crank out a synopsis in a week my grandparents were generous when i graduated from college from the envelope she removed a multipage contract with his name on it and the breakdown of payment there was a lot of legal jargon but the important details were there an advance of twenty thousand dollars payable upon the completion of an acceptable synopsis the balance to be paid upon acceptance by her of a completed manuscript his heart was pounding so hard he was sure it showedlike the throat of a bullfrog seem fair enough the light in her eyes said that she was enjoying this probably because she knew how destitute he was it also crossed his mind that it might be interesting working with her she was goodlooking and clearly passionate in a flash he saw her naked and in bed with him between chapters okay so whats the story line he took a sip of his coffee and settled back its quite simple she began its the story of a vengeful ghost returned to kill her fiancé who abandoned her she paused for a moment as if to gauge his reaction it sounded corny but he nodded her on okay what im imagining is a beautiful seventeenyearold girl whos been dating this older boy for months shes crazy about him and they talk of getting married someday then a few months before hes to go to college she discovers shes pregnant as the due date approaches the boy abandons hergoes off to school hundreds of miles away and drops out of her life for good again she glared at him with a strange expectancy and a stir of discomfort registered in his gut then what well shes very upset that he left her flat and wasnt there for the birth not even moral support her parents are disgusted with her but forbid her to have an abortion of course her own plans for college are dashed so she has the child but a few days later she dies from complications of childbirth the daughter is raised by her grandparents meanwhile the boy finishes college never making contact with the girls family never learning what happened to the girl or his child we jump ahead twentysomething yearsthe boys a man successful in his profession and happy with his life and and the ghost of his dead girlfriend suddenly appears to take vengeance on hima revenant a what revenant a vengeful ghost his mouth was dry and he swallowed some coffee so what do you think interesting but execution is everything yes it is what will he be doing in the present is he married does he have a family how does he spend his days ive got to know what to have him do from chapter to chapter she nodded hes divorced with no kids she said then like a halfglimpsed premonition she said hes a writer a writer he repeated as if taking an oath yes i like the irony of him being the supposed artistic sensitive type yet hes badif you pardon my french a son of a bitch geoff simply nodded ive got some of their back stories in notes which i can share with youstuff that you can use to flesh things out but its the ending that i cant come up with how the ghost shows up and gets back at him thats where im stuck and i want the best possible retribution uhhuh he drained his cup and a prickly silence filled the moment but im sure you can come up with the perfect justice i take it you believe in ghosts no but im afraid of them she smiled at the old joke what about you nope well i know youre supposed to write from what you know but im sure your fertile imagination can flesh this out so what do you think well its not really my kind of story i write thrillers not horror tales but ive read your novels and i think it is your kind of story just that the antagonist is a ghost not the standard villain maybe that was his problem all his villains were standard he nodded and glanced around the food hall students were scattered at different tables some of them reading some working at their laptops he didnt mind them but he was tired of teaching kids how to write most had never written fiction before and most made their first forays with dumb horror tales hoping to be the next stephen king and most had zero talent like this woman but she had money enough to buy his way out of here for a couple of years and he was certain that if he didnt sign shed find someone else who would i also think youd enjoy working on it she nudged the contract toward him doubtful he thought and for a long moment he stared at it then he picked up the pen and signed and a small rat uncurled in his gut by six that evening he was back home thinking that this might turn out to be the toughest twenty thousand dollars hed ever make no it wasnt the fact that he didnt write ghost stories nor was her story line too much of a challenge as he sipped his second scotch he told himself coincidence dumb blind coincidence twentyfour years ago while doing grad work in la he had gotten a young undergraduate pregnant they had dated less than a year while he finished his mfa they had talked about marriage but when a teaching post presented itself he broke off the relationship and moved back to the east coast he gave jessica some money to get an abortion but she had refused he left no forwarding address and never heard from her again uncertain what had happened to her or her baby yes he felt guilty but he was also young selfish and scared and he couldnt turn down the job because it paid well and would allow him the time to write his first novel which became an instant bestseller as he lay in bed staring into the black it all came back to him but did he really want to be shacked up for the next ten or twelve months slogging through that old muck but one hundred thousand dollars two hours later he was still rolling around his mattress maybe it was his inherent paranoia crossed with his writers imagination but suddenly he wondered if this lauren grant was really an innocent little rich kid who just wanted her name on a book he got out of bed and went to his laptop where he googled lauren j grant a common enough name but not a single hit came up he tried other search engines and databases and nothing she had no web site no entry in facebook myspace or any blog site she had never registered a book or movie review anywhere under her name nothing in the vast digital universe where most people had left evidence of their existence she did not exist it was as if she were a ghost the next day feeling like roadkill from the lack of sleep he went to the registrars office and got a clerk to give him copies of lauren j grants application while grades were confidential their application forms were not she was from philadelphia her parents were susan and john grantshe was a real estate agent he the owner of a trucking firm lauren was an only child she had graduated from prescott high school all looked legitimate but that evening back home at his laptop anxiety was setting bats loose in his chest the more he tried to work on the synopsis the more distracted he became what if she were some kind of writer stalkera delusional nutcake like the assistant who murdered that singer selena or worse the crazed groupie who shot john lennon dead after getting his autograph or worse still his own annie wilkes like in that story misery its your olfertile imagination getting the best of you he told himself nonetheless he went back online and found a web site for prescott high school but probably because of the fear of pedophiles students were not identified by name however using different search engines he located a site for the publisher of the schools yearbooks and ordered one for the year she had graduated he then checked the online yellow pages and with relief he found an address for her parents that matched what she had written on the application your imagination was always much richer than your real life he told himself and went to bed over the next several days he threw himself into the synopsis by the end of the next week he had the story line filled out and an ending that satisfied him so he emailed lauren a copy humming for that twentygrand advance within the hour she called him geoffrey its good but the ending is not there yet youre letting him off too easily he didnt mind the presumptuous use of his first name as much as her sudden authority this little twit wasnt satisfied with his synopsis he resented that almost as much as he resented his need for her money twentysomething years have passed he said do ghosts hold grudges that long in this story they do well frankly i think the ghost bit is silly i told you i dont write ghost stories i dont even read them and i dont believe in them theyre cheesy gimmicks there was a long uncomfortable silence filled only with the hush of the open phone line so what do you recommend she finally said that its the grown daughter who seeks him out and then what there are some tense moments but in the end they reconcile he realizes how callous and irresponsible he had been but hes a grown man now and has reformed and wants to bond with his longlost daughter he knew how trite that sounded but it was the best he was willing to offer but she didnt approve i like the idea of the grown daughter replacing the ghost as an agent of justice she said but its got to be intense i want his guilt and fear to be palpable and i dont want forgiveness suddenly she was all business and holding hostage his twenty thousand for an ending that was making him uncomfortable and it has to be a surprise she continued a surprise ending and a grand guignol ill see what i come up with okay she said but i want blood the rat stirred in his gut again but why such harsh justice because blood debts must be paid and the rat took a nip for another six days he worked on the synopsis grabbing a few writing hours between classes but that friday classes were cancelled because of a freak snowstorm producing lightning and thunder global warming the radio said so he took advantage of the day off and wrote without interruption by early evening he had exhausted himself and downed a few glasses of scotch to relax he thought about going to bed early and getting up around four the next morning to continue working thats when the fedex delivery man came by with a package it was the prescott high school yearbook he tore through the portrait pages yes there was a lauren grant with a few school clubs and activities listed but no portrait photo nor was she in group shots maybe she was sick and missed the photo sessions at the moment he really didnt care his head was soupy from exhaustion and alcohol so he went to bed satisfied that he had an ending that made senseone that should satisfy her she wanted the guys death so he gave him a weak heart in the middle of the night he thinks he sees a ghost and dies of fright contrived yes and if she didnt like it fuck it it was the best he could come up with so he emailed it to her and went to bed thinking i dont have blood on my hands jessica could be alive and well today i just didnt want to deal with her or the baby i was just a kid no way i should pay for that nor for cheating on maggie to rout the rabble in his head he downed two sleeping pills and slipped into a dreamless oblivion it was a little after midnight when his phone rang through the furriness of his brain he heard the answering machine go on in the other room and a muffled female voice leave a message he couldnt make out after several minutes of lying in the dark he got up went to the next room and hit the play button hi geoff its lauren i received your new ending and frankly it doesnt work im really sorry but its still too weak however i think ive got the ending weve been looking for sorry about the hour but im leaving first thing in the morning for the holidays and i want to share it with you in person so ill be right over she clicked off and when he tried to retrieve her number to call back the message read unavailable she had called from an unlisted number jesus it was past midnight and why the hell didnt she just email it suddenly his mind was a fugue what if she wasnt coming over simply to share her idea but another voice cut in get a grip man youre letting your boozeandxanaxprimed imagination get the best of you that and the freak storm but what if she was an imposter who knew about jessica and was out to get him the best possible retribution but to what end surely not blackmail she was loaded and he was broke write about what you know make the guilt and fear palpable her words shot through his brain like an electric arc she was his metaphorical revenant and his penance was having to flesh out his own guilt his own revenge she didnt like it and she was coming with the perfect payback no way impossible so is this freak thunderandlightning snowstorm no maybe this was all maggies doing in a drunken moment years ago he had told her about jessica what if all three of them were in collusion and they concocted this scheme recruiting this lauren grant or whatever her name wasa hit woman to get back for jessie for his cheating on maggie for all his indiscretions against women even more farfetched he told himself maggie was happily involved with another guy and didnt give a shit about him anymore and jessica could be dead for all he knew outside the landscape lit up as if by strobe lights and a moment later boulders rumbled across the sky he stared through the window as lightning turn the stripped black trees behind the house into an xrayed forest as he watched and waited for the thunder another thought cut across him mind like a shark fin one that made all the sense in the world because he was bad because he was selfish because blood debts must be paid suddenly he felt his gorge rise and he shot to the toilet where he flopped to his knees and threw up the contents of his stomach as he hung over the bowl gagging the bathroom light began to flicker the power lines every time carleton experienced a heavy snow sections of the town got hit with a brownout he wiped his mouth and flushed the toilet when he heard the doorbell ring jesus he shot back into the bedroom he was tearing through his bureau drawers underwear and pullovers spilling to the floor when he heard something from downstairs geoffrey she was inside had he forgotten to lock the door after the fedex man left geoffrey im here he did not respond geoffrey suddenly the lights flickered again then they blinked out black the place was dead black not a stray photon in the room not even any light seepage from the outside the whole neighborhood was out geoffrey please come down he heard himself whimper frozen in black completely disoriented in his own bedroom unable to move i know youre there the next moment the lights flickered back on come down and see what ive got he didnt answer his brain still felt stunned geoffrey the lights were back on and he took several deep breaths to compose himself shall i come up no in the living room after a few moments he felt centered again and crept his way out of the bedroom and down the creaking of the stairs sounding like bones snapping the only other sound was that of the furnace kicking on at the bottom the foyer overhead burned the living room was still dark because the lamps had not been turned on he inched his way to the entrance and braced himself against the frame she was in there standing by the dead fireplace her long black shearling defining her form in negative surprise his forehead was an aspic of fear i know what you want he whispered what i know what youre planning you do yes her voice was barely audible over her shoulder hung her case he could not see her hands but in the foyer light he could see the white oval of her face a weird grin distorted her features satisfaction fulfillment retribution i didnt think youd guess she removed the shoulder bag and began to open it i know who you are he said his fingers were nearly bloodless with cold i know of course but you cant imagine but she never finished her sentence without thought he pulled the gun from his back pocket and shot her three times she collapsed to the floor without a

kill my husband izaan bekkar the fortyeighth president of the united states i suppose assassination is the correct term no matter its my responsibility once done ill be a hero go figure only in america where killing for religious reasons is deemed sacrilegious hypocrites every damn one of them im alone now sitting in my room outside trees bare as brooms claw at my window just as izaans deception scrapes at my raw conscience a winter wind rattles the thick pane of glass my only comfort comes from thoughts of retribution and the monotonous dripdripdrip of a leaky faucet ive listened to that torturous sound ever since izaan locked me up its all i have for entertainment ive noticed that its pitch is different at nightmore baritonethan in the afternoon when the water sings like a soprano interesting what we notice when alone a digital clock reads am eleven minutes before the morning call to prayer five hours and eleven minutes before my meeting with dr truman north fourteen hours and eleven minutes until lights out and another sleepless night there are people like the selfrighteous dr north who want me to accept their version of my predicament but i silently refuse and play along ill do anything to guarantee my release from this hell the key is the burqa my life didnt start in a burqa but it may end in one i stood backstage listening wearing a navy st john suit that izaan bought for me america is on the brink of destruction izaan boomed to a packed auditorium network and cable news cameras focused on his keen blue eyes and crisp angular features global warming oil dependence nuclear war america needs leadership she can believe in izaan ran his life and his campaign on highoctane fear constituents guzzled his message when he swerved for emphasis they leaned into his turn hed brake for effect and theyd relax hed race his cadence their hearts seemed to pound thats why at your insistence im announcing my candidacy for president of the united states the crowd roared their approval he beamed pausing for effect his ego swelling from their admiration like a snake charmer he wooed them just as hed wooed me years before after a few moments the crowd calmed it gives me great pleasure to introduce you to the love of my life my wife my partner sylvia bekkar i dutifully walked onto the stage and gripped his hand strobes flashed he raised our clasped fingers high in the air my heart soared at his touch gentle and loving together we left the stage and greeted constituents at the rope line afterward as i tumbled over the edge of false impressions into a cold reality staffers swept me out of the way you ooze charisma the campaign manager told izaan patting him on the back i watched as izaan pushed past him and headed for the campaign bus and so it went stop after stop month after month izaans poll numbers rose my spirits fell slowly izaans mask of confident composure shattered under the pressure nervous glances over his shoulder escalated once we were issued secret service get them away from me he ordered pointing at the agents posted outside the campaign bus i dont need government spies watching my every move theyre here for your protection an advisor said izaan leveled him with a glare i know their claims i also know the truth the campaign manager pulled izaan inside the bus are you all right izaan held up a document you hand me sacrilege like this and call it a speech he tore it in two then you ask if im all right leave before i fire you drunk on the prospect of riding their horse into the white house the staff attributed izaans outbursts to exhaustion i dont care what the hell you need to do just get him through the election i overheard the campaign manager say to a deputy well deal with him after november fools a day later we were back home for a night i entered izaans bedroom to check on him determined to show him that i cared that i wanted to be a part of his life our life he emerged from his bathroom wearing only a towel what are you doing in here snooping around i he grabbed a handful of my red hair filthy american whore tempting me is this what you want he dropped his towel revealing his naked muscular frame is it i said nothing he yanked my head back his face inches from mine you want to know my secrets i fought against crying youre hurting me what are you he asked in a voice as soft as a caress please i love he jerked my hair again i grabbed his arm im a say it filthy whore i spit the words at him im a filthy whore this is what happens to whores he shoved me facedown on the bed i scrambled for safety he caught my foot knocked me to the floor then wrenched my nightgown up over my head tangling my face and arms in the silk pinning me down a knock on the door you all right sir secret service izaan slammed his palm over my mouth i writhed for air leave me be izaan yelled footsteps retreated he held me down thrusting his hatred into me for days afterward my body ached and his words replayed in my mind like a stale song id seen his anger before felt its wrath but this was different raw and exposed dripdripdrip i plotted to leave him later after the campaign he was under so much pressure he didnt mean it he loved me needed me i couldnt leave a continuous loop of rationalization circled around my mind coming back to the same awful conclusion he was the force that held my world together and without him id spin out of control you may hate a thing although it is good for you and love a thing although it is bad for you izaan would say i didnt know from where the quote originated but it nagged at me made me wonder november loomed izaan won nonstop news coverage of the most recent beheading in the middle east wound my anxiety into a tangled knot fortyeight hours after the election izaans staff showed up at our home izaan jerked me to my feet his fingers digging into my arm he turned me to face men id never seen before and insisted that i look them in the eye men have status above women another of those quotes good women are obedient what are you talking about with forefinger and thumb he wrenched my chin around to face his allmale staff i dropped my gaze he smiled then he ordered them to scour our home to cleanse it of the world of the infidel nothing unclean would follow us to pennsylvania avenue infidel id never heard him utter this word before he smacked the side of my head i reeled humiliation stained my cheeks his men ripped the designer wardrobe from my closet i suddenly realized that they were the costumes of a disposable prop me i fought izaan as he dragged me to the cellar youve learned so little he shoved me next to the old incinerator radiating heat singed the hair on my arm and snapped at my skin they fed my wardrobe into the flames reducing the clothing hed taught me to wear to ashes they incinerated the lifestyle hed insisted i master in order to project the flawless image of a model american couple the next president and first lady of the united states of america photographs of our smiling faces at our wedding political events and holidays were burned along with books bibles magazines and artwork only pictures of izaanwithout my presence or that of any other womanwere kept beyond tears i stood speechless id kept his secret helped him build a secular image that america would swallow do you see how it is now he asked do you see what we worked so hard to achieve now this country will be led to allah then i knew the quran his quotes were paraphrased from the quran i met his gaze he would pay only one bag accompanied me to washington and the hay adams hotel demoralized i donned izaans latest demanda burqa the top of the burqa was shaped like a pillbox hat from there black fabric fell in a deliberately formless shape to the floor the only other detail was the mesh veil that hid my face and eyes tears slashed mascara across my cheeks the burqa gripped me in a bonecrushing depression it devoured my peripheral vision and my selfrespect the veil distorted my perception through it even the brightly upholstered chairs and ornately carved bed of the hotel appeared worn and worthless reality terrifying and ugly as a cobra about to strike snapped into focus thoughts flew at me from a thousand broken places i wanted to scream if i started i wouldnt stop i needed to think to act a highpitched ringing grew in my ears and buzzed through my brain like a menacing swarm of bees i walked into my bathroom and retrieved the prescription izaan demanded i take i stared at the bottle until now he controlled me inside and out his precious pills were supposed to help with the ringing my depression and everything else they didnt when i took them i felt submerged beneath the world slogging upstream against a relentless current detached and passive i studied the label what was really in the bottle i unscrewed the top and dumped the entire contents into the toilet izaan would be furious i was delighted water swirled around the bowl sucking the venomous capsules into the vortex siphoning them down the drain just as id been sucked into the dizzying eddy of izaans deception secret service agent frank harrigan knocked on my door its time i fought to find a smile but instead i found hate and clung to it i greeted frank the burqa so impaired my vision that i caught my hip on the door handle as i exited my room frank ignored my clumsiness i massaged the pain he escorted me through the halls to my husbands temporary headquarters at the hay adams across from the white house it was a suite of course for us presidentelect izaan bekkar heat built up beneath the burqa my head itched perspiration clung to the back of my neck anxiety raced in my chest seemingly appropriate for a warrior going into battle a bead of sweat trickled over my temple frank ushered me into izaans temporary office arms crossed over his chest frank took up his post in the back of the room i sat on the couch across from izaan who aimed that smile at me the one that blinded everyone to the truth everyone that is except me you look nice in your burqa islamofascist bastard he shook his head in tight controlled movements theyll impeach you i kept my words short chatter and questions agitated izaan provoked his paranoia impeach his gaze narrowed hard and dark he leaned toward me and glared with laserlike intensity the first amendment protects religious freedom but it wont protect you from the people when they learn their president is a radical islamist youve got to let go of this sylvia it will destroy you a small victory he was angry do you understand me i smiled he sucked a deep breath how are you interesting a change of strategy act like you care try to keep the wife happy its important that you work with me sylvia a bitter laugh rose in my throat i swallowed it and kept quiet were so close he spoke softly but i could hear the threat that weighted his words do you understand how important this is i kept silent after my appointment with izaan frank took me back to my room i wrenched the burqa over my head and threw it into the corner i stood naked before the mirror my boney ribs angled to a concave stomach a purplish knot bloomed on my hip like a shriveled rose i leaned into the mirror dirty green eyes stared back at me my cheeks were free of bruise or blemish a disfigured face would have defeated izaan bekkars political agenda the face wasnt to be touched but that rule was about to end the veil of a burqa would see to that you must do exactly as i say izaans orders and instructions permeated my mind dripdripdrip fanaticism indeed had a face presidentelect izaan bekkar america would be brought to allah or die on her knees could i face the destruction id enabled turning from the mirror i opened my suitcase how could i have spent years married to this man without even knowing him the answer was easy i didnt want to know the truth i worked a finger into the edge of the suitcase lining the seam gave way revealing the longbladed knife that id sewn into the gap behind the fabric i peered out through the window into the dusky darkness and the flickering lights of the white house i laid the blade against my wrist how easy it would be to run a hot bath settle into the soothing water and slice my skin how long would it take before i fell into an unending sleep a gentle press and beads of blood popped up along the edge of the knife dripdripdrip the handle mahogany inlaid with mother of pearl felt smooth and reassuring in my grasp not a chance i tossed it back onto the bed the bloodstained blade left a swath of pink on the comforter there was another way something izaan would never expect from me courage inauguration day arrived with a flurry of snow and vibrant activity i needed to move quickly not an easy task on icy ground clad in a burqa we walked out to the waiting motorcade and were ushered into limousines unable to see my feet and the floor of the car i stumbled my knee clipped the door another bruise izaan and i were seated in separate vehicles snow coated my burqa and melted into the fabric wet material clung to my body like a cold soggy blanket images swirled before me pulsing forward retracting the saturated cotton clung to my face threatening to suffocate me i fought the urge to gasp for air i wanted to rip the fabric off my skin the knife focus on the knife under the folds of cloth i stroked it with my fingertips it anchored me steadied my breathing but could i do it we circled the capitol and entered the building through a private hallway behind the podium marble pillars towered over us sleek and smooth people scurried everywhere id learned that no matter the amount of money spent on coordination planning and security the secret service could never manage to completely control grand events such as a presidential inauguration the sheer number of bodies made that impossible if they only knew where the real threat lay i suppressed the urge to laugh at the irony an agent guarded me the secret service thought they directed all my movements izaan thought he controlled me as first lady the agents acted as my protectors my lifeline but soon theyd have to kill me through the veil of the chadri i stared out at the crowd that scurried like ants in and around the seats my gaze landed on a man wearing a dingy down parka now arriving an amplified voice boomed take your seats down parka stood next to a denimclad teenager who bent over to tie his shoe a woman hurried past in a faux leopardprint coat and snow boots why were they so poorly dressed i shivered a cluster of pain mounted behind my eyes i stood in the wings waiting for my cue savage fluorescent lights hung low over our heads i squinted against the glare pain as sharp as the tip of an ice pick scraped behind my eyes nausea clamped down on my stomach i rubbed my temples through the fabric of my headdress too late to take a pill the pills are gone remember music played it didnt sound right pain distorted everything the bass thrummed in my head like a boom box where were the secret service agents why didnt they stop that racket nonsensical chatter filled my mind as i told myself to follow izaan we walked onto the stage a collective gasp whooshed around me as the burqa caused a stir people dashed around us taking their positions this way doctor someone said so much scurrying so much rush rush i expected to know everyone on the stage but strangers filled the seats around us dignitaries izaans friends supporters my gaze snagged on a police officer trailing a german shepherd the dogs nose led their progress through the crowd gazes darted in my direction i tucked myself in close to izaan he shot me a hard glance a vice of pain pinched my eyes i closed them to fight the building misery when i opened them chief justice deborah steman stood to my left the fine fabric of her black robe glimmered in the bright light a large gold cross dangled at her throat she looked like a nun izaan nodded i knew my role his instructions were explicit i took the quran from izaans grasp and handed it to the chief justice another gasp sucked through the crowd the chief justices eyebrows arched over her wide eyes her lips parted with a quick intake of breath i bit the side of my mouth to quell my nervous energy trembling knees threatened to buckle why did the chief justices robes resemble a nuns habit where was frank and the other agents with my limited vision i couldnt locate them i fingered the knife hidden in the folds of my dress the enemy burqa suddenly became my confidant hiding my secret what was the doubletalk they loved to spout in political circles ah yes the enemy of my enemy is my friend izaan glared at chief justice steman then surveyed the crowd whod come to celebrate theyd voted for him but were now puzzled into silence the shadow of a new beard dusted his cheeks and chin the audiences confusion morphed into outrage distorted angry faces stared at us shouts echoed around me i knew what i needed to do my gaze followed the justices questioning glance as it darted over the faces of the other dignitaries many looked as stunned as the crowd others looked pleased i focused on the knife which sobered me raise your right hand the chief justice said izaan obeyed hed raised that hand to me countless times every time he did so my body absorbed another punishing blow now the country would take his beating unless he reverently rested his left hand on the quran presenting me a perfect target repeat after me the chief justice said i flashed back to the countless times hed repeated his message to woo the american people and me the hypnotic song of the snake charmer i do solemnly swear the chief justice said i moved in a bit closer to izaan as he repeated the words that i will faithfully execute pain arched through my skull from the depths behind my eyes to the base of my neck my legs quivered nausea rolled over me the office of president of the united states the crowd pressed in were they straining to hear izaans every word were they threatening the ceremony did they sense my intent i couldnt tell and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states of america i withdrew the knife from the folds of the burqa a slice of midday light glinted off the blade i thrust it between izaans ribs aiming deep twisting hard he arched toward me mouth gaping his fingers reached for the knife protruding from his side blood oozed into the fabric of his dark suit i braced myself for the impact of the secret service agents bullets a woman screamed the body twisted knees buckled he crumpled to the floor a shoulder plowed into me my chin cracked against the cold marble floor dont hurt her a man gasped shes my patient air whooshed from my lungs searing pain soared through my head shrill wails descended upon me my hands were yanked behind my back and handcuffs snapped over my wrists the screaming continued got a stabbing at union station i heard a man say need an ambulance a radio squawked man down in the main terminal ground level i repeat man down shes wearing a burlap sack over her head the uniformed officer removed the burqa from my head and shoulders i stared at the burlap sack in his hand bold print declared pioneer brand idaho potatoes lbs thats not a burqa i said as confusion engulfed me i glanced around trains union station a second cop walked over the victim was talking to that nun over there looks like this woman he said pointing at me knocked the nun down then stabbed the guy whats your name i was asked the first cop lifted me to my feet do you know your name i said nothing sylvia i heard a voice call out frank shuffled toward us she lives across the street with me at the homeless shelter frank tugged at his unwashed beard a tattered herringbone overcoat snugged tight around his rotund middle she just got out of the nuthouse liar i spun toward him why are you saying that frank continued we were in the shelter watching the inauguration on television president bekkar was taking the oath then sylvia ran out according to the victims id hes dr truman north one of the cops said psychiatrist my mind reeled no no nonot dr north president bekkar couldnt they see hes her doctor frank said i told him she stopped taking her medicine north refuses to go to the hospital the other policeman said without talking to his patient first i squinted at the officer dr norths here he nodded and walked me over to a gurney i stared down into norths blue eyes and said im a hero i killed the islamofascist president no sylvia north paused to catch his breath you didnt kill the president racking coughs overcame him you stabbed me no i weve got to go a paramedic said you stabbed me north said again his eyes rolled back in his head as his jaw went slack no i shook my head i would never do that i paramedics rushed norths gurney toward the ambulance blood seeped through the blanket that covered him my god what did i do dripdripdrip its almost four years later now dr north made me see that i didnt kill any president instead delusional i stabbed north i understand what happenedmy break with realityand im all better gray clouds coat the sky with a steady drizzle and i listen to the relentless dripdripdrip of rain off the nearby eaves funny how some things never change i stand at the rope line waiting for president izaan bekkar to swing through his campaign stop in fairfield virginia television vans line the street awaiting his arrival a petite blond in a short skirt and matching jacket advances to the rope line and thrusts her microphone in front of the man next to me after a controversial presidency president izaan bekkar is determined to run for a second term sir how did you feel four years ago when president bekkar revealed he was a muslim being a muslim didnt bother me the man says man has a right to his own religion so long as it doesnt get forced on anybody president bekkar has said that if he wins hell be sworn in on the quran does that bother you no why should it hes been a damn good president i step away fearing the reporter will approach me fools every one of them is too stupid to be afraid they dont understand agendas i understand i see the truth i also know habit ive watched footage from all of bekkars campaign stops he always starts on the left shaking hands with his supporters as he moves right i chose this spot well hell come directly to me hell like my burqa i wore it for him beneath it i grip the knife david j montgomery david writes for several of the countrys largest newspapers as a book critic but we wont hold that against him recently hes begun producing fiction the rest of us can critique discussand enjoy because hes good one of the most prolific and respected reviewers of thrillers in the business he not only has an eye for writing bedtime for mr li demonstrates he has a pen for it as well jason ryder a hit man you wouldnt mind having a beer with certainly it would have to be a casual drinkyou wouldnt want to get mixed up in his businessbut it you could talk to such a man wouldnt you in a world of uncertain moral landscapes an antihero like ryder is an intriguing figure from beyond the pale but not beyond redemption just dont say anything bad about the lakers around him bedtime for mr li jason ryder sat slumped behind the wheel of the rented ford watching the raindrops chase each other down the windshield hed been sitting there for over an hour already and his ass was starting to go numb on the radio was a playoff game between the los angeles lakers and the portland trailblazers with the lakers ahead by three in the fourth quarter listening to basketball on the radio was like watching a porno movie with the picture turned off but he had to make do ryder had been on the job for a week already enough time to make him more than a little antsy he was never one to hurryhe was nothing if not meticulous an essential requirement for success in his line of workbut that didnt mean he wanted to waste time either there were places hed rather be than the front seat of an taurus and things hed rather do than drink lukewarm mcdonalds coffee while watching a middleaged chinese man negotiate with hookers officially li jinping held the position of cultural attaché in the washington dc embassy of the peoples republic of china he spent his days overseeing the loan of endangered giant pandas to various zoos across the united states as well as organizing tours of the shanghai acrobats and beijing opera unofficially li was a colonel in the second department of the peoples liberation armyplaand the head of all human intelligence gathering operations in the united states in other words he was china s top spy in north america li wasnt a very good spyhe had only successfully recruited one american a disgruntled line cook working in the white house messbut that never dampened his enthusiasm for the job he fancied himself as the chinese james bond despite his receding hairline and expanding waistline he would likely have been fired for incompetence long ago had he not gotten lucky during his previous posting in beijing a posting that had allowed him to gather some juicy intel on select politburo members and highranking officials in the party li loved life in the us he ate like a trencherman and drank like a sailor he had not one but two mistressesin addition of course to his doting wife back home in beijing he was the very picture of ill health but he didnt care he was master of his domain in washington and would only leave when he dropped dead of the inevitable heart attack if only li jinping were a better spy or perhaps if he had been more modest in his appetites or most of all if he hadnt hired a room service waiter at the beijing hilton to secretly take pictures of the vice chairman of the national peoples congress while he was rendezvousing with his much younger boyfriend a gymnastic star predicted to make a fine showing at the olympics but he had and that was why he was going to die jason ryder didnt really care about the reasons li jinpings misdeeds outsize appetites and poor judgment were of no concern to him he could have been screwing the giant pandas instead of renting them out to american zoos and ryder still wouldnt have cared he had only one reason to kill liand it came with five zeros after it ryder had been hired via a circuitous path involving two diplomats one general and a transsexual korean bartender to eliminate li through whatever method proved most convenient the vice chairman of the national peoples congress hadnt specified any requirements other than that li had to die soon if possible painfully if it happened to work out that way the vice chairman had also promised a bonus of an additional if lis elimination could be handled in a particularly embarrassing way but ryder hadnt quite figured out how to handle that one yet hed been giving it some consideration however and had purchased a size xxl pair of frilly undergarments from a plussize womens store at the mall he didnt relish the prospect of undressing li in order to paint him as a crossdresserbut when the time came he thought hed be able to persuade himself with the hefty bonus even so he was keeping an open mind to the possibilities just in case a better opportunity presented itself ryder didnt anticipate that lis removal would be particularly difficult for a man in the intelligence business li was surprisingly dumb taking unnecessary risks seemingly at every turn he failed to take even the basic precautions to guard his identity or his person ryder was surprised that he hadnt yet seen li appear on cnn as a talking head commenting on how it had grown increasingly difficult to conduct military espionage in a post united states the guy was that obvious even so the job had to be handled carefully there was always significant risk involved in eliminating an official of a foreign government a risk made even greater when the individual was a member of the clandestine community ryder was unaware of the identity of the client who had hired him but even if he had known that he was a senior member of the chinese politburo it wouldnt have changed the equation any just because one man in the prc government wanted li dead didnt mean they would turn a blind eye to his murder all the more reason to make his death appear to be something it wasnt ryder had been tracking lis activities and movements for over a week now hed had what turned out to be a golden opportunity to complete the job two days before but he hadnt been ready to pull the trigger li had met his numbertwo mistress an exotic dancer at a gentlemans club just over the dc border in arlington at a rundown hotel on capitol hill ryder had followed them into the lobby where he observed them having a heated disagreement of some sort the girl had stormed away in anger leaving li to head for the elevators by himself ryder assumed that li was going to make use of the room one way or another a fact apparently confirmed when a busty blonde decked out in whores garb arrived thirtyfive minutes later and headed up to lis floor patience was something ryder had amassed in abundance over the years so he wasnt overly concerned about the missed chance he was however starting to get a little annoyed that he was missing the lakers in the playoffs but he knew there would be another opportunity li just couldnt help himself the man seemed to attract compromising circumstances like lindsay lohan attracts paparazzi the trail that evening had brought ryder to the parking lot outside a szechuan restaurant in northwest dc one of the areas frequent summer squalls had risen up awhile before pelting the car with a torrent of rain ryder welcomed the weather as it provided excellent cover for his activities no one was likely to linger in the parking lot and wonder why the man in the dark sedan had been sitting there for the past hour li had gone in alone but ryders quick peek in the front door while studying the menu had revealed that he was not dining solo he had a woman with himyet another tootall tooobvious blonde who would surely tower over the diminutive li like an nba allstar clearly the man liked his women large and blondand for sale after he spotted li with the pro ryder wondered if being found dead with a hooker would be enough of an embarrassment to earn the bonus payment of course that would require him to eliminate the woman as well something he wasnt willing to do a working girl has a hard enough life without some random guy offing her because she signed on for a trick with the wrong john ryder was a man of flexible ethics but even so there were lines that he drew and that was one of them still the situation presented potential opportunities if li took the girl back to another anonymous hotel for a quick whambamthankyoumaam the circumstances would be ripe for action all ryder would have to do was wait for the pro to leave then he could dispatch the target at his leisure two nights before under similar circumstances li had stayed the rest of the night after his date left apparently he didnt mind staying in lessthanluxury accommodations even though the mere thought of what the sheets were like made ryders skin crawl ryder was in the middle of trying to decide if he needed to relieve himself bad enough to urinate in an empty coffee cup when the door to the restaurant opened and li and the woman emerged ever the gentleman li opened an umbrella to shield himself and hurried ahead leaving his companion to fend for herself lis corvette was parked four cars away from ryder but the chinese spy never even glanced in the direction of the ford ryder shook his head the mans tradecraft was appalling it was surprising that nobody had eliminated him before li was so careless it seemed a miracle he hadnt been killed simply by accident li climbed behind the wheel of the corvette and was joined a few moments later by the blond prostitute now dripping wet and complaining loudly ryder couldnt hear all of what she was saying but it sounded like she was cursing li for the lazy inconsiderate bastard he was ryder doubted that lis understanding of english was enough to appreciate the nuances of fine swearing but even if he did he seemed like the kind of guy who would probably find it a turnon the corvette pulled out of the parking lot and ryder followed at a discreet distance even though there were only ninety seconds left in the basketball game he turned the radio off now that he was actively working ryder wouldnt allow himself any distractions hed just have to rely on the lakers to win it on their own sure ryder could probably tailgate li from one side of dc to the other and the spy would never even notice but the hooker likely had some street savvy so there was no reason to push it at any rate the trip ended up being a short one as less than ten minutes later they pulled into the parking garage adjacent to a large but shabbylooking hotel not far from the white house li was no big spender that was for sure apparently the pla didnt give its spies an expense account it was all good news for ryders purposes crummy hotel meant crummy security high turnover of guests and no questions asked things were looking good if all went as planned hed be able to complete the job and get out of washington in time to watch some basketball the corvettes doors opened and li came spilling out he stumbled as he walked across the parking garage catching hold of the girl in order to stay upright the alcohol he presumably drunk with dinner was catching up with him ryder half expected the girl to roll him right there and beat feet down the exit ramp but apparently there was still honor among whores if not thieves and she instead led him to the elevator ryder climbed out of his car then leaned back inside to grab a small black duffel bag from the floorboards on the passenger side the bag contained all the equipment he would need to complete the jobincluding the size xxl womens lingerie just thinking about it made ryder shudder a little the elevator bell dinged loudly and the doors slowly slid open there was no way ryder could ride up in the elevator with them so he waited at a reasonable distance while li and his date stepped aboard and the doors closed behind them he then hurried over to punch the button for the next car he didnt have long to wait and the second bay of elevator doors opened and he climbed aboard stepping out onto the lobby level a minute later ryder scanned the large poorly lit room searching for li he spotted him weaving his way across the threadbare carpet to the registration desk you know a hotel has openminded standards when the desk clerk doesnt even bat his eyes when a guy shows up for what is clearly a sexforhire assignation the clerk just took lis credit card typed for a couple minutes on his keyboard and handed over a room key the next part was going to be tricky ryder needed to learn what room li was staying in without connecting himself to li in anybodys minds that left out the obvious solutions like walking up to registration and asking say which room did you just give that guy fortunately ryder had an alternate plan seeing that li and the girl were heading for the bank of elevators just off the lobby ryder walked past them to the nearby stairs after li punched the up button and waited for the elevator to arrive ryder opened the door leading to the stairs and jogged up the first two flights the hotel had eight floors so if the clerk had assigned li a room on the top level ryder was probably going to be in trouble but assuming that the law of averages gave him a good shot for a lower floor he had a decent chance of success emerging onto the thirdfloor landing ryder sucked in air and tried to slow his breathing two flights shouldnt have winded him already but clearly he hadnt been hitting the gym often enough he watched the illuminated numbers above the bank of elevators one of them was fixed on eight so that couldnt be li there was no way he could have risen to the top floor already the other was on four as ryder watched it switched to five a few seconds later it was still frozen on the number five that was it ryder returned to the stairs and started jogging up again he arrived at the door marked five and paused again to suck in air he tried to calm his breathing as he opened the solid metal fire door as quietly as possible he peeked out the door and looked to the left nothing he looked to the right again nothing could he have miscalculated another look to the left still nothing then ryder heard a loud feminine giggle come from somewhere to his right emerging into the corridor from the stairwell ryder saw that the hallway made a sharp turn about fifty feet to his right just out of sight from where he was standing a moment before he hurried down the corridor and peered around the bend li and his date were weaving down the hall his hands all over her groping at her ample breasts and full derriere as ryder watched li goosed her in the ass causing another highpitched squeal li was a pig a fact for which ryder gave thanks this was going to work he thought about halfway down the corridor li stopped at a door on the left he fumbled with his room key for several seconds before the girl finally took it away from him and unlocked the door herself pushing it open she shoved li in ahead of her allowing the door to slam shut behind them ryder strode down the hallway and glanced at the door li had just entered number ryder continued down the hall then paused to look at the numbers on the doors around him he pantomimed looking down at his hand as if to confirm his room number shaking his head he pivoted and headed back the way hed come it was unlikely that his act was being observed by anyone but it was worth doing all the same ryder had found himself heading the wrong way down hotel corridors for real enough times to know that it was a very believable mistake after heading back down in the elevator ryder emerged into the lobby he made his way to the bar which was ahead of him approximately fifty yards in a direct line of sight with the bank of elevators for the next part of his plan to work li had to be alone that meant ryder had to wait for the pro to leave he didnt anticipate it taking more than an hour at most there was no way that a man like li who hadnt even been willing to pay for a decent hotel had bought the girl for the entire night ryder ordered a light beer at the barhe didnt want his senses to be dulled by too much alcoholand sat down at the table nearest the entrance he was just another outoftown businessman killing time and spending the night alone there were a couple of other men in the bar likewise doing a little solitary drinking he wondered what kind of companies they worked for given the quality of the accommodations maybe they just didnt know what kind of hotel they were booking its addresson pennsylvania avenue was decent enough to fool people he doubted the hotel got much return business however ryder nursed his beer for the next half hour but there was no sign of the girl he had to admit to a little grudging respect for li hed half assumed the man would have passed out by now he decided hed better order another beer just to avoid making anyone curious as he stood at the bar waiting for his drink sportscenter came on the tv the lead story was the lakers victory in overtime just moments before a victory that the anchorman called one of the most exciting basketball games in recent memory ryder just shook his head it was bad enough that he was stuck in this fleabag hotel tracking a fat washedup spy now hed missed the best game of the season he was more determined than ever to kill li and go home as ryder was returning from the bar beer in hand he spotted the prostitute emerging from the elevator she strolled across the lobby headed in the direction of the registration desk ryder sat down at this table to watch her he took a sip of beer as she stopped at the desk and spoke briefly with the clerk who had checked them in she slipped him somethinga payoff presumablyand headed for the exit ryder glanced around the bar confirmed that no one was watching him and poured half his beer into the base of a fake tree next to his table he didnt want to leave a full beer behind which might make someone curious as to where hed gone he put the bottle down on the table and left the bar riding the elevator back up to the fifth floor ryder prepared himself for what he was going to do killing a man in cold blood was never an easy task but he had long ago steeled himself against the emotions connected to the act he had done it enough times before that although not automatic it was the next closest thing to it like michael corleone so famously said it wasnt personal it was just business ryder had a job to do and he planned to do it quickly efficiently and without hesitation arriving at the fifth floor ryder walked down the corridor to room he had been in the hotel long enough and was anxious to finish the job and get the hell out of there ryder unzipped the duffel bag then knocked sharply on the door two staccato beats ryder hoped the man hadnt sunk into postcoital oblivion apparently not as he heard a fumbling with the doors safety catch who there please asked the voice on the other side of the door hotel security ryder answered please open the door sir the door opened to reveal li jinping standing there in his underwear a dingy white tshirt stretched tight over his ample belly li blinked at ryder blearyeyed and obviously concerned what is a matter please please step back sir i need to check the room li hesitated before taking a step backward allowing ryder to enter he did so and closed the door behind him youre mr li right yes i am li ryder already knew who he was but he figured it couldnt hurt to check he reached his hand into the duffel bag and wrapped his fingers around the grip of the semiautomatic pistol he was about to whip it out of the bag when a soft knock sounded on the door at his back ryder jerked his hand out of the bag with a start shit was it the real hotel security or the cops who else would be knocking on the door in the middle of the night he doubted the hotel had room service ryder had to decide how he wanted to play it and fast so far he hadnt done anything too incriminating but he also couldnt allow any official connection to be made between him and li another knock sounded on the door louder this time ryder put his hand back in the bag and felt for the pistol again he was tired of pussyfooting around with this job if drastic action needed to be taken he was going to take it one way or another this was going to end tonight li honey a muffled voice came from the hallway its me candy i forgot my phone ryder cursed his luck it was the prostitute back just in time to screw up everything there was no way he could let her see him with li not unless he wanted to kill her too he would if he had to but that would make what he had planned almost impossible to pull off he had to think of some other way around it he turned to li and locked eyes with him listen to me carefully we know you had a prostitute here in your room with you is that her at the door li nodded his eyes wide yes i have girl but im diplomat you can no arrest shut up and listen to me im going to step into the bathroom youre going to get rid of the whore as quickly as possible do you understand li nodded we dont want to embarrass the hotel any more than has already happened so just get rid of her and ill handle everything else understand another nod none of it made much sense but ryder wasnt giving him time to think li was scared and smashed and hardly thinking his best ryder was counting on that to make him compliant with his demands the knocking was louder now li are you asleep sweetie i really need my phone wheres her phone ryder asked li just shrugged ryder walked over the bed and looked around there was a bottle of jim beam and a glass on the nightstand lis clothes were tossed in a heap on the chair next to the bed the phone could be anywhere with li standing there uselessly ryder rushed past him into the bathroom and flipped on the light there a pink cell phone was sitting on the counter next to the dirty water glass and noname shampoo ryder grabbed it and returned to li give the girl her phone and get rid of her ryder handed it to him do what i say and this will all be over soon ryder returned to the bathroom and closed the door until it was open just a crack he withdrew the pistol from his bag and peered through the gap li opened the door to the corridor and candy started to step in li didnt move though forcing her to stop abruptly he held her phone out toward her here your phone i find it thanks sweetie candy took the phone i was afraid youd be asleep not yet but i go bed now very tired are you sure you wouldnt like to no very tired thank you li gently urged the girl out and closed the door ryder stepped out and slid the security bolt closed good job li i do what you say now you go im afraid not it was then that li looked down and saw that ryder was pointing the pistol at him ryder led li at gunpoint over to the bed picking up the remote control from the bedside table ryder turned up the volume on the televisionconveniently enough it was already turned on playing a porno movieand told li to lie down on the bed lis face turned a bright shade of crimson and sweat poured down his face as he started speaking in rapidfire chinese his voice strained and highpitched ryder didnt understand a word of it but he assumed the man was pleading for his life hed heard it all before in more languages than he could count save it ryder said gesturing with the pistol get over on the bed but lis voice grew even more agonized he was talking so fast he couldnt even catch his breath last chance ryder said lie down on the bed or this is really going to get nasty it was then that li started clutching at his chest his face had turned nearly purple and he was no longer even looking at ryder his eyes were tightly closed his face a mask of pain a few seconds later he keeled over ryder looked down at li lying on the floor next to a used condom wrapper his movements slower now his face a rictus of agony he watched the chinese man for a few minutes but it was obvious that he was on his way out a few moments later his movements stopped completely he was dead sonuvabitch ryder muttered to himself if that wasnt the easiest money hed ever made he didnt know what was smiling at his good fortune he put the pistol back in his bag and started making a few alterations to the scene acting quickly before the lividity in lis body could set ryder hauled the corpse up onto the bed arranging him back against the pillows he turned the volume down on the tv before wiping the remote clean of prints he then placed the remote in lis hand to get his fingerprints on it before dropping it to his side looking down at the corpse ryder briefly considered whether he should try stripping the body and dressing him in the womans underwear he couldnt bring himself to do it though too much riskand too damn disgustingeven for fifty grand he did grit his teeth long enough to pull down lis boxer shorts he also reached into the duffel bag and withdrew two hardcore gay porno magazines not very politically correct in china he put lis prints on them as well and laid them on the bed next to the body that would have to be good enough the stage set ryder glanced around the room making sure he hadnt left any incriminating evidence behind one of the advantages to doing a job in such a questionable environment was that it would be nearly impossible for the csi geeks to find any usable dna the room probably held the fingerprints hairs and assorted bodily secretions of enough people to fill rfk stadium ryder exited the room smearing the doorknobs and locks as he left he didnt think anyone would look too closely at the case once they realized li was a chinese diplomatand saw the circumstances under which he diedtheyd chalk the death up as an obvious heart attack and leave it at that if anyone on the outside got implicated it was going to be candy not him but he doubted it would come to that if there was one thing the chinese hated more than anything it was embarrassment as he rode the elevator back down to the ground floor ryder wondered if his client would be satisfied enough to give him the bonus it didnt really matter one hundred grand was enough for the job even without the extra money now if he could just get home in time to watch the nba finals hed be a happy man simon wood few authors in the thriller community are as borderline as simon wood former racecar driver licensed airplane pilot private investigator and world travelerreplete with adventures featuring transylvanian wolves and thai railroads it seems simon is a bit of an adrenaline junkie so its no wonder that nick the stubbornly lovestruck protagonist in protecting the innocent isnt adverse to a little risk either this story asks you to consider how far youd go for love would you risk your own life if youre anything like nickor simonyou might go just a little too far protecting the innocent see you later nick kissed melanie goodbye and watched her walk away the lunchtime throng on market street swallowed her up but the crowd parted at different times to expose glimpses of an arm a leg a shoulder he couldnt get enough of her the last couple of months had been a whirlwind it was more than just an infatuationhe felt a connection with her on every level possible for the first time in his life he was thinking about marriage although he didnt want to share that with her until he was sure she felt the same way if things carried on the way they were going hed test the waters maybe whisk her off to somewhere romantic and let the moment sweep both of them away a friendly sounding voice called his name instinctively he turned the man looked familiar and at the same time didnt he was tall blond and wellattired his suit certainly hadnt come off the rack nick forbes yes the man put out a hand yes nick took it and shook do i know you sort of im melanies brother jamie now nick saw the resemblance melanie had mentioned a brother but theyd never met if youre looking for mel shes just gone he pointed in the direction of the wells fargo building i came to see you not melanie me yes you you and melanie have become close theres no become about it we are close please let me finish people brushed by them so eager to get on with their own lives that they paid scant regard to this encounter it was if the two men had fallen off the world and no longer had any impact on society your relationship with my sister is a problem the smile went out of jamies eyes coldness replaced the warmth who did this son of bitch think he was nick thought a problem yes a problem you have to stop seeing her look i dont know who you think youre talking to but you have no right to tell me or melanie how to live our lives yes i do jamie pressed his fingers into nicks chest stay away from her or there will be trouble nick knocked jamies hand aside is that a threat just do as i tell you and you wont get hurt now that is a threat jamie shrugged the response away like hed heard it all before im not going to argue with you anymore just do as i say its not a threat its a warning break it off with melanie before its too late jamie walked by nick and let the current of people sweep him away ill be watching whats that supposed to mean nick called out to jamies retreating form nick picked up melanie at her condo the next night he wanted to mention jamies reprehensible scene but couldnt do it from what shed mentioned about him they were close very close telling her about what happened yesterday might force her to choose sides while he waited for melanie to finish changing nick tried to make sense of what had happened the guy was just trying to protect his sister that was understandable his outburst was almost admirable except it wasnt it was excessive and totally uncalled for there was no way nick could tell melanie about it she took his arm and led him to the elevator nick had reservations at her favorite restaurant in the city a french place called the fifth floor he had planned on taking her to a greek place he liked on battery but hed switched at the last minute the reasonprivacy the fifth floor was secluded and somewhat exclusive if jamie wanted to create a scene hed have a hard job during the drive nicks animal instincts kicked in he sensed a car was tailing him this wasnt the first time hed had this feeling for the past couple of weeks he would have sworn hed seen the same car outside his home at the gym and parked across from his job if it wasnt a car it was someone following him on foot hed put it down to paranoia but after jamies warning he wasnt so sure youre quiet tonight melanie said he dragged his gaze away from his rearview mirror and the acura that had been trailing him since he left the office just a little distracted is all sorry she smiled at him well dont be youre with me tonight i demand attention he laughed yes my queen thats more like it he looked back in his rearview the acura was gone the hostess showed them to a corner table nick took the seat that gave him the best view of the bar leading into the dining area if jamie planned any sort of confrontation hed see it coming they ordered melanie chatted and nick struggled to concentrate on what she said she called him on it a couple of times and he apologized promising to do better he expected jamie to appear at any moment but he didnt show by the time the entrées were served nick felt this wasnt the night jamie would make his scene his tension lifted and clarity seeped in a thought came to him he wondered if hed really been accosted by melanies brother and not by some jealous exboyfriend melanie had mentioned she hadnt had much luck in the relationship department over the years the men she bared her soul to always ran out on her was it possible these men might not have run out but have been helped on their way youve mentioned your brother jamie but youve never told me much about him hes a great guy im sure you two would really like each other hes older than me by a couple of years and of course that makes him my protector hes always looking out for me i dont know what he wouldnt do for me she enthused this description matched the guy nick had met yesterday but that still didnt mean anything have you got a picture of him of course im surprised i havent shown it to you before now melanie fished in her purse and removed a photo from her pocketbook nick took the picture and examined it and his theory went up in smoke the jamie in the picture was the jamie on market street nick squeezed out a polite smile and handed the picture back he looks how i expected him to look the three of us should go out together id like that nick said and meant it it would be a good opportunity to show this guy how happy he made his sister if that didnt work he doubted jamie could keep a lid on his jealously and hed expose himself for the person he really was either way itd be a winwin for nick jamie doesnt have to play third wheel he should bring his girlfriend make it a double date i havent doubledated in years jamie doesnt have a girlfriend i dont know why i do nick thought maybe he doesnt put himself out there he suggested they skipped dessert and hooked up with some friends at a club but left early to go back to melanies condo they fooled around and melanie wanted him to spend the night but he couldnt get jamie off his mind he went home his head full of jamie goddamn the guy for thinking he could destroy his relationship with melanie well he wasnt going to stand for it jamies threatening ways might have worked with melanies past boyfriends but they wouldnt with him his blood was up when he went to bed but it turned icy cold when he picked up the newspaper off his stoop the following morning the chronicle had been turned to the third page the headline read man killed in senseless mugging it took nick a minute to realize the newspaper wasnt current but six months old the story detailed the botched mugging a wells fargo employeemiles talbot twentysixhad been returning home after a night out in the city hed been stabbed repeatedly on the embarcadero and his wallet and valuables had been taken his body had been dragged from the main thoroughfare and dumped under the archway of pier after nick read the story a vague recollection of the incident filtered through the cops had never found the person responsible there were no prizes for guessing whod left this piece of san francisco history for him it was a cheap and tactless attempt to intimidate him it was also vague was jamie saying that if he didnt stop seeing his sister hed end up in the same condition christ it was as pathetic as it was infuriating nick went to toss the newspaper in the trash but a second thought struck him hed taken the news story for a veiled threat maybe it wasnt maybe talbots murder was an example of what happened to melanies boyfriends who didnt take a hint the strength went out of his legs and he flopped into a chair at his kitchen table had melanies brother killed this guy it seemed incredible that he would resort to that nick couldnt bring himself to believe it but an itch at the back of his skull believed it was not only possible but true there was only one way to find out he googled miles talbots murder the hits revealed various incarnations of the story hed read in the chronicle there were a few more column inches dedicated to announcing when the investigation went cold none of the hits revealed the one fact nick looked forthe name of a girlfriend he called wells fargo and asked for talbots extension he received the expected awkward silence before the switchboard operator said ill transfer you hold one moment nick was connected to julia chastain in the private clients department who spoke in a hushed tone you wanted to speak to miles talbot yes is he there no okay ill leave a message you dont know then know what julia gave him the cliffs notes version he acted suitably shocked and tossed in the factoid that hed been an old college buddy of talbots which took him closer into her confidence how did his girlfriend take it melanie lassen i dont know i imagine she took it hard do you know her nick sagged under the weight of the confirmation it was as if his flesh couldnt support the immense weight of his bones it was an effort to speak but he forced the words out yeah i know her julia said something but he wasnt listening anymore he thanked her and hung up the guys in his office wanted to hit gordon biersch for lunch he possessed the desire to drink but not the thirst he hit the streets instead he stood in line at a subway but walked away before his turn came he was wandering along spear street when a voice interrupted him from his thoughts looks like youve read some bad news jamie said he had a smug look plastered over his face nick would have loved to have wiped it off for him but this wasnt the time or the place so he bottled his disgust ha ha very funny jamie fell in at nicks side i take it youve worked out the meaning yes then youll be getting out of melanies life you cant control her like this shes a woman not a child nick failed to keep his anger in check and youre not her father from that i assume youre going to continue with the relationship nick didnt have a choice he couldnt abandon melanie he guessed this was the decision miles talbot had come to and he had paid the ultimate price still nick couldnt walk away the murder of a man isnt enough of a deterrent for you no not even if it was a dozen jamie shook his head in disbelief i cant make out if youre dumb or brave but im leaning toward the former nick grabbed jamie by the throat and slammed him up against the smoked glass windows of a faceless building jamie made no effort to fight nick off you cant break us up its looking that way jamie said with sincerity a handful of people streamed from the office building a couple of guys puffed themselves up to look more foreboding than they were weve called the cops one of the men said and held up a cell phone nick released his hold on jamie and wiped his hands on his pants just leave melanie and me alone nick backed away from jamie as jamies unwitting supporters closed in around him asking him if he was okay nick turned his back on them and walked away ask her about the others nick jamie called out after him miles talbot wasnt an isolated incident nick lay in melanies bed a sheen of sweat glistened on his chest hed made love to melanie like it was the last time it left them breathless but for totally different reasons he couldnt get jamies parting remark out of his head what had he meant hed killed for melanie before how many times two five a dozen how did anyone get away with that many murders and how did melanie cope shed have to think she was some sort of kiss of death with a trail of dead boyfriends left in her wake that was if she even knew they were dead melanie said her boyfriends had run out on her not died on her christ he should go to the cops but with what he needed something concrete to give them if he went to them halfcocked hed achieve nothing beyond alienating melanie and blowing any kind of future with her wow dont look too depressed melanie returned to the bedroom with a glass of water in her hand she slipped between the sheets and pressed her naked body up against his she offered him the glass and he sat up and took it you cant be sad after all that no he sipped the water i was just thinking about what stuff she pinched his arm playfully come on spit it out whats eating you i was wondering how important i was to you very really she took the glass from his hand and placed it on the nightstand she took his face in her hands and stared directly at him her eyes shone with a brightness that blinded him at this very moment in space and time you are the most important person to me at this very moment she smiled yes whats all this about are you feeling insecure i feel i know you and at the same time i dont this wasnt a line he really did feel this way he hadnt realized how much he felt this until jamie came on the scene concern clouded her expression but the remark pushed her away from him she retreated to her side of the bed what do you want to know anything he took her hand in his everything a single tear leaked from her right eye what do you want to know they held each other for a time not saying anything then she told him to get up he showered and when he returned to the bedroom she wasnt there he found her in the living room surrounded by boxes whats going on get dressed and ill tell you my life story the boxes contained photo albums dating back to her baby years she introduced him to twodimensional images of family and friends past and present it didnt matter which photos she showed him jamie was always there lurking in the corners glued to her heels like an unwanted shadow whos that nick pointed to a goodlooking boy no more than twelve dressed in a miami vice sport jacket over a pastel tshirt and white pants melanie was at his side the photo had captured some sort of school dance it was the first picture that failed to feature jamie melanie flushed and turned the page no secrets nick turned the page back he tapped the boys image with his index finger a first love perhaps yes she conceded his name was mikey pryce we went steady for six months she slapped a hand over her face i cant believe im telling you this so how did mikey break your heart she pulled back from him the temperature in the room plunged he died nicks stomach clenched as a sense of foreboding overcame him he forced out a single word how drowned during a family vacation nick turned the pages he pointed out something that lightened her mood then steered her to a picture of another boyfriend this sparked a long conversation about the boyfriends and girlfriends theyd both had he pumped her for everything he could getnames places dates his mind was on fire he committed every detail to memory ask him to do this at any other time and hed have never managed the feat but tonight it was all about saving his life and every nugget of data was stored thered been seven great loves in melanies life including mikey pryce and miles talbot each of these guys had skipped out on her she didnt make it clear whether theyd all been killed but theyd all broken things off abruptly all my boyfriends have a habit of walking out on me one way or another she turned the page on miles talbot nick took the album from her i wont you have my word on it seven people it didnt seem like a lot of people but digging up seven life stories consumed time like nick wouldnt have believed he possessed a newfound respect for the police it took hours just to come up with one single facet of someones life but nick persevered if he was going to serve jamie up to the cops this was how it would happen he used every spare moment researching melanies old boyfriends this came at the expense of melanie he saw her twice a week if he was lucky she complained but he blamed a big project at work for his absence on the plus side jamie stopped pestering him if he was daring nick to learn the truth it looked as if hed get his wish nicks first break came with mikey pryce he found a newspaper story detailing that the boy had drowned at a watering hole in sacramento where the sacto and american rivers met the competing currents had swept him away melanie had neglected to mention that she and jamie were there too jamie had provided the eyewitness account to the police was he just thirteen when hed committed his first murder looking for a pattern nick tracked down melanies high school boyfriend trent barber unlike mikey pryce trent was alive and well he hadnt strayed far from his orange county roots he was a sound engineer for the movies nick used the movie angle to get trent to speak to him on the phone but nick soon found he was out of his depth when the movie talk got technical i hear we have a mutual friend nick said in this business you need friends who is it melanie lassen who are you the question came through gritted teeth nick saw no point in lying melanies boyfriend so what are you doingchecking up on her yeah if you want to know about stds ask for a blood test im more interested in her brother jamie nick got the feeling trent was about to hang up but the mention of jamie stopped him trent s tone changed from anger to concern so hes given you the speech what speech dont piss around you wouldnt be tracking down her high school sweetheart unless hed given you the nooneisgoodenoughformysister speech and what did you do about it i blew the freak off what do you think i think he convinced you to stop seeing his sister trent went silent for a good minute before speaking again i was a good tight end in school could have gotten a scholarship why didnt you jamie broke my hand with a hammer happy now would you mind doing me a favor and go to hell nick received similar accounts from jonathon tripp and tommy frist both college boyfriends both took jamies hints before bodily harm was involved matthew warner wasnt so lucky he was an intern at a san francisco architecture firm when he dated melanie theyd gotten real close according to warners sister penny he was found at the marin headlands across from the golden gate bridge with his throat cut the police theorized the murder was a product of a carjacking since his car had been found abandoned and burnt out in san rafael the only odd factor to the case was that matt was discovered stretched out on a picnic blanket when nick hung up on penny she was crying mark bale proved to be the exception to the boyfriend rule hed dated melanie nine months before miles talbot did he lived in the city and he agreed to meet nick at a bar on the embarcadero did you ever get a visit from her brother bale turned his nose up not really he called me once but that was about it he tried some line with me but i didnt pay much attention so he didnt scare you off no then whyd you break up with her whys this so important to you indulge me nick said call it a commitment thing bale grinned shes done it to you hasnt she if he meant made him fall in love then yes nick grinned back but shrugged if you want the gods honest truth the reason mel and i didnt last was the plain fact that she got weird i was ready to settle down but then the vibe changed i didnt like it so i called it quits nicks roommate yelled out phone nick answered it good im glad youre in jamie said what do you want melanie decided we should have a night out ive got reservations for three at one market for thursday at eight okay id appreciate if it you didnt make it i would hate to disappoint melanie it would be the kinder thing to do nick ignored jamies request and met them at the restaurant melanies face lit up when she saw him approach the table but jamie just scowled nick kissed melanie and shook hands with jamie to nicks surprise and relief jamie chose to keep the dinner cordial he and nick may have exchanged penetrating stares but that was as far as it went melanie led the conversation choosing to reminisce about her childhood as melanie told it every day had been a norman rockwell painting mikey pryces drowning never even featured nick fought the urge to resurrect the ghosts if jamie was playing nice so would he despite the circumstances nick was having an enjoyable time after they finished their entrées melanie excused herself and retreated to the restroom the two men in her life watched her go i told you not to come jamie said this would be a good time to leave ill provide excuses you dont get it do you im here for the long haul havent i shown you whatll happen to you jamie i have enough on you to go to the cops right now jamie smirked i know about the others all the way from mikey pryce that sent jamies smirk running for the hills i dont want to turn you in because melanie means so much to me so ill give you a break you leave now and i dont just mean the restaurant im talking about the city the state the country i dont care just go leave us in peace ill make excuses for you jamie picked up his glass and polished off the rest of his wine i cant do that then this one is going to get messy i think youre right melanie rejoined them you two seem to be getting on like a house on fire truer words were never said jamie remarked his eyes sparkled with the irony of melanies statement weve got so much in common nick reached over and kissed melanie like you when the check came a brief fight over who would pay for the bill ensued jamie won nick couldnt help but feel hed been provided his last meal while jamie waited for the waiter to return with his credit card and receipt nick took his chance ill check in with the valets for our cars he snatched up jamies ticket stub thats okay no i insist join me mel he forced the issue by holding out her coat jamie fumed as nick walked melanie out the valet approached them on the street but nick waved him away whats going on melanie asked threes a crowd we need some alone time nick smiled i have a surprise they crossed the street over to nicks car hed gotten lucky and snagged a parking spot directly across the restaurant he gunned the engine and was pulling away when jamie came tearing out of the restaurant melanie waved goodbye to him i feel so bad melanie said where are we going dont ask questions youll spoil the surprise he headed out of the city and across the bay bridge when he reached berkeley he pointed the car in the direction of the marina the place was deserted the restaurants had closed for the night if it hadnt been for the street lighting the marina would have been in total darkness he parked in the red zone fronting the pier what are we doing here melanie asked youll see come on he came around to her side of the car and opened the door for her he took her hand and led her onto the pier then guided her toward the streetlamp at the end of it i know we havent been dating long nick began but i feel ive known you all my life she squeezed his hand youre very sweet with every step they took he cataloged his affection for her his outpourings left her speechless she never interrupted she just listened and that was good her silence gave him the courage for what he had to do when they reached the end of the pier he released her hand and turned to face her he looked into her eyes and his throat closed up cmon dont stop now she encouraged what is it out in the bay a buoy chimed the water slapped against the pier he needed encouragement to finish this to go all the way and he got it a racing engine and squealing tires cut through the calm jamie had caught up with him nick thought hed spotted jamies acura on the freeway hed hoped for a longer lead it didnt matter jamie was too late melanie i love you i love you too thats why i wanted to give you this nick reached inside his pocket a distant voice cried out but he and melanie ignored it the moment was all that counted he produced his gift a small box containing a ring he fell to one knee will you marry me stop jamie cried out his feet pounded on the wooden planking oh nick you shouldnt have why nick asked i cant you can forget jamie forget everything hes done just think about us im sorry nick melanie turned away from him jamie cried out again damn him nick thought that son of a bitch wouldnt win he jumped to his feet and grabbed melanies arm to prevent her from leaving she whirled on him he didnt see the switchblade shed removed from her purse until she plunged it into his stomach confusion dulled his pain she jerked the blade free and his legs went out from under him why nick asked his words weak in his throat jamie caught up a moment later he fell to his knees at nicks side to examine the wound not again he murmured not again nick looked straight at melanie her gaze was glassy absent and a stiffness had overcome her she was a million miles away from this nick why didnt you listen to me jamie said i tried to warn you i did everything i could to protect you you made me think it was you it was easier that way i didnt want you thinking it was her shes not a bad person shes just damaged what are you talking about nick tried to move but the pain in his abdomen stopped him cold our father jamie tried to apply pressure to the wound but blood oozed between his fingers and nick groaned he loved her loved her too much loved her so much he ruined her you must have noticed she never talks about him and has no pictures of him in the condo it started sinking in she killed mikey pryce and all the others father was the first the pain in his heart matched the pain in his stomach i dont understand what did i do wrong i cant explain it it doesnt make sense to anyone except her you crossed the line for her i just wanted to love her thats crossing the line you can love her you just cant love her all the way it made a twisted kind of sense nick pictured the day at the watering hole where mikey pryce had promised to love melanie forever even promising to marry her unwittingly hed triggered melanies murderous reflex which she repeated with matthew warner

suspense with more than forty novels and ten million copies of her books in print worldwide she is a proven master of the craft who knows how to complicate the tensions behind everyday relationships if theres a characters heart to be broken joan will snap it in two and decide later if it should be allowed to heal in watch out for my girl nash benedict finds himself turning benedict arnold after promising to look after his brothers girl while he serves in iraq an accidental crush becomes an inappropriate affair of the heart and that leads the characters headlong into a meeting with murder watch out for my girl i had a helluva time getting your number benedict i called because morgan hunter is missing nash benedict heard the irritation in the voice of morgans boss captain hart commander of fire station in chevy chase maryland he made no apology he was hard to reach for good reason a picture of morgans anguished face the last time hed seen her flashed across his mind his voice was unexpectedly thick with emotion as he confirmed morgans missing she didnt show up this morning at seven for her twentyfourhour shift and didnt call to say she wouldnt be showing up shes never missed a day of work in five years never even been late you can see why id be concerned nash glanced at his watch pm shes been missing since seven this morning and youre just now calling me id have called you sooner but nobody knew how to reach you the captain retorted someday soon morgan hunter would be his sisterinlaw she was dating his younger brother carter whod left six months ago for a oneyear tour of duty in iraq watch out for my girl nash dont let anything happen to her while im serving my country overseas nash had known what carter really meant was dont let some son of a bitch move in on morgan while im serving my country overseas carter had never imagined that something sinister might threaten his girl or that the something sinister might be his elder brother nash felt the blood pound in his temples carter had asked only one favor and nash had failed to deliver completely hed done his best over the past six months while carter was dismantling iedsimprovised explosive devicesin iraq to keep an eye on carters girl in between covert missions for the us president nash had gone sailing with morgan on chesapeake bay laughed with her at a revival of a funny thing happened on the way to the forum at the kennedy center and picked crabs with her at the crab shack in baltimore nash hadnt expected to fall in love with his brothers girl any more than hed expected her to disappear but he was in love with morgan hunter and no one had seen hide nor hair of the woman for the past eighteen hours nash felt a wave of guilt wash over him this was his fault morgan had run from him because of what hed done last night on her front doorstep he hadnt meant to kiss her theyd been convulsed with laughter leaning helplessly on each other shed turned her face up to his sharing the hilarious moment on impulse hed lowered his head and his mouth had found hers for a moment shed responded hungrily then shed gasped and backed up a step and stared at him in the harsh porch light with wide wounded brown eyes asking him without words how he could betray his brother how he could betray her trust nash didnt want morgan to be the victim of some accident but he grasped at that possibility as something besides his behavior that might have caused her absence from work youve checked with the area hospitals he asked the commander i called the hospitals i checked with her father in bethesda ive left messages on her cellwhich have gone straight to voice mail i even sent another firefighter to her apartment in avendale captain hart said the front door was unlocked but the place was pristine no signs of disturbance her purse was there with her wallet inside but her keys and her cell phone and her jeep were missing are you telling me no one has any idea where she might have gone nash asked the station commander i figured you would know benedict youre the one shes been spending all her free time with captain hart made it an accusation i dont have a clue where she is nash snapped she was fine when i left her about ten last night except perhaps for feeling as guilty then about what had happened between them as nash did now i cant believe you kissed me what were you thinking im going to marry your brother when he comes home i love him shed swiped the back of her hand across her mouth as though to wipe away his kiss staring at him above that erasing hand through wary watery eyes i miss carter shed said quietly using his brothers name to stab him in the heart i think it would be better if we dont see each other anymore shed added twisting the knife nash shuddered at the memory one of my best firefighters has disappeared the captain said if you know anything i dont nash could hear the affection and agony in the commanders voice he knew exactly how the man felt ill be calling the local precinct to file a missing persons report when enough time has passed i dont like the looks of this benedict i dont like it at all nash closed his cell phone and slipped it back into the pocket of his cammies he was scheduled to leave for el salvador with his team on a covert presidential mission at midnight which gave him just six hours to find his brothers girl and make amends assuming she would let him apologize assuming that the reason shed disappeared was nothing more sinister than an unwanted kiss nash felt the hairs rise on the back of his neck as he thought of what else might have happened to morgan hunter what if juan espinoza the drug lord whose coca crop nash had ruined the last time he was in colombia had figured out the identity of his nemesis the ghost and made good on his threat ill find you el fantasma then ill find what you love most and ill destroy it nash huffed out a breath he hadnt feared the threat because hed been sure his cover was unassailable no one except his elite team knew that nash benedict son of presidential advisor foster benedict was the scourge of the south american drug trade and of montana militiamen and basque separatists and somalian war lords what if one of his many foes had found him out and come seeking vengeancethrough the woman he loved maybe his kiss had nothing to do with morgans disappearance nash felt adrenaline spill into his veins felt his muscles cord with tension and his neck hairs hackle a feral beast readying for battle but he was also a rational man and his thoughts held him in place if morgan had been kidnapped why hadnt he received a ransom note or a vindictive message telling him that what he loved most was lost forever maybe the note is on the way that thought sent a chill rattling down his spine and maybe youre freaking out over nothing maybe morgan took off for a while to think and missed work without calling her boss morgan hunter was the strongest most confident most together woman he knew which was a great part of his attraction to her she was a firefighter who often dealt with lifeanddeath emergencies would a woman with her selfconfidence her physical and emotional strength fall apart from a single kiss for which the perpetrator had been wellchastised on the spot he had to find morgan and bring her home safe that was the least he could do after kissing his brothers girl morgan hunter couldnt believe the predicament in which she found herself shed felt confused and upset when shed grabbed her keys an hour after nash benedict had kissed her and gone for a drive to think she hadnt planned to be gone long shed left the radio off in her jeep because she didnt want to be distracted or soothed she wanted to examine her feelings with brutal honesty because she had strong feelings for nash benedict that conflicted with her love for his brother shed left home without thinking which direction she was going when she finally noticed her surroundings an hour later she was driving along a winding deserted rockandgravel road almost at the same instant a deer appeared in her headlights the deer froze and so did she at least for that part of a second that would have allowed her to brake before she hit the animal or make a wiser choice than the one she made morgan had seen enough accident victims as a firefighter to know that hitting anything headon even if she was only going fortyfive was a bad move so she jerked the wheel to miss the deer then jerked it again to miss the gnarled trunk of an ancient black walnutand flipped her jeep it rolled three times before it came to an abrupt and jarring halt rightsideup in the embrace of a copse of spruce sometime during one of those rolls the drivers side air bag had deployed it was already deflating but morgan smelled the acrid scent of the cartridge that had exploded to fill it with air and watched wideeyed as a stream of white smoke rose behind the steering wheel it had all happened so fast morgan couldnt believe she was alive and apparently unhurt she gasped with relief and felt a sharp pain in her chest not entirely unhurt she had either badly bruised or broken a rib she reached down with a trembling hand to fumble at the seat belt release she felt tremendously relieved when she heard a click and the seat belt let go with the constricting pressure gone from her chest she took another deep breath ow she croaked could that excruciating pain be the result of a rib that was simply bruised she would have to be very careful if she put a broken rib through her lung out here in the middle of nowhere it was goodbye so long adios baby she recognized the swelling along the back of her neck as a whiplash injury warm blood dripped from her chin and she realized she must have bitten her cheek or her lip morgan was afraid to move afraid to discover another injury most of the full moons light was blocked by trees that had only half shed their autumn leaves she reached around the deflated air bag searching for the keys which she found in the ignition she tasted blood as she caught her lower lip in her teeth for luckand turned the key the car was dead bad words bad words bad words she muttered there was no sign of civilization from where she was sitting thank god shed brought her cell phone with her shed almost left it at home because she was afraid nash would call and she didnt want to speak to him until shed sorted out what she was going to say she certainly didnt want to talk to him now not after doing something so stupid better to call morgan reachedcarefullyinto the shallow pocket of her black leather jacket and found it empty bad bad words she reached up gingerly to turn on the interior light to search for where her phone might have landed which was when she realized the windows on the passengers side of the car were shattered had her cell phone gone out one of those broken windows she felt a flash of panic and shoved it down shed recently heard a story about a woman whod lost control of her car on route and hit a tree shed been foundten days laterpartially consumed by wild animals and riddled with insects thats not me she said out loud she tried to turn her head to look in the backseat but it hurt too much she shoved at the drivers side door and it screeched open she eased herself sideways groaning when she realized that one of her ankles was swollen the size of a grapefruit great thats just great her jeep footwell was high enough off that ground that she would have a drop when she got out of the car she braced herself with her hands then scooted off the seat and landed on her uninjured foot even that little bit of jarring hurt both her chest and her ankle she hissed in a breath and held it as she put pressure on her injured foot ow she said again oh ow she closed her eyes for a moment relieved that her ankle was only sprained painful but not impossible to walk on the back passenger door was crushed and wouldnt budge she limped to the hatch and opened it and crawled up inside on hands and knees leaning over the backseat to search for her phone she was appalled at how weak she felt shock she realized maybe she was even bleeding internally if that rib was broken and tearing into her flesh she knew too much about internal bleeding too much about broken ribs stabbing into lungs too much about shock killing you as fastor even fasterthan your actual injuries she couldnt find her phone she consoled herself with the thought that even if she found it there might not be any reception out here if someone picked her up on the road she wouldnt need her cell phone and if no one picked her up tonight she could always hobble back here and hunt for her phone in the daylight she suddenly realized how cold it was cold enough to see her breath cold enough to make her shiver in the light leather jacket shed grabbed on her way out the door morgan found a dogwood limb she could use for a makeshift cane and followed the trail of destruction caused by her jeep back to the road her flourescent watch showed it was six minutes past midnight what were the chances someone would be coming along this twolane rockandgravel road at this hour morgan stood at the edge of the road and looked in both directions she wasnt even sure which way led to the closet place where help could be found she hadnt walked ten steps beforeto her amazement and delightshe saw a pair of headlights in the distance almost sagging with relief she watched the car make its slow winding way toward her to her surprise the car stopped fifty yards downhill from her she started to yell at the driver as he stepped out of the car into the bright moonlight for some reason her breath caught in her throat and held her silent why is he stopping there as she watched he slid a small slender body out of the backseat and hefted it over his shoulder a very long striped lightanddark scarf was draped around his neck the womans long blond hair hung almost to his butt nearly even with the length of his scarf morgan instinctively stepped back into the shadows a moment before the stranger looked in her direction her heart was racketing in her chest and she held her hands over her mouth to keep him from seeing her breath in the cold air she stared hard at the license plate of the car so she could identify this probable killer to the police but it was too far away to make out the numbers she had no idea of the make or model to her it was simply a darkcolored fourdoor car the man disappeared into the undergrowth at the side of the road he came back emptyhanded five minutes later got into his car and drove away morgan realized what a narrow escape shed had what if shed shouted out to the man what if shed become his next victim no onenot nash not carterwould have known what had become of her she chastised herself for naming nash first youve been spending time with nash thats all you miss carter you love carter in six months you will marry carter if she survived the night when the car disappeared from sight she struggled back onto the road and began hobbling in the opposite direction the killer had taken even with her makeshift cane her ankle hurt her chest hurt and she was very very cold morgan saw the headlights appear over her shoulder before she heard the car wheels on the stoneandgravel road she turned and saw a darkcolored car for an instant she was afraid it was the killer she glanced at her watch ten minutes had passed surely this was someone else just in case she would stay closer to the forest than the road if the driver was wearing that distinctive scarf shed fade into the forest and hide she cried out in agony when she raised her arm to flag down the darkcolored car she saw it had four doors and felt a shiver run down her spine when the car stopped the power window slid down on the passengers side morgan held a hand to her aching chest as she leaned to peer inside and nearly cried out with relief the driver was a woman there was no sign of a scarf darkandlightstriped or any other color you need a ride the woman asked yes thank you morgan said as she opened the door and slid into the amazing warmth of the car i nearly hit a deer i ended up driving off the road youre bleeding morgan touched her chin where the blood had dried i think i bit my lip when my car flipped youre lucky to be alive dont i know it i was starting to think id have to walk home this road doesnt seem to get much traffic no it doesnt the woman said as morgan pulled the door closed and reached carefully for the seat beat she saw the fringe of a navyandwhitestriped scarf on the floor of the backseat and hissed in a tortured terrified breath i didnt see your car the woman said as she put her car in gear and continued in the direction shed been driving morgan hesitated then said its back a ways off in the bushes my husband just got home from work the woman said i asked him to pick me up some cigarettes on his way home but he forgotlucky for you morgan was very much afraid that she was riding in a murderers carwith his wife did the woman know what her husband had done was she an accomplice morgan realized she might have made a mistake getting into the car do you have a cell phone i could use sorry the woman said shaking her head theres a pay phone at the convenience store where were headed the womans cell phone rang morgans neck hurt when she jerked it toward the woman who reached into the pocket of her furtrimmed coat and retrieved a cell phone flipped it open and said you were right there was someone on the road yeah shes in the car with me now morgan didnt think she simply grabbed the wheel and yanked it hard and found herself headed for another large tree trunk let go of the wheel the woman cried morgan heard the shriek of tearing metal and a womans scream the police would eventually have checked out the gps on morgans cell phone but nash was able to access the information immediately thank god shed left it on if she was still in possession of her phone she was about an hour north of chevy chase somewhere along route northwest of frederick maryland nash made good time on i north and merged onto us the coordinates hed put into his gps sent him to hamburg road the sun had disappeared behind the mountains and the sudden chill had created patches of fog making visibility iffy he stopped at a convenience store before he headed up the mountain and showed a picture of morgan and described her vehicle to the clerk the man shook his head id have remembered a woman like that he showed the picture to another man in the store and said have you seen this woman the man shook his head there would be no moonlight for hours and even then nash wondered if it would penetrate the thick undergrowth on the sides of the road the pavement ended and he found himself driving on a rough rockandgravel road except where humans had carved hiking trails the mountain terrain seemed impenetrable what the hell had she been doing up here it seemed impossible he could find a lone woman in this vast wilderness except he had precise gps coordinates that told him where to find her cell phone nash stopped when his headlights picked out the tornup grass where morgans jeep had apparently left the road his heart was in his throat as he grabbed a flashlight and headed off into the undergrowth the trail of destruction left a clear path to follow he found morgans cell phone near a crushed elderberry tree he hurried forward but when he reached her car it was empty morgan he shouted feeling frantic morgan are you out here he was greeted by an eerie silence he turned in a circle and saw a light down the hill in the distance on the opposite side of the road moving through the underbrush that must be her he ran back to his suv and raced down the winding road despite the fog that had gathered in the hollows afraid the moving light wouldnt be visible when he got to where hed seen it from above when he reached the bottom of the hill he found a rustedout chevy pickup parked where hed seen the light but the light hed seen from above had disappeared he heard the engine ticking on the pickup so he knew it hadnt been there long he shined his flashlight in the front seat of the truck when he tried the doors they were locked then he checked the truck bed and saw blood dried blood had morgan been lying in the bed of that truck sometime during the past eighteen hours nash swore in frustration as he tried to find a way through the thick undergrowth on the side of the road there was a lot of blood in the bed of that truck was he too late is anybody out there he shouted there was no sound not even a breath of wind to rustle the trees he fought back his fear and shouted again morgan its nash are you out there he heard branches crackling as though someone was moving through the underbrush he shined his flashlight toward the sound but couldnt see much beyond the first colorful layer of bushes as he was lowering the light he caught sight of a broken branch more than a few broken branches and realized the swath of destruction was wide enough to have been made by a vehicle another accident he was confused for a moment but he knew from the light hed seenand the truck on the side of the roadthat someone was here he followed the trail shouting as he ran morgan im coming hold on baby im coming if hed been in another line of work nash would have died a moment later some instinct caused him to duck as he felt a rush of air near his ear and the thick branch that would have brained him made contact with his right shoulder instead causing him to drop his flashlight he grunted in pain and turned to confront his attacker the man was swinging the branch in the opposite direction when nash stepped under it and hit him in the solar plexus doubling him over nash followed with an uppercut that rocked the mans head back arms flailing his attacker fell over backward nash followed him grabbing two handfuls of the mans corduroy jacket and dragging him upright to hit him again the heavyset man put his hands up and cried stop stop nash frisked him onehanded then dropped him on the ground and retrieved his flashlight he shined it on the mans face and realized hed seen him before at the convenience store what are you doing out here he asked my wife is missing she went out last night to get some cigarettes and never came back we had an argument so i thought maybe she spent the night with her mother when she never showed up this morning i thought maybe she had an accident ive been looking for her along this road most of the day why did you attack me i was afraid people are always dumping stuff up here at night thats illegal you know so i thought maybe his voice trailed off and he shrugged sheepishly theres dried blood in the back of your pickup oh thats nothing nothing nash shot back i found a deer on the side of the roadhit by a car i guess i put it in my truck figuring id butcher it but it wasnt dead and it woke up and jumped out animal blood nash shook his head in disgust he turned and followed the trail of broken branches and car wreckage to a darkcolored toyota it had run headon into a sycamore his heart began thudding hard when he spied the bloodstained windshield on the drivers side his flashlight reflected something on the passengers window a bloody handprint then he saw the longlegged female body lying on the leafstrewn ground the head and shoulders were covered with a black leather jacket he recognized the distinctive silver buttons the jacket belonged to morgan he gave a cry of anguish as he ran forward and dropped to his knees beside the body he gently eased the jacket away even though the woman was apparently dead and swallowed the sob that erupted as he realizedit isnt morgan this must be his attackers wife but who had covered her dead face with morgans jacket and where was morgan nash his name came as a whisper on the wind he felt his heart surge with joy as he called into the darkness morgan where are you equally quiet a ghostly warning look out nash whirled and rose in one motion and found himself facing a colt automatic where the hell is she the stranger said in a harsh voice that bitch killed my wife whats your connection to the woman who owns that leather jacket nash asked the stranger sneered she saw me dump a body couldnt leave her out here after that sent my wife to pick her up and that bitch crashed my car nash glanced at the car and realized how desperate morgan must have been and how brave and how precious she was to him she killed my wife the stranger ranted nash glanced at the dead body he knew morgan must have done everything in her power to save the woman it was what she did when im done with you ill find her and shell pay the stranger was distracted by a crash in the underbrush the instant he turned his head nash leapt he was nearly deafened by the gunshot but the bullet shot past his ear into the night he made short work of disarming the stranger this time he used the mans own weapon to knock him out when the short lifeanddeath struggle was over nash shoved himself onto his feet and said in a calm quiet voice where are you morgan a faint voice said im here he followed morgans voice to a spot in the bushes behind the sycamore tree she was sitting up with her back braced against a red maple he kept his flashlight lowered so it wouldnt hit her in the eyes but he couldnt help noticing her bloodsoaked shirt and her bloody lacerated face his knees surprised him by buckling and he dropped onto the leaves beside her what kind of shape are you in he was afraid to touch her she was covered in blood cracked rib i think sprainedmaybe fracturedankle whiplash multiple cuts on my face and arms broken finger thats all thats enough she said with asperity you took long enough getting here i was waiting for your call she avoided his gaze and said matteroffactly i lost my phone and the dead womans phone got broken in a million little bits in the crash i was afraid to go out on the road because i knew that killer would come hunting his wife so ive been hiding she paused met his gaze and said waiting for you to find me nash brushed the knuckles of his hand across her bloodcrusted cheek when i saw that body i thought you were dead when i saw that tree coming at me im sorry morgan i know so am i im leaving the country in a few hours if you need mefor anythingleave a message on my phone and she moaned as she lifted her arm to brush her scraped knuckles across his cheek her eyes brimmed with tears as she said goodbye nash he didnt pretend to misunderstand what she was saying he couldnt fight for her not when she loved his brother he had to let her go so do i call an ambulance he said at last or can i just pick you up and drive you to the nearest hospital she managed a tenuous smile call the cops to come get that murdering son of a bitch then take me to the nearest hospital jon land killing time has all the earmarks of international bestselling author jon land a tense situation in which time is your enemy impossible odds and a villain youre not likely to ever forget even if he happens to be on your side the main character in killing time fallon is a sociopath hes a professional killer whoafter a kill goes horribly wronghides out by murdering and impersonating an english teacher at hampton lake middle school jon got the idea for this story after the tragic events that happened in chechnya when terrorists seized a schoolkilling and wounding hundreds of students it fascinated him to think about what would have happened if the terrorists had come across someone as demented and violent as they were killing time is the answer to that question and its not pretty killing time were glad to have you aboard mr beechum said roger meeks principal of hampton lake middle school rising from behind his desk i think youre going to be most happy here fallon thought about how hed killed the last man he shook hands with and released the principals flaccid grip quickly that mans name was beechum and hed had the misfortune to pick up a sodden weary fallon hitchhiking on the side of a lonely interstate poor beechum also had the misfortune of being in the process of relocating to a new state to take a new job and for having a passing resemblance to fallon passing in that they both had dark hair and features close enough to allow fallon to effortlessly fool principal meeks with only minor modifications to his own appearance your résumé is quite impressive meeks continued retaking his seat and looking up from the pages before him their eyes met and for just a moment fallon thought the principal was studying him perhaps noticing the anomalies with the face of the nowdead teacher clipped to the top sheet but then he smiled i think youre going to be very happy at hampton lake middle school lets show you the building the tour as meeks called it was important to fallon though he smiled through its course careful to ask all the right questions he was actually cataloguing various routes of escape and hiding that his former employers were after him was not in doubt at all any more than the fact they would eventually be successful because fallon had failed them worse fallon had misbehaved by executing those sent to make him pay for his failure his former employers would have been wise to let him go and be done with it but they couldnt take the chance fallon would come after them here he became a victim of his own welldeserved reputation his background in special forces had taught him to not just accept killing but embrace it as a skill to be mastered like any other with practice the meansknife gun bare hand explosivesmattered not at all only the result and with fallon the result was always the same except once and now because of that he was on the run killing time in the guise of a middleschool english teacher or language arts as they called it these days meeks continued the tour of hampton lake middle school in perfunctory fashion fallon nodding and smiling at all the appropriate times the building was tshaped with two long hallways separated by an enclosed courtyard adjoining a perpendicular twostory wing at the buildings front end located farthest from the road a gym and presentation room were located in the back end the cafeteria in the front fallon noted a drop ceiling heavy enough to support a mans weight accessing a crawl space that ran the length of the building on both sides the location of the subbasement containing the electrical and heating elements was more difficult to pin down at this point normally fallon would look for places to stash weapons as well here he didnt consider that to be a factor if he was found escape would be the thing not confrontation now meeks said the cursory tour over lets show you your classroom eighthgrade honors english language arts was just finishing an abridged heavily censored version of a book called catch fallon rented the movie that night and didnt really get most of it except the title concept of a wartime pilot in search of a loophole to be deemed too crazy to fly fallon thought parts were supposed to be funny but didnt laugh and was glad when it was time for the class to move on to frankenstein fallon hadnt read the book either but hed seen the movie the old one with boris karloff and figured that was close enough his classroom overlooked the front of the building including an ovalshaped drive that enclosed a parking lot used by teachers as well as visitors fallon couldnt see the main entrance but had a clear view of any vehicle approaching it which was the next best thing so who do we think is the villain in the story fallon asked his class his remark was greeted by shrugs and quick glances cast amidst his young charges having no real concept of how to teach exactly hed constructed his classes around discussion fortunately hed come at a time of the semester devoted to literature and didnt expect to still be around for the next unit more than a month in any one setting would be tempting fate indeed the villain fallon prompted leaning back so he was halfway sitting on the lip of his desk frankenstein a boy named trent said from the rear trent had floppy hair and the first signs of acne fallon liked him because he recognized a worn patch in the rear pocket of his jeans as the outline of a switchblade fallon looked into trents eyes and saw emotionless stonecold resignation a boy after his own heart not the monster trent continued without further prompt the doctor why fallon asked him cause he fucked with nature the moment froze everyone staring at fallon in shock trent resumed again saving him the bother of coming up with an appropriate response so the monster kills all these people terrorizes the village scares the crap out of people but its not his fault not really so hes not responsible for his own actions fallon challenged poor bastard doesnt even know what hes doing blame frankenstein for bringing him to life like parents a frizzyhaired girl named chelsea chimed in between crackling chomps on a wad of gum sending a brief laugh rippling through the classroom maybe thats shelleys point someone else said so the monsters not evil fallon raised no came the multiple response but hes not good either no so what is he the same as everybody else trent said booted feet propped up on the desk before him five weeks earlier fallon had received his next job through the usual means a text message sent to his cell phone dispatched him to a public email web site he logged in at the nearest fedexkinkos and entered the coded details into his pda fallon never knew the reason for his targets selection he only needed to know who and where sometimes how and when his logon automatically triggered the deposit of half his fee into a previously designated offshore bank account setting up a kill could take considerable time up to several weeks a period during which fallon became intimately acquainted with the habits of his targets without immersing himself into the minutia of their lives the last job was different because it specified the targets entire family be included someone out to set an example obviously make a point discussion here was not an option even if fallon had wanted he couldnt have asked for confirmation and clarification and if the fact that the targets family consisted of a wife and three young children bothered fallon there was no way to contact his employer to change his mind the url from which his assignment had been sent was a dummy site automatically deactivated as soon as fallon logged off declining a job was never an option once the mechanical triggering apparatus made fallon an even richer man catch wiring the targets house with explosives was easy enough doing it in a way that would make it look like a tragic accident only slightly harder the only drawback hed have to trigger the blast manually himself not an attractive prospect considering he much preferred being somewhere else far away when the explosion ripped lumber and concrete flesh and blood apart fallon was not a man prone to question or marred by pangs of conscience and the early stages of the job progressed without being terribly struck by either a man like fallon could not view human beings with any higher regard than say crashtest dummies or departmentstore mannequins they were his means to an end though with ample funds for a secure retirement in place he was hardpressed to say exactly what those ends were except he couldnt retire he enjoyed his work too much catch and his latest assignment shouldve have gone down like all the others all in place and on schedule fallon following his instructions to the letter to make sure all family members were inside before triggering the blast detonators were a thing of the past mostly cell phones the thing these days simple matter of wiring the trigger chip with a number and then dialing it at the appropriate time thered be a brief delay several seconds or more but that wasnt a problem in this case fallon took his throwaway cell phone from his pocket and dialed let it ring once and then settled back to wait from his car parked safely down the street counting the seconds out in his head onetwothree by five fallon began to feel edgy and at ten he redialed let it ring twice this time counted the seconds again same result nothing setbacks were nothing new to fallon failure something else again there was no time to consider what had gone wrong better to focus on damage control what to do from here fallon had weapons a bounty of them but murdering an entire family in the suburbs with guns and knives without a clear plan of access and approach would be a desperate move not befitting a professional of his level worse hed be acting rashly with the eventual outcome dictated by fortune instead of forethought better to come back rethink the next step tomorrow except tomorrow turned out worse the next book on the honors english list was called johnny got his gun fallon couldnt find a movie version but the book was short and supposedly about war so he decided to read it the book was short and fallon understood nary a word much less what the book was supposed to be about antiwar that much was clear if nothing else so he decided to focus the classs discussion on war itself something he knew plenty about but mr beechum of course didnt which meant fallon couldnt appear to either he listened to the surprisingly intelligent unsettling comments made by his students unsettling because it made him realize how much he missed that part of his life for its simplicity and clarity the ability to kill for a cause with impunity of course the cause meant little to fallon it was the impunity he embraced with a fervor and passion unknown in any previous segment of his life an unpleasant end to his military career was as expected as it was inevitable fortunately there were plenty of private firms willing to pay far more while letting him practice his same skills that too ended badly in an embarrassing scandal for the company and yet another inglorious dismissal for fallon but there was no shortage of work for a man with fallons skills and hed been stateside barely a week when a similarly exmember of the same private firm came calling with an offer to join a network of professionals whose work was appreciated instead of vilified fallon didnt bother himself with delusions of morality of right and wrong he did what he did and he liked it simple as that the class agreed with the books antiwar stance fallon wished hed been able to tell them the true side of things about the various pleasures a man could derive from watching a face explode to a bullet or the guttural gasps a victim makes when a knife digs deep and tears he wished he could explain that violence was something to neither be shunned nor embraced it simply was just like him to make his point fallon decided to stray from the lesson plan and introduce the only story he actually remembered reading as a boy read so much the pages actually disintegrated the words disappearing until there were no sentences left and fallon reluctantly discarded the handout he hadnt thought of that story in a very long time until now glad to find a copy ripe for photocopying in the school library the most dangerous game the librarian said reading over fallons shoulder as collated copies spit out from the machines feeder a true classic but a bit violent dont you think when fallon returned the following morning the target family was gone whisked away in the dawn hours by shadowy men in black suvs if the neighbors were to be believed fbi or federal marshals no doubt extricating fallons targets into witness protection fallon had never failed before but there were percentages involved in everything and here the odds had finally caught up with him he found himself obsessing over every move he had made to retrace where hed gone wrong the wiring perhaps maybe a bad chip a reception or transmission problem even that was why fallon was awake in his motel room when they came four of them all wellarmed and wellskilled enough to know not to drive their car too close to his room in the motor court but theyd left their headlights on a second too long enough to alert fallon that someone was coming he gauged the distance suggested by the strength of the headlights and counted the seconds again onetwothree the door blew inward at six fallon unleashing a fusillade that was every bit the equal of his four wouldbe killers so much passed through his mind as the bullets chewed up the walls around him and the smell of blood mixed with sulfur and cordite the roar from the three guns he managed to reach drowned out the screams mostly and fallon was screeching away from the scene before another light snapped on in any of the nearby rooms the reality of the moment struck him and fast the fact that his employers wouldnt stop with these four men especially since fallon had so effortlessly executed them was no less a reality than the fact that his time as a contractor was effectively over there was no redemption or second chances he had gone from the very best at what he did to irrelevant in the seconds it had taken him to gun down four men catch fallon had effectively prepared for this moment while never really considering it a possibility money would not be a problem he had plenty of it stashed away the issue was getting to it safely making the necessary arrangements with according precautions and such things took time that meant disappearing without the use of any of his various identifies all of which could be compromised now his employers and conduits knew too much about him his habits and patterns disappearing meant relying on none of them becoming someone else entirely while laying the groundwork for his permanent departure from parts known there were plenty of third world countries into which he could vanish only to resurface as a man with a different identity boasting the kind of skills that were always in need fallon couldnt imagine himself wallowing away the time on a beach no matter how beautiful or plentiful the women his life had been defined by killing for too long to either risk or want change for now going off the grid meant avoiding all forms of security cameras and public transportation including buses trains and airplanes rental cars were out as well and stealing too many cars could leave the kind of pattern he needed to avoid that left hitchhiking mr beechums was the fifth car in a week to chance picking him up fallon didnt kill the others and hadnt expected to kill beechum until the ditzy man kept speaking enthusiastically of the new job he was headed for thats when the plan unfolded for fallon and the best he was able to do for beechum in return was kill him in quick painless fashion i love kids was the last thing the teacher said making a difference in their lives and all in that moment fallon couldnt have known the kind of difference hed end up making fallon saw the two vans creep toward the schools entrance when he was in the third day of discussing the most dangerous game they were noteworthy first for the fact they drove onto the grounds down the wrong side of the ushaped drive fronting the building and second because the vans wore the markings of a professional cleaning service such markings always allowed for unquestioned access to buildings public and otherwise but why would a middle school with a full janitorial staff need a professional cleaning service fallons heart began to beat faster as the vans drifted out of his line of sight two vans meant a dozen men or more certainly overkill on the part of his former employers and if they had ascertained his presence here at hampton lake theyd be much better off laying an ambush instead of storming the building in full awareness of his conceivable escape that reality should have made him feel better but it didnt instincts had saved his life often enough for fallon to learn to trust them and right now they were scratching at his spine like scalpels peeling back the flesh rainsfords my kind of guy trent was saying from his customary perch in the back of the room why fallon managed to ask not really paying attention his eyes strayed out the window again but the vans did not reappear he moved closer to the glass hoping to better his angle because he kicks general zaroffs ass and it was zaroffs own fucking fault why fallon asked intrigued in spite of the nagging feeling that wouldnt go away because hed been playing the game too long hunting men who knows how many of them so why stop because he shouldve known hed meet his match sooner or later its like you know inevitable fallon moved away from the window suddenly intrigued so whyd he keep doing it come on people put yourself in zaroffs shoes cause its all he had said a girl in the front row all he knew what else he was good at it someone else answered when youre that good you dont think anybodyll ever beat you was rainsford better at the game than the general fallon asked his class no said trent zaroff lost cause he got lazy when you get lazy you get beat every time but rainsford he was a hero why he saved lives of zaroffs future victims not all heroes mean to be heroes if you get my drift may i have your attention please the voice of principal meeks boomed over the schools pa system all students and teachers please report to the gymnasium immediately thats all students and teachers please report to the the principals voice cut off in midsentence as if hed accidentally hit the wrong switch fallon watched his students begin to rise from their desks replaying meekss words in his headnot for content so much as cadence something all wrong about the tone and import fallon knew the sound of a man under duress because hed put countless men in just that position when you get lazy you get beat every time no fallon said before the student closest to the door could open it back to your seats but back to your seats the edge in fallons voice had his students returning to their desks without further question the hallway beyond filled with students spilling out of nearby classrooms the heavy trampling of feet signaling the approach of those emerging from the twostory wing at the buildings head mr beechum fallon swung toward the windows again they only opened inward at the very top enough to provide ventilation but not escape mr beechum fallon didnt answer mr beechum was gone trent fallon said the persona shed cold eyes boring down on the boy whod been his favorite give me your switchblade my wh now trent the voice not raised just measured and certain its a butterfly knife trent fished the butterfly knife out of his backpack brought it up to fallon and extended it toward him in a trembling hand fallon wished he could smile at him reassuringly the way mr beechum would except mr beechum was gone okay fallon said everyone line up starting on this wall and wrapping around to the back of the room shoulder to shoulder very close out of sight from the door why a girl asked moving to obey fallon didnt answer beyond his classroom the thick flow of students and their teacher escorts continued down the corridor oblivious to whatever might be transpiring fallon hoped he was wrong but knew he wasnt he had spent his life as zaroff the odds stacked heavily in his favor but now suddenly he found himself as rainsford when youre that good you dont think anybodyll ever beat you well whoever had come in those vans was in for a big surprise werent they the moments passed in silence broken only by the loud breathing of his students or maybe it wasnt loud maybe fallon just heard it that way the hallway emptied a few stragglers passing the windowed door and then no one a pause then fresh footsteps crackling atop tile alone followed by the creaking echo of doors being thrust open each growing louder fallon snapped the butterfly knifes blade into position a boy whimpered two girls began to sob then a third fallon pressed a single finger against his lips signaling them to be quiet ducked back so he was out of sight from the doorway the heavy footsteps drew closer the knob rattled door easing inward a student gasped a man lurched past fallon never seeing him fallon noted the highend submachine gun he was steadying with a second hand in the last moment before he pounced arm wrapped around the mans neck to silence him as he drew trents butterfly knife on a sharp upward angle required to slice through bone and gristle digging into the lungs and shredding them the man gurgled and rasped fighting against fallon as bloody froth poured from his mouth fallon snapped his neck for good measure studying his face as he dragged him across the room before the horrified stares of his students the man was arab fallon could tell that from sight as well as smell smells were important to him you spend enough time all over the world in the various cesspits of humanity and you begin to know men by their smells as much as anything an arab all right and in that moment fallon realized everything he had been dispatched to iraq to prevent had finally come to pass the foreign stink come home fallon was free to escape now two vans meant a dozen men at least the other eleven likely scattered throughout the building he could flee the building without so much as killing another or perhaps just one maybe use one of their vans as his escape vehicle and leave them to whatever debacle they intended to perpetrate on the school and the world it wasnt his world anyway not anymore or was it he glanced at his students bunched tighter together now hugging each other as they stared at him in terror the way they would a monster like the one frankenstein had created or maybe general zaroff mad for the hunt johnny got his gun all right flee and these students his students would inevitably end up in the gym with the others perhaps to be made an example of for disobeying terrorists like these were not very original and that awareness sparked a memory in fallons head of chechnyan terrorists taking a school over in that particular godforsaken hostage situation the students brought to the gymnasium just like here and then the gym was blown up while the whole world watched no not very original but effective all the same fallon tried to imagine how hed do it how many men in the gym versus how many patrolling and securing the building he settled on four in the gym eight for the building seven now fallon stooped and began working the dead mans jacket free i need you all to stay here fallon told his students dont make a sound and wait for me to come back for you they looked at him as the stranger he had become even before hed donned the terrorists jacket and bandana squeezed his feet into the dead mans work boots and slung his submachine gun from his shoulder enough to pass for the dead man from a reasonable distance which was the best he could hope for the hijackers had never all met each other but this kind of operation was different requiring practice and synchronization they would know the building as well as he did every crawl space every nook every cranny the difference of course was he knew the terrorists were here while they had no idea he was wait for me to come back for you why had he said that fallon wondered once he was in the hallway careful to leave the door open as all the others on the hallway were it would be so easy for him to flee the building now before the inevitable appearance of the authorities on the scene that was no longer an option for him the challenge the game before him much too great to consider walking away from but was he zaroff or was he rainsford the building was eerily quiet save for the din coming from the gymnasium area where nearly students were being crammed in even now fallon tried to remember all the details of the chechnyan school seizing those terrorists had waited for the authorities to arrive waited for them to mount their illfated raid before triggering the explosives and killing hundreds it would be the same way here the strategy aimed at drawing the most attention possible roundtheclock coverage on the networks for days before the entire country paid witness to a mass murder in prime time fallon made sure to conceal the considerable bulk of his shoulders within the terrorists shapeless now bloodstained jacket he tied the dead mans bandana low over his forehead hoping it would conceal the differences in their faces and hair from the distance he required he made sure the walkietalkie simple radio shack variety was secured to his belt and started back up the corridor the way the dead terrorist would if he were retracing his steps at the head of the hallway the office directly on his left and the science wing just down the hall to his right fallon glimpsed another of the terrorists rushing away from the main entrance with extra chains clanking by now all such doors would have been secured and wired with explosives to detour both escape from within and attack from the outside fallon had a clear shot at the man but opted not to take it until he was sure no others were in the vicinity instead he made his footsteps just loud enough to be heard then swung about gun leading back to the stairwell up which number two had rushed hey the man called to him in arabic shoo hada fallons response to the man asking him what is this was to swing and fire a single headshot that dropped the terrorist where he stood he crumpled to the steps and slid halfway back down the stairs not fallons intention but by this point instinct had taken over two down fallon heard footsteps converging on the stairwell from opposite directions on the second floor he crouched over the body and angled low submachine gun angled at the main entry doors as if to suggest thats where the deadly fire had originated he could see the plastic explosives layered into place over the glass not the way he wouldve done it exactly but still effective the footsteps grew louder voices in arabic shouted his way fallon swung when the two men were close enough to take in a single sweep two shots both to the head again to be sure four down this time his shots coincided with the rattling echo of machinegun fire coming from the other end of the building screams and cries answered the barrage greeted by a second longer one that drove the students and teachers to silence four to six of the remaining terrorists would be down there doors chained from the inside denying him both access and the element of surprise without either never mind both the game would be over fallons radio shack walkietalkie crackled he snapped it from his belt listened shoofi mafi whats the matter mafi mushkil fallon replied hoping he had chosen the right word in arabic no problem dilwaati hurry fallon clasped the walkietalkie back on his belt and headed down the stairs banking left toward the schools science wing as the blare of sirens descended on hampton lake middle school the students of his eighthgrade honors language arts class were arranged twobytwo fourteen deep with fallon bringing up the rear after rousing them from the classroom against the tearful protestations of many he placed trent at the head of the group to lead the way toward the gym hed encountered another terrorist in the science wing who approached him in the halflight noticing the ruse too late and making the mistake of trying to right his submachine gun fallon was close enough to use trents butterfly knife this time a single swipe across the mans throat for silence and surety he spent just over a minute gathering up two vials of clear liquid in one of the science labs and ran into another of the terrorists literally at the head of the corridor their eyes had met the terrorists gaping fallons steeling as his hands came up thumbs pressing into the mans eyes to mash brain tissue and send him spasming toward death six down then back fast to his classroom to affect the final phase of his plan the students suitably scared and confused he marched them down the hall toward the gymnasium pretending to prod with the submachine gun while concealing a capped glass vial in either hand a hundred feet away a pair of terrorists guarding that boobytrapped entry to the building spotted him coming and twisted his way keeping tight to the wall while shouting instructions fallon ignored they approached on either side of his marching phalanx and as soon as they were close enough to realize something was very wrong fallon popped the caps off his vials and tossed the acid compound at their faces not directly on line but enough splashing home to send their hands upward to comfort their ravaged eyes fallon took each down with a single quick burst then pushed his shocked charges on faster through the glass doors and halfwall he glimpsed a nonstop onslaught of police vehicles and media vans continuing with his charges toward the chained entrance to the gym he moved to the front of the apparent stragglers he had rounded up pounding on the door and then swinging away with gun leading open up hurry he screamed in arabic desperation forced into his voice theyre in the building the chains rattled locks and explosives being thrust aside the double door entrance jerked open by a sweaty man who bled garlic through his pores fallon started shooting willing to sacrifice a few innocents to get the last of the job done he felled the three terrorists converging on the door before turning his attention on the one who had yanked it open because his hands were too full to go fast for a weapon that man had barely hit the floor when fallon whirled sideways scanning the room for motion he fired at whatever moved like a cheap arcade game now hoping no bystanders got caught in the fire but knowing he couldnt let that concern stop him he fired his last spray upward into the sprinkler apparatus activating a spray of water which almost instantly doused the cavernous room and drenched its occupants his submachine gun clicked empty fallon was twisting to retrieve the sidearm of a dead terrorist when a bearded rail of a man came at him showcasing a detonator as he blithered away in arabic maashallah maashallah fallon palmed trents butterfly knife locked the blade into place maashallah maashallah the mans wild hair a soaked tangle that swept over his face seeming to merge it with his beard maashallah fallon snapped his hand outward sending the knife whizzing through the air it took the final terrorist in the eye buried to the hilt in his brain he fell to the floor the detonator rattled across the floor fourteen down fallon thought realizing his initial estimate had been off as he looked up and let the cascading water wash over his face and not a single bystander with them fallon emerged from the boys locker room wearing the uniform and visor of a swat officer whod gone in there to secure the site confusion was his ally now confusion and chaos as the police stormed the building to find bodies everywhere and had to sort through the tales of the mysterious teacher who had killed them theyd never believe it at first and before they did fallon would be gone in the foyer beyond the gym he passed his eighthgrade honors language arts class being questioned by an expanding bevy of officers fallon kept his head turned low and to the side cocking his gaze back just once when he was almost to the door to meet trents so if he wasnt beechum any of you have an idea who he was an official in plain clothes was asking his students rainsford trent said as his eyes locked and held with fallons through the swat visor his name was rainsford ridley pearson not only is bestselling author ridley pearson a master of forensic detail but he also plays in a rock band with other bestselling writers like amy tan mitch albom and stephen king we play music as well as metallica writes novels he said so its good news that ridley agreed to contribute a story to this collection rather than an original song boldts broken angel opens with one of the most haunting and powerful scenes youll ever read the reader follows detective lou boldt on the trail of a serial killer who is as twisted as ridleys brilliant plot fight the urge to skip ahead because you wont want to miss a single word this is a model thriller by a modern master the perfect story to complete the collection boldts broken angel erastus malsterthey called him rastushooked both feet beneath the large gray cleat on the bow of the fishing trawler sea spirits and holding himself fast lifted his arms straight out at his sides like leonardo dicaprio in titanic the salt spray peppered his widemouthed grin stung his eyes and seasoned his fourteenyearold tongue it was his uncles boat his uncles idea to wave to his mother in the jet as it took off from seatac they had no real way to track the flight bound for israel where she was set to join up with a twostar cruise ship tour of israel ports and egyptian treasures so rastus waved at all the planes while his uncle drank beer and laughed from the wheelhouse his uncle loved to laugh his uncle had also judged wrong they were far too distant from the airport to catch any of the planes taking off in fact they could barely seen any metal in the sky a flicker or a flash as the aluminum skin caught the retreating sun rastus saw one blaze in particular as he rode the bow a brilliant whiteandorange glint that held the intensity of a cameras flash he pointed up to it and gasped uncle uncle he called out his uncle only laughed and hoisted the beer at first he thought they were salmon or seals or even orca whales surfacingan exciting splash a hundred yards to his left port as his uncle called it why they couldnt just call it left rastus wasnt sure the moment that first splash occurred his uncle cranked the wheel in that direction so severely that the cleat was not enough to hold rastus and he fell to his right barely catching hold of the wire rail at the last possible second he regained his balance righted himself and looked back at his uncle in the wheelhouse the mans face had contorted into a full flood of surprise and excitement rastus turned to see why three more giant splashes had to be whales the way the water shot up his uncle was running the boat right into the same area having goosed the mighty engine and thrown something of a duck tail into their now violent wake the man hoisted a pair of binoculars and surveyed the distant splashesfor now there were three more then five and suddenly the water was boiling all around themten twenty fifty his uncle dropped the glasses let go of the wheel and ran to the railing he hurled vomit into the watera man who had never been seasick in his life rastus looked down into the water as a white fish dead and floating passed incredibly close the boat struck the next it wasnt a fish at all it was a naked woman big and flabby and disgusting her skin around her chest and pelvis as white as bone a patch of wet black hair where her legs met and there not twenty yards away a man also naked faceup arms at his sides the sky was raining dead bodies a dozen a second now two dozen rastus heard a tremendous explosion he looked to where his uncle had been at the rail there was nothing but a splash of red there now and a deep dent in the metal decking uncle rastus screamed uncle six more bodies streamed by the boat now running out of control all naked every face lockedor were they frozenin an unforgiving expression of pure terror the fifth that passed by was unmistakable it was his mother as hed never seen her nine years later the jokes on u was a comedy club in seattles university district on friday and saturday nights a haunt for college kids but during the week an escape for aging software wizards greenparty candidates some whitehaired hippies wearing bifocals and on this evening an oversize man at the beatup piano on stage a longinthetooth police lieutenantor former police lieutenant he wasnt sureplugging through a killer rendition of an oscar peterson arrangement the establishment had moved around town mostly along th avenue occasionally changing or at least modifying its name trying to retain its former clientele while simultaneously skating on some existing debt its owner bear berenson was a fiftysomething hempie round in the middle and pallid in the face a man with a contagious laugh an agreeable disposition and a bad left hip hed fallen off a bicycle two years earlier riding at night without any light while royally stoned and busy trying to do some math in his head the hip has never been right since he liked to say counting how long it took whoever would listen to realize it was a pun those who missed the pun altogether were people that didnt interest bear the man at the piano had not only gotten the joke the first time hed heard itof manybut had been quick enough to finish the sentence and therefore the joke for him it was just this kind of person that interested bearfiercely intelligent yet humble nimbly facile but reserved able to leap small buildingswith a ladder and rope lou boldt kept the song going with his right hand while he sipped some very cold milk using his left it was a good happyhour crowd all things considered some pretty coeds had wandered in no doubt expecting standup but had stayed the better part of an hour were presently on the back end of several rounds of margaritas and without knowing itor maybe they didwere providing eye candy for the true jazz aficionados who populated the lounge boldt brought the bass line back into the improvisation but didnt have time to wipe his mouth so he wore a whos got milk mustache for as long as it took him to lean into his own shoulder and drag his lips across the white buttondown oxford if you looked closely you could see the jcpenney fabric tag escaping the starched collar for it was halftorn off and trying to act as a small flag beneath the buzz cut graying stubble of head hair that held the texture of a kitchen scrub brush boldt smiled and grimaced when he played his face a marvel to watch as it reacted to the shapes of the sound and the story his fingers told as if surprised himself by what he heard enigmatic in conversation and generally not known for talking much at all here at the piano lord of the eightyeight keys lou boldt shined for ninety minutes once a weeksometimes twicehe revealed things about himself that only his closest friends understood bear berenson was one of those friends so was phil shoswitz a former lieutenant himself then a captain now a deputy commissioner he wasnt a regular to these happyhour performances but he was no stranger either his presence at the moment however signaled something else to boldt boldt had been blackballed by anyone of equal or higher rank within the department during his suspension a leave of absence now in its third month only his homicide detectives treated him humanly the inquiry had seen to that internal investigations unsubstantiated charges of criminal misconduct meted out in a brutally partisan moment of city politicsas far as boldt was concerned ii looked at it a little differentlythey believed they had proven that boldt had sneaked nearly ten thousand dollars in cash back into the property room in an attempt to save a former homicide detectives past pension and future whod been stupid enough to borrow it in the first place for the past fortythree minutesbut who was countingboldt had been assuming that shoswitz had been sent here to dole out his sentence to deliver the ruling to answer the one question that had been hanging over boldts head for the past eightyseven days did he or did he not have a job for him it wasnt about guilt or innocence because he knew the truth it was about how far ii could wear that stick up their ass and still sit down at the table it was about ignoring fact for fiction the exact way so many young detectives chose to do when first on the jobon boldts homicide squad people like barbara bobbie gaynes who was also in the crowd but back in a dark corner staying away from shoswitz as if the man were an aids carrier the two had gotten along oncegaynes and shoswitzback when boldt had promoted her into the ranks of homicide detective breaking a glass ceiling that still had shards on the floor you learned to tiptoe on the job gaynes was as good or maybe better at it than most than most of the most a clear thinker and possessing singleminded determination she fit the qualifications that boldt sought for any and all of his teams his staff his bloodhounds her being here didnt surprise him she loved jazz piano or claimed to but she kept her eyes on shoswitz the same way that boldt tried not to she knew he knew but what did shoswitz know and when the hell was he just going to march up to the slightly raised platform and deliver us from evil as boldt thought of it it was either a pardon or a pattern boldt was resolved to it being either but the waiting godthe ninetyminute set had nevernot everdragged on for this long this was pain the call that came into the seattle police departments broadway substation set off a controlled series of events that echoed through the halls of the sounddampened public safety building bouncing from one department to another over a series of three days that would later be put onto the official books as a period lasting precisely fortynine hours it wasnt often the clocks were adjusted inside spd and it would take weeks for the adjustment to be made but by then the damage had been done as lou boldt put it to the press boldt who had nothing to do with making three days look like two could only reflect on what might have been had his department been informed of the missing person some twenty hours earlier perhaps nothing he mused but then again maybe several lives would have been saved what are you doing here at this hour the woman asked from the open doorway to his lieutenants office one of two such offices in crimes against persons it was day three since the call had come inthe exact hour that the report had first appeared on boldts desk i thought you were playing happy hour was yes but you headed back downtown i did daphne matthews had a radiance about her his compass pointed to her true north always had always would hed sensed her before shed spoken the way a bird knows to signal dawn before the night sky lightens a single lumen some of this he could put off to her unusual though plain beautya combination of girlnextdoor and smoking hot babe that she could ignite with a look or a stance or a new texture to her sultry voice but only some most of the attraction came at a level that neither of them understood well enough to voice something subcutaneous like an agreeable infection is it going to be twenty questions she asked the lieu was there he said referring to shoswitz by his former rank boldt had never fully adjusted to his own role of lieutenant nor to shoswitz having moved upstairs im sensing anxiety hostility youre closed off from me once a psychologist he said too close to home dont leave she had turned to go please he added you sure its not directed at you none of it is meant for you for phil im to take reamers place he told her reamer she said her eyes rolled as she scanned her mental rolodex your reamer she had a look like shed been punched he felt that same thing in his belly my reamer kansas city she asked st louis he answered which leaves his desk open beginning next week reamers a sergeant she said now youre catching on no way she said more boldly now stepping inside im told its never happened at my pay scale he said i think that was intended to make me feel better but it didnt work youre moving back to the sergeants desk if i want to stay on i am i could have taken my twenty nearly a decade ago we both know that they know that they obviously want me to take it now and you i dont golf i have two kids in elementary school who will go to college someday if i sit around at home ill eat my service revolver so what do you think jesus lou yeah are you seriously going to take it you could get a rep to no this is their ruling no

thinking but he all but did they want me out while respecting the record they dont want the baggage its because so much of the force looks up to you hell youre a living legend that must scare the pee out of them you know i hate that why do you do that you of all people you are what you are you can swim in de nile or you can make for shore and climb out but dont lay it on me i dont mean legend in the sense of superhero i mean the rank and file looks up to you in a way few if any around herei would say noneare looked up to thats your burden and thats a threat to everyone above you everyone but phil because he gets it im not saying im buying that im not selling she said and as to that youve never bought in to it but thats because you can be as blind deaf and stubborn as a mule at times brilliant at others right now youre sitting on the pity pot and its your pot to sit on but dammit lou when people around here fear you youre doing something right carpe diem i was never comfortable looking out the window you invented ways to get yourself onto investigations the brass knows that about you theyre doing you a favor longterm this is a favor you just cant see it yet nearly a thirty percent pay cut that hurts thats supposed to keep you from accepting it shorter vacation back to a pool car ditto and ditto she stepped even closer to him it felt dangerous and warmer at the same time did phil give any opinion did he steer you one way or the other he said he wished theyd let him take my desk that the only real police work is on the streets always has been says its more like a corporation upstairs every day thats a nice compliment dont you think lamoia and i the same rank he said a loaded statement because shed been living with lamoia for nearly a year now the worlds oddest couple and yet they were still together a rocky year he thought looking on from a distance theyd struggled with social services to maintain guardianship of a young girl there was no way it was going to happen they werent married they werent in the system for adoption but lamoia knew enough judges and had enough friends to keep pushing back the decision a week here a month there it was all thumbs and toes in the dike at this point they were about go get washed downstream and he had a feeling the whole thing would go if the child led the way he wont treat it that way you know that you walk on water for him anything but itll be your squad both teams i pity the lieu who comes in above you you make it sound as if my decisions been made hasnt it there were times like right now that he wanted to take her by the hips and pull her close to him he wanted to experience her not so much sexual as just a physical contact to bridge all the words that flowed between them liz his wife would never understand lamoia would never understand but he felt they wouldhe and daphne they would get it they wouldnt abuse it or misuse it or push it but it wasnt to be not today hed learned to contain it like locking up the neighborhood dog he muzzled its bark he tried not to feed it hoping it would just roll over and die but it never did not ever yeah he said i suppose it has can i help you move your things across the room id like that he said do you need to call liz do you need to call john they were maybe a foot apart her chest rose and fell more quickly than only a minute earlier there was mirth in her eyeshe could swear there wasand invitation on her lips and god he didnt dare look below her waist hed been there once a long long time ago but he remembered it like they were still tasting the others skin how could time stand still like that while the world rushed by the phone at the sergeants desk rang his desk it rang and rang and lou boldt marched toward it with both reluctance and hunger the same way he would have marched toward herjust this onceif she had dared to ask get used to it boldt said he was standing outside an office highrise at the northern end of third avenue where no local had ever foreseen a highrise taking root he addressed john lamoia who wore his trademark deerskin jacket so soft and supple it looked like a chamois and the pressed jeans above the exotic cowboy boots he couldnt see daphne pressing the jeans as other girlfriends had done for him over the years it meant he had to send them out had to actually pay to have them that way and the thought of that amused boldt to no end im good lamoia said welcome back sarge technically the graveyard was boldts shiftanother disincentive shoswitz had thrown at him lamoia would be the day sergeant for cap for the next month but apparently daphne had said something and a phone call had followed and just as boldt had been about to tap one of his team to join him lamoia had volunteered for old times sake so lamoia said calls been on the books over two days boldt said how that happened has to be looked into but the fact is a womans gone missing and were now officially past the first fortyeight so were screwed were challenged boldt said and were here because this is where she was last seen we dont know if she was seen were here to check the surveillance cameras because work was all the boyfriend gave me you brought him in phone call boldt answered lamoias questioning look i wanted to expedite things the extra day and all all that time behind a desk lamoia said cant help a persons game one phone call boldt said it saved us something like two three hours im not arguing lamoia said but he clearly disapproved of boldts cutting a corner and boldt marveled how quickly his world had turned upside down lamoiathe rogue of all timequestioning his practices id like to find her alive would the boyfriend lamoia asked knowing that statistics put the crime squarely on the man who knows he sounded genuine enough but maybe hes taking internet acting classes boldt called into the highrise over his mobile and they were approached moments later by a uniformed guard as the man worked to open the doors lamoia spoke how can we gain access to security tape at this hour frankie malones the top guy no way i called him at home he gave us the keys to the store when it works it works lamoia said they were ushered in and taken to the security department and shown an hour of tapes they had the missing woman arriving two days earlier had her going out to lunch with friends back in the hallways and elevators upon her return couldnt find her leaving the building boldt asked the tapes be set aside and that halfinch copies be sent over to public safety by noon the same day boldt and lamoia walked the hallways rode the elevator repeated what theyd seen i doubt it was here boldt said im with you but then howd she disappear thats quite a crush at the end of the day true enough we might have missed her you think no me neither so it was here lamoia ventured dont see how but yeah maybe locked in a closet somewhere down in parking in a trunk dogs boldt asked expensive were past the fortyeight boldt said weve cut the probability of finding her alive by fity sixty percent i know the stats sarge if we did miss her in the crowd then it was between here and home and the boyfriend gets a much closer look either way lamoia said did you search for similars with the number of missing persons reports we get i didnt have all night we do now lamoia said dont you have to get home to the baby lets not go there okay the men were outside the building now the background whine of rubber on i a jet just behind the space needle on final approach to seatac a motorboat was cutting across lake union some rowdy voices echoed from a half block away the city stayed up later and later it was in its adolescence boldt felt as if hed known it from birth twothirdshell more like ninetyfive percent are going to be underage or just overage girls lamoia said we toss them the database is manageable you know me and computers i got it sarge lamoia said we can crunch this data in minutes trust me he would never fully trust lamoia again with daphne hed made his peace but lamoias going after her would never sit right he let it pass for now an hour later they were sitting alongside one another staring at a flatscreen display it was nearing midnight should we run it again boldt asked thats the third time sarge it aint lying to us how could this have slipped through they put me on leave and no one mans the shop it was defalgo you know how he is hes waiting out his twentytwo its all done with mirrors with him anyway always has been buddy defalgo couldnt figure out a scratchandwin lotto card boldt said what are they doing putting him in my chair its more like a corporation upstairs lamoia said thats what i hear boldt wanted to smack him had daphne told him that as shed gotten home on the screen was a womans face attractive early to middle thirties a driverslicense photo but one that boldt assumed would be on every morning news show in town by am it was on they werent trying to find a missing woman they were trying to find two the facts of the reports were far too similar to put it off to chance last seen at work never made it home maybe not the boyfriend boldt whispered his throat dry his chest painful yeah lamoia said i was just thinking the same thing rastus malster applied the finishing touches this was no dabonsomeblush exercise the fact that he had to accomplish it inside a restroom stall only added to the thrill he heard the unique whistling stream of a female peeing from the adjacent stall and looked low to see a wide black leather toeend of a shoe pointing toward him to where he swore if hed bent over he could have seen his face in its polish but he kept his eyes if not his mind on the work before himthe small mirror hanging from a wire thrown over the coat hook on the back of the door every line was carefully applied if he didnt like his work he used a moist towelette to clear the slate and tried again a great deal of admiration went into his work he took time to study and appreciate his expertise transformation took time rome wasnt built in a day the soiled white leather work shoes helped himin case miss hissy thighs next door was looking at his footwear the way he was looking at hers but no she was in and done up and gone before the automatic flusher had a chance to catch up with her besides even if she had glanced his way hed naired both legs the night before to babybottomsmooth he might look a little thick at the ankle but not everyone fit into a size two the trick now was to time his exit well hed entered when there was no one in here he hoped to leave the same long on patiencefor he would never have taken on any of this without his mothers patiencehe found himself in no hurry he waited for the last click of a heel the last spray of a toilet flushing or the electronic peal of the automatic paper dispenser then he gave it an extra thirty seconds twentyeighttwentynine and having collected his small mirror and his bag of goodies he swung open the stall door to behold true artistry at work he slipped out the printout of the intelligencers web page from his pocket took one last look at it memorizing both the face and the name and crumpled it up he disposed of it immediately in front of him she had a royal almost equestrian look about hera high princess a ladyinwaiting he looked like a cornfed midwesterner with a graying buzz cut if they wanted to make comments about him to the press then they deserved the opportunity to meet him theyd earned it when a uniformed woman entered the restroom rastus startled his heart racing hello she said reconsidering his location he heaved a sigh of relief as the woman slipped into a stall and immediately was heard unzipping her pantsall without waiting for any kind of reply from him rastus moved along the sinks pleased as punch shed never given him a second glance the piece of paper hed tossed into the trash uncurled slightly like the dancers at the beginning of swan lake not enough to catch the face again only part of the two names oldt and lieutenant d matthews seen here at a dare fundraiser in the first body surfaced at sunrise bobbing up out of murky depths of bowmans bay like a decomposing mermaid phen shiffman was who spotted her as he motored out for his morning work of checking the hatchery hed been enjoying a smoke and a fresh cup of strong coffee when her breasts arched out of the water followed by the dark trim between her legs it was like one of those synchronized swimming moves hed seen on the olympicsonly she was naked as a jaybird not wearing any kind of bathing suit or undies or nothing as he would later tell mike rickert the prosecuting attorney whose desk the case landed on though he hadnt seen it he supposed her head had surfaced first led by her arms maybe whatever the case shed continued in a graceful back arch like a dancer head shoulders chest groin knees feet and she was under again if hed been drinking the night before or hed been smoking some rope on the way out as he sometimes did he might have considered saying nothing about her because once she was gone she was gone but on the other hand he knew this was seriousshe was as dead as a salmon bruised and fedon some as pale as the silver flash of a trout this he had to call in boldt read about it on a briefing page that arrived on ones computer screen at the start of every shift the victims toenails had been elaborately painted in a way that suggested city life not skagit county rickert for his part had done his homework he knew of the missing seattle women he posted the information and made a few calls suggesting spd might want to visit the county morgue or might want some dental records sent downthe crabs had gotten half her face by midafternoon boldt and daphne had made the ninetyminute drive north together arriving at the county hospital dental records had confirmed the deceaseds identity the second of the two women whod gone missing dressed in surgical kits and wearing paper masks over their faces having smeared mentholatum liberally beneath their nosesbecause floaters were the worst of the worstthey studied the rotting corpse at one point boldt looked over at daphne and wondered if the stains on the mask beneath her eyes were tears of emotion or from the mentholatum vapors getting in her eyes they worked with a young pathologist who seemed to know his stuff boldt longed for his longtime friend dr ray but the man had retired and would likely never stand under the lights again her spine is broken the pathologist explained in a toneless voice cracked clean in half which might explain the dance the fisherman saw in the water when she surfaced there are severe ligature marks here and here two more on both shoulders her vaginal and rectal area are torn though from the same ligature im suggesting she was trussed boldt said this won a sharp snap of daphnes neck as she looked up at boldt couldnt have said it better the pathologist said bound and trussedandwell maybe not please boldt said daphnes eyes said please dont its justif i had to guessand this is only wild speculation with only a small amount of science to support itnahi shouldnt boldt encouraged him yet again conjecture is all there is at least some circumstantial evidence to suggest the binding was a flexible material in several weightbearing places it appears to have pinched the skin weightbearing boldt repeated for the term caught his ear yes thats the conjecture part the man answered if i had to guess i would say she was trussed facedown the ligature was jerked or tugged severely and was improperly arranged so that maximum stress came here he pointed to her shoulders and here he pointed to her crotch it was excessive force enough to shatter l and l and to sever the cord could she have been dropped daphne asked dropped yes i suppose that would account for it but it would have had to have been from a very great height the elastic cord boldt said could it have been bungee cord he leaned in for a close look at the rope burns on her side indeed the doctor said are you telling me she was bungee jumping the clothes came off during her time in the water is it possible boldt asked she was naked daphne said with authority he threw her offi dont knowa bridge threw her the doctor asked or was it accidental too much alcohol a stupid idea gone wrong was alcohol found in her system boldt asked blood workup will be a day or two minimum he threw her daphne repeated her voice softer were going to find that the position is important to him the angel pose flying like that hes roman catholic or was raised roman catholic single lives or lived with a single parent hes under thirty over eighteen uses mass transit but has a drivers license probably crossdresses though not in public were going to need every hair and fiber every xray every detail of this corpse before it degrades any further threw her the doctor could barely get out the words youre sure this meant for daphne he wanted the angel to fly she said having not taken her eyes off the dead woman for the past few minutes but he got it wrong tied it wrong from what you tell us and he broke her back instead who knows how long he might have kept her alive if shed have only flown for him the doctor stepped back as if a few feet might separate him from the truth and the first one boldt asked also staring at the cadaver i imagine that one went wrong as well or he wouldnt have failed so miserably with her poor her she whispered if shed only known how to fly the drive back began in silence traumatic death had a way of making anything else seem inconsequential and of no importance even if the discussion was to be the solution of that death a black hood pulled down over all existence the road ran before them people racing to pass to maintain a position and to both of them it seemed so insignificant though neither spoke of it directly lifes uglies revealed themselves at such times mans clambering for space and position maybe you should have quit she said then i wouldnt be in a car with you dont start way too late for that he said what is it with us he grinned didnt mean to but it was irrepressible do you think well ever no he said cutting her off i try to not think about it catch him she said finishing her thought but thank you for sharing the grin was vanquished oh he said and as to that other thing i couldnt disagree more i too try not to think about it but i find im not very good at it well get this guy boldt said but the window of time has closed yes were way behind the eight ball no question about it but its you and its me what chance has he got you sound like john she quipped him too boldt said ive got a guy at the udub dr brian rutledge oceanography hes going to make a careful study of this and tell us the car rounded a bend and faced a long bridge with a dramatic drop so boldt slowed the vehicle that she was tossed off this bridge deception pass hes going to tell us what day and at what time she went off because its what he does were going to back up and use traffic cams to spot every car that left the highway for this road at the appropriate time were going to box this guy in he pulled to a stop and the two wandered out on to the bridge again they were gripped in silencein part because of the majesty of the view gray water and green island shrouded in a descending mist in part because of what had happened here they both could visualize it the body coming out of the trunk already roped up he ties a knot he throws her over early early morning daphne said because first light no traffiches got to hope for no traffic but theres no way this guy is tossing her in the dark he wants to see her fly this is about satisfying some need in him his sister jumped off the barn roof and died when he was a kid his mother fell from a ladder broke her back theres a payoff here thats fundamental to the crime okay he said more than you wanted from you get a clue he walked farther into the very middle of the bridge he squatted examining the thick metal rail from a variety of angles i doubt bungee jumping is anything new to this bridge he said no so he can take his time tying it rigging it getting it just right its pulling her out of the trunk thats the trick a public appeal she said thats what im thinking yes someone saw his car him thought nothing of it maybe we jog a memory he surveyed the surrounding area rocks and water and nothing but beauty he found it difficult to think in terms of crime did he use this same bridge for the first one yes i believe he did she said it wasnt the location it was his rigging that failed probably failed a lot worse the first time so we check the waters your oceanographer may be able to help you from what youve said yes odds that he sent the first one off this bridge high you want a number he spit a laugh no i see your point with two failures he may now blame the bridge if you elect to involve the press then hell certainly abandon the area so we look for other isolated locations with significant drops maybe with some distance parameters hes got a woman alive in his trunk he doesnt want to test that to push that its a means to an endthe trunk it worries him having her back there and not just out of fear of being caught he has more respect for the victim than wed understand its the sister the mother the girlfriend this isnt a hate crime quite the oppositeits reverential a form of worship for him he wants to bless her with flight he wants to give her a chance at resurrection i can look at dead bodies all day long but i talk to you for five minutes and ive got chills she laid a hand on his shoulder glad to hear it buddy a flight of gulls cawed overhead as they played in the wind boldt followed behind daphne back to the car watching that machine of hers drive her forward could have walked all day with the lab work expedited boldt had the building blocks for a possible modus by midday the following day a wednesday he was supposed to be working the graveyard but had already used up several favors to get someone to sub for himthis in his first week of duty as cap sergeant he and lamoia who technically was the shift sergeant rode in lamoias midsize pool car a replacement for a series of transams and cameros hed owned and driven proudly through the years you gonna explain it lamoia asked several strands of human hair that werent hers all asian but consisting of two different dnas two other women and one of the hairs was carrying traces of a polymer adhesive maybe more than one a piece a wig yes and weve got a smudge of lipstick in the vics hair along with traces of blood not her blood but it is female and it is rich in stem cells stem cells menstrual blood on her head lamoia said are you just being gross sarge or is this going somewhere is this some stab at me and no boldt said cutting him off we have hair evidence we have contradictory evidence of menstrual blood in her head hair we have two women that simply vanished from their office buildings is any of this clicking yet two asians the polymer a wig well done but the blood where would such bl a bathroom a womens room and how could a woman possibly get it on her head lamoia drove through three more sets of lights dodging angry traffic he was just pulling up in front of the office tower with the lake view as he barked out his answer a trash bin in a womans restroom our boy goes in drag boldt said it has to be damn convincing hes wearing an asian wighair from several women hes cleaning sinks mopping floors waiting for that moment its just him and a woman that looks right to himhas to be a certain look he thumps her lamoia said dumps her into one of those waste bins those giant things on the rollers covers her with waste product boldt said including in this case some used feminine products shes unconscious in there and cant be seen from the outside and he wheels her right out past everyone down to an alley or a parking garage someplace innocuous but convenient and lays her out in the trunk changes back to a man in the car and is gone boldt completed jesus h the way your mind works fine line boldt said making a point of meeting eyes with lamoia were here lamoia said to look at security tape we werent looking for housecleaners the first time boldt said we go back and review parkinggarage tape i think wed have caught it has to be the alley no cameras in the alleyat least from this building you think a neighboring building lamoia asked or maybe a cctv you check that out while i put up with these security guys lamoia was twenty yards away when he called back enthusiastically were close sarge boldt held up his hand to his ear indicating he wanted lamoia to call him security guys could really drag things out cynthia storm had been working health and human services for public safety for two years it was a long way up from social services where shed had to deal with teenage miscreants of every variety since the publication of a series of teenage vampire books and a movie seattle had played host to a flood of teenage runaways a city that typically saw far more than its fair share of vagrant minors the number had nearly doubled in the past eighteen months and as far as anyone could tell the only common denominator was that the vampire series had been set in the pacific northwest portland had seen a large increase as well cynthia was more than happy not to have that on her watch give her the meter maids and the men in uniform any day but she hadnt been promoted to the badges yet she still mostly dealt with the service staffall of whom had to be vetted to work public safety and their absences had to be accounted for today she was chasing down jasmina vladavich a bosnian housecleaner whod failed to show to work for two days had not answered her phone and as it turned out had not been seen by her cousin the woman shed listed as her emergency contact jasmina had a good track record with the department but was rumored by the cousin to be in the early stages of pregnancy she was unmarried and distraught about it cynthia and her supervisor had decided jasmina worthy of a house call to make sure that the baby had not led to prenatal depression or illness she rang the bell it was an apartment complex twenty minutes south of the city near seatac a neighborhood known for strip joints drugs and borderline importexport businesses laundry hung from wires on half balconies attempting to dry in a climate that dictated otherwise the sound of televisions competed jasmina didnt answer the bellno surprise therebut cynthia used her credentials to talk the super into having a look the elevator had not worked for three years she was told she trudged up five flights down a hall marked with graffiti and was let into jasmina she called out the super waited at the door hello she heard the groan it came faintly from the back barely heard over an episode of in living color playing next door stay there she told the super who looked ready to bolt hello she followed the soft groans into a back bedroom where a woman was hogtied and lying on her belly shed soiled herself and her face was streaked with tears and mucus a nylon knee sock had been used to gag her she was wearing only underwear and a bra and there were raw bruise marksshed been rocking on her legs rolling around the room call she hollered we need an ambulance right now she approached the woman cautiously jasmina looked a little wild around the eyes im going to help you okay jasmina nodded im going to remove the gag and the ropes jasmina do you hear me but the woman had lapsed into unconsciousness cynthia got the gag off and jasmina sucked for air and came back awake baby the woman moaned well get you the hospital who did this to you jasmina the father of the baby no was my card the woman moaned my card its all right its all right she was talking nonsense cynthia realized mantook my card my id card with her hand free now she touched the plastic id card that cynthia had fastened to her own belt public safety card cynthia didnt care about any work card her concerns were dehydration malnutrition and the condition of the baby inside this woman weve called an ambulance she reminded why this for stupid card jasmina groaned she shook as she began to cry why indeed cynthia now thought as she focused more on what she was being told she reached out somewhat reluctantly because of the filth and cradled the crying woman in her arms why indeed daphne had been briefed over the phone by an energetic lou boldt she had not known for the past three years when he locked onto a case he not only possessed but emitted a contagious energy a force field of curiosity optimism and bizarre selfconfidence that she found utterly intoxicating and physically stimulating she responded to his passion bodily so privately that were her condition ever known to others it would have proved embarrassing her skin prickling she stepped around the yellow wet floor cone and entered the womens washroom to relieve her bladder and check her makeup she feared her chest was likely flushed along with her face a cleaner was doing the sinks she had a large brown trash canister behind her and appeared to be emptying the trash containers of used hand towels bothered by an earring that hadnt sat right all day she unhooked it from her ear okay if i she asked the cleaner motioning to the stall mmm the woman nodded back at her daphne took two steps and felt a shock of electricity so powerful she could neither scream nor move her mind flashed unconscious but only for a split second shit shit shit she coughed out softly the pain so intense so immobilizing and overpowering she wanted desperately to blink her eyes stung but instead her eyelids fluttered partially open as if the juice were still flowing through her she gasped for air the woman picked her up then and daphne understood from the strength and the way the person cradled her that this wasnt a woman after all it was a man in drag it was the man boldt had just described to her she was his captive he folded her into the trash can and then began stuffing newsprint and damp paper towels on top of her the next blast from the stun stick connected with her neck again she passed out when she came awake the trash canister was movingrolling across a hard floor a stone floor public safety the guyit had to be a guywas taking her out of the building she tried to raise her voice to say somethinganything tried to call out but either her lungs or vocal cords were in full disconnect her brain told them to shout they did nothing her body had disowned her an elevator grunted and jerkedit could only be a service elevator by how poorly it was operating her heart beat so strongly in her chest she feared it might stop beating altogether surely no heart could take such abuse it was as if all the adrenaline summoned by the thousands of volts of electricity had concentrated into the center of her chest and was now looking for a way out she moved her mouth to say the word help but nothing came out a dark purple cloud loomed at the crown of her head a massive headache like an avalanche awaiting release it shifted like jello an amorphous orb of unconsciousness now a black goo as thick as tar pitch it flowed down toward her ears as well as into the vacant space behind her forehead where her sinuses should have been but nothing was right it was only this oozing purplish black wave of silence that descended then it owned her and she was no more wheres matthews lamoia asked bobbie gaynes a detective whod worked his squad for the past few years she was supposed to pull together the squad and get the command center ready for us no clue answered gaynes returning to what she considered a stupid report she was a terrible typist and her own limitations frustrated her seeing boldt in the office she rolled her chair away from her terminal and leapt out of the chair and just stopped herself short of hugging the lieutenantturnedsergeant welcome backsarge she said she would pull the command center together for me boldt said little girls room i think gaynes said i saw her in the hallway heading that direction go check would you we need her you and everyone weve got in the building whos a detective command center five minutes yes sir boldt raised his voice and made an announcement bodies started moving immediately the coach was back the game was on and everyone in the room knew it the players assembled in the command center briefing room designed like a college lecture hall it could seat fifty all with internet access all facing a lectern and powerpoint projection screen five inch lcd hd monitors suspended from the ceiling and two large white boards there were eleven detectives facing boldt and lamoia who quickly brought the others up to speed most had read their daily briefings as charged and needed nothing more than to be caught up on the discovery of the bridge and the connection to the killers use of disguise as a womens restroom attendant teams were created to chase down specifics other area bridges to consider the traffic cams that might reveal a vehicle going out to deception pass bridge area retail stores that sold asian wigs costume shops or tailors that might have provided the coveralls specific to the office buildings where heshe had preyed on his victims they were smart cops and barely needed instruction to get started within minutes the command center hummed with conversation some teams stayed some broke off to other parts of the building but a machine had been started with boldt and lamoia sharing the drivers seat and that machine was intent to narrow down various aspects of the case and begin to focus on suspects when bobbie gaynes stepped into the center and shrugged across the room at boldt boldt felt his hackles raise he pulled out his cell phone and speeddialed daphne it went immediately to voice mail indicating the phone was turned off why would daffy have her phone off he asked lamoia her lover she wouldnt she does lamoia pulled out his mobile and gave it a try no he said disconnecting must have forgotten to charge it or something her office he raised his voice across to gaynes her office not there gaynes looked worried and her cars downstairs i checked lamoia dialed another number presumably his loft apartment where daphne now lived with him he disconnected his skin a shade grayer id like to say that theres a reason for this but we both know her too well he said this is not like her boldt said no so lamoia stepped to a landline let me check my office voice mail he did so no message gaynes had joined them im sure she was headed to the bathroom earlier when i last saw her photographs of the two women victims one deceased one still missing played on the center lcd tv overhead it was here that lamoia looked oh shit he said boldt looked up as well hair color eyes you and daphne said she said not me yes boldt interrupted a similarity between his victims you see the resemblance i do its unmistakable but its just not possible lamoia said not with our level of security if i may gaynes asked somewhat timidly go ahead boldt said youre suggesting that lieutenant matthews shares a certain look with the two prior victims we are yes and thatwell she stepped up to the computer that ran the various overhead displays she called up the daily alerts that opened with one filed by cynthia storm of hhs boldt and lamoia spun around to read the alerts on the overhead screen my eyes suck boldt said anxiously what the hell does it say lamoias voice broke as he read aloud summarizing one of our staffa housecleanerjasmina somethingavichwas found tied up in her apartment this is like three hours ago shed been there left that way for nearlyfortyeight hours thirtynine hours he corrected himself she said the doerit wasnt burglary or sexual assault he wantedhe confiscated her photo id her public safety id the three moved as a unit a team as they first walked and then ran from the command center down the hall with such intensity that everyone moved out of their way others jumped up from their desks and peered into the hallway to see what was going on gaynes knocked but lamoia didnt wait for an answer he pushed through the door men inside he announced a woman cursed and complained from inside a stall a toilet flushed boldt went to the janitors closet its locked i want this unlocked gaynes hurried from the bathroom shouting for a key lamoia dropped to a knee stood and started opening stalls he banged on the locked stall from where the woman had cursed open it now im a little busy here open the fucking door lamoia ordered the woman leaned forward and threw open the lock and covered her legs as lamoia swung the door open he stared at the tile floor his voice rasped as he said finish with your business stick to this panel as you stand you go out to my right you understand you have no right shut up and do as i say the woman came off the toilet pulled up her underwear and pants and was holding them as she nudged by lamoia and then boldt who was by now looking over lamoias shoulder the toilet flushed automatically its just not possible boldt whispered gravely you and matthews said her lover your photos were in the paper two days ago she brought it home to show me her photo he saw her photo he knew she was looking for him hes a sick fuck that much we know already are you sure its hers the two men had not stopped staring at the tile floor where a wire hoop earring lay i bought it for her lamoia said the sixmonth anniversary of her moving in it was the last really good night we had he said boldt didnt want to hear such things gaynes returned with the closet key in hand out of breath sid boldt said to her scientific identification division get them up here what is it gaynes said desperately get them up here boldt repeated his head beginning to spin boldt had been through this once before back when the fires had been hotter between them back when hed been younger and less experienced with the overlap of personal and professional he had that behind him now had that to build upon but still felt his knees weak with terror and his mind a runaway train careening down memory and emotion toward an unknown abyss he couldnt think about her that was the point he had to make the disconnect to give her the best chance of being found alive regulations called for lamoia to step aside boldt wouldnt force the issue but john knew enough to keep his mouth shut and his ideas to himself he could share them with boldt in private but to actively push his own agenda would only drive himself out of the wheelhouse he was an observer now not even that if he misstepped there was no time to pull the threads together boldt had done the best he could he turned up the heat on the team trying to identify area bridges he doubled the man power reviewing traffic cams and assigned two other detectives to review public safety surveillance video to locate the imposter housecleaner and follow him to wherever hed gone he worked shoswitz to provide the departments helicopter either to race him and a small team to possible sites or for use as air surveillance if they got a bead on what vehicle the man was driving boldt fought to remain focused to forget about who was riding in a trunk or the back of a van to forget about the cadaver hed seen so recently he could still smell the room about the victim being stripped naked and trussed and thrown off a bridge not this life not her not on his watch the worst moment came as the control center lulled into a library silence as the initial adrenaline subsided giving way to police workthe often monotonous repetitive process of attempting to move from wide angle to telephoto lamoia spoke up for the first time in ten minutes its been on the skids for months i told you that right boldt didnt answer i dont know if it wasyou knowthe little one or just a mismatch or what but weve both known it was over for way too long funny how you hold on to things you know are broken right like youre going to find the glue youre going to find out how to fix it and we both did that she did it too and the thing is we never said a thing about it it was all done with looks and silences and fake smiles and forced sex thats enough boldt said im just sayingshit i dont know what im saying boldt heard him sniff weve got video taggart shouted from across the room screen two everyone in the room watched a housecleaner pushing a garage bin down the hall it looked heavy and difficult to control the person stopped in front of the service elevator it took taggart another five minutes to call up the elevators interior in the correct time frame but there was the housecleaner looking calm and easy the trash can beside her she wheeled it off the elevator another five minutes to pick up the parking garage he found himself a dark enough corner boldt said the video showed nothing of his transferring daphne to the car they couldnt be sure that a transfer had ever happened get sid down there boldt called out done taggart answered the car pulled out taggart and his team did a phenomenal job of freezing the picture at just the right moment where the camera afforded the best clarity it was an older model ford taurus they had a partial plate the photo suggested a number preceded the four but no one could be certain not knowing the position of the plate numbers increased the database exponentially the machine of the seattle police department continued to roll forward the description of the vehicle went out along with the partial the same information was transmitted to king county sheriffs department and other regional law enforcement police cruisers across five jurisdictions were mobilized to inspect and station themselves on all area bridges in the control center the deployment of personnel was kept track of on screen bridge by bridge they accounted for those now under the observation of law enforcement boldt watched all this as a disconnected observer as one by one the area bridges were accounted for a feeling welled up in him that he couldnt shake and hed been here too many times before to ignore such feelings its deception pass boldt said aloud speaking to no one then he turned to lamoia to press his point this guy isnt creative enough to reinvent the wheel he showed us that today and weve not paid any attention he went about this in the exact same way as he did before the same mo daphne called thisshe said hed throw them at sunrise before traffic of any sort developed she said he might change his location if we made our knowledge of the bridge public but we never did that we made our knowledge of the killing public yes but we left the bridge out hes keeping her overnight yes he is either in the vehicle or at a home or apartment or trailer keeping her daphne said how this is some kind of ritual for him the preparation the trying to make her fly its reverential thats why he didnt assault them didnt harm them bottom line johnwe have time the one thing we didnt have with the other two we have that here she has time we can keep people on the bridges but move them to where they cant be seen so easily we can lay some traps hes giving us the time we need to be in position but where daniels boldt called out sarge i need a name attached to that partial plate registration working on it ill take ten names ill take twenty but zero isnt going to cut it weve got more like seventeen hundred at the moment were working to narrow it down run it through skagit boldt said hows that calling across the room had raised some heads boldt was making a nuisance of himself skagit countya taurus with that same partial you want to narrow it down narrow it down some in the room laughed not daniels he sank back into his chair and picked up his telephone receiver because of the bridge deception pass lamoia asked she said he wouldnt want to move them far its a long way from herenearly two hours when the traffics bad that doesnt fit with what she told us youre telling me shes running this thing from wherever she is lamoia sounded skeptical who are you going to trust more it hit lamoia in the chest he sat down looking wounded five minutes passed feeling like twenty twenty like forty james erwin malster daniels said from behind boldt he placed a photocopy of a drivers license in front of the sergeant fiftyone years old caucasian male registered with the pipe fitting union member of the united association pipe fitters plumbers boldt said exactly retired in good standing nine years ago following the death of his wife health complications this is who the car is registered to correct but its not correct boldt said she gave me a profile twenties thirties at the oldest is this the father its his car its not him a pipe fitter lamoia said so he knows how to rig things its not him boldt said she could have had the profile wrong lamoia said guy loses his wife spends years grievingcomes apart at the seams theres a son boldt said to daniels find the son im not showing find the son boldt repeated yes sir you have the location of residence oak harbor christ lamoia said i say something wrong daniels asked oak harbors only a few miles from deception pass boldt said he turned to lamoia she called that one right she also said hed change bridges once we publicized the death and we publicized the death which is what got us in trouble is that what youre saying john are you laying this onto me because i can take it but it isnt going to do a damn thing in terms of bringing her back she said hed switch bridges she was wrong about that boldt said because which is it sarge was she right or wrong because i dont think you can have it both ways boldt had been having it both ways for years part of his heart left behind while the rest of him loved and stayed with his family hed built a great wall between his true emotions and the presentable parent to where no one could see the other side not even him most of the time but lamoia had loosened the lid with that last comment contents may explode under pressure boldt said hes going to throw her off deception pass bridge his angel is going to fly this time hes screwed this up twice if it is the pipe fitter hes not a giveup guy youre not the psychologist she is lamoia said his arms crossed his voice hoarse father or son pipe fitter or who knows what youre all over the map sarge ill disregard that boldt said lamoia daniels said in a cautionary tone you think she was wrong john boldt asked then what if she was wrong about his doing this at sunrise what if sunset works just as well for him he eyed lamoia up and down you want to sit here or you want to take a ride in the chopper daniels squirmed caught in the crosshairs sarge he said call a prosecuting attorney named rickert up there mount vernon tell him to rally the best guys his sheriffs office can muster and to have them put eyes on the residence we want an open channel with our dispatch real time updates you getting all this i got it i can be up there in twenty twentyfive minutes boldt looked over at lamoia all the bravado was gone the luster the very sense of who john lamoia was someone something now inhabited his body you coming lamoia looked up through fixed eyes i hate helicopters he said thats beenthe mistake daphne told him it took all of her courage and more than a little part of what energy she could summon he had her tied to a narrow woodenslat table a scratchy rope across her bare chest her hands connected by a rope beneath the table another rope at her knees and yet another holding her ankles apart also connecting under the table she was naked her legs spread at once both horribly embarrassing and making her feel incredibly vulnerable he could do whatever he wanted to her there would be no stopping him she was in a dreary dimly lit room the windows were small and high on the wall and covered in soiled decaying curtains the pungent oily stalesalt smell told her water was close she was not blindfolded he had no fear of her seeing his face her being able to identify him this increased her panic he hovered over her paying her nakedness no mind preparing to administer a pill and what smelled like cough syrup he was intending to drug her he would then either leave her here to sleep it off or walk her to his car while she was numb and transport her he was a softlooking man with piggish squinting eyes smudged with a horrid blue eye shadow and a pallor to his facial skin her comment stopped him she seized upon his hesitation you broke her back shewas too relaxed the drugswhatever it is youre about to give meits what killed herwhat will kill me if youtake away my strength to resist the force of the fallyoull break my back he stared at her expressionless he seemed to be thinking how could she read my mind like this how could she possibly know you want them to flywant me to fly dont you she said gaining some strength to her voice though not much the lingering effect of the stun stick was a massive migraine a dry throat and pain radiating throughout her body on top of that she was absurdly cold chilled to the bone a kind of chill that might be chemical or a response to shock but was unlike anything she knew i cant fly if you drug me the harnessmust distribute the force of the fall better shoulders to hips bigger harnessmaybe he held up a series of nylon straps and buckles it look liked hed made it himselfthere were nuts and bolts where a harness might have had stitching or grommets you dont needto drug meto put that on she said i wont fight i wantto help yoube the first to fly she watched his eyes mist shed triggered something painful in him she clawed through the purple and black orbs that threatened on the sides of her vision that warmth flowing down from her skull trying to overtake her he looked her over head to toe his eyes lingering where a woman always felt men looking she thought perhaps she didnt fit the lookthe look that he sought the victim theyd seen had been slightly heavier wider in the hips maybe he was considering rejecting her maybe shed spoken too much but speaking was her living her lifedepended on it to make this work she said we must be a team the two of us she thought that more than anything he missed whatever angel he was trying to recreate that to include him to embrace him to let him in was the secret to unlocking him what do you know about the two of us he appeared bewildered and confused she understood she had caused this had her mind been clearer she could have had more tools at her disposal but her education took a backseat to instinctit came down to getting him to loosen the ropes everything depended on his loosening the ropes we shouldtry on the harness you think you didnt know her id like to have shut up she meant a great deal to you i said shut up he lashed out with the harness whipping her bare skin across her middle and raising welts she shut up she looked away her arms beginning to shake from the fear she hated herself for giving this away for feeding him this she must not at all costs give him a connection between him beating her and her fear she fought herself her desire to hide to retreat to stay silent was to ask him to strike her again to speak was most likely the same invitation but she could control her speech whereas he controlled her silence and this was a very big difference to her you didnt mean to do that she said i forgive you his gaze locked onto her i forgive you for all of this i can see it stems from your pain i will fly for you i will help you but if you drug me youll break my back youll kill me nowwhat about the harness shouldnt we get the harness on she had him she fought through the goo the descending veil of approaching unconsciousness long enough to understand shed gotten through to him as a psychologist shed learned to spot these moments to seize upon them his arm moved toward the knot that tied one ankle to the other but it was a motion filled with suspicion and distrust come on she silently pleaded the man untied the first knot five khakiclad sheriff deputies stormed the malster residence with a precision boldt had not expected he and lamoia wearing flak jackets followed closely behind dead body boldt said knowing that smell the deputies quickly swarmed through the rooms shouting clear within seconds of one another got something a voice called out lamoia and boldt slipped down a narrow hallway to one of the homes two bedrooms it was a small room crowded with a double bed and a low dresser atop the dresser were several photographs of a younger woman wearing clothes and a haircut from a decade earlier burrito lamoia said a human burrito a wrap of thick plastic tarp secured with a half roll or more of duct tape whoever had done the job had tried to seal the body inside but the putrid smell overcame the room weeks boldt said his gloved hand pressing the plastic closer to where the face should have been the corpse was in a high degree of decay squirming larvae smeared the plastic from inside ohcrap lamoia said this guy is sick this guy is trying to hold on to the one parent he had left boldt said daphne said the doer would be living with a single parent so where is she hes not living here boldt said back in the hall now looking around the place had been cleaned up the kitchen was immaculate but a wire strainer had left a rust ring in the sink suggesting the passage of a good deal of time this is his mausoleum he indicated the small living room where two of the deputies stood awaiting instruction there were no fewer than twenty framed photographs of the same woman spread around the room we gotta find him lamoia insisted stating the obvious howre we going to do that sarge he sounded on the edge of tears were good boldt said basement he called to the deputies clear a deputy answered boldt stepped into the living room studying the various photographs more closely answers werent handed you you had to extract them its here somewhere he told lamoia start looking lamoia joined him they worked the house drawers closets cabinets boldt made a phone call and announced himself to his skagit sheriffs office counterpart with whom hed been dealing for the past hour and a half we need to check tax records for other properties a trailer or mobile home a boat someplace he could have taken heryes okay as soon as possible he called out for lamoia to bring him the photos from the bedroom even with the front and back doors open it reeked inside the small house but boldt wasnt going anywhere together the two lined up and rearranged the nearly three dozen framed photographs then they reshuffled them several times these five boldt said rearranging them yet again all were taken in bright sunlight in three of the five water could be seen behind the womans head one was clearly taken on a boat but not a pleasure craft lamoia turned to say something but boldts phone rang it was his contact at the sheriffs office we struck out on the tax records at least for this guy but we did pick up tax records for a commercial trawler registered to norman malster its in arrears but until about a year ago it had been paid up regularly for nearly twenty years a brother not a common name the sheriffs deputy said do we know where i got my guys making some calls everyone knows everyone here it shouldnt be orange metal boldt said pulling one of the photos closer one piece is curved down the other straight thats not oak harbor hang on a second the deputy went off the line when he returned he said la conner that s the bridge in la conner boldt and lamoia were out the door to the shouts of deputies across the street to a vacant lot where the helicopter waited have you there in three minutes shouted the pilot the door was slid shut the helicopter already lifting into a graying sky daphne contained her impatience with the first knot untied both ankles were free but her upper legs remained bound and her captor perhaps sensing her intentions pulled the harness up her calves restricting her movement before loosening the rope that bound her legs she needed a split second her legs were painful and weary from the stun stick but she couldnt allow him to slip the harness past her knees where it would immobilize her once againclearly his plan it was your mother wasnt it she said her captor froze his stunned expression exactly what shed hoped for she pulled her knees toward her chest leaned to the right and kicked out like she was on a rowing machine her captor flew back and into the wall she rocked and fell off the table turning sideways her hands and arms still bound her left shoulder twisting toward dislocation she kicked him again and again the third blow did damage his head struck the wall metal she knew from the sound of it a boat the loop of rope binding her wrists slipped off the head end of the table her wrists were connected by three feet of loose rope she pulled the rope to her mouth and sank her teeth into the knot her captor leaned forward daphne kicked him again this time in the groin and he buckled forward but his hand came up holding a fish knife and he lashed out at her catching her forearm your mother is dead she shouted assuming that to be the case and knowing this was the message that would unnerve him she whipped the rope in front of her catching him in the side of the face he slashed with the knife catching her knee she screamed and kicked out and in her effort to push him away the rope caught around his head and she had him by the neck now his back to her her knee on his spine and she pulled back with all her strength something came at her from the sidea gas canister it caught her in the temple and she went down hard she rolled beneath the table and the rope still caught around his neck pulled him with her she couldnt get away from him nowthey were tied by the rope around his neck he punched the knife toward her she dodged it and in the process looped another length of rope around his neck he swung the knife upward the rope cut her hands were free she scurried under the table and rose to her feet while he unwrapped the rope and gasped for breath he turned to face her my angel he said not going to happen daphne said she reached out for anythingthe nearest thing she could grab she blasted an air horn that was so loud in the enclosed space they both went deaf then she saw it the stun stick he had it in his hand as he came around the table toward her hed made the right choice driving her toward the bow and away from the only steps she saw she fired off the air horn again three short three long three short sos shes dead daphne repeated hoping to incite his rage to drive him to emotion and toward making mistakes as a result did she jump to her death she said guessing did she leave you unfairly you dont deserve to be like her he said brandishing the stun stick as he moved ever closer what are we going to do with you an explosion behind him turned him around it was not an explosion after all but the door to the cabin disintegrating behind lamoias efforts to kick it in lamoia took one step and fell into the cabin and her captor lunged forward and hit him with the stun stick lamoias body spasmed and then fell limpunconcious but a stun stick took time to recycle its charge daphne rushed him and struck the back of his head with the air horn canister boldt slid down the stairs landing on lamoia knocked the stun stick from the captors hand took the man under the arms and threw himthrew him like he was a matter of a few poundsacross the narrow hold and into the metal hull he followed around and pulled the man to him and struck the man in the face blow after blow lou she shouted the mans blood coming off boldts knotted fist again she shouted his name boldt stopped and looked back at her still holding the captor by his shirt he averted his eyes youll kill him she said her voice nothing but a faint whisper she pulled a mackinaw around her she staggered back and sat down sos he said that was a nice touch his mother she mumbled boldt let the man go he hit the floor with a thud boldt came around toward her but she recoiled and he raised his hands well get you help he said she nodded a look of defiance in her eyes her right hand still gripping the air horn boldt sat down on a folding patio chair next to her a small drink table between them daphne wore extra makeup to cover a bruise on her face a long sleeve tshirt and blue jeans the little girl for whom daphne served as guardian played inside a childproofed area of the balcony boldt couldnt see lamoia setting up something like this it had probably been daphne are you coming back he asked within seconds of sitting down two weeks paid leave she said more if i ask im not an idiot shed asked him over he hadnt been to lamoias loft since daphne had moved in he wasnt sure why that was but he wasnt sure he wanted to figure it out either she made him tea with no offer of coffee milk and sugar she drank chai the cloves and cinnamon heavy in the air but thats a yes he said it is she confirmed are you kidding me you think id quit not likely he said thank you but no one would blame you stuff it she said dont say another word you invited me he reminded not to discuss the case his mother was on that pacific west flight ten years ago he was out there on the sound when the bodies started to fall i dont pretend to knowtheres no fixing everyone theres no blame the human mindwell its why i want to get back to work we come from such different places he said i blame them all the time i have no means no way to fix any of them i just want them put away i suppose im the dog catcher and youre the person the volunteer at the shelter something like that are you getting enough sleep maybe not he watched the girl playing then he realized how relaxed daphne was with the child hed pictured her the stressed and worrying typehe should have known she couldnt have been more at ease this suits you it does though it may not last weve pretty much exhausted all the various channels if we get to keep her it will be a miracle miracles happen boldt said liz tells me that all the time how is she he didnt feel right talking about his wife his family with this woman he thought he understood why but marveled that that kind of discussion still made him feel restless daphne said were going to give it another chance john and me here then was the reason shed called he wondered why shed made such a deal out of it then he didnt wonder at all not a quitter he said i wanted to tell you like this here you and me dont ask me why but he wanted to ask her why okay he said is this awkward with you okay thanks for that you dont owe me this he said sure i do liz is good he said the kids are great seriously she smiled over at a building smiled for herself nodded gripped the arms of the folding chair a little tightly listen he said listen closely because i dont know if i can get this out right even once she nodded biting her lips so that they folded into her mouth whatever this is it has never gone awayim talking for me okay just for me it runs like one of those tantric chords they talk about this hum that operates out of the spectrum of human hearing always the musician i love that about youyour music what im talking about its not music exactly it pulsates quavers but it never stops never ceases its just there now then just there he swallowed dryly for a long time i let it let you haunt me own me then i realized it was more a tone than a handcuff so i harmonize with it i vamp off it ive learnedto love it she went tight with that word without actually ever hearing it its justthere like air water elemental i dont allow it to get in my way to stop my life i just let it hum down there wherever it is hum and resonate and sing to me she squinted her eyes tightly he felt he should leave without another word are you okay he finally asked trying to lock that in to memorize it store it so that i can recall it whenever i want whenever i need which is more often than it should be i ramble when im nervous but youre never nervous she said opening her eyes again i wish youd be nervous more often im glad for you and john he said shut up lou shut up and let me hear it too they sat there in silence for another fifteen minutes the girl made squeaks asked her mommy for some juice daphne got up to fetch it and boldt stood with her he made for the door turned back she had the box of juice out of the refrigerator was punching a straw through the top she wore a smile of satisfaction as she headed back to the balcony boldt turned the handle and let himself out humming as he went author biographies kathleen antrim is
