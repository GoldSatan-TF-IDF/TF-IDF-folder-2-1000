trial and error its hard to know exactly where to begin but first let me explain why im in jail the trial had lasted for eighteen days and from the moment the judge had entered the courtroom the public benches had been filled to overflowing the jury at leeds crown court had been out for almost two days and rumour had it that they were hopelessly divided on the barristers bench there was talk of hung juries and retrials as it had been more than eight hours since mr justice cartwright had told the foreman of the jury that their verdict need no longer be unanimous a majority of ten to two would be acceptable suddenly there was a buzz in the corridors and the members of the jury filed quietly into their places press and public alike began to stampede back into court all eyes were on the foreman of the jury a fat jollylooking little man dressed in a doublebreasted suit striped shirt and a colourful bow tie striving to appear solemn he seemed the sort of fellow with whom in normal circumstances i would have enjoyed a pint at the local but these were not normal circumstances as i climbed back up the steps into the dock my eyes settled on a pretty blonde who had been seated in the gallery every day of the trial i wondered if she attended all the sensational murder trials or if she was just fascinated by this one she showed absolutely no interest in me and like everyone else was concentrating her full attention on the foreman of the jury the clerk of the court dressed in a wig and a long black gown rose and read out from a card the words i suspect he knew by heart will the foreman of the jury please stand the jolly little fat man rose slowly from his place please answer my next question yes or no members of the jury have you reached a verdict on which at least ten of you are agreed yes we have members of the jury do you find the prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty as charged there was total silence in the courtroom my eyes were fixed on the foreman with the colourful bow tie he cleared his throat and said i first met jeremy alexander in at a cbi training seminar in bristol fiftysix british companies who were looking for ways to expand into europe had come together for a briefing on community law at the time that i signed up for the seminar coopers the company of which i was chairman ran vehicles of varying weights and sizes and was fast becoming one of the largest private road haulage companies in britain my father had founded the firm in starting out with three vehicles two of them pulled by horses and an overdraft limit of ten pounds at his local martins bank by the time we became cooper son in the company had seventeen vehicles with four wheels or more and delivered goods all over the north of england but the old man still resolutely refused to exceed his tenpound overdraft limit i once expressed the view during a downturn in the market that we should be looking further afield in search of new business perhaps even as far as the continent but my father wouldnt hear of it not a risk worth taking he declared he distrusted anyone born south of the humber let alone those who lived on the other side of the channel if god put a strip of water between us he must have had good reasons for doing so were his final words on the subject i would have laughed if i hadnt realised he meant it when he retired in reluctantly at the age of seventy i took over as chairman and began to set in motion some ideas id been working on for the past decade though i knew my father didnt approve of them europe was only the beginning of my plans for the companys expansion within five years i wanted to go public by then i realised we would require an overdraft facility of at least a million pounds and would therefore have to move our account to a bank which recognized that the world stretched beyond the county boundaries of yorkshire it was around this time that i heard about the cbi seminar at bristol and applied for a place the seminar began on the friday with an opening address from the head of the european directorate of the cbi after that the delegates split into eight small working groups each chaired by an expert on community law my group was headed by jeremy alexander i admired him from the moment he started speaking in fact it wouldnt be an exaggeration to say that i was overawed he was totally selfassured and as i was to learn he could effortlessly present a convincing argument on any subject from the superiority of the code napol√©on to the inferiority of the english middleorder batting he lectured us for an hour on the fundamental differences in practice and procedure between the member states of the community then answered all our questions on commercial and company law even finding time to explain the significance of the uruguay round like me the other members of our group never stopped taking notes we broke up for lunch a few minutes before one and i managed to grab a place next to jeremy i was already beginning to think that he might be the ideal person to advise me on how to go about achieving my european ambitions listening to him talk about his career over a meal of stargazy pie with red peppers i kept thinking that although we were about the same age we couldnt have come from more different backgrounds jeremys father a banker by profession had escaped from eastern europe only days before the outbreak of the second world war he had settled in england anglicized his name and sent his son to westminster from there jeremy had gone on to kings college london where he read law graduating with firstclass honours my own father was a selfmade man from the yorkshire dales who had insisted i leave school the moment i passed my o levels ill teach you more about the real world in a month than youd learn from any of those university types in a lifetime he used to say i accepted this philosophy without question and left school a few weeks after my sixteenth birthday the next morning i joined coopers as an apprentice and spent my first three years at the depot under the watchful eye of buster jackson the works manager who taught me how to take the companys vehicles apart and more importantly how to put them back together again after graduating from the workshop i spent two years in the invoicing department learning how to calculate charges and collect bad debts a few weeks after my twentyfirst birthday i passed the test for my heavy goods vehicles license and for the next three years i zigzagged across the north of england delivering everything from poultry to pineapples to our farflung customers jeremy spent the same period reading for a masters degree in napoleonic law at the sorbonne when buster jackson retired i was moved back to the depot in leeds to take over as works manager jeremy was in hamburg writing a doctoral thesis on international trade barriers by the time he had finally left the world of academia and taken up his first real job as a partner with a large firm of commercial solicitors in the city i had been earning a working wage for eight years although i was impressed by jeremy at the seminar i sensed behind that surface affability a powerful combination of ambition and intellectual snobbery that my father would have mistrusted i felt hed only agreed to give the lecture on the offchance that at some time in the future we might be responsible for spreading some butter on his bread i now realise that even at our first meeting he suspected that in my case it might be honey it didnt help my opinion of the man that he had a couple of inches on me in height and a couple less around the waist not to mention the fact that the most attractive woman on the course that weekend ended up in his bed on the saturday night we met up on the sunday morning to play squash when he ran me ragged without even appearing to raise a sweat we must get together again he said as we walked to the showers if youre really thinking of expanding into europe you might find im able to help my father had taught me never to make the mistake of imagining that your friends and your colleagues were necessarily the same animals he often cited the cabinet as an example so although i didnt like him i made sure that when i left bristol at the end of the conference i was in possession of jeremys numerous telephone and fax numbers i drove back to leeds on the sunday evening and when i reached home i ran upstairs and sat on the end of the bed regaling my sleepy wife with an account of why it had turned out to be such a worthwhile weekend rosemary was my second wife my first helen had been at leeds high school for girls at the same time that i had attended the nearby grammar school the two schools shared a gymnasium and i fell in love with her at the age of thirteen while watching her play netball after that i would find any excuse to hang around the gym hoping to catch a glimpse of her blue knickers as she leapt to send the ball unerringly into the net as the schools took part in various joint activities i began to take an active interest in theatrical productions even though i couldnt act i attended joint debates and never opened my mouth i enlisted in the combined schools orchestra and ended up playing the triangle after i had left school and gone to work at the depot i continued to see helen who was studying for her a levels despite my passion for her we didnt make love until we were both eighteen and even then i wasnt certain that we had consummated anything six weeks later she told me in a flood of tears that she was pregnant against the wishes of her parents who had hoped that she would go on to university a hasty wedding was arranged but as i never wanted to look at another girl for the rest of my life i was secretly delighted by the outcome of our youthful indiscretion helen died on the night of september giving birth to our son tom who himself only survived a week i thought i would never get over it and im not sure i ever have after her death i didnt so much as glance at another woman for years putting all my energy into the company following the funeral of my wife and son my father not a soft or sentimental man you wont find many of those in yorkshire revealed a gentle side to his character that i had never seen before he would often phone me in the evening to see how i was getting on and insisted that i regularly joined him in the directors box at elland road to watch leeds united on saturday afternoons i began to understand for the first time why my mother still adored him after more than twenty years of marriage i met rosemary about four years later at a ball given to launch the leeds music festival not a natural habitat for me but as coopers had taken a fullpage advertisement in the program and brigadier kershaw the high sheriff of the county and chair man of the ball committee had invited us to join him as his guests i had no choice but to dress up in my seldomworn dinner jacket and accompany my parents to the ball i was placed on table next to a miss kershaw who turned out to be the high sheriffs daughter she was elegantly dressed in a strapless blue gown that emphasized her comely figure and had a mop of red hair and a smile that made me feel we had been friends for years she told me over something described on the menu as avocado with dill that she had just finished reading english at durham university and wasnt quite sure what she was going to do with her life i dont want to be a teacher she said and im certainly not cut out to be a secretary we chatted through the second and third courses ignoring the people seated on either side of us after coffee she dragged me onto the dance floor where she continued to explain the problems of contemplating any form of work while her diary was so packed with social engagements i felt rather flattered that the high sheriffs daughter should show the slightest interest in me and to be honest i didnt take it seriously when at the end of the evening she whispered in my ear lets keep in touch but a couple of days later she rang and invited me to join her and her parents for lunch that sunday at their house in the country and then perhaps we could play a little tennis afterwards you do play tennis i suppose i drove over to church fenton on sunday and found that the kershaws residence was exactly what i would have expected large and decaying which come to think of it wasnt a bad description of rosemarys father as well but he seemed a nice enough chap her mother however wasnt quite so easy to please she originated from somewhere in hampshire and was unable to mask her feeling that although i might be good for the occasional charitable donation i was not quite the sort of person with whom she expected to be sharing her sunday lunch rosemary ignored the odd barbed comment from her and continued to chat to me about my work as it rained all afternoon we never got round to playing tennis so rosemary used the time to seduce me in the little pavilion behind the court at first i was nervous about making love to the high sheriffs daughter but i soon got used to the idea however as the weeks passed i began to wonder if i was anything more to her than a lorry driver fantasy until that is she started to talk about marriage mrs kershaw was unable to hide her disgust at the very idea of someone like me becoming her soninlaw but her opinion turned out to be irrelevant as rosemary remained implacable on the subject we were married eighteen months later over two hundred guests attended the rather grand county wedding in the parish church of st marys but i confess that when i turned to watch rosemary progressing up the aisle my only thoughts were of my first wedding ceremony for a couple of years rosemary made every effort to be a good wife she took an interest in the company learned the names of all the employees even became friendly with the wives of some of the senior executives but as i worked all the hours god sent i fear i may not always have given her as much attention as she needed you see rosemary yearned for a life that was made up of regular visits to the grand theatre for opera north followed by dinner parties with her county friends that would run into the early hours while i preferred to work at weekends and to be tucked up in bed before eleven most nights for rosemary i wasnt turning out to be the husband in the title of the oscar wilde play she had recently taken me to and it didnt help that i had fallen asleep during the second act after four years without producing any offspring not that rosemary wasnt very energetic in bed we began to drift our separate ways if she started having affairs and i certainly did when i could find the time she was discreet about them and then she met jeremy alexander it must have been about six weeks after the seminar in bristol that i had occasion to phone jeremy and seek his advice i wanted to close a deal with a french cheese company to transport its wares to british supermarkets the previous year i had made a large loss on a similar enterprise with a german beer company and i couldnt afford to make the same mistake again send me all the details jeremy had said ill look over the paperwork at the weekend and call you on monday morning he was as good as his word and when he phoned me he mentioned that he had to be in york that thursday to brief a client and suggested we get together the following day to go over the contract i agreed and we spent most of that friday closeted in the coopers boardroom checking over every dot and comma of the contract it was a pleasure to watch such a professional at work even if jeremy did occasionally display an irritating habit of drumming his fingers on the table when i hadnt immediately understood what he was getting at jeremy it turned out had already talked to the french companys inhouse lawyer in toulouse about any reservations he might have he assured me that although monsieur sisley spoke no english he had made him fully aware of our anxieties i remember being struck by his use of the word our after we had turned the last page of the contract i realised that everyone else in the building had left for the weekend so i suggested to jeremy that he might like to join rosemary and me for dinner he checked his watch considered the offer for a moment and then said thank you thats very kind of you could you drop me back at the queens hotel so i can get changed rosemary however was not pleased to be told at the last minute that i had invited a complete stranger to dinner without warning her even though i assured her that she would like him jeremy rang our front doorbell a few minutes after eight when i introduced him to rosemary he bowed slightly and kissed her hand after that they didnt take their eyes off each other all evening only a blind man could have missed what was likely to happen next and although i might not have been blind i certainly turned a blind eye jeremy was soon finding excuses to spend more and more time in leeds and i am bound to admit that his sudden enthusiasm for the north of england enabled me to advance my ambitions for coopers far more quickly than i had originally dreamed possible i had felt for some time that the company needed an inhouse lawyer and within a year of our first meeting i offered jeremy a place on the board with the remit to prepare the company for going public during that period i spent a great deal of my time in madrid amsterdam and brussels drumming up new contracts and rosemary certainly didnt discourage me meanwhile jeremy skilfully guided the company through a thicket of legal and financial problems caused by our expansion thanks to his diligence and expertise we were able to announce on february that coopers would be applying for a listing on the stock exchange later that year it was then that i made my first mistake i invited jeremy to become deputy chairman of the company under the terms of the flotation fiftyone percent of the shares would be retained by rosemary and myself jeremy explained to me that for tax reasons they should be divided equally between us my accountants agreed and at the time i didnt give it a second thought the remaining onepound shares were quickly taken up by institutions and the general public and within days of the company being listed on the stock exchange their value had risen to my father who had died the previous year would never have accepted that it was possible to become worth several million pounds overnight in fact i suspect he would have disapproved of the very idea as he went to his deathbed still believing that a tenpound overdraft was quite adequate to conduct a wellrun business during the s the british economy showed continual growth and by march coopers shares had topped the fivepound mark following press speculation about a possible takeover jeremy had advised me to accept one of the bids but i told him that i would never allow coopers to be let out of the familys control after that we had to split the shares on three separate occasions and by the sunday times was estimating that rosemary and i were together worth around thirty million pounds i had never thought of myself as being wealthy after all as far as i was concerned the shares were simply pieces of paper held by joe ramsbottom our company solicitor i still lived in my fathers house drove a fiveyearold jaguar and worked fourteen hours a day i had never cared much for holidays and wasnt by nature extravagant wealth seemed somehow irrelevant to me i would have been happy to continue living much as i was had i not arrived home unexpectedly one night i had caught the last plane back to heathrow after a particularly long and arduous negotiation in cologne and had originally intended to stay overnight in london but by then id had enough of hotels and simply wanted to get home despite the long drive when i arrived back in leeds a few minutes after one i found jeremys white bmw parked in the driveway had i phoned rosemary earlier that day i might never have ended up in jail i parked my car next to jeremys and was walking towards the front door when i noticed that there was only one light on in the house in the front room on the first floor it wouldnt have taken sherlock holmes to deduce what might be taking place in that particular room i came to a halt and stared up at the drawn curtains for some time nothing stirred so clearly they hadnt heard the car and were unaware of my presence i retraced my steps and drove quietly off in the direction of the city centre when i arrived at the queens hotel i asked the duty manager if mr jeremy alexander had booked a room for the night he checked the register and confirmed that he had then ill take his key i told him mr alexander has booked himself in somewhere else for the night my father would have been proud of such thrifty use of the companys resources i lay on the hotel bed quite unable to sleep my anger rising as each hour passed although i no longer had a great deal of feeling for rosemary and even accepted that perhaps i never had i now loathed jeremy but it wasnt until the next day that i discovered just how much i loathed him the following morning i rang my secretary and told her i would be driving to the office straight from london she reminded me that there was a board meeting scheduled for two oclock which mr alexander was pencilled in to chair i was glad she couldnt see the smile of satisfaction that spread across my face a quick glance at the agenda over breakfast and it had become abundantly clear why jeremy had wanted to chair this particular meeting but his plans didnt matter anymore i had already decided to let my fellow directors know exactly what he was up to and to make sure that he was dismissed from the board as soon as was practicable i arrived at coopers just after and parked in the space marked chairman by the time the board meeting was scheduled to begin id had just enough time to check over my files and became painfully aware of how many of the companys shares were now controlled by jeremy and what he and rosemary must have been planning for some time jeremy vacated the chairmans place without comment the moment i entered the boardroom and showed no particular interest in the proceedings until we reached an item concerning a future share issue it was at this point that he tried to push through a seemingly innocuous motion which could ultimately have resulted in rosemary and myself losing overall control of the company and therefore being unable to resist any future takeover bid i might have fallen for it if i hadnt travelled up to leeds the previous evening and found his car parked in my driveway and the bedroom light on just when he thought he had succeeded in having the motion agreed without a vote i asked the company accountants to prepare a full report for the next board meeting before we came to any decision jeremy showed no sign of emotion he simply looked down at his notes and began drumming his fingers on the boardroom table i was determined that the report would prove to be his downfall if only it hadnt been for my short temper i might given time have worked out a more sensible way of ridding myself of him as no one had any other business to raise i closed the meeting at and suggested to jeremy that he join rosemary and me for dinner i wanted to see them together jeremy didnt seem too keen but after some bluffing from me about not fully understanding his new share proposal and feeling that my wife ought to be brought in on it at some stage he agreed when i rang rosemary to let her know that jeremy would be coming to dinner she seemed even less enthusiastic about the idea than he had been perhaps the two of you should go off to a restaurant together she suggested then jeremy can bring you up to date on whats been going on while youve been away i tried not to laugh we havent got much food in at the moment she added i told her that it wasnt the food i was worried about jeremy was uncharacteristically late but i had his usual whisky and soda ready the moment he walked through the door i must say he put up a brilliant performance over dinner though rosemary was less convincing over coffee in the sitting room i managed to provoke the confrontation that jeremy had so skilfully avoided at the board meeting why are you so keen to rush through this new share allocation i asked once he was on his second brandy surely you realise that it will take control of the company out of the hands of rosemary and me cant you see that we could be taken over in no time he tried a few wellrehearsed phrases in the best interests of the company richard you must realise how quickly coopers is expanding its no longer a family firm in the long term it has to be the most prudent course for both of you not to mention the shareholders i wondered which particular shareholders he had in mind i was a little surprised to find rosemary not only backing him up but showing a remarkable grasp of the finer details of the share allocation even after jeremy had scowled rather too obviously at her she seemed extremely wellversed in the arguments he had been putting forward given the fact that she had never shown any interest in the companys transactions in the past it was when she turned to me and said we must consider our future darling that i finally lost my temper yorkshiremen are well known for being blunt and my next question lived up to our countys reputation are you two having an affair by any chance rosemary turned scarlet jeremy laughed a little too loudly and then said i think youve had one drink too many richard not a drop i assured him sober as a judge as i was when i came home late last night and found your car parked in the driveway and the light on in the bedroom for the first time since id met him i had completely wrongfooted jeremy even if it was only for a moment he began drumming his fingers on the glass table in front of him i was simply explaining to rosemary how the new share issue would affect her he said hardly missing a beat which is no more than is required under stock exchange regulations and is there a stock exchange regulation requiring that such explanations should take place in bed oh dont be absurd said jeremy i spent the night at the queens hotel call the manager he added picking up the telephone and offering it to me hell confirm that i was booked in to my usual room im sure he will i said but hell also confirm that it was i who spent the night in your usual bed in the silence that followed i removed the hotel bedroom key from my jacket pocket and dangled it in front of him jeremy immediately jumped to his feet i rose from my chair rather more slowly and faced him wondering what his next line could possibly be its your own fault you bloody fool he eventually stammered out you should have taken more interest in rosemary in the first place and not gone off gallivanting around europe all the time its no wonder youre in danger of losing the company funny it wasnt the fact that jeremy had been sleeping with my wife that caused me to snap but that he had the arrogance to think he could take over my company as well i didnt reply but just took a pace forward and threw a punch at his cleanshaven jaw i may have been a couple of inches shorter than he was but after twenty years of hanging around with lorry drivers i could still land a decent blow jeremy staggered first backwards and then forwards before crumpling in front of me as he fell he cracked his right temple on the corner of the glass table knocking his brandy all over the floor he lay motionless in front of me blood dripping onto the carpet i must admit i felt rather pleased with myself especially when rosemary rushed to his side and started screaming obscenities at me save your breath for the exdeputy chairman i told her and when he comes round tell him not to bother with the queens hotel because ill be sleeping in his bed again tonight i strode out of the house and drove back into the city centre leaving my jaguar in the hotel parking lot when i walked into the queens the lobby was deserted and i took the lift straight up to jeremys room i lay on top of the bed but was far too agitated to sleep i was just dozing off when four policemen burst into the room and pulled me off the bed one of them told me that i was under arrest and read me my rights without further explanation i was marched out of the hotel and driven to millgarth police station a few minutes after five am i was signed in by the custody officer and my personal possessions were taken from me and dropped into a bulky brown envelope i was told that i had the right to make one telephone call so i rang joe ramsbottom woke his wife and asked if joe could join me at the station as quickly as possible then i was locked in a small cell and left alone i sat on the wooden bench and tried to fathom out why i had been arrested i couldnt believe that jeremy would have been foolish enough to charge me with assault when joe arrived about forty minutes later i told him exactly what had taken place earlier in the evening he listened gravely but didnt offer an opinion when i had finished he said he would try to find out what the police intended to charge me with after joe left i began to fear that jeremy might have had a heart attack or even that the blow to his head from the corner of the table might have killed him my imagination ran riot as i considered all the worst possibilities and i was becoming more and more desperate to learn what had happened when the cell door swung open and two plainclothes detectives walked in joe was a pace behind them im chief inspector bainbridge said the taller of the two and this is my colleague sergeant harris their eyes were tired and their suits crumpled they looked as if they had been on duty all night as both of them could have done with a shave i felt my chin and realised i needed one as well wed like to ask you some questions about what took place at your home earlier this evening said the chief inspector i looked at joe who shook his head it would help our enquiries mr cooper if you cooperated with us the chief inspector continued would you be prepared to give us a statement ether in writing or as a tape recording im afraid my client has nothing to say at the moment chief inspector said joe and he will have nothing to say until i have taken further instructions i was rather impressed id never seen joe that firm with anyone other than his children we would simply like to take a statement mr ramsbottom chief inspector bainbridge said to joe as if i didnt exist we are quite happy for you to be present throughout no said joe firmly you either charge my client or you leave us and leave us immediately the chief inspector hesitated for a moment and then nodded to his colleague they departed without another word charge me i said once the cell door had been locked behind them what with for gods sake murder i suspect said joe after what rosemary has been telling them murder i said almost unable to mouth the word but i listened in disbelief as joe told me what hed been able to discover about the details of the statement my wife had given to the police during the early hours of the morning but thats not what happened i protested surely no one would believe such an outrageous story they might when they learn the police have found a trail of blood leading from the sitting room to the spot where your car was parked in the drive said joe thats not possible i said when i left jeremy he was still lying unconscious on the floor the police also found traces of blood in the trunk of your car they seem quite confident that it will match up with jeremys oh my god i said hes clever hes very clever cant you see what theyve been up to no to be honest i cant joe admitted this isnt exactly all in a days work for a company solicitor like me but i managed to catch sir matthew roberts qc on the phone before he left home this morning hes the most eminent criminal silk on the northeastern circuit hes appearing in the york crown court today and hes agreed to join us as soon as the court has risen if youre innocent richard joe said with sir matthew defending you there will be nothing to fear of that you can be certain later that afternoon i was charged with the murder of jeremy anatole alexander the police admitted to my solicitor that they still hadnt found the body but they were confident that they would do so within a few hours i knew they wouldnt joe told me the following day that they had done more digging in my garden during the past twentyfour hours than i had attempted in the past twentyfour years around seven that evening the door of my cell swung open once again and joe walked in accompanied by a heavilybuilt distinguishedlooking man sir matthew roberts was about my height but at least a couple of stone heavier from his rubicund cheeks and warm smile he looked as if he regularly enjoyed a good bottle of wine and the company of amusing people he had a full head of dark hair that remained modelled on the old denis compton brylcreem advertisements and he was attired in the garb of his profession a dark threepiece suit and a silvergrey tie i liked him from the moment he introduced himself his first words were to express the wish that we had met in more pleasant circumstances i spent the rest of the evening with sir matthew going over my story again and again i could tell he didnt believe a word i was saying but he still seemed quite happy to represent me he and joe left a few minutes after eleven and i settled down to spend my first night behind bars i was remanded in custody until the police had processed and submitted all their evidence to the department of public prosecutions the following day a magistrate committed me to trial at leeds crown court and despite an eloquent plea from sir matthew i was not granted bail forty minutes later i was transferred to armley jail the hours turned into days the days into weeks and the weeks into months i almost tired of telling anyone who would listen that they would never find jeremys body because there was no body to find when the case finally reached leeds crown court nine months later the crime reporters turned up in their hordes and followed every word of the trial with relish a multimillionaire a possible adulterous affair and a missing body were too much for them to resist the tabloids excelled themselves describing jeremy as the lord lucan of leeds and me as an oversexed lorry driver i would have enjoyed every last syllable of it if i hadnt been the accused in his opening address sir matthew put up a magnificent fight on my behalf without a body how could his client possibly be charged with murder and how could i have disposed of the body when i had spent the entire night in a bedroom at the queens hotel how i regretted not checking in the second time but simply going straight up to jeremys room it didnt help that the police had found me lying on the bed fully dressed i watched the faces of the jury at the end of the prosecutions opening speech they were perplexed and obviously in some doubt about my guilt that doubt remained until rosemary entered the witness box i couldnt bear to look at her and diverted my eyes to a striking blonde who had been sitting in the front row of the public gallery on every day of the trial for an hour the counsel for the prosecution guided my wife gently through what had taken place that evening up to the point when i had struck jeremy until that moment i couldnt have quarreled with a word she had spoken and then what happened mrs cooper prodded counsel for the crown my husband bent down and checked mr alexanders pulse rosemary whispered then he turned white and all he said was hes dead ive killed him and what did mr cooper do next he picked up the body threw it over his shoulder and began walking towards the door i shouted after him what do you think youre doing richard and how did he respond he told me he intended to dispose of the body while it was still dark and that i was to make sure that there was no sign that jeremy had visited the house as no one else had been in the office when they left everyone would assume that jeremy had returned to london earlier in the evening be certain there are absolutely no traces of blood were the last words i remember my husband saying as he left the room carrying jeremys body over his shoulder that must have been when i fainted sir matthew glanced quizzically up at me in the dock i shook my head vigorously he looked grim as counsel for the prosecution resumed his seat do you wish to question this witness sir matthew the judge asked sir matthew rose slowly to his feet i most certainly do mlud he replied he drew himself up to his full height tugged at his gown and stared across at his adversary mrs cooper would you describe yourself as a friend of mr alexander yes but only in the sense that he was a colleague of my husbands replied rosemary calmly so you didnt ever see each other when your husband was away from leeds or even out of the country on business only at social events when i was accompanied by my husband or if i dropped into the office to pick up his mail are you certain that those were the only times you saw him mrs cooper were there not other occasions when you spent a considerable amount of time alone with mr alexander for example on the night of september before your husband returned unexpectedly from a european trip did mr alexander not visit you then for several hours while you were alone in the house no he dropped by after work to leave a document for my husband but he didnt even have time to stay for a drink but your husband says began sir matthew i know what my husband says rosemary replied as if she had rehearsed the line a hundred times i see said sir matthew lets get to the point shall we mrs cooper were you having an affair with jeremy alexander at the time of his disappearance is this relevant sir matthew interrupted the judge it most assuredly is mlud it goes to the very core of the case replied my qc in a quiet even tone everyones gaze was now fixed on rosemary i willed her to tell the truth she didnt hesitate certainly not she replied although it wasnt the first time my husband had accused me unjustly i see said sir matthew he paused do you love your husband mrs cooper really sir matthew the judge was unable to disguise his irritation i must ask once again if this is relevant sir matthew exploded relevant its absolutely vital mlud and i am not being assisted by your lordships thinly veiled attempts to intervene on behalf of this witness the judge was beginning to splutter with indignation when rosemary said quietly i have always been a good and faithful wife but i cannot under any circumstances condone murder the jury turned their eyes on me most of them looked as if they would be happy to bring back the death penalty if that is the case i am bound to ask why you waited two and a half hours to contact the police said sir matthew especially if as you claim you believed your husband had committed murder and was about to dispose of the body as i explained i fainted soon after he left the room i phoned the police the moment i came to how convenient said sir matthew or perhaps the truth is that you made use of that time to set a trap for your husband while allowing your lover to get clean away a murmur ran through the courtroom sir matthew the judge said jumping in once again you are going too far not so mlud with respect in fact not far enough he swung back round and faced my wife again i put it to you mrs cooper that jeremy alexander was your lover and still is that you are perfectly aware he is alive and well and that if you wished to you could tell us exactly where he is now despite the judges spluttering and the uproar in the court rosemary had her reply ready i only wish he were she said so that he could stand in this court and confirm that i am telling the truth her voice was soft and gentle but you already know the truth mrs cooper said sir matthew his voice gradually rising the truth is that your husband left the house on his own he then drove to the queens hotel where he spent the rest of the night while you and your lover used that time to leave clues across the city of leeds clues i might add that were intended to incriminate your husband but the one thing you couldnt leave was a body because as you well know mr jeremy alexander is still alive and the two of you have together fabricated this entire bogus story simply to further your own ends isnt that the truth mrs cooper no no rosemary shouted her voice cracking before she finally burst into tears oh come come mrs cooper those are counterfeit tears are they not said sir matthew quietly now youve been found out the jury will decide if your distress is genuine i glanced across at the jury not only had they fallen for rosemarys performance but they now despised me for allowing my insensitive bully of a counsel to attack such a gentle longsuffering woman to every one of sir matthews probing questions rosemary proved well capable of delivering a riposte that revealed to me all the hallmarks of jeremy alexanders expert tuition when it was my turn to enter the witness box and sir matthew began questioning me i felt my story sounded far less convincing than rosemarys despite its being the truth the closing speech for the crown was deadly dull but nevertheless deadly sir matthews was subtle and dramatic but i feared less convincing after another night in armley jail i returned to the dock for the judges summing up it was clear that he was in no doubt as to my guilt his selection of the evidence he chose to review was unbalanced and unfair and when he ended by reminding the jury that his opinion of the evidence should ultimately carry no weight he only added hypocrisy to bias after their first full days deliberations the jury had to be put up overnight in a hotel ironically the queens and when the jolly little fat man in the bow tie was finally asked members of the jury do you find the prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty as charged i wasnt surprised when he said clearly for all to hear guilty my lord in fact i was amazed that the jury had failed to reach a unanimous decision i have often wondered which two members felt convinced enough to declare my innocence i would have liked to thank them the judge stared down at me richard wilfred cooper you have been found guilty of the murder of jeremy anatole alexander i did not kill him my lord i interrupted in a calm voice in fact he is not dead i can only hope that you will live long enough to realise the truth sir matthew looked up anxiously as uproar broke out in the court the judge called for silence and his voice became even more harsh as he pronounced you will go to prison for life that is the sentence prescribed by law take him down two prison officers stepped forward gripped me firmly by the arms and led me down the steps at the back of the dock into the cell i had occupied every morning for the eighteen days of the trial sorry old chum said the policeman who had been in charge of my welfare since the case had begun it was that bitch of a wife who tipped the scales against you he slammed the cell door closed and turned the key in the lock before i had a chance to agree with him a few moments later the door was unlocked again and sir matthew strode in he stared at me for some time before uttering a word a terrible injustice has been done mr cooper he eventually said and we shall immediately lodge an appeal against your conviction be assured i will not rest until we have found jeremy alexander and he has been brought to justice for the first time i realised sir matthew knew that i was innocent i was put in a cell with a petty criminal called fingers jenkins can you believe as we approach the twentyfirst century that anyone could still be called fingers even so the name had been well earned within moments of my entering the cell fingers was wearing my watch he returned it immediately i noticed it had disappeared sorry he said just put it down to abit prison might have turned out to be far worse if it hadnt been known by my fellow inmates that i was a millionaire and was quite happy to pay a little extra for certain privileges every morning the financial times was delivered to my bunk which gave me the chance to keep up with what was happening in the city i was nearly sick when i first read about the takeover bid for coopers sick not because of the offer of a share which made me even wealthier but because it became painfully obvious what jeremy and rosemary had been up to jeremys shares would now be worth several million pounds money he could never have realised had i been around to prevent a takeover i spent hours each day lying on my bunk and scouring every word of the financial times whenever there was a mention of coopers i went over the paragraph so often that i ended up knowing it by heart the company was eventually taken over but not before the share price had reached i continued to follow its activities with great interest and i became more and more anxious about the quality of the new management when they began to sack some of my most experienced staff including joe ramsbottom a week later i wrote and instructed my stockbrokers to sell my shares as and when the opportunity arose it was at the beginning of my fourth month in prison that i asked for some writing paper i had decided the time had come to keep a record of everything that had happened to me since that night i had returned home unexpectedly every day the prison officer on my landing would bring me fresh sheets of bluelined paper and i would write out in longhand the chronicle youre now reading an added bonus was that it helped me to plan my next move at my request fingers took a straw poll among the prisoners as to who they believed was the best detective they had ever come up against three days later he told me the result chief superintendent donald hackett known as the don came out top on more than half the lists more reliable than a gallup poll i told fingers what puts hackett ahead of all the others i asked him es honest es fair you cant bribe im and once the bastard knows youre a villain e doesnt care ow long it takes to get you beind bars hackett i was informed hailed from bradford rumour had it among the older cons that he had turned down the job of assistant chief constable for west yorkshire like a barrister who doesnt want to become a judge he preferred to remain at the coalface arrestin criminals is ow e gets his kicks fingers said with some feeling sounds just the man im looking for i said how old is he fingers paused to consider must be past fifty by now he replied after all e ad me put in borstal for nickin a toolset and that was he paused again more than twenty years ago when sir matthew came to visit me the following monday i told him what i had in mind and asked his opinion of the don i wanted a professionals view hes a hell of a witness to crossexamine thats one thing i can tell you replied my barrister whys that he doesnt exaggerate he wont prevaricate and ive never known him to lie which makes him awfully hard to trap no ive rarely got the better of the chief superintendent i have to say though that i doubt if hed agree to become involved with a convicted criminal whatever you offered him but im not i know mr cooper said sir matthew who still didnt seem able to call me by my first name but hackett will have to be convinced of that before he even agrees to see you but how can i convince him of my innocence while im stuck in jail ill try to influence him on your behalf sir matthew sad after some thought then he added come to think of it he does owe me a favour after sir matthew had left that night i requested some more lined paper and began to compose a carefully worded letter to chief superintendent hackett several versions of which ended crumpled up on the floor of my cell my final effort read as follows in replying to this letter please write on the envelope number a name cooper r w h m prison armley leeds ls i reread the letter corrected the spelling mistake and scrawled my signature across the bottom at my request sir matthew delivered the letter to hackett by hand the first thousandpoundaday postman in the history of the royal mail i told him sir matthew reported back the following monday that he had handed the letter to the chief superintendent in person after hackett had read it through a second time his only comment was that he would have to speak to his superiors he had promised he would let sir matthew know his decision within a week from the moment i had been sentenced sir matthew had been preparing for my appeal and although he had not at any time raised my hopes he was unable to hide his delight at what he had discovered after paying a visit to the probate office it turned out that in his will jeremy had left everything to rosemary this included over three million pounds worth of coopers shares but sir matthew explained the law did not allow her to dispose of them for seven years an english jury may have pronounced on your guilt he declared but the hardheaded taxmen are not so easily convinced they wont hand over jeremy alexanders assets until either they have seen his body or seven years have elapsed do they think that rosemary might have killed him for his money and then disposed no no said sir matthew almost laughing at my suggestion its simply that as theyre entitled to wait for seven years theyre going to sit on his assets and not take the risk that alexander may still be alive in any case if your wife had killed him she wouldnt have had a ready answer to every one of my questions when she was in the witness box of that im sure i smiled for the first time in my life i was delighted to learn that the taxman had his nose in my affairs sir matthew promised he would report back if anything new came up goodnight richard he said as he left the interview room another first it seemed that everyone else in the prison was aware that chief superintendent hackett would be paying me a visit long before i was it was dave adams an old lag from an adjoining cell who explained why the inmates thought hackett had agreed to see me a good copper is never appy about anyone doin time for somethin e didnt do ackett phoned the governor last tuesday and ad a word with im on the qt accordin to maurice dave added mysteriously i would have been interested to learn how the governors trusty had managed to hear both sides of the conversation but decided this was not the time for irrelevant questions even the ardest nuts in this place think youre innocent dave continued they cant wait for the day when mr jeremy alexander takes over your cell you can be sure the long termersll give im a warm welcome a letter from bradford arrived the following morning dear cooper the chief superintendent began and went on to inform me that he intended to pay a visit to the jail at four oclock the following sunday he made it clear that he would stay no longer than half an hour and insisted on a witness being present throughout for the first time since id been locked up i started counting the hours hours arent that important when your room has been booked for a life sentence as i was taken from my cell that sunday afternoon and escorted to the interview room i received several messages from my fellow inmates to pass on to the chief superintendent give my best regards to the don said fingers tell im ow sorry i am not to bump into im this time when es finished with you ask im if ed like to drop into my cell for a cup of tea and a chat about old times kick the bastard in the balls and tell im ill be appy to serve the extra time one of the prisoners even suggested a question to which i already knew the answer ask im when es going to retire cause im not coming out till the day after when i stepped into the interview room and saw the chief superintendent for the first time i thought there must have been some mistake i had never asked fingers what the don looked like and over the past few days i had built up in my mind the image of some sort of superman but the man who stood before me was a couple of inches shorter than me and im only five foot ten he was as thin as the proverbial rake and wore pebblelensed hornrimmed glasses which gave the impression that he was halfblind all he needed was a grubby raincoat and he could have been mistaken for a debt collector sir matthew stepped forward to introduce us i shook the policeman firmly by the hand thank you for coming to visit me chief superintendent i began wont you have a seat i added as if he had dropped into my home for a glass of sherry sir matthew is very persuasive said hackett in a deep gruff yorkshire accent that didnt quite seem to go with his body so tell me cooper what do you imagine it is that i can do for you he asked as he took the chair opposite me i detected an edge of cynicism in his voice he opened a notepad and placed it on the table as i was about to begin my story for my use only he explained should i need to remind myself of any relevant details at some time in the future twenty minutes later i had finished the abbreviated version of the life and times of richard cooper i had already gone over the story on several occasions in my cell during the past week to be certain i didnt take too long i wanted to leave enough time for hackett to ask any questions if i believe your story he said and i only say if you still havent explained what it is you think i can do for you youre due to leave the force in five months time i said i wondered if you had any plans once youve retired he hesitated i had obviously taken him by surprise ive been offered a job with group as area manager for west yorkshire and how much will they be paying you i asked bluntly it wont be full time he said three days a week to start with he hesitated again twenty thousand a year guaranteed for three years ill pay you a hundred thousand a year but ill expect you to be on the job seven days a week i assume youll be needing a secretary and an assistant that inspector williams whos leaving at the same time as you might well fit the bill so ill also supply you with enough money for backup staff as well as the rent for an office a flicker of respect appeared on the chief superintendents face for the first time he made some more notes on his pad and what would you expect of me in return for such a large sum of money he asked thats simple i expect you to find jeremy alexander this time he didnt hesitate my god he said you really are innocent sir matthew and the governor both tried to convince me you were and if you find him within seven years i added ignoring his comment ill pay a further five hundred thousand into any branch of any bank in the world that you stipulate the midland bradford will suit me just fine he replied its only criminals who find it necessary to retire abroad in any case i have to be in bradford every other saturday afternoon so i can be around to watch city lose hackett rose from his place and looked hard at me for some time one last question mr cooper why seven years because after that period my wife can sell alexanders shares and hell become a multimillionaire overnight the chief superintendent nodded his understanding thank you for asking to see me he said its been a long time since i enjoyed visiting anyone in jail especially someone convicted of murder ill give your offer serious consideration mr cooper and let you know my decision by the end of the week he left without another word hackett wrote to me three days later accepting my offer i didnt have to wait five months for him to start working for me because he handed in his resignation within a fortnight though not before i had agreed to continue his pension contributions and those of the two colleagues he wanted to leave the force and join him having now disposed of all my coopers shares the interest on my deposit account was earning me over four hundred thousand a year and as i was living rentfree hacketts request was a minor consideration i would have shared with you in greater detail everything that happened to me over the following months but during that time i was so preoccupied with briefing hackett that i filled only three pages of my bluelined prison paper i should however mention that i studied several law books to be sure that i fully understood the meaning of the legal term autrefois acquit the next important date in the diary was my appeal hearing matthew at his request i had long ago stopped calling him sir matthew tried valiantly not to show that he was becoming more and more confident of the outcome but i was getting to know him so well that he was no longer able to disguise his true feelings he told me how delighted he was with the makeup of the reviewing panel fair and just he kept repeating later that night he told me with great sadness that his wife victoria had died of cancer a few weeks before a long illness and a blessed release he called it i felt guilty in his presence for the first time over the past eighteen months we had only ever discussed my problems i must have been one of the few prisoners at armley who ever had a bespoke tailor visit him in his cell matthew suggested that i should be fitted with a new suit before i faced the appeal tribunal as i had lost over a stone since i had been in jail when the tailor had finished measuring me and began rolling up his tape i insisted that fingers return his cigarette lighter although i did allow him to keep the cigarettes ten days later i was escorted from my cell at five oclock in the morning my fellow inmates banged their tin mugs against their locked doors the traditional way of indicating to the prison staff that they believed the man leaving for trial was innocent like some great symphony it lifted my soul i was driven to london in a police car accompanied by two prison officers we didnt stop once on the entire journey and arrived in the capital a few minutes after nine i remember looking out of the window and watching the commuters scurrying to their offices to begin the days work any one of them whod glanced at me sitting in the back of the car in my new suit and was unable to spot the handcuffs might have assumed i was a chief inspector at least matthew was waiting for me at the entrance of the old bailey a mountain of papers tucked under each arm i like the suit he said before leading me up some stone steps to the room where my fate would be decided once again i sat impassively in the dock as sir matthew rose from his place to address the three appeal judges his opening statement took him nearly an hour and by now i felt i could have delivered it quite adequately myself though not as eloquently and certainly nowhere near as persuasively he made great play of how jeremy had left all his worldly goods to rosemary who in turn had sold our family house in leeds cashed in all her coopers shares within months of the takeover pushed through a quickie divorce and then disappeared off the face of the earth with an estimated seven million pounds i couldnt help wondering just how much of that jeremy had already got his hands on sir matthew repeatedly reminded the panel of the polices inability to produce a body despite the fact they now seemed to have dug up half of leeds i became more hopeful with each new fact matthew placed before the judges but after he had finished i still had to wait another three days to learn the outcome of their deliberations appeal dismissed reasons reserved matthew travelled up to armley on the friday to tell me why he thought my appeal had been turned down without explanation he felt that the judges must have been divided and needed more time to make it appear as if they were not how much time i asked my hunch is that theyll let you out on license within a few months they were obviously influenced by the polices failure to produce a body unimpressed by the trial judges summing up and impressed by the strength of your case i thanked matthew who for once left the room with a smile on his face you may be wondering what chief superintendent hackett or rather exchief superintendent hackett had been up to while all this was going on he had not been idle inspector williams and constable kenwright had left the force on the same day as he had within a week they had opened up a small office above the constitutional club in bradford and begun their investigations the don reported to me at four oclock every sunday afternoon within a month he had compiled a thick file on the case with detailed dossiers on rosemary jeremy the company and me i spent hours reading through the information he had gathered and was even able to help by filling in a few gaps i quickly came to appreciate why the don was so respected by my fellow inmates he followed up every clue and went down every side road however much it looked like a culdesac because once in a while it turned out to be a highway on the first sunday in october after hackett had been working for four months he told me that he thought he might have located rosemary a woman of her description was living on a small estate in the south of france called villa fleur how did you manage to track her down i asked letter posted by her mother at her local pillarbox the postman kindly allowed me to have a look at the address on the envelope before it proceeded on its way hackett said cant tell you how many hours we had to hang around how many letters weve had to sift through and how many doors weve knocked on in the past four months just to get this one lead mrs kershaw seems to be a compulsive letter writer but this was the first time shes sent one to her daughter by the way he added your wife has reverted to her maiden name calls herself ms kershaw now i nodded not wishing to interrupt him williams flew out to cannes on wednesday and hes holed up in the nearest village posing as a tourist hes already been able to tell us that ms kershaws house is surrounded by a tenfoot stone wall and she has more guard dogs than trees it seems the locals know even less about her than we do but at least its a start i felt for the first time that jeremy alexander might at last have met his match but it was to be another five sundays and five more interim reports before a thin smile appeared on hacketts usually tightlipped face ms kershaw has placed an advertisement in the local paper he informed me it seems shes in need of a new butler at first i thought we should question the old butler at length as soon as hed left but as i couldnt risk anything getting back to her i decided inspector williams would have to apply for his job instead but surely shell realise within moments that hes totally unqualified to do the job not necessarily said hackett his smile broadening you see williams wont be able to leave his present employment with the countess of rutland until hes served a full months notice and in the meantime weve signed him up for a special sixweek course at ivor spencers school for butlers williams has always been a quick learner but what about references by the time rosemary kershaw interviews him hell have a set of references that would impress a duchess i was told you never did anything underhand that is the case when im dealing with honest people mr cooper not when im up against a couple of crooks like this im going to get those two behind bars if its the last thing i do this was not the time to let hackett know that the final chapter of this story as i plotted it did not conclude with jeremy ending up in jail once williams had been put on the shortlist for the position of rosemarys butler i played my own small part in securing him the job rereading over the terms of the proposed contract gave me the idea tell williams to ask for francs a month and five weeks holiday i suggested to hackett when he and matthew visited me the following sunday why asked the exchief superintendent shes only offering and three weeks holiday she can well afford to pay the difference and with references like these i said looking back down at my file she might become suspicious if he asked for anything less matthew smiled and nodded rosemary finally offered williams the job at francs a month with four weeks holiday a year which after fortyeight hours consideration williams accepted but he did not join her for another month by which time he had learnt how to iron newspapers lay place settings with a ruler and tell the difference between a port sherry and liqueur glass i suppose that from the moment williams took up the post as rosemarys butler i expected instant results but as hackett pointed out to me sunday after sunday this was hardly realistic williams has to take his time explained the don he needs to gain her confidence and avoid giving her any reason for the slightest suspicion it once took me five years to nail a drug smuggler who was only living half a mile up the road from me i wanted to remind him that it was me who was stuck in jail and that five days was more like what i had in mind but i knew how hard they were all working on my behalf and tried not to show my impatience within a month williams had supplied us with photographs and life histories of all the staff working on the estate along with descriptions of everyone who visited rosemary even the local priest who came hoping to collect a donation for french aid workers in somalia the cook gabrielle pascal no english excellent cuisine came from marseilles family checked out the gardener jacques reni stupid and not particularly imaginative with the rosebeds local and well known rosemarys personal maid charlotte merieux spoke a little english crafty sexy came from paris still checking her out all the staff had been employed by rosemary since her arrival in the south of france and they appeared to have no connection with each other or with her past life ah said hackett as he studied the picture of rosemarys personal maid i raised an eyebrow i was just thinking about williams being cooped up with charlotte merieux day in and day out and more important night in and night in he explained he would have made superintendent if he hadnt fooled around so much still lets hope this time it turns out to our advantage i lay on my bunk studying the pictures of the staff for hour after hour but they revealed nothing i read and reread the notes on everyone who had ever visited villa fleur but as the weeks went by it looked more and more as if no one from rosemarys past other than her mother knew where she was or if they did they were making no attempts to contact her there was certainly no sign of jeremy alexander i was beginning to fear that she and jeremy might have split up until williams reported that there was a picture of a dark handsome man on a table by the side of rosemarys bed it was inscribed well always be together j during the weeks following my appeal hearing i was constantly interviewed by probation officers social workers and even the prison psychiatrist i struggled to maintain the warm sincere smile that matthew had warned me was so necessary to lubricate the wheels of the bureaucracy it must have been about eleven weeks after my appeal had been turned down that the cell door was thrown open and the senior officer on my corridor announced the governor wants to see you cooper fingers looked suspicious whenever he heard those words it inevitably meant a dose of solitary i could hear my heart beating as i was led down the long corridor to the governors office the prison officer knocked gently on the door before opening it the governor rose from behind his desk thrust out his hand and said im delighted to be the first person to tell you the good news he ushered me into a comfortable chair on the other side of his desk and went over the terms of my release while he was doing this i was served coffee as if we were old friends there was a knock on the door and matthew walked in clutching a sheaf of papers that needed to be signed i rose as he placed them on the desk and without warning he turned round and gave me a bearhug not something i expect he did every day after i had signed the final document matthew asked whats the first thing youll do once they release you im going to buy a gun i told him matteroffactly matthew and the governor burst out laughing the great gate of armley prison was thrown open for me three days later i walked away from the building carrying only the small leather suitcase i had arrived with i didnt look back i hailed a taxi and asked the driver to take me to the station as i had no desire to remain in leeds a moment longer than was necessary i bought a firstclass ticket phoned hackett to warn him i was on my way and boarded the next train for bradford i savoured a british rail breakfast that wasnt served on a tin plate and read a copy of the financial times that had been handed to me by a pretty shop assistant and not a petty criminal no one stared at me but then why should they when i was sitting in a firstclass carriage and dressed in my new suit i glanced at every woman who passed by however she was dressed but they had no way of knowing why when the train pulled into bradford the don and his secretary jenny kenwright were waiting for me on the platform the chief superintendent had rented me a small furnished flat on the outskirts of the city and after i had unpacked not a long job they took me out to lunch the moment the small talk had been dispensed with and jenny had poured me a glass of wine the don asked me a question i hadnt expected now that youre free is it still your wish that we go on looking for jeremy alexander yes i replied without a moments hesitation im even more determined now that i can taste the freedom hes enjoyed for the past three years never forget that man stole my freedom from me along with my wife my company and more than half my possessions oh yes donald i wont rest until i come face to face with jeremy alexander good said the don because williams thinks rosemary is beginning to trust him and might even given time start confiding in him it seems he has made himself indispensable i found a certain irony in the thought of williams pocketing two wage packets simultaneously and of my being responsible for one while rosemary paid the other i asked if there was any news of jeremy nothing to speak of said donald she certainly never phones him from the house and were fairly sure he never attempts to make any direct contact with her but williams has told us that every friday at midday he has to drop her off at the majestic the only hotel in the village she goes inside and doesnt reappear for at least forty minutes he darent follow her because shes given specific instructions that hes to stay with the car and he cant afford to lose this job by disobeying orders i nodded my agreement but that hasnt stopped him having the occasional drink in the hotel bar on his evening off and hes managed to pick up a few snippets of information hes convinced that rosemary uses the time when shes in the hotel to make a longdistance phone call she often drops in at the bank before going on to the majestic and comes out carrying a small packet of coins the barman has told williams that she always uses one of the two phone boxes in the corridor opposite the reception desk she never allows the call to be put through the hotel switchboard always dials direct so how do we discover who shes calling i asked we wait for williams to find an opportunity to use some of those skills he didnt learn at butlers school but how long might that take no way of knowing but williams is due for a spot of leave in a couple of weeks so hell be able to bring us up to date when williams arrived back in bradford at the end of the month i began asking him questions even before he had time to put his suitcase down he was full of interesting information about rosemary and even the smallest detail fascinated me she had put on weight i was pleased she seemed lonely and depressed i was delighted she was spending my money fast i wasnt exactly ecstatic but more to the point williams was convinced that if rosemary had any contact with jeremy alexander it had to be when she visited the hotel every friday and placed that directdial call but he still hadnt worked out how to discover who or where she was phoning by the time williams returned to the south of france a fortnight later i knew more about my exwife than i had ever done when we were married as happens so often in the real world the next move came when i least expected it it must have been about on a monday afternoon when the phone rang donald picked up the receiver and was surprised to hear williamss voice on the other end of the line he switched him on to the squawk box and said all three of us are listening so youd better begin by telling us why youre ringing when its not your day off ive been sacked were williamss opening words playing around with the maid were you was donalds first reaction i only wish chief but im afraid its far more stupid than that i was driving ms kershaw into town this morning when i had to stop at a red light while i was waiting for the lights to change a man crossed the road in front of the car he stopped and stared at me i recognised him immediately and prayed the lights would turn to green before he could place me but he walked back looked at me again and smiled i shook my head at him but he came over to the drivers side tapped on the window and said how are you inspector williams who was it demanded donald neil case remember him chief could i ever forget him neveronthecase neil said donald i might have guessed i didnt acknowledge him of course and as ms kershaw said nothing i thought i might have got away with it but as soon as we arrived back at the house she told me to come and see her in the study and without even asking for an explanation she dismissed me she ordered me to be packed and off the premises within the hour or shed call the local police damn back to square one said donald not quite said williams what do you mean if youre no longer in the house we no longer have a point of contact worse we cant play the butler card again because shes bound to be on her guard from now on i know all that chief said williams but suspecting that i was a policeman caused her to panic and she went straight to her bedroom and made a phone call as i wasnt afraid of being found out any longer i picked up the extension in the corridor and listened in all i heard was a womans voice give a cambridge number and then the phone went dead i assumed rosemary had been expecting someone else to pick up the phone and hung up when she heard a strange voice what was the number donald asked something what do you mean something barked donald as he scribbled the numbers down i didnt have anything to write with chief so i had to rely on my memory i was glad williams couldnt see the expression on the dons face then what happened he demanded i found a pen in a drawer and wrote what i could remember of the number on my hand i picked up the phone again a few moments later and heard a different woman on the line saying the directors not in at the moment but im expecting him back within the hour then i had to hang up quickly because i could hear someone coming along the corridor it was charlotte rosemarys maid she wanted to know why id been sacked i couldnt think of a convincing reply until she accused me of having made a pass at the mistress i let her think that was it and ended up getting a slapped face for my trouble i burst out laughing but the don and jenny showed no reaction then williams asked so what do i do now chief come back to england no said donald stay put for the moment book yourself into the majestic and watch her round the clock let me know if she does anything out of character meanwhile were going to cambridge as soon as weve booked ourselves into a hotel there ill call you understood sir said williams and rang off when do we go i asked donald once he had replaced the receiver tonight he replied but not before ive made a few telephone calls the don dialled ten cambridge numbers using the digits williams had been able to jot down and inserting the numbers from nought to nine in the missing slot turned out to be a school sorry wrong number said donald was a chemists shop was a garage was answered by an elderly male voice sorry wrong number donald repeated a newsagent a local policemans wife i tried not to laugh but donald only grunted a womans voice sorry wrong number yet again was st catharines college a womans voice on an answering machine a hairdresser did you want a perm or just a trim donald checked his list it has to be either or the time has come for me to pull a few strings he dialled a bradford number and was told that the new deputy chief constable of cambridgeshire had been transferred from the west yorkshire constabulary the previous year leeke allan leeke said donald without needing to be prompted he turned to me he was a sergeant when i was first made up to inspector he thanked his bradford contact then rang directory enquiries to find out the number of the cambridge police headquarters he dialled another number cambridge police how can i help you asked a female voice can you put me through to the deputy chief constable please donald asked who shall i say is calling donald hackett the next voice that came on the line said don this is a pleasant surprise or at least i hope its a pleasant surprise because knowing you it wont be a social call are you looking for a job by any chance i heard youd left the force yes its true ive resigned but im not looking for a job allan i dont think the cambridge constabulary could quite match my present salary so what can i do for you don i need a trace done on three numbers in the cambridge area authorised asked the deputy chief constable no but it might well lead to an arrest on your patch said donald that and the fact that its you whos asking is good enough for me donald read out the three numbers and leeke asked him to hang on for a moment while we waited donald told me all they have to do is press a few buttons in the control room and the numbers will appear on a screen in front of him things have changed since i first joined the force in those days we had to let our legs do the walking the deputy chief constables voice came back on the line right the first numbers come up is a wing commander danverssmith hes the only person registered as living in the house he read out an address in great shelford which he explained was just to the south of cambridge jenny wrote the details down is a professor and mrs balcescu also living in great shelford is dame julia renaud the opera singer she lives in grantchester we know her quite well shes hardly ever at home because of her concert commitments all over the world her house has been burgled three times in the last year always when she was abroad thank you said donald youve been most helpful anything you want to tell me asked the deputy chief constable sounding hopeful not at the moment replied donald but as soon as ive finished my investigation i promise youll be the first person to be informed fair enough came back the reply and the line went dead right donald said turning his attention back to us we leave for cambridge in a couple of hours that will give us enough time to pack and for jenny to book us into a hotel near the city centre well meet back here at he checked his watch six oclock he walked out of the room without uttering another word i remember thinking that my father would have got on well with him just over two hours later jenny was driving us at a steady sixtynine miles per hour down the a now the boring part of detective work begins said donald intense research followed by hours of surveillance i think we can safely ignore dame julia jenny you get to work on the wing commander i want details of his career from the day he left school to the day he retired first thing tomorrow you can begin by contacting raf college cranwell and asking for details of his service record ill take the professor and make a start in the university library what do i do i asked for the time being mr cooper you keep yourself well out of sight its just possible that the wing commander or the professor might lead us to alexander so we dont need you trampling over any suspects and frightening them off i reluctantly agreed later that night i settled into a suite at the garden house hotel a more refined sort of prison but despite feather pillows and a comfortable mattress i was quite unable to sleep i rose early the next morning and spent most of the day watching endless updates on sky news episodes of various australian soaps and a film of the week every two hours but my mind was continually switching between raf cranwell and the university library when we met up in donalds room that evening he and jenny confirmed that their initial research suggested that both men were who they purported to be i was sure one of them would turn out to be jeremy i said unable to hide my disappointment it would be nice if it was always that easy mr cooper said donald but it doesnt mean that one of them wont lead us to jeremy he turned to jenny first lets go over what you found out about the wing commander wing commander danverssmith dfc graduated from cranwell in served with number two squadron at binbrook in lincolnshire during the second world war and flew several missions over germany and occupied france he was awarded the dfc for gallantry in he was grounded in and became an instructor at raf cottesmore in gloucestershire his final posting was as deputy commanding officer at raf locking in somerset he retired in when he and his wife moved back to great shelford where he had grown up whys he living on his own now asked donald wife died three years ago he has two children sam and pamela both married but neither living in the area they visit him occasionally i wanted to ask jenny how she had been able to find out so much information about the wing commander in such a short time but said nothing as i was more interested in hearing what the don had discovered about professor balcescu donald picked up a pile of notes that had been lying on the floor by his feet so let me tell you the results of my research into a very distinguished professor he began professor balcescu escaped from romania in after ceausescu had had him placed under house arrest he was smuggled out of the country by a group of dissident students via bulgaria and then on into greece his escape was well documented in the newspapers at the time he applied for asylum in england and was offered a teaching post at gonville and caius college cambridge and three years later the chair of eastern european studies he advises the government on romanian matters and has written a scholarly book on the subject last year he was awarded a cbe in the queens birthday honours how could either of these men possibly know rosemary i asked williams must have made a mistake when he wrote down the number williams doesnt make mistakes mr cooper said the don otherwise i wouldnt have employed him your wife dialled one of those numbers and were just going to have to find out which one this time well need your assistance i mumbled an apology but remained unconvinced hackett nodded curtly and turned back to jenny how long will it take us to get to the wing commanders home about fifteen minutes sir he lives in a cottage in great shelford just south of cambridge right well start with him ill see you both in the lobby at five oclock tomorrow morning i slept fitfully again that night now convinced that we were embarked on a wildgoose chase but at least i was going to be allowed to join them the following day instead of being confined to my room and yet more australian soaps i didnt need my alarm call i was already showering when the phone went a few minutes after five the three of us walked out of the hotel trying not to look as if we were hoping to leave without paying our bill it was a chilly morning and i shivered as i climbed into the back of the car jenny drove us out of the city and onto the london road after a mile or so she turned left and took us into a charming little village with neat wellkept houses on either side of the road we passed a garden centre on the left and drove another half mile then jenny suddenly swung the car round and reversed into a layby she switched off the engine and pointed to a small house with an rafblue door thats where he lives she said number fortyseven donald focused a tiny pair of binoculars on the house some earlymorning risers were already leaving their homes cars heading towards the station for the first commuter train to london the paperboy turned out to be an old lady who pushed her heavilyladen bicycle slowly round the village dropping off her deliveries the milkman was next clattering along in his electric van two pints here a pint there the occasional halfdozen eggs or carton of orange juice left on front doorsteps lights began to flick on all over the village the wing commander has had one pint of redtop milk and a copy of the daily telegraph delivered to his front door said donald people had emerged from the houses on either side of number fortyseven before a light appeared in an upstairs room of the wing commanders home once that light had been switched on donald sat bolt upright his eyes never leaving the house i became bored and dozed off in the back at some point when i woke up i hoped we might at least be allowed a break for breakfast but such mundane considerations didnt seem to worry the two professionals in the front they continued to concentrate on any movement that took place around number fortyseven and hardly exchanged a word at a thin elderly man dressed in a harris tweed jacket and grey flannels emerged from number fortyseven and marched briskly down the path all i could see at that distance was a huge bushy white moustache it looked almost as if his whole body had been designed around it donald kept the glasses trained on him ever seen him before he asked passing the binoculars back to me i focused the glasses on the wing commander and studied him carefully never i said as he came to a halt by the side of a battered old austin allegro how could anyone forget that moustache it certainly wasnt grown last week said donald as danverssmith eased his car out onto the main road jenny cursed i thought that if he used his car the odds would be on him heading into cambridge she deftly performed a threepoint turn and accelerated quickly after the wing commander within a few minutes she was only a couple of cars behind him danverssmith was not proving to be the sort of fellow who habitually broke the speed limit his days as a test pilot are obviously long behind him donald said as we trailed the allegro at a safe distance into the next village about half a mile later he pulled into a petrol station stay with him said donald jenny followed the allegro into the forecourt and came to a halt at the pump directly behind danverssmith keep your head down mr cooper said the don opening his door we dont want him seeing you what are you going to do i asked peeping between the front seats risk an old cons trick donald replied he stepped out of the front seat walked round to the back of the car and unscrewed the petrol cap just as the wing commander slipped the nozzle of a petrol pump into the tank of his allegro donald began slowly topping up our already full tank then suddenly turned to face the old man wing commander danverssmith he asked in a plummy voice the wing commander looked up immediately and a puzzled expression came over his weatherbeaten face baker sir said donald flight lieutenant baker you lectured me at raf locking vulcans if i remember bloody good memory baker good show said danverssmith delighted to see you old chap he said taking the nozzle out of his car and replacing it in the pump what are you up to nowadays jenny stifled a laugh work for ba sir grounded after i failed my eye test bloody desk job im afraid but it was the only offer i got bad luck old chap said the wing commander as they headed off towards the pay booth and out of earshot when they came back a few minutes later they were chattering away like old chums and the wing commander actually had his arm round donalds shoulder when they reached his car they shook hands and i heard donald say goodbye sir before danverssmith climbed into his allegro the old airman pulled out of the forecourt and headed back towards his home donald got in next to jenny and pulled the passenger door closed im afraid he wont lead us to alexander the don said with a sigh danverssmith is the genuine article misses his wife doesnt see his children enough and feels a bit lonely even asked if id like to drop in for a bite of lunch why didnt you accept i asked donald paused i would have done but when i mentioned that i was from leeds he told me hed only been there once in his life to watch a test match no that man has never heard of rosemary cooper or jeremy alexander id bet my pension on it so now its the turn of the professor lets head back towards cambridge jenny and drive slowly i dont want to catch up with the wing commander or well all end up having to join him for lunch jenny swung the car across the road and into the far lane then headed back towards the city after a couple of miles donald told her to pull into the side of the road just past a sign announcing the shelford rugby club the professor and his wife live behind that hedge donald said pointing across the road settle back mr cooper this might take some time at jenny went off to get some fish and chips from the village i devoured them hungrily by three i was bored stiff again and was beginning to wonder just how long donald would hang around before we were allowed to return to the hotel i remembered happy days would be on at well sit here all night if necessary donald said as if he were reading my thoughts fortynine hours is my record without sleep whats yours jenny he asked never taking his eyes off the house thirtyone sir she replied then this may be your chance to break that record he said a moment later a woman in a white bmw nosed out of the driveway leading to the house and stopped at the edge of the pavement she paused looked both ways then turned across the road and swung right in the direction of cambridge as she passed us i caught a glimpse of a blonde with a pretty face ive seen her before i blurted out follow her jenny donald said sharply but keep your distance he turned round to face me where have you seen her he asked passing over the binoculars i cant remember i said trying to focus on the back of a mop of fair curly hair think man think its our best chance yet said donald trying not to sound as if he was crossexamining an old lag i knew i had come across that face somewhere though i felt certain we had never met i had to rack my brains because it was at least five years since i had seen any woman i recognised let alone one that striking but my mind remained blank keep on thinking said the don while i try to find out something a little more simple and jenny dont get too close to her never forget shes got a rearview mirror mr cooper may not remember her but she may remember him donald picked up the carphone and jabbed in ten numbers lets pray he doesnt realise ive retired he mumbled dvla swansea how can i help you sergeant crann please said donald ill put you through dave crann donald hackett good afternoon chief superintendent how can i help you white bmw k sce said donald staring at the car in front of him hold on please sir i wont be a moment donald kept his eye fixed on the bmw while he waited it was about thirty yards ahead of us and heading towards a green light jenny accelerated to make sure she wouldnt get trapped if the lights changed and as she shot through an amber light sergeant crann came back on the line weve identified the car sir he said registered owner mrs susan balcescu the kendalls high street great shelford cambridge one endorsement for speeding in a builtup area a thirtypound fine otherwise nothing known thank you sergeant thats most helpful my pleasure sir why should rosemary want to contact the balcescus donald said as he clipped the phone back into place and is she contacting just one of them or both neither of us attempted to answer i think its time to let her go he said a moment later i need to check out several more leads before we risk coming face to face with either of them lets head back to the hotel and consider our next move i know its only a coincidence i ventured but when i knew him jeremy had a white bmw f bzk said jenny i remember it from the file donald swung round some people cant give up smoking you know others drinking but with some its a particular make of car he said although a lot of people must drive white bmws he muttered almost to himself once we were back in donalds room he began checking through the file he had put together on professor balcescu the times report of his escape from romania he told us was the most detailed professor balcescu first came to prominence while still a student at the university of bucharest where he called for the overthrow of the elected government the authorities seemed relieved when he was offered a place at oxford and must have hoped that they had seen the last of him but he returned to bucharest university three years later taking up the position of tutor in politics the following year he led a student revolt in support of nicolae ceausescu and after he became president balcescu was rewarded with a cabinet post as minister of education but he soon became disillusioned with the ceausescu regime and within eighteen months he had resigned and returned to the university as a humble tutor three years later he was offered the chair of politics and economics professor balcescus growing disillusionment with the government finally turned to anger and in he began writing a series of pamphlets denouncing ceausescu and his puppet regime a few weeks after a particularly vitriolic attack on the establishment he was dismissed from his post at the university and later placed under house arrest a group of oxford historians wrote a letter of protest to the times but nothing more was heard of the great scholar for several years then late in he was smuggled out of romania by a group of students finally reaching britain via bulgaria and greece cambridge won the battle of the universities to tempt him with a teaching post and he became a fellow of gonville and caius in september in november after the retirement of sir halford mckay balcescu took over the chair of eastern european studies donald looked up theres a picture of him taken when he was in greece but its too blurred to be of much use i studied the blackandwhite photograph of a bearded middleaged man surrounded by students he wasnt anything like jeremy i frowned another blind alley i said its beginning to look like it said donald especially after what i found out yesterday according to his secretary balcescu delivers his weekly lecture every friday morning from ten oclock to eleven but that wouldnt stop him from taking a call from rosemary at midday interrupted jenny if youll allow me to finish said hackett sharply jenny bowed her head and he continued at twelve oclock he chairs a full departmental meeting in his office attended by all members of staff im sure youll agree jenny that it would be quite difficult for him to take a personal call at that time every friday given the circumstances donald turned to me im sorry to say were back where we started unless you can remember where youve seen mrs balcescu i shook my head perhaps i was mistaken i admitted donald and jenny spent the next few hours going over the files even checking every one of the ten phone numbers a second time do you remember rosemarys second call sir said jenny in desperation the directors not in at the moment might that be the clue were looking for possibly said donald if we could find out who the director is we might be a step nearer to jeremy alexander i remember jennys last words before i left for my room i wonder how many directors there are in britain chief over breakfast in donalds room the following morning he reviewed all the intelligence that had been gathered to date but none of us felt we were any nearer to a solution what about mrs balcescu i said she may be the person taking the call every friday at midday because thats the one time she knows exactly where her husband is i agree but is she simply rosemarys messenger or is she a friend of jeremys asked donald perhaps well have to tap her phone to find out said jenny donald ignored her comment and checked his watch its time to go to balcescus lecture why are we bothering i asked surely we ought to be concentrating on mrs balcescu youre probably right said donald but we cant afford to leave any stone unturned and as his next lecture wont be for another week we may as well get it over with in any case well be out by eleven and if we find mrs balcescus phone is engaged between twelve and twelve thirty after donald had asked jenny to bring the car round to the front of the hotel i slipped back into my room to pick up something that had been hidden in the bottom of my suitcase for several weeks a few minutes later i joined them and jenny drove us out of the hotel carpark turning right into the main road donald glanced at me suspiciously in the rearview mirror as i sat silently in the back did i look guilty i wondered jenny spotted a parking meter a couple of hundred yards away from the department of european studies and pulled in we got out of the car and followed the flow of students along the pavement and up the steps no one gave us a second look once we had entered the building donald whipped off his tie and slipped it in his jacket pocket he looked more like a marxist revolutionary than most of the people heading towards the lecture the lecture theatre was clearly signposted and we entered it by a door on the ground floor which turned out to be the only way in or out donald immediately walked up the raked auditorium to the back row of seats jenny and i followed and donald instructed me to sit behind a student who looked as if he spent his saturday afternoons playing lock forward for his college rugby team while we waited for balcescu to enter the room i began to look around the lecture theatre was a large semicircle not unlike a miniature greek amphitheatre and i estimated that it could hold around three hundred students by the time the clock on the front wall read there was hardly a seat to be found no further proof was needed of the professors reputation i felt a light sweat forming on my forehead as i waited for balcescu to make his entrance as the clock struck ten the door of the lecture theatre opened i was so disappointed at the sight that greeted me that i groaned aloud he couldnt have been less like jeremy i leaned across to donald wrongcoloured hair wrongcoloured eyes about thirty pounds too light the don showed no reaction so the connection has to be with mrs balcescu whispered jenny agreed said donald under his breath but were stuck here for the next hour because we certainly cant risk drawing attention to ourselves by walking out well just have to make a dash for it as soon as the lecture is over well still have time to see if shes at home to take the twelve oclock call he paused i should have checked the layout of the building earlier jenny reddened slightly because she knew i meant you and then i suddenly remembered where i had seen mrs balcescu i was about to tell donald but the room fell silent as the professor began delivering his opening words this is the sixth of eight lectures he began on recent social and economic trends in eastern europe in a thick central european accent he launched into a discourse that sounded as if he had given it many times before the undergraduates began scribbling away on their pads but i became increasingly irritated by the continual drone of the professors nasal vowels as i was impatient to tell hackett about mrs balcescu and to get back to great shelford as quickly as possible i found myself glancing up at the clock on the wall every few minutes not unlike my own schooldays i thought i touched my jacket pocket it was still there even though on this occasion it would serve no useful purpose halfway through the lecture the lights were dimmed so the professor could illustrate some of his points with slides i glanced at the first few graphs as they appeared on the screen showing different income groups across eastern europe related to their balance of payments and export figures but i ended up none the wiser and not just because i had missed the first five lectures the assistant in charge of the projector managed to get one of the slides upside down showing germany bottom of the export table and romania top which caused a light ripple of laughter throughout the theatre the professor scowled and began to deliver his lecture at a faster and faster pace which only caused the assistant more difficulty in finding the right slides to coincide with the professors statements once again i became bored and i was relieved when at five to eleven balcescu called for the final graph the previous one was replaced by a blank screen everyone began looking round at the assistant who was searching desperately for the slide the professor became irritable as the minute hand of the clock approached eleven still the assistant failed to locate the missing slide he flicked the shutter back once again but nothing appeared on the screen leaving the professor brightly illuminated by a beam of light balcescu stepped forward and began drumming his fingers impatiently on the wooden lectern then he turned sideways and i caught his profile for the first time there was a small scar above his right eye which must have faded over the years but in the bright light of the beam it was clear to see its him i whispered to donald as the clock struck eleven the lights came up and the professor quickly left the lecture theatre without another word i leapt over the back of my bench seat and began charging down the gangway but my progress was impeded by students who were already sauntering out into the aisle i pushed my way past them until i had reached ground level and bolted through the door by which the professor had left so abruptly i spotted him at the end of the corridor he was opening another door and disappeared out of sight i ran after him dodging in and out of the chattering students when i reached the door that had just been closed behind him i looked up at the sign professor balcescu director of european studies i threw the door open to discover a woman sitting behind a desk checking some papers another door was closing behind her i need to see professor balcescu immediately i shouted knowing that if i didnt get to him before hackett caught up with me i might lose my resolve the woman stopped what she was doing and looked up at me the director is expecting an overseas call at any moment and cannot be disturbed she replied im sorry but i ran straight past her pulled open the door and rushed into the room where i came face to face with jeremy alexander for the first time since i had left him lying on the floor of my drawing room he was talking animatedly on the phone but he looked up and recognised me immediately when i pulled the gun from my pocket he dropped the receiver as i took aim the blood suddenly drained from his face are you there jeremy asked an agitated voice on the other end of the line despite the passing of time i had no difficulty in recognising rosemarys strident tones jeremy was shouting no richard no i can explain believe me i can explain as donald came running in he came to an abrupt halt by the professors desk but showed no interest in jeremy dont do it richard he pleaded youll only spend the rest of your life regretting it i remember thinking it was the first time he had ever called me richard wrong for a change donald i told him i wont regret killing jeremy alexander you see hes already been pronounced dead once i know because i was sentenced to life imprisonment for his murder im sure youre aware of the meaning of autrefois acquit and will therefore know that i cant be charged a second time with a crime ive already been convicted of and sentenced for even though this time they will have a body i moved the gun a few inches to the right and aimed at jeremys heart i squeezed the trigger just as jenny came charging into the room she dived at my legs jeremy and i both hit the ground with a thud well as i pointed out to you at the beginning of this chronicle i ought to explain why im in jail or to be more accurate why im back in jail i was tried a second time on this occasion for attempted murder despite the fact that i had only grazed the bloody mans shoulder i still blame jenny for that mind you it was worth it just to hear matthews closing speech because he certainly understood the meaning of autrefois acquit he surpassed himself with his description of rosemary as a calculating evil jezebel and jeremy as a man motivated by malice and greed quite willing to cynically pose as a national hero while his victim was rotting his life away in jail put there by a wifes perjured testimony of which he had unquestionably been the mastermind in another four years a furious matthew told the jury they would have been able to pocket several more millions between them this time the jury looked on me with considerable sympathy thou shalt not bear false witness against any man were sir matthews closing words his sonorous tones making him sound like an old testament prophet the tabloids always need a hero and a villain this time they had got themselves a hero and two villains they seemed to have forgotten everything they had printed during the previous trial about the oversexed lorry driver and it would be foolish to suggest that the page after page devoted to every sordid detail of jeremy and rosemarys deception didnt influence the jury they found me guilty of course but only because they werent given any choice in his summing up the judge almost ordered them to do so but the foreman expressed his fellow jurors hope that given the circumstances the judge might consider a lenient sentence mr justice lampton obviously didnt read the tabloids because he lectured me for several minutes and then said i would be sent down for five years matthew was on his feet immediately appealing for clemency on the grounds that i had already served a long sentence this man looks out on the world through a window of tears he told the judge i beseech your lordship not to put bars across that window a second time the applause from the gallery was so thunderous that the judge had to instruct the bailiffs to clear the court before he could respond to sir matthews plea his lordship obviously needs a little time to think matthew explained under his breath as he passed me in the dock after much deliberation in his chambers mr justice lampton settled on three years later that day i was sent to ford open prison after considerable press comment during the next few weeks and what sir matthew described to the court of appeal as my clients unparalleled affliction and exemplary behaviour i ended up only having to serve nine months meanwhile jeremy had been arrested at addenbrookes hospital by allan leeke deputy chief constable of cambridgeshire after three days in a heavily guarded ward he was charged with conspiracy to pervert the course of public justice and transferred to armley prison to await trial he comes before the leeds crown court next month and you can be sure ill be sitting in the gallery following the proceedings every day by the way fingers and the boys gave him a very handsome welcome im told hes lost even more weight than he did trooping backwards and forwards across europe fixing up his new identity rosemary has also been arrested and charged with perjury they didnt grant her bail and donald informs me that french prisons particularly the one in marseilles are less comfortable than armley one of the few disadvantages of living in the south of france shes fighting the extradition order of course but im assured by matthew that she has absolutely no chance of succeeding now weve signed the maastricht treaty i knew something good must come out of that as for mrs balcescu im sure you worked out where id seen her long before i did in the case of regina v alexander and kershaw im told she will be giving evidence on behalf of the crown jeremy made such a simple mistake for a normally calculating and shrewd man in order to protect himself from being identified he put all his worldly goods in his wifes name so the striking blonde ended up with everything and i have a feeling that when it comes to her crossexamination rosemary wont turn out to be all that helpful to jeremy because it slipped his mind to let her know that in between those weekly phone calls he was living with another woman its been difficult to find out much more about the real professor balcescu because since ceausescus downfall no one is quite sure what really happened to the distinguished academic even the romanians believed he had escaped to britain and begun a new life bradford city have been relegated so donald has bought a cottage in the west country and settled down to watch bath play rugby jenny has joined a private detective agency in london but is already complaining about her salary and conditions williams has returned to bradford and decided on an early retirement it was he who pointed out the painfully obvious fact that when its twelve oclock in france its only eleven oclock in britain by the way ive decided to go back to leeds after all coopers went into liquidation as i suspected they would the new management team not proving all that effective when it came to riding out a recession the official receiver was only too delighted to accept my offer of for what remained of the company because no one else was showing the slightest interest in it poor jeremy will get almost nothing for his shares still you should look up the new stock in the ft around the middle of next year and buy yourself a few because theyll be what my father would have called a risk worth taking by the way matthew advises me that ive just given you whats termed as inside information so please dont pass it on as i have no desire to go back to jail for a third time cheap at half the price the stories indicated with an asterisk are based on known incidents some of them embellished with considerable licence the others are the product of my own imagination ja july women are naturally superior to men and mrs consuela rosenheim was no exception victor rosenheim an american banker was consuelas third husband and the gossip columns on both sides of the atlantic were suggesting that like a chain smoker the former colombian model was already searching for her next spouse before she had extracted the last gasp from the old one her first two husbands one an arab the other a jew consuela showed no racial prejudice when it came to signing marriage contracts had not quite left her in a position that would guarantee her financial security once her natural beauty had faded but two more divorce settlements would sort that out with this in mind consuela estimated that she only had another five years before the final vow must be taken the rosenheims flew into london from their home in new york or to be more accurate from their homes in new york consuela had travelled to the airport by chauffeurdriven car from their mansion in the hamptons while her husband had been taken from his wall street office in a second chauffeurdriven car they met up in the concorde lounge at jfk when they had landed at heathrow another limousine transported them to the ritz where they were escorted to their usual suite without any suggestion of having to sign forms or book in the purpose of their trip was twofold mr rosenheim was hoping to take over a small merchant bank that had not benefited from the recession while mrs rosenheim intended to occupy her time looking for a suitable birthday present for herself despite considerable research i have been unable to discover exactly which birthday consuela would officially be celebrating after a sleepless night induced by jetlag victor rosenheim was whisked away to an earlymorning meeting in the city while consuela remained in bed toying with her breakfast she managed one piece of thin unbuttered toast and a stab at a boiled egg once the breakfast tray had been removed consuela made a couple of phone calls to confirm luncheon dates for the two days she would be in london she then disappeared into the bathroom fifty minutes later she emerged from her suite dressed in a pink olaganie suit with a dark blue collar her fair hair bouncing on her shoulders few of the men she passed between the elevator and the revolving doors failed to turn their heads so consuela judged that the previous fifty minutes had not been wasted she stepped out of the hotel and into the morning sun to begin her search for the birthday present consuela began her quest in new bond street as in the past she had no intention of straying more than a few blocks north south east or west from that comforting landmark while a chauffeurdriven car hovered a few yards behind her she spent some time in aspreys considering the latest slimline watches a gold statue of a tiger with jade eyes and a faberge egg before moving on to cartier where she dismissed a crested silver salver a platinum watch and a louis xiv longcase clock from there she walked another few yards to tiffanys which despite a determined salesman who showed her almost everything the shop had to offer she still left emptyhanded consuela stood on the pavement and checked her watch it was and she had to accept that it had been a fruitless morning she instructed her chauffeur to drive her to harrys bar where she found mrs stavros kleanthis waiting for her at their usual table consuela greeted her friend with a kiss on both cheeks and took the seat opposite her mrs kleanthis the wife of a not unknown shipowner the greeks preferring one wife and several liaisons had for the last few minutes been concentrating her attention on the menu to be sure that the restaurant served the few dishes that her latest diet would permit between them the two women had read every book that had reached number one on the new york times bestseller list which included the words youth orgasm slimming fitness or immortality in its title hows victor asked maria once she and consuela had ordered their meals consuela paused to consider her response and decided on the truth fast reaching his sellby date she replied and stavros well past his im afraid said maria but as i have neither your looks nor your figure not to mention the fact that i have three teenage children i dont suppose ill be returning to the market to select the latest brand consuela smiled as a salade ni√ßoise was placed in front of her so what brings you to london other than to have lunch with an old friend asked maria victor has his eye on another bank replied consuela as if she were discussing a child who collected stamps and im in search of a suitable birthday present and what are you expecting victor to come up with this time asked maria a house in the country a thoroughbred racehorse or perhaps your own lear jet none of the above said consuela placing her fork by the halffinished salad i need something that cant be bargained over at a future date so my gift must be one that any court in any state will acknowledge is unquestionably mine have you found anything appropriate yet asked maria not yet admitted consuela aspreys yielded nothing of interest cartiers cupboard was almost bare and the only attractive thing in tiffanys was the salesman who was undoubtedly penniless i shall have to continue my search this afternoon the salad plates were deftly removed by a waiter whom maria considered far too young and far too thin another waiter with the same problem poured them both a cup of fresh decaffeinated coffee consuela refused the proffered cream and sugar though her companion was not quite so disciplined the two ladies grumbled on about the sacrifices they were having to make because of the recession until they were the only diners left in the room at this point a fatter waiter presented them with the bill an extraordinarily long ledger considering that neither of them had ordered a second course or had requested more than evian from the wine waiter on the pavement of south audley street they kissed again on both cheeks before going their separate ways one to the east and the other to the west consuela climbed into the back of her chauffeurdriven car in order to be returned to new bond street a distance of no more than half a mile once she was back on familiar territory she began to work her way steadily down the other side of the street stopping at bentleys where it appeared that they hadnt sold anything since last year and moving rapidly on to adler who seemed to be suffering from much the same problem she cursed the recession once again and blamed it all on bill clinton who victor had assured her was the cause of most of the worlds current problems consuela was beginning to despair of finding anything worthwhile in bond street and reluctantly began her journey back towards the ritz feeling she might even have to consider an expedition to knightsbridge the following day when she came to a sudden halt outside the house of graff consuela could not recall the shop from her last visit to london some six months before and as she knew bond street better than she had ever known any of her three husbands she concluded that it must be a new establishment she gazed at the stunning gems in their magnificent settings heavily protected behind the bulletproof windows when she reached the third window her mouth opened wide like a newborn chick demanding to be fed from that moment she knew that no further excursions would be necessary for there hanging round a slender marble neck was a peerless diamond and ruby necklace she felt that she had seen the magnificent piece of jewellery somewhere before but she quickly dismissed the thought from her mind and continued to study the exquisitely set rubies surrounded by perfectly cut diamonds making up a necklace of unparalleled beauty without giving a moments thought to how much the object might cost consuela walked slowly towards the thick glass door at the entrance to the shop and pressed a discreet ivory button on the wall the house of graff obviously had no interest in passing trade the door was unlocked by a security officer who needed no more than a glance at mrs rosenheim to know that he should usher her quickly through to the inner portals where a second door was opened and consuela came face to face with a tall imposing man in a long black coat and pinstriped trousers good morning madam he said bowing slightly consuela noticed that he surreptitiously admired her rings as he did so can i be of assistance although the room was full of treasures that might in normal circumstances have deserved hours of her attention consuelas mind was focused on only one object yes i would like to study more closely the diamond and ruby necklace on display in the third window certainly madam the manager replied pulling back a chair for his customer he nodded almost imperceptibly to an assistant who silently walked over to the window unlocked a little door and extracted the necklace the manager slipped behind the counter and pressed a concealed button four floors above a slight burr sounded in the private office of mr laurence graff warning the proprietor that a customer had enquired after a particularly expensive item and that he might wish to deal with them personally laurence graff glanced up at the television screen on the wall to his left which showed him what was taking place on the ground ah he said once he saw the lady in the pink suit seated at the louis xiv table mrs consuela rosenheim if im not mistaken just as the speaker of the house of commons can identify every one of its members so laurence graff recognised the customers who might be able to afford the most extravagant of his treasures he quickly stepped from behind his desk walked out of his office and took the waiting lift to the ground floor meanwhile the manager had laid out a black velvet cloth on the table in front of mrs rosenheim and the assistant placed the necklace delicately on top of it consuela stared down at the object of her desire mesmerised good morning mrs rosenheim said laurence graff as he stepped out of the lift and walked across the thick pile carpet towards his wouldbe customer how nice to see you again he had in truth only seen her once before at a shouldertoshoulder cocktail party in manhattan but after that he could have spotted her at a hundred paces on a moving escalator good morning mr consuela hesitated feeling unsure of herself for the first time that day laurence graff he said offering his hand we met at sotheby parke benett last year a charity function in aid of the red cross if i remember correctly of course said mrs rosenheim unable to recall him or the occasion mr graff bowed reverently towards the diamond and ruby necklace the kanemarra heirloom he purred then paused before taking the managers place at the table fashioned in by silvio di larchi he continued all the rubies were extracted from a single mine in burma over a period of twenty years the diamonds were purchased from de beers by an egyptian merchant who after the necklace had been made up for him offered the unique piece to king farouk for services rendered when the monarch married princess farida he presented it to her on their wedding day and she in return bore him four heirs none of whom alas was destined to succeed to the throne graff looked up from one object of beauty and gazed on another since then it has passed through several hands before arriving at the house of graff continued the proprietor its most recent owner was an actress whose husbands oil wells unfortunately dried up the flicker of a smile crossed the face of consuela rosenheim as she finally recalled where she had previously seen the necklace quite magnificent she said giving it one final look i will be back she added as she rose from her chair graff accompanied her to the door nine out of ten customers who make such a claim have no intention of returning but he could always sense the tenth may i ask the price consuela asked indifferently as he held the door open for her one million pounds madam graff replied as casually as if she had enquired about the cost of a plastic keyring at a seaside gift shop once she had reached the pavement consuela dismissed her chauffeur her mind was now working at a speed that would have impressed her husband she slipped across the road calling first at the white house then yves saint laurent and finally at chanel emerging some two hours later with all the weapons she required for the battle that lay ahead she did not arrive back at her suite at the ritz until a few minutes before six consuela was relieved to find that her husband had not yet returned from the bank she used the time to take a long bath and to contemplate how the trap should be set once she was dry and powdered she dabbed a suggestion of a new scent on her neck then slipped into some of her newly acquired clothes she was checking herself once again in the fulllength mirror when victor entered the room he stopped on the spot dropping his briefcase on the carpet consuela turned to face him you look stunning he declared with the same look of desire she had lavished on the kanemarra heirloom a few hours before thank you darling she replied and how did your day go a triumph the takeover has been agreed and at half the price it would have cost me only a year ago consuela smiled an unexpected bonus those of us who are still in possession of cash need have no fear of the recession victor added with satisfaction over a quiet supper in the ritzs dining room victor described to his wife in great detail what had taken place at the bank that day during the occasional break in this monologue consuela indulged her husband by remarking how clever of you victor how amazing how you managed it i will never understand when he finally ordered a large brandy lit a cigar and leaned back in his chair she began to run her elegantly stockinged right foot gently along the inside of his thigh for the first time that evening victor stopped thinking about the takeover as they left the dining room and strolled towards the lift victor placed an arm around his wifes slim waist by the time the lift had reached the sixth floor he had already taken off his jacket and his hand had slipped a few inches further down consuela giggled long before they had reached the door of their suite he had begun tugging off his tie when they entered the room consuela placed the do not disturb sign on the outside doorknob for the next few minutes victor was transfixed to the spot as he watched his slim wife slowly remove each garment she had purchased that afternoon he quickly pulled off his own clothes and wished once again that he had carried out his new years resolution forty minutes later victor lay exhausted on the bed after a few moments of sighing he began to snore consuela pulled the sheet over their naked bodies but her eyes remained wide open she was already going over the next step in her plan victor awoke the following morning to discover his wifes hand gently stroking the inside of his leg he rolled over to face her the memory of the previous night still vivid in his mind they made love a second time something they had not done for as long as he could recall it was not until he stepped out of the shower that victor remembered it was his wifes birthday and that he had promised to spend the morning with her selecting a gift he only hoped that her eye had already settled on something she wanted as he needed to spend most of the day closeted in the city with his lawyers going over the offer document line by line happy birthday darling he said as he padded back into the bedroom by the way did you have any luck finding a present he added as he scanned the front page of the financial times the city editor was already speculating on the possible takeover describing it as a coup a smile of satisfaction appeared on victors face for the second time that morning yes my darling consuela replied i did come across one little bauble that i rather liked i just hope it isnt too expensive and how much is this little bauble victor asked consuela turned to face him she was wearing only two garments both of them black and both of them remarkably skimpy victor started to wonder if he still had the time but then he remembered the lawyers who had been up all night and would be waiting patiently for him at the bank i didnt ask the price consuela replied youre so much cleverer than i am at that sort of thing she added as she slipped into a navy silk blouse victor glanced at his watch how far away is it he asked just across the road in bond street my darling consuela replied i shouldnt have to delay you for too long she knew exactly what was going through her husbands mind good then lets go and look at this little bauble without delay he said as he did up the buttons on his shirt while victor finished dressing consuela with the help of the financial times skilfully guided the conversation back to his triumph of the previous day she listened once more to the details of the takeover as they left the hotel and strolled up bond street together arm in arm probably saved myself several million he told her yet again consuela smiled as she led him to the door of the house of graff several million she gasped how clever you are victor the security guard quickly opened the door and this time consuela found that mr graff was already standing by the table waiting for her he bowed low then turned to victor may i offer my congratulations on your brilliant coup mr rosenheim victor smiled how may i help you my husband would like to see the kanemarra heirloom said consuela before victor had a chance to reply of course madam said the proprietor he stepped behind the table and spread out the black velvet cloth once again the assistant removed the magnificent necklace from its stand in the third window and carefully laid it out on the centre of the velvet cloth to show the jewels to their best advantage mr graff was about to embark on the pieces history when victor simply said how much is it mr graff raised his head this is no ordinary piece of jewellery i feel how much repeated victor its provenance alone warrants how much the sheer beauty not to mention the craftsmanship involved how much asked victor his voice now rising the word unique would not be inappropriate you may be right but i still need to know how much its going to cost me said victor who was beginning to sound exasperated one million pounds sir graff said in an even tone aware that he could not risk another superlative ill settle at half a million no more came back the immediate reply i am sorry to say sir said graff that with this particular piece there is no room for bargaining theres always room for bargaining whatever one is selling said victor i repeat my offer half a million i fear that in this case sir i feel confident that youll see things my way given time said victor but i dont have that much time to spare this morning so ill write out a cheque for half a million and leave you to decide whether you wish to cash it or not i fear you are wasting your time sir said graff i cannot let the kanemarra heirloom go for less than one million victor took out a chequebook from his inside pocket unscrewed the top of his fountain pen and wrote out the words five hundred thousand pounds only below the name of the bank that bore his name his wife took a discreet pace backwards graff was about to repeat his previous comment when he glanced up and observed mrs rosenheim silently pleading with him to accept the cheque a look of curiosity came over his face as consuela continued her urgent mime victor tore out the cheque and left it on the table ill give you twentyfour hours to decide he said we return to new york tomorrow morning with or without the kanemarra heirloom its your decision graff left the cheque on the table as he accompanied mr and mrs rosenheim to the front door and bowed them out onto bond street you were brilliant my darling said consuela as the chauffeur opened the car door for his master the bank rosenheim instructed as he fell into the back seat youll have your little bauble consuela hell cash the cheque before the twentyfour hours are up of that im sure the chauffeur closed the back door and the window purred down as victor added with a smile happy birthday darling consuela returned his smile and blew him a kiss as the car pulled out into the traffic and edged its way towards piccadilly the morning had not turned out quite as she had planned because she felt unable to agree with her husbands judgement but then she still had twentyfour hours to play with consuela returned to the suite at the ritz undressed took a shower opened another bottle of perfume and slowly began to change into the second outfit she had purchased the previous day before she left the room she turned to the commodities section of the financial times and checked the price of green coffee she emerged from the arlington street entrance of the ritz wearing a doublebreasted navy blue yves saint laurent suit and a widebrimmed red and white hat ignoring her chauffeur she hailed a taxi instructing the driver to take her to a small discreet hotel in knightsbridge fifteen minutes later she entered the foyer with her head bowed and after giving the name of her host to the manager was accompanied to a suite on the fourth floor her luncheon companion stood as she entered the room walked forward kissed her on both cheeks and wished her a happy birthday after an intimate lunch and an even more intimate hour spent in the adjoining room consuelas companion listened to her request and having first checked his watch agreed to accompany her to mayfair he didnt mention to her that he would have to be back in his office by four oclock to take an important call from south america since the downfall of the brazilian president coffee prices had gone through the roof as the car travelled down brompton road consuelas companion telephoned to check the latest spot price of green coffee in new york only her skill in bed had managed to stop him from calling earlier he was pleased to learn that it was up another two cents but not as pleased as she was eleven minutes later the car deposited them outside the house of graff when they entered the shop together arm in arm mr graff didnt so much as raise an eyebrow good afternoon mr carvalho he said i do hope that your estates yielded an abundant crop this year mr carvalho smiled and replied i cannot complain and how may i assist you enquired the proprietor we would like to see the diamond necklace in the third window said consuela without a moments hesitation of course madam said graff as if he were addressing a complete stranger once again the black velvet cloth was laid out on the table and once again the assistant placed the kanemarra heirloom in its centre this time mr graff was allowed to relate its history before carvalho politely enquired after the price one million pounds said graff after a moments hesitation carvalho said im willing to pay half a million this is no ordinary piece of jewellery replied the proprietor i feel possibly not but half a million is my best offer said carvalho the sheer beauty not to mention the craftsmanship involved nevertheless i am not willing to go above half a million the word unique would not be inappropriate half a million and no more insisted carvalho i am sorry to say sir said graff that with this particular piece there is no room for bargaining theres always room for bargaining whatever one is selling the coffee grower insisted i fear that is not true in this case sir you see i suspect you will come to your senses in time said carvalho but regrettably i do not have any time to spare this afternoon i will write out a cheque for half a million pounds and leave you to decide whether you wish to cash it carvalho took a chequebook from his inside pocket unscrewed the top of his fountain pen and wrote out the words five hundred thousand pounds only consuela looked silently on carvalho tore out the cheque and left it on the counter ill give you twentyfour hours to decide i leave for chicago on the early evening flight tomorrow if the cheque has not been presented by the time i reach my office graff bowed his head slightly and left the cheque on the table he accompanied them to the door and bowed again when they stepped out onto the pavement you were brilliant my darling said consuela as the chauffeur opened the car door for his employer the exchange said carvalho turning back to face his mistress he added youll have your necklace before the day is out of that im certain my darling consuela smiled and waved as the car disappeared in the direction of piccadilly and on this occasion she felt able to agree with her lovers judgement once the car had turned the corner she slipped back into the house of graff the proprietor smiled and handed over the smartly wrapped gift he bowed low and simply said happy birthday mrs rosenheim dougie mortimers right arm the stories indicated with an asterisk are based on known incidents some of them embellished with considerable licence the others are the product of my own imagination ja july robert henry kefford iii known to his friends as bob was in bed with a girl called helen when he first heard about dougie mortimers right arm bob was sorry to be leaving cambridge he had spent three glorious years at st johns and although he hadnt read as many books as he had done for his undergraduate degree at the university of chicago he had striven every bit as hard to come head of the river it wasnt unusual for an american to win a rowing blue in the early s but to have stroked a victorious cambridge eight for three years in a row was acknowledged as a first bobs father robert henry kefford ii known to his friends as robert had travelled over to england to watch his son take part in all three races from puthey to mortlake after bob had stroked cambridge to victory for the third time his father told him that he must not return to his native illinois without having presented a memento to the university boat club that they would remember him by and dont forget my boy declared robert henry kefford ii the gift must not be ostentatious better to show that you have made an effort to present them with an object of historic value than give them something that obviously cost a great deal of money the british appreciate that sort of thing bob spent many hours pondering his fathers words but completely failed to come up with any worthwhile ideas after all the cambridge university boat club had more silver cups and trophies than they could possibly display it was on a sunday morning that helen first mentioned the name of dougie mortimer she and bob were lying in each others arms when she started prodding his biceps is this some form of ancient british foreplay that i ought to know about bob asked placing his free arm around helens shoulder certainly not helen replied i was simply trying to discover if your biceps are as big as dougie mortimers as bob had never known a girl talk about another man while he was in bed with her he was unable to think of an immediate response and are they he eventually enquired flexing his muscles hard to tell helen replied ive never actually touched dougies arm only seen it at a distance and where did you come across this magnificent specimen of manhood it hangs over the bar at my dads local in hull doesnt dougie mortimer find that a little painful asked bob laughing doubt if he cares that much said helen after all hes been dead for over sixty years and his arm still hangs above a bar asked bob in disbelief hasnt it begun to smell a bit by now this time it was helens turn to laugh no you yankee fool its a bronze cast of his arm in those days if you were in the university crew for three years in a row they made a cast of your arm to hang in the clubhouse not to mention a card with your picture on it in every packet of players cigarettes ive never seen your picture in a cigarette packet come to think of it said helen as she pulled the sheet over his head did he row for oxford or cambridge asked bob no idea so whats the name of this pub in hull the king william helen replied as bob took his arm from around her shoulder is this american foreplay she asked after a few moments later that morning after helen had left for newnham bob began searching his shelves for a book with a blue cover he dug out his muchthumbed history of the boat race and flicked through the index to discover that there were seven mortimers listed five had rowed for oxford two for cambridge he began to pray as he checked their initials mortimer aj westminster and wadham oxon mortimer ck uppingham and oriel oxon mortimer djt harrow and st catharines cantab mortimer el oundle and magdalen oxon bob turned his attention to mortimer djt biography page and flicked the pages backwards until he reached the entry he sought douglas john townsend mortimer st catharines cambridge stroke he then read the short summary of mortimers rowing career dougie mortimer stroked the cambridge boat to victory in a feat which he repeated in but in when the experts considered cambridge to have one of the finest crews for years the light blues lost to an oxford boat that was regarded as the rank outsider although many explanations were suggested by the press at the time the result of the race remains a mystery to this day mortimer died in bob closed the book and returned it to the shelf assuming the great oarsman must have been killed in the first world war he perched on the end of the bed considering the information he now possessed if he could bring dougie mortimers right arm back to cambridge and present it to the club at the annual blues dinner it would surely be a prize that met his fathers demanding criterion he dressed quickly and went downstairs to the pay phone in the corridor once directory enquiries had given him the four numbers he required he set about trying to remove the next obstacle the first calls he made were to the king william or to be precise the king williams because the directory had supplied him with the numbers of three pubs in hull which bore that name when he was put through to the first he asked does dougie mortimers right arm hang above your counter he couldnt quite make out every word of the broad northern accent that replied but he was left in no doubt that it didnt the second call was answered by a girl who said do you mean that thing thats nailed to the wall above the bar yes i guess that will be it said bob well then this is the pub youre looking for after bob had taken down the address and checked the pubs opening hours he made a third call yes thats possible he was told you can take the to peterborough where youll have to change and catch the for doncaster then change again youll arrive in hull at what about the last train back asked bob change at doncaster and peterborough you should be back in cambridge just after midnight thank you said bob he strolled off to his college for lunch and took a place at the large centre table but proved unusually poor company for those around him he boarded the train to peterborough later that afternoon still thinking about how he could possibly relieve the pub owners of their prize possession at peterborough he jumped out walked across to a waiting train on platform three and climbed aboard still deep in thought when his train pulled into hull a couple of hours later he was no nearer to solving the problem he asked the first taxi on the rank to take him to the king william market place harolds corner or percy street asked the cabbie percy street please replied bob they dont open until seven lad the cabbie told him once he had dropped bob outside the front door bob checked the time twenty minutes to kill he walked down a side street at the back of the pub and stopped to watch some young lads playing football they were using the front walls of two houses on either side of the street as goals and showed amazing accuracy in never hitting any of the windows bob wondered if the game would ever catch on in america he became so captivated by the youngsters skill that they stopped to ask him if he wanted to join in he said no thank you confident that if he did play with them he would be the one person who ended up breaking a window he arrived back outside the king william a few minutes after seven and strolled into the empty pub hoping that no one would pay much attention to him but at six feet four inches and dressed in a doublebreasted blue blazer grey flannels a blue shirt and college tie the three people behind the bar might well have wondered if he had dropped in from another planet he stopped himself from looking above the bar as a young blonde barmaid stepped forward and asked him what he would like a half a pint of your best bitter bob said trying to sound like one of his english friends when they ordered a drink from the college buttery the landlord eyed bob suspiciously as he took his halfpint glass over to a small round table in the corner and sat down quietly on a stool he was pleased when two other men entered the pub so that the landlords attention was distracted bob took a sip of the dark liquid and nearly choked when he had recovered he allowed his eyes to glance above the bar he tried to hide his excitement when he saw the bronze cast of a massive arm embedded in a large piece of varnished wood he thought the object both dreadful and inspiring at the same time his eyes moved down to the bold lettering printed in gold beneath it d j t mortimer st catharines stroke bob kept his eye on the landlord as the pub began to fill up but he soon became aware that it was his wife everyone called her nora who was not only in charge but who did most of the serving when he had finished his drink he made his way over to her end of the bar what can i do for you young man nora asked ill have another thank you said bob an american she said as she pulled the pump and began to refill his glass we dont get many of you lot up ere at least not since the bases closed she placed his halfpint on the counter in front of him so what brings you to ull you do bob replied ignoring his drink nora looked suspiciously at the stranger who was young enough to be her son bob smiled or to be more accurate dougie mortimer does now ive figured you out said nora you phoned this morning didnt you my christie told me i should ave guessed bob nodded how did the arm end up in hull he asked now thats a long story said nora it was my grandfathers wasnt it born in ely e was and e used to spend his holidays fishin the cam said it was the only catch he managed that year which i suppose is one better than sayin it fell off the back of a lorry still when e died a few years back my father wanted to throw the bloody thing out with the rest of the rubbish but i wouldnt ear of it told im e should ang it in the pub didnt i i cleaned and polished it it came up real nice and then i ung it above the bar still its a long way for you to travel just to ave a look at that load of old cobblers bob looked up and admired the arm once again he held his breath i didnt come just to look then why did you come she asked i came to buy get a move on nora said the landlord cant you see there are customers waitin to be served nora swung round and said just old your tongue cyril barnsworth this young mans come all the way up to ull just to see dougie mortimers arm and whats more e wants to buy it this caused a ripple of laughter from the regulars standing nearest to the bar but as nora didnt join in they quickly fell silent then its been a wasted journey asnt it said the landlord because its not for sale its not yours to sell said nora placing her hands on her hips mind you lad es right she said turning back to face bob i wouldnt part with it for a undred quid said nora several others in the room were beginning to show an interest in the proceedings how about two hundred said bob quietly this time nora burst out laughing but bob didnt even smile when nora had stopped laughing she stared directly at the strange young man my god e means it she said i certainly do said bob i would like to see the arm returned to its rightful home in cambridge and im willing to pay two hundred pounds for the privilege the landlord looked across at his wife as if he couldnt believe what he was hearing we could buy that little secondhand car ive had my eye on he said not to mention a summer oliday and a new overcoat for next winter nora added staring at bob as if she still needed to be convinced that he wasnt from another planet suddenly she thrust her hand over the counter and said youve got yourself a deal young man bob ended up having to supply several rounds of drinks for those customers who claimed to have been close personal friends of noras grandfather even if some of them looked rather obviously too young he also had to stay overnight in a local hotel because nora wouldnt part with her grandfathers heirloom as she now kept referring to it until her bank manager had phoned cambridge to check that robert henry kefford iii was good for two hundred pounds bob clung onto his treasure all the way back to cambridge that monday morning and then lugged the heavy object from the station to his digs in the grange road where he hid it under the bed the following day he handed it over to a local furniture restorer who promised to return the arm to its former glory in time for the night of the blues dinner when three weeks later bob was allowed to see the results of the restorers efforts he immediately felt confident that he now possessed a prize not only worthy of the cubc but that also complied with his fathers wishes he resolved not to share his secret with anyone not even helen until the night of the blues dinner although he did warn the puzzled president that he was going to make a presentation and that he required two hooks eighteen inches apart and eight feet from the floor to be screwed into the wall beforehand the university blues dinner is an annual event held in the boat house overlooking the cam any former or current rowing blue is eligible to attend and bob was delighted to find when he arrived that night that it was a nearrecord turnout he placed the carefully wrapped brown paper parcel under his chair and put his camera on the table in front of him because it was his last blues dinner before returning to america bob had been seated at the top table between the honorary secretary and the current president of boats tom adams the honorary secretary had gained his blue some twenty years before and was recognized as the clubs walking encyclopedia because he could name not only everyone in the room but all the great oarsmen of the past tom pointed out to bob three olympic medallists dotted around the room the oldest is sitting on the left of the president he said charles forester he rowed at number three for the club in so he must be over eighty can it be possible said bob recalling foresters youthful picture on the clubhouse wall certainly can said the secretary and whats more young man he added laughing youll look like that one day too what about the man at the far end of the table asked bob he looks even older he is said the secretary thats sidney fisk he was boatman from to with only a break for the first world war took over from his uncle at short notice if i remember correctly so he would have known dougie mortimer said bob wistfully now theres a great name from the past said adams mortimer djt st catharines stroke oh yes fisk would certainly have known mortimer thats for sure come to think of it charles forester must have been in the same boat as mortimer when he was stroke during the meal bob continued to quiz adams about dougie mortimer but he was unable to add a great deal to the entry in bobs history of the boat race other than to confirm that cambridges defeat in still remained a mystery as the light blues demonstrably had the superior crew when the last course had been cleared away the president rose to welcome his guests and to make a short speech bob enjoyed the parts he was able to hear above the noise made by the rowdy undergraduates and even joined in the frenzy whenever oxford was mentioned the president ended with the words there will be a special presentation to the club this year by our colonial stroke bob kefford which im sure were all going to appreciate when bob rose from his place the cheering became even more raucous but he spoke so softly that the noise quickly died away he told his fellow members how he had come to discover and later retrieve dougie mortimers right arm leaving out only his exact location when he first learned of its whereabouts with a flourish he unwrapped the parcel that had been secreted under his chair and revealed the newly restored bronze cast the assembled members rose to their feet and cheered a smile of satisfaction came over bobs face as he looked around only wishing his father could have been present to witness their reaction as his eyes swept the room bob couldnt help noticing that the oldest blue present charles forester had remained seated and was not even joining in the applause bobs gaze then settled on sidney fisk the only other person who had not risen to his feet the old boatmans lips remained fixed in a straight line and his hands didnt move from his knees bob forgot about the two old men when the president assisted by tom adams hung the bronze arm on the wall placing it between a blade that had been pulled by one of the olympic crew of and a zephyr worn by the only blue ever to row in a cambridge boat that had beaten oxford four years in a row bob began to take photographs of the ceremony so that he would have a record to show his father that he had carried out his wishes when the hanging was over many of the members and old blues surrounded bob to thank and congratulate him leaving him in no doubt that all the trouble he had taken to track down the arm had been worthwhile bob was among the last to leave that night because so many members had wanted to wish him good luck for the future he was strolling along the footpath back to his digs humming as he went when he suddenly remembered that he had left his camera on the table he decided to collect it in the morning as he was sure that the clubhouse would be locked and deserted by now but when he turned round to check he saw a single light coming from the ground floor he turned and began walking back towards the clubhouse still humming when he was a few paces away he glanced through the window and saw that there were two figures standing in the committee room he strode over to take a closer look and was surprised to see the elderly blue charles forester and sidney fisk the retired boatman trying to shift a heavy table he would have gone in to assist them if fisk hadnt suddenly pointed up towards dougie mortimers arm bob remained motionless as he watched the two old men drag the table inch by inch nearer to the wall until it was directly below the plaque fisk picked up a chair and placed it against the wall and forester used it as a step to climb onto the table forester then bent down and took the arm of the older man to help him up once they were both safely on the table they held a short conversation before reaching up to the bronze cast easing it off its hooks and slowly lowering it until it rested between their feet forester with the help of the chair stepped back down onto the floor then turned round to assist his companion again bob still didnt move as the two old men carried dougie mortimers arm across the room and out of the boathouse having placed it on the ground outside the door forester returned to switch off the lights when he stepped back outside into the cold night air the boatman quickly padlocked the door once again the two old men held a short conversation before lifting bobs trophy up and stumbling off with it along the towpath they had to stop lower the arm to the ground rest and start again several times bob followed silently in their wake using the broadtrunked trees to conceal himself until the elderly pair suddenly turned and made their way down the bank towards the river they came to a halt at the waters edge and lowered their bounty into a small rowing boat the old blue untied the rope and the two men pushed the boat slowly out into the river until the water was lapping around the knees of their evening dress trousers neither seemed at all concerned about the fact that they were getting soaked forester managed to clamber up into the little boat quite quickly but it took fisk several minutes to join him once they were both aboard forester took his place at the oars while the boatman remained in the bow clutching on to dougie mortimers arm forester began to row steadily towards the middle of the river his progress was slow but his easy rhythm revealed that he had rowed many times before when the two men calculated that they had reached the centre of the cam at its deepest point forester stopped rowing and joined his companion in the bow they picked up the bronze arm and without ceremony cast it over the side and into the river bob heard the splash and saw the boat rock dangerously from side to side fisk then took his turn at the oars his progress back to the riverbank was even slower than foresters they eventually reached land and both men stumbled out and shoved the boat up towards its mooring the boatman finally securing the rope to a large ring soaked and exhausted their breath rising visibly in the clear night air the two old men stood and faced each other they shook hands like two business tycoons who had closed an important deal before disappearing into the night tom adams the clubs honorary secretary rang bob the following morning to tell him something he already knew in fact he had lain awake all night thinking of little else bob listened to adamss account of the breakin whats surprising is that they only took one thing he paused your arm or rather dougies arm its very strange especially as someone had left an expensive camera on the top table is there anything i can do to help asked bob no i dont think so old boy said adams the local police are making enquiries but my bet is that whoever stole the arm will probably be halfway across the county by now i expect youre right said bob while youre on the line mr adams i wonder if i could ask you a question about the history of the club ill do my best said adams but you must remember that its only a hobby for me old chap do you by any chance know who is the oldest living oxford rowing blue there was a long silence the other end of the line are you still there bob asked eventually yes i was just trying to think if old harold deering is still alive i cant remember seeing his obituary in the times deering said bob yes radley and keble he became a bishop if i remember correctly but im damned if i can recall where thank you said bob thats most helpful i could be wrong adams pointed out after all i dont read the obituary columns every day and im a bit rusty when it comes to oxford bob thanked him once again before ringing off after a college lunch he didnt eat bob returned to his digs and rang the porters lodge at keble he was answered by a curmudgeonly voice do you have any record of a harold deering a former member of the college bob asked deering deering said the voice thats a new one on me let me see if hes in the college handbook another long pause during which bob really did begin to think hed been cut off until the voice said good heavens no wonder it was just a bit before my time deering harold ba ma theology became bishop of truro is that the one yes thats the man said bob do you by any chance have an address for him i do said the voice the rt revd harold deering the stone house mill road tewkesbury gloucestershire thank you said bob youve been very helpful bob spent the rest of the afternoon composing a letter to the former bishop in the hope that the old blue might agree to see him he was surprised to receive a call at his digs three days later from a mrs elliot who turned out to be mr deerings daughter with whom he was now living the poor old chap cant see much beyond his nose these days she explained so i had to read your letter out to him but hed be delighted to meet you and wonders if you could call on him this sunday at after matins assuming thats not inconvenient for you thats fine said bob please tell your father to expect me around it has to be in the morning mrs elliot went on to explain because you see he has a tendency to fall asleep after lunch im sure you understand by the way ill send directions to your college on the sunday morning bob was up long before the sun rose and started out on his journey to tewkesbury in a car he had hired the previous day he would have gone by train but british rail didnt seem willing to rise quite early enough for him to reach his destination on time as he journeyed across the cotswolds he tried to remember to keep the car on the left and couldnt help wondering how long it would be before the british started to build some highways with more than one lane he drove into tewkesbury a few minutes after eleven and thanks to mrs elliots clear directions quickly found the stone house he parked the car outside a little wicket gate a woman had opened the door of the house even before bob was halfway up the scrubcovered path it must be mr kefford she declared im susan elliot bob smiled and shook her hand i should warn you mrs elliot explained as she led him towards the front door that youll have to speak up fathers become rather deaf lately and im afraid his memory isnt what it used to be he can recall everything that happened to him at your age but not even the most simple things that i told him yesterday ive had to remind him what time you would be coming this morning she said as they walked through the open door three times im sorry to have put you to so much trouble mrs elliot said bob no trouble at all said mrs elliot as she led him down the corridor the truth is my fathers been rather excited by the thought of an american blue from cambridge coming to visit him after all these years he hasnt stopped talking about it for the past two days hes also curious about why you wanted to see him in the first place she added conspiratorially she led bob into the drawing room where he immediately came face to face with an old man seated in a winged leather chair wrapped in a warm plaid dressing gown and propped up on several cushions his legs covered by a tartan blanket bob found it hard to believe that this frail figure had once been an olympic oarsman is it him the old man asked in a loud voice yes father mrs elliot replied equally loudly its mr kefford hes driven over from cambridge especially to see you bob walked forward and shook the old mans bony outstretched hand good of you to come all this way kefford said the former bishop pulling his blanket up a little higher i appreciate your seeing me sir said bob as mrs elliot directed him to a comfortable chair opposite her father would you care for a cup of tea kefford no thank you sir said bob i really dont want anything as you wish said the old man now i must warn you kefford that my concentration span isnt quite what it used to be so youd better tell me straight away why youve come to see me bob attempted to marshal his thoughts im doing a little research on a cambridge blue who must have rowed around the same time as you sir whats his name asked deering i cant remember them all you know bob looked at him fearing that this was going to turn out to be a wasted journey mortimer dougie mortimer he said djt mortimer the old man responded without hesitation now theres someone you couldnt easily forget one of the finest strokes cambridge ever produced as oxford found out to their cost the old man paused youre not a journalist by any chance no sir its just a personal whim i wanted to find out one or two things about him before i return to america then i will certainly try to help if i can said the old man in a piping voice thank you said bob id actually like to begin at the end if i may by asking if you knew the circumstances of his death there was no response for several moments the old clerics eyelids closed and bob began to wonder if he had fallen asleep not the sort of thing chaps talked about in my day he eventually replied especially with its being against the law at the time dont you know against the law said bob puzzled suicide a bit silly when you think about it the old priest continued even if it is a mortal sin because you cant put someone in jail whos already dead now can you not that it was ever confirmed you understand do you think it might have been connected with cambridge losing the boat race in when they were such clear favourites its possible i suppose said deering hesitating once again i must admit the thought had crossed my mind i took part in that race as you may know he paused again breathing heavily cambridge were the clear favourites and we didnt give ourselves a chance the result was never properly explained i must admit there were a lot of rumours doing the rounds at the time but no proof no proof you understand what wasnt proved asked bob there was another long silence during which bob began to fear that the old man might have thought hed gone too far my turn to ask you a few questions kefford he said eventually of course sir my daughter tells me that youve stroked the winning boat for cambridge three years in a row thats correct sir congratulations my boy but tell me if you had wanted to lose one of those races could you have done so without the rest of the crew being aware of it it was bobs turn to ponder he realised for the first time since he had entered the room that he shouldnt assume that a frail body necessarily indicates a frail mind yes i guess so he eventually said you could always change the stroke rate without warning or even catch a crab as you took the surrey bend heaven knows theres always enough flotsam on the river to make it appear unavoidable bob looked the old man straight in the eye but it would never have crossed my mind that anyone might do so deliberately nor mine said the priest had their cox not taken holy orders im not sure i understand sir said bob no reason you should young man i find nowadays that i think in non sequiturs ill try to be less obscure the cox of the cambridge boat was a chap called bertie partridge he went on to become a parish priest in some outpost called chersfield in rutland probably the only place that would have him he chuckled but when i became bishop of truro he wrote and invited me to address his flock it was such an arduous journey from cornwall to rutland in those days that i could easily have made my excuses but like you i wanted the mystery of the race solved and i thought this might be my only chance bob made no attempt to interrupt fearing he might stop the old mans flow partridge was a bachelor and bachelors get very lonely dont you know if you give them half a chance they love to gossip i stayed overnight which gave him every chance he told me over a long dinner accompanied by a bottle of nonvintage wine that it was well known that mortimer had run up debts all over cambridge not many undergraduates dont you might say but in mortimers case they far exceeded even his potential income i think he rather hoped that his fame and popularity would stop his creditors from pressing their claims not unlike disraeli when he was prime minister he added with another chuckle but in mortimers case one particular shopkeeper who had absolutely no interest in rowing and even less in undergraduates threatened to bankrupt him the week before the boat race a few days after the race had been lost mortimer seemed without explanation to have cleared all his obligations and nothing more was heard of the matter once again the old man paused as if in deep thought bob remained silent still not wishing to distract him the only other thing i can recall is that the bookies made a killing deering said without warning i know that to my personal cost because my tutor lost a fivepound wager and never let me forget that i had told him we didnt have a snowballs chance in hell mind you i was always able to offer that as my excuse for not getting a first he looked up and smiled at his visitor bob sat on the edge of his seat mesmerised by the old mans recollections im grateful for your candour sir he said and you can be assured of my discretion thank you kefford said the old man now almost whispering im only too delighted to have been able to assist you is there anything else i can help you with no thank you sir said bob i think youve covered everything i needed to know bob rose from his chair and as he turned to thank mrs elliot he noticed for the first time a bronze cast of an arm hanging on the far wall below it was printed in gold hrr deering keble bow you must have been a fine oarsman sir no not really said the old blue but i was lucky enough to be in the winning boat three years in a row which wouldnt please a cambridge man like yourself bob laughed perhaps one last question before i leave sir of course kefford did they ever make a bronze of dougie mortimers arm they most certainly did replied the priest but it mysteriously disappeared from your boathouse in a few weeks later the boatman was sacked without explanation caused quite a stir at the time was it known why he was sacked asked bob partridge claimed that when the old boatman got drunk one night he confessed to having dumped mortimers arm in the middle of the cam the old man paused smiled and added best place for it wouldnt you say kefford bob thought about the question for some time wondering how his father would have reacted he then replied simply yes sir best place for it do not pass go the stories indicated with an asterisk are based on known incidents some of them embellished with considerable licence the others are the product of my own imagination ja july may hamid zebari smiled at the thought of his wife shereen driving him to the airport neither of them would have believed it possible five years before when they had first arrived in america as political refugees but since he had begun a new life in the states hamid was beginning to think anything might be possible when will you be coming home papa asked nadim who was strapped safely in the back seat next to his sister may she was too young to understand why papa was going away just a fortnight i promise no more their father replied and when i get back well all go on holiday how long is a fortnight his son demanded fourteen days hamid told him with a laugh and fourteen nights said his wife as she drew into the curb below the sign for turkish airways she touched a button on the dashboard and the boot flicked up hamid jumped out of the car grabbed his luggage from the boot and put it on the pavement before climbing into the back of the car he hugged his daughter first and then his son may was crying not because he was going away but because she always cried when the car came to a sudden halt he allowed her to stroke his bushy moustache which usually stopped the flow of tears fourteen days repeated his son hamid hugged his wife and felt the small swelling of a third child between them well be here waiting to pick you up shereen called out as her husband tipped the skycap on the curb once his six empty cases had been checked in hamid disappeared into the terminal and made his way to the turkish airlines desk as he took the same flight twice a year he didnt need to ask the girl at the ticket counter for directions after he had checked in and been presented with his boarding pass hamid still had an hour to wait before they would call his flight he began the slow trek to gate b it was always the same the turkish airlines plane would be parked halfway back to manhattan as he passed the pan am checkin desk on b he observed that they would be taking off an hour earlier than him a privilege for those who were willing to pay an extra sixtythree dollars when he reached the checkin area a turkish airlines stewardess was slipping the sign for flight new yorklondonistanbul onto a board estimated time of departure the seats were beginning to fill up with the usual cosmopolitan group of passengers turks going home to visit their families those americans taking a holiday who cared about saving sixtythree dollars and businessmen whose bottom line was closely watched by tightfisted accountants hamid strolled over to the restaurant bar and ordered coffee and two eggs sunnyside up with a side order of hash browns it was the little things that reminded him daily of his newfound freedom and of just how much he owed to america would those passengers travelling to istanbul with young children please board the plane now said the stewardess over the loudspeaker hamid swallowed the last mouthful of his hash browns he hadnt yet become accustomed to the american habit of covering everything in ketchup and took a final swig of the weak tasteless coffee he couldnt wait to be reunited with the thick turkish coffee served in small bone china cups but that was a tiny sacrifice when weighed against the privilege of living in a free land he settled his bill and left a dollar in the little tin tray would those passengers seated in rows to please board the aircraft now hamid picked up his briefcase and headed for the passageway that led to flight an official from turkish airlines checked his boarding pass and ushered him through he had been allocated an aisle seat near the back of economy ten more trips he told himself and he would fly pan am business class by then he would be able to afford it whenever the wheels of his plane left the ground hamid would look out of the little window and watch his adopted country as it disappeared out of sight the same thoughts always going through his mind it had been nearly five years since saddam hussein had dismissed him from the iraqi cabinet after he had held the post of minister of agriculture for only two years the wheat crops had been poor that autumn and after the peoples army had taken their share and the middlemen their cut the iraqi people ended up with short rations someone had to take the blame and the obvious scapegoat was the minister of agriculture hamids father a carpet dealer had always wanted him to join the family business and had even warned him before he died not to accept agriculture the last three holders of that office having first been sacked and later disappeared and everyone in iraq knew what disappeared meant but hamid did accept the post the first years crop had been abundant and after all he convinced himself agriculture was only a stepping stone to greater things in any case had not saddam described him in front of the whole revolutionary command council as my good and close friend at thirtytwo you still believe you are immortal hamids father was proved right and hamids only real friend friends melted away like snow in the morning sun when this particular president sacked you helped him to escape the only precaution hamid had taken during his days as a cabinet minister was to withdraw from his bank account each week a little more cash than he actually needed he would then change the extra money into american dollars with a street trader using a different dealer each time and never exchanging enough to arouse suspicion in iraq everyone is a spy the day he was sacked he checked how much was hidden under his mattress it amounted to eleven thousand two hundred and twentyone american dollars the following thursday the day on which the weekend begins in baghdad he and his pregnant wife took the bus to erbil he left his mercedes conspicuously parked in the front drive of his large home in the suburbs and they carried no luggage with them just two passports the roll of dollars secreted in his wifes baggy clothing and some iraqi dinars to get them as far as the border no one would be looking for them on a bus to erbil once they arrived in erbil hamid and his wife took a taxi to sulaimania using most of the remaining dinars to pay the driver they spent the night in a small hotel far from the city centre neither slept as they waited for the morning sun to come shining through the curtainless window next day another bus took them high into the hills of kurdistan arriving in zakho in the early evening the final part of the journey was the slowest of all they were taken up through the hills on mules at a cost of two hundred dollars the young kurdish smuggler showed no interest in iraqi dinars he delivered the former cabinet minister and his wife safely over the border in the early hours of the morning leaving them to make their way on foot to the nearest village on turkish soil they reached kirmizi renga that evening and spent another sleepless night at the local station waiting for the first train for istanbul hamid and shereen slept all the way through the long train journey to the turkish capital and woke up the following morning as refugees the first visit hamid made in the city was to the iz bank where he deposited ten thousand eight hundred dollars the next was to the american embassy where he produced his diplomatic passport and requested political asylum his father had once told him that a recently sacked cabinet minister from iraq was always a good catch for the americans the embassy arranged accommodation for hamid and his wife in a firstclass hotel and immediately informed washington of their little coup they promised hamid that they would get back to him as quickly as possible but gave him no clue as to how long that might take he decided to use the time to visit the carpet bazaars on the south side of the city so often frequented by his father many of the dealers remembered hamids father an honest man who liked to bargain and drink gallons of coffee and who had often talked about his son going into politics they were pleased to make his acquaintance especially when they learned of what he planned to do once he had settled in the states the zebaris were granted american visas within the week and flown to washington at the governments expense which included a charge for excess baggage of twentythree turkish carpets after five days of intensive questioning by the cia hamid was thanked for his cooperation and the useful information he had supplied he was then released to begin his new life in america he his pregnant wife and the twentythree carpets boarded a train for new york it took hamid six weeks to find the right shop on the lower east side of manhattan from which to sell his carpets once he had signed the fiveyear lease shereen immediately set about painting their new americanised name above the door hamid didnt sell his first carpet for nearly three months by which time his meagre savings had all but disappeared but by the end of the first year sixteen of the twentythree carpets had been sold and he realised he would soon have to travel back to istanbul to buy more stock four years had passed since then and the zebaris had recently moved to a larger establishment on the west side with a small apartment above the shop hamid kept telling his wife that this was only the beginning that anything was possible in the united states he now considered himself a fullyfledged american citizen and not just because of the treasured blue passport that confirmed his status he accepted that he could never return to his birthplace while saddam remained its ruler his home and possessions had long ago been requisitioned by the iraqi state and the death sentence had been passed on him in his absence he doubted if he would ever see baghdad again after the stopover in london the plane landed at istanbuls ataturk airport a few minutes ahead of schedule hamid booked into his usual small hotel and planned how best to allocate his time over the next two weeks he was happy to be back among the hustle and bustle of the turkish capital there were thirtyone dealers he wanted to visit because this time he hoped to return to new york with at least sixty carpets that would require fourteen days of drinking thick turkish coffee and many hours of bargaining as a dealers opening price would be three times as much as hamid was willing to pay or what the dealer really expected to receive but there was no short cut in the bartering process which like his father hamid secretly enjoyed by the end of the fortnight hamid had purchased fiftyseven carpets at a cost of a little over twentyone thousand dollars he had been careful to select only those carpets that would be sought after by the most discerning new yorkers and he was confident that this latest batch would fetch almost a hundred thousand dollars in america it had been such a successful trip that hamid felt he would indulge himself by taking the earlier pan am flight back to new york after all he had undoubtedly earned himself the extra sixtythree dollars many times over in the course of his trip he was looking forward to seeing shereen and the children even before the plane had taken off and the american flight attendant with her pronounced new york accent and friendly smile only added to the feeling that he was already home after lunch had been served and having decided he didnt want to watch the inflight movie hamid dozed off and dreamt about what he could achieve in america given time perhaps his son would go into politics would the united states be ready for an iraqi president by the year he smiled at the thought and fell contentedly into a deep sleep ladies and gentlemen a deep southern voice boomed out over the intercom this is your captain im sorry to interrupt the movie or to wake those of you whove been resting but weve developed a small problem in an engine on our starboard wing nothing to worry about folks but federal aviation authority rulings insist that we land at the nearest airport and have the problem dealt with before we continue with our journey it shouldnt take us more than an hour at the most and then well be on our way again you can be sure that well try to make up as much of the lost time as possible folks hamid was suddenly wide awake we wont be disembarking from the aircraft at any time as this is an unscheduled stop however youll be able to tell the folks back home that youve visited baghdad hamid felt his whole body go limp and then his head rocked forward the flight attendant rushed up to his side are you feeling all right sir she asked he looked up and stared into her eyes i must see the captain immediately immediately the flight attendant was in no doubt of the passengers anxiety and quickly led him forward up the spiral staircase into the firstclass lounge and onto the flight deck she tapped on the door of the cockpit opened it and said captain one of the passengers needs to speak to you urgently show him in said the southern voice the captain turned to face hamid who was now trembling uncontrollably how can i be of help sir he asked my name is hamid zebari i am an american citizen he began if you land in baghdad i will be arrested tortured and then executed the words tumbled out i am a political refugee and you must understand that the regime will not hesitate to kill me the captain only needed to take one look at hamid to realise he wasnt exaggerating take over jim he said to his copilot while i have a word with mr zebari call me the moment weve been given clearance to land the captain unfastened his seatbelt and led hamid to an empty corner of the firstclass lounge take me through it slowly he said during the next few minutes hamid explained why he had had to leave baghdad and how he came to be living in america when he had reached the end of his story the captain shook his head and smiled no need to panic sir he assured hamid no one is going to have to leave the aircraft at any time so the passengers passports wont even be checked once the engine has been attended to well be back up and on our way immediately why dont you just stay here in first class then youll be able to speak to me at any time should you feel at all anxious how anxious can you feel hamid wondered as the captain left him to have a word with the copilot he started to tremble once more its the captain once again folks just bringing you up to date weve been given clearance by baghdad so weve begun our descent and expect to land in about twenty minutes well then be taxiing to the far end of the runway where well await the engineers just as soon as theyve dealt with our little problem well be back up and on our way again a collective sigh went up while hamid gripped the armrest and wished he hadnt eaten any lunch he didnt stop shaking for the next twenty minutes and almost fainted when the wheels touched down on the land of his birth he stared out of the porthole as the aircraft taxied past the terminal he knew so well he could see the armed guards stationed on the roof and at the doors leading onto the tarmac he prayed to allah he prayed to jesus he even prayed to president reagan for the next fifteen minutes the silence was broken only by the sound of a van driving across the tarmac and coming to a halt under the starboard wing of the aircraft hamid watched as two engineers carrying bulky toolbags got out of the van stepped onto a small crane and were hoisted up until they were level with the wing they began unscrewing the outer plates of one of the engines forty minutes later they screwed the plates back on and were lowered to the ground the van then headed off towards the terminal hamid felt relieved if not exactly relaxed he fastened his seatbelt hopefully his heartbeat fell from a minute to around but he knew it wouldnt return to normal until the plane lifted off and he could be sure they wouldnt turn back nothing happened for the next few minutes and hamid became anxious again then the door of the cockpit opened and he saw the captain heading towards him a grim expression on his face youd better join us on the flight deck the captain said in a whisper hamid undid his seatbelt and somehow managed to stand he unsteadily followed the captain into the cockpit his legs feeling like jelly the door was closed behind them the captain didnt waste any words the engineers cant locate the problem the chief engineer wont be free for another hour so weve been ordered to disembark and wait in the transit area until hes completed the job id rather die in a plane crash hamid blurted out dont worry mr zebari weve thought of a way round your problem were going to put you in a spare uniform that will make it possible for you to stay with us the whole time and use the crews facilities no one will ask to see your passport but if someone recognises me began hamid once youve got rid of that moustache and youre wearing a flight officers uniform dark glasses and a peaked hat your own mother wouldnt know you with the help of scissors followed by shaving foam followed by a razor hamid removed the bushy moustache that he had been so proud of to leave an upper lip that looked as pale as a blob of vanilla ice cream the senior flight attendant applied some of her makeup to his skin until the white patch blended in with the rest of his face hamid still wasnt convinced but after he had changed into the copilots spare uniform and studied himself in the toilet mirror he had to admit that it would indeed be remarkable if anyone recognised him the passengers were the first to leave the plane and were ferried by an airport bus to the main terminal a smart transit van then came out to collect the crew who left as a group and sheltered hamid by making sure that he was surrounded at all times hamid became more and more nervous with each yard the van travelled towards the terminal the security guard showed no particular interest in the air crew as they entered the building and they were left to find themselves seats on wooden benches in the whitewalled hall the only decoration was a massive portrait of saddam hussein in full uniform carrying a kalashnikov rifle hamid couldnt bring himself to look at the picture of his good and close friend another crew was also sitting around waiting to board their aircraft but hamid was too frightened to start up a conversation with any of them theyre french he was informed by the senior flight attendant im about to find out if my night classes were worth all the expense she took the spare place next to the captain of the french aircraft and tried a simple opening question the french captain was telling her that they were bound for singapore via new delhi when hamid saw him saad altakriti once a member of saddams personal guard marched into the hall from the insignia on his shoulder he now appeared to be in charge of airport security hamid prayed that he wouldnt look in his direction altakriti sauntered through the room glancing at the french and american crews his eyes lingering on the stewardesses blackstockinged legs the captain touched hamid on the shoulder and he nearly leapt out of his skin its ok its ok i just thought youd like to know that the chief engineer is on his way out to the aircraft so it shouldnt be too long now hamid looked beyond the air france plane and watched a van come to a halt under the starboard wing of the pan am aircraft a man in blue overalls stepped out of the vehicle and onto the little crane hamid stood up to take a closer look and as he did so saad altakriti walked back into the hall he came to a sudden halt and the two men stared briefly at each other before hamid quickly resumed his place next to the captain altakriti disappeared into a side room marked do not enter i think hes spotted me said hamid the makeup started to run down onto his lips the captain leant across to his chief flight attendant and interrupted her parley with the french captain she listened to her bosss instructions and then tried a tougher question on the frenchman saad altakriti marched back out of the office and began striding towards the american captain hamid thought he would surely faint without even glancing at hamid altakriti barked captain i require you to show me your manifest the number of crew you are carrying and their passports my copilot has all the passports the captain replied ill see you get them thank you said altakriti when you have collected them you will bring them to my office so that i can check each one meanwhile please ask your crew to remain here they are not under any circumstances to leave the building without my permission the captain rose from his place walked slowly over to the copilot and asked for the passports then he issued an order which took him by surprise the captain took the passports into the security office just as a bus drew up outside the transit area to take the french crew back to their plane saad altakriti placed the fourteen passports in front of him on his desk he seemed to take pleasure in checking each one of them slowly when he had finished the task he announced in mock surprise i do believe captain that i counted fifteen crew wearing pan am uniforms you must have been mistaken said the captain there are only fourteen of us then i will have to make a more detailed check wont i captain please return these documents to their rightful owners should there happen to be anyone not in possession of a passport they will naturally have to report to me but that is against international regulations said the captain as im sure you know we are in transit and therefore under un resolution not legally in your country save your breath captain we have no use for un resolutions in iraq and as you correctly point out as far as we are concerned you are not legally even in our country the captain realised he was wasting his time and could bluff no longer he gathered up the passports as slowly as he could and allowed altakriti to lead him back into the hall as they entered the room the pan am crew members who were scattered around the benches suddenly rose from their places and began walking about continually changing direction while at the same time talking at the top of their voices tell them to sit down hissed altakriti as the crew zigzagged backwards and forwards across the hall whats that youre saying asked the captain cupping his ear tell them to sit down shouted altakriti the captain gave a halfhearted order and within a few moments everyone was seated but they still continued talking at the top of their voices and tell them to shut up the captain moved slowly round the room asking his crew one by one to lower their voices altakritis eyes raked the benches of the transit hall as the captain glanced out onto the tarmac and watched the french aircraft taxiing towards the far runway altakriti began counting and was annoyed to discover that there were only fourteen pan am crew members in the hall he stared angrily around the room and quickly checked once again all fourteen seem to be present said the captain after he had finished handing back the passports to his crew where is the man who was sitting next to you altakriti demanded jabbing a finger at the captain you mean my first officer no the one who looked like an arab there are no arabs on my crew the captain assured him altakriti strode over to the senior flight attendant he was sitting next to you his upper lip had makeup on it that was beginning to run the captain of the french plane was sitting next to me the senior flight attendant said she immediately realised her mistake saad altakriti turned and looked out of the window to see the air france plane at the end of the runway preparing for takeoff he jabbed a button on his hand phone as the thrust of the jet engines started up and barked out some orders in his native tongue the captain didnt need to speak arabic to get the gist of what he was saying by now the american crew were all staring at the french aircraft willing it to move while altakritis voice was rising with every word he uttered the air france eased forward and slowly began to gather momentum saad altakriti cursed loudly then ran out of the building and jumped into a waiting jeep he pointed towards the plane and ordered the driver to chase after it the jeep shot off accelerating as it weaved its way in and out of the parked aircraft by the time it reached the runway it must have been doing ninety miles an hour and for the next hundred yards it sped along parallel to the french aircraft with altakriti standing on the front seat clinging onto the windscreen and waving his fist at the cockpit the french captain acknowledged him with a crisp salute and as the s wheels lifted off a loud cheer went up in the transit lounge the american captain smiled and turned to his chief flight attendant that only proves my theory that the french will go to any lengths to get an extra passenger hamid zebari landed in new delhi six hours later and immediately phoned his wife to let her know what had happened early the next morning pan am flew him back to new york first class when hamid emerged from the airport terminal his wife jumped out of the car and threw her arms around him nadim wound the window down and declared you were wrong papa a fortnight turns out to be fifteen days hamid grinned at his son but his daughter burst into tears and not because their car had come to a sudden halt it was just that she was horrified to see her mother hugging a strange man chunnel vision the stories indicated with an asterisk are based on known incidents some of them embellished with considerable licence the others are the product of my own imagination ja july whenever im in new york i always try to have dinner with an old friend of mine called duncan mcpherson we are opposites and so naturally we attract in fact duncan and i have only one thing in common we are both writers but even then theres a difference because duncan specialises in screenplays which he writes in the intervals between his occasional articles for newsweek and the new yorker whereas i prefer novels and short stories one of the other differences between us is the fact that i have been married to the same woman for twentyeight years while duncan seems to have a different girlfriend every time i visit new york not bad going as i average at least a couple of trips a year the girls are always attractive lively and bright and there are various levels of intensity depending on what stage the relationship is at in the past ive been around at the beginning very physical and in the middle starting to cool off but this trip was to be the first time i experienced an ending i phoned duncan from my hotel on fifth avenue to let him know i was in town to promote my new novel and he immediately asked me over for dinner the following evening i assumed as in the past that it would be at his apartment another opposite unlike me hes a quite superlative cook i cant wait to see you he said ive come up with an idea for a novel at last and i want to try the plot out on you delighted i replied look forward to hearing all about it tomorrow night and may i ask i hesitated christabel he said christabel i repeated trying to recall if i had ever met her but theres no need for you to remember anything about her he added because shes about to be given the heaveho to use one of your english expressions ive just met a new one karen shes absolutely sensational youll adore her i didnt feel this was the appropriate moment to point out to duncan that i had adored them all i merely asked which one was likely to be joining us for dinner depends if christabel has finished packing duncan replied if she has it will be karen we havent slept together yet and id been planning on that for tomorrow night but as youre in town it will have to be postponed i laughed i could wait i assured him after all im here for at least a week no no in any case i must tell you about my idea for a novel thats far more important so why dont you come to my place tomorrow evening shall we say around seven thirty before i left the hotel i wrapped up a copy of my latest book and wrote hope you enjoy it on the outside duncan lives in one of those apartment blocks on nd and park and though ive been there many times it always takes me a few minutes to locate the entrance to the building and like duncans girlfriends the doorman seems to change with every trip the new doorman grunted when i gave my name and directed me to the elevator on the far side of the hall i slid the grille doors across and pressed the button for the fourteenth floor it was one of those top floors that could not be described as a penthouse even by the most imaginative of estate agents i pulled back the doors and stepped out onto the landing rehearsing the appropriate smiles for christabel goodbye and karen hello as i walked towards duncans front door i could hear raised voices a very british expression born of understatement lets be frank and admit that they were screaming at each other at the tops of their voices i concluded that this had to be the end of christabel rather than the beginning of karen i was already a few minutes late so there was no turning back i pressed the doorbell and to my relief the voices immediately fell silent duncan opened the door and although his cheeks were scarlet with rage he still managed a casual grin which reminds me that i forgot to tell you about a few more opposites the damn man has a mop of boyish dark curly hair the rugged features of his irish ancestors and the build of a champion tennis player come on in he said this is christabel by the way if you hadnt already guessed im not by nature a man who likes other peoples castoffs but im bound to confess i would have been happy to make christabel the exception she had an oval face deep blue eyes and an angelic smile she was also graced with that fine fair hair that only the nordic races are born with and the type of figure that slimming advertisements make their profits out of she wore a cashmere sweater and tapered white jeans that left little to the imagination christabel shook me by the hand and apologised for looking a little scruffy ive been packing all afternoon she explained the proof of her labours was there for all to see three large suitcases and two cardboard boxes full of books standing by the door on the top of one of the boxes lay a copy of a dorothy l sayers murder mystery with a torn red dustjacket i was becoming acutely aware that i couldnt have chosen a worse evening for a reunion with my old friend lm afraid were going to have to eat out for a change duncan said its been he paused a busy day i havent had a chance to visit the local store good thing actually he added itll give me more time to take you through the plot of my novel congratulations christabel said i turned to face her your novel she said number one on the new york times bestseller list isnt it yes congratulations said duncan i havent got round to reading it yet so dont tell me anything about it it wasnt on sale in bosnia he added with a laugh i handed him my little gift thank you he said and placed it on the hall table ill look forward to it ive read it said christabel duncan bit his lip lets go he said and was about to turn and say goodbye to christabel when she asked me would you mind if i joined you im starving and as duncan said theres absolutely nothing in the icebox i could see that duncan was about to protest but by then christabel had passed him and was already in the corridor and heading for the elevator we can walk to the restaurant duncan said as we trundled down to the ground floor its only californians who need a car to take them one block as we strolled west on nd street duncan told me that he had chosen a fancy new french restaurant to take me to i began to protest not just because ive never really cared for ornate french food but i was also aware of duncans unpredictable pecuniary circumstances sometimes he was flush with money at other times stony broke i just hoped that hed had an advance on the novel no like you i normally wouldnt bother he said but its only just opened and the new york times gave it a rave review in any case whenever im in london you always entertain me right royally he added in what he imagined was an english accent it was one of those cool evenings that make walking in new york so pleasant and i enjoyed the stroll as duncan began to tell me about his recent trip to bosnia you were lucky to catch me in new york he was saying ive only just got back after being holed up in the damned place for three months yes i know i read your article in newsweek on the plane coming over i said and went on to tell him how fascinated i had been by his evidence that a group of un soldiers had set up their own underground network and felt no scruples about operating an illegal black market in whatever country they were stationed yes thats caused quite a stir at the un said duncan the new york times and the washington post have both followed the story up with features on the main culprits but without bothering to give me any credit for the original research of course i turned round to see if christabel was still with us she seemed to be deep in thought and was lagging a few paces behind i smiled a smile that i hoped said i think duncans a fool and youre fantastic but i received no response after a few more yards i spotted a red and gold awning flapping in the breeze outside something called le manoir my heart sank ive always preferred simple food and have long considered pretentious french cuisine to be one of the major cons of the eighties and one that should have been passed if not part of culinary history by the nineties duncan led us down a short crazypaving path through a heavy oak door and into a brightly lit restaurant one look around the large overdecorated room and my worst fears were confirmed the ma√Ætre d stepped forward and said good evening monsieur good evening replied duncan i have a table reserved in the name of mcpherson the ma√Ætre d checked down a long list of bookings ah yes a table for two christabel pouted but looked no less beautiful can we make it three my host asked rather halfheartedly of course sir allow me to show you to your table we were guided through a crowded room to a little alcove in the corner which had only been set for two one look at the tablecloth the massive flowered plates with le manoir painted in crimson all over them and the arrangement of lilies on the centre of the table made me feel even more guilty about what i had let duncan in for a waiter dressed in a white openneck shirt black trousers and black waistcoat with le manoir sewn in red on the breast pocket hurriedly supplied christabel with a chair while another deftly laid a place for her a third waiter appeared at duncans side and enquired if we would care for an aperitif christabel smiled sweetly and asked if she might have a glass of champagne i requested some evian water and duncan nodded that he would have the same for the next few minutes while we waited for the menus to appear we continued to discuss duncans trip to bosnia and the contrast between scraping ones food out of a billycan in a cold dugout accompanied by the sound of bullets and dining off china plates in a warm restaurant with a string quartet playing schubert in the background another waiter appeared at duncans side and handed us three pink menus the size of small posters as i glanced down the list of dishes christabel whispered something to the waiter who nodded and slipped quietly away i began to study the menu more carefully unhappy to discover that this was one of those restaurants which allows only the host to have the bill of fare with the prices attached i was trying to work out which would be the cheapest dishes when another glass of champagne was placed at christabels side i decided that the clear soup was likely to be the least expensive starter and that it would also help my feeble efforts to lose weight the main courses had me more perplexed and with my limited knowledge of french i finally settled on duck as i couldnt find any sign of poulet when the waiter returned moments later he immediately spotted christabels empty glass and asked would you care for another glass of champagne madame yes please she replied sweetly as the ma√Ætre d arrived to take our order but first we had to suffer an ordeal that nowadays can be expected at every french restaurant in the world today our specialities are he began in an accent that would not have impressed central casting for hors doeuvres gel√©e de saumon sauvage et caviar imp√©rial en aigre doux which is wild salmon slivers and imperial caviar in a delicate jelly with sour cream and courgettes soused in dill vinegar also we have cuisses de grenouilles √† la pur√©e dherbes √† soupe fricass√©e de chanterelles et racines de persil which are panfried frogs legs in a parsley pur√©e fricassee of chanterelles and parsley roots for the main course we have escalope de turbot which is a poached fillet of turbot on a watercress pur√©e lemon sabayon and a gew√ºrztraminer sauce and of course everything that is on the menu can be recommended i felt full even before he had finished the descriptions christabel appeared to be studying the menu with due diligence she pointed to one of the dishes and the ma√Ætre d smiled approvingly duncan leaned across and asked if i had selected anything yet consomm√© and the duck will suit me just fine i said without hesitation thank you sir said the ma√Ætre d how would you like the duck crispy or perhaps a little underdone crispy i replied to his evident disapproval and monsieur he asked turning to duncan caesar salad and a rare steak the ma√Ætre d retrieved the menus and was turning to go as duncan said now let me tell you all about my idea for a novel would you care to order some wine sir asked another waiter who was carrying a large red leather book with golden grapes embossed on its cover should i do that for you suggested christabel then therell be no need to interrupt your story duncan nodded his agreement and the waiter handed the wine list over to christabel she opened the red leather cover with as much eagerness as if she was about to begin a bestselling novel you may be surprised duncan was saying that my book is set in britain let me start by explaining that the timing for its publication is absolutely vital as you know a british and french consortium is currently building a tunnel between folkestone and sangatte which is scheduled to be opened by queen elizabeth on may in fact chunnel will be the title of my book i was horrified another glass of champagne was placed in front of christabel the story begins in four separate locations with four different sets of characters although they are all from diverse age groups social backgrounds and countries they have one thing in common they have all booked on the first passenger train to travel from london to paris via the channel tunnel i felt a sudden pang of guilt and wondered if i should say something but at this point a waiter returned with a bottle of white wine the label of which christabel studied intently she nodded and the sommelier extracted the cork and poured a little into her empty glass a sip brought the smile back to her lips the waiter then filled our glasses duncan continued there will be an american family mother father two teenage children on their first visit to england a young english couple who have just got married that morning and are about to begin their honeymoon a greek selfmade millionaire and his french wife who booked their tickets a year before but are now considering a divorce and three students duncan paused as a caesar salad was placed in front of him and a second waiter presented me with a bowl of consomm√© i glanced at the dish christabel had chosen a plate of thinly cut smoked gravadlax with a blob of caviar in the centre she was happily squeezing half a lemon protected by muslin all over it now said duncan in the first chapter its important that the reader doesnt realise that the students are connected in any way as that later becomes central to the plot we pick up all four groups in the second chapter as theyre preparing for the journey the reader discovers their motivations for wanting to be on the train and i build a little on the background of each of the characters involved what period of time will the plot cover i asked anxiously between spoonfuls of consomm√© probably three days replied duncan the day before the journey the day of the journey and the day after but im still not certain by the final draft it might all happen on the same day christabel grabbed the wine bottle from the icebucket and refilled her glass before the wine waiter had a chance to assist her around chapter three continued duncan we find the various groups arriving at waterloo station to board le shuttle the greek millionaire and his french wife will be shown to their firstclass seats by a black crew member while the others are directed to second class once they are all on board some sort of ceremony to commemorate the inauguration of the tunnel will take place on the platform big band fireworks cutting of tape by royalty etc that should prove quite adequate to cover another chapter at least while i was visualising the scene and sipping my soup the restaurant may have been pretentious but the food was excellent the wine waiter filled my glass and then duncans i dont normally care for white wine but i had to admit that this one was quite exceptional duncan paused to eat and i turned my attention to christabel who was being served a second dollop of caviar that appeared even bigger than the first chapter five said duncan opens as the train moves out of the station now the real action begins the american family are enjoying every moment the young bride and groom make love in the rest room the millionaire is having another row with his wife about her continual extravagance and the three students have met up for the first time at the bar by now you should begin to suspect that theyre not ordinary students and that they may have known each other before they got on the train duncan smiled and continued with his salad i frowned christabel winked at me to show she knew exactly what was going on i felt guilty at being made a part of her conspiracy and wanted to tell duncan what she was up to its certainly a strong plot i ventured as the wine waiter filled our glasses for a third time and having managed to empty the bottle looked towards madame she nodded sweetly have you started on the research yet i asked yes research is going to be the key to this project and im well into it already said duncan i wrote to sir alastair morton the chairman of eurotunnel on newsweek headed paper and his office sent me back a caseload of material i can tell you the length of the rolling stock the number of carriages the diameter of the wheels why the train can go faster on the french side than the british even why its necessary for them to have a differentgauge track on either side of the channel the pop of a cork startled me and the wine waiter began pouring from a second bottle should i tell him now during chapter six the plot begins to unfold said duncan warming to his theme as one of the waiters whipped away the empty plates and another brushed a few breadcrumbs off the tablecloth into a little silver scoop the trick is to keep the reader interested in all four groups at the same time i nodded now we come to the point in the story when the reader discovers that the students are not really students but terrorists who plan to hijack the train three dishes topped by domed silver salvers were placed in front of us on a nod from the ma√Ætre d all three domes were lifted in unison by the waiters it would be churlish of me not to admit that the food looked quite magnificent i turned to see what christabel had selected truffles with foie gras they reminded me of a mira painting until she quickly smudged the canvas what do you think the terrorists motive for hijacking the train should be duncan asked this was surely the moment to tell him but once again i funked it i tried to remember what point in the story we had reached that would depend on whether you eventually wanted them to escape i suggested which might prove quite difficult if theyre stuck in the middle of a tunnel with a police force waiting for them at either end the wine waiter presented christabel with the bottle of claret she had chosen after no more than a sniff of the cork she indicated that it was acceptable i dont think they should be interested in financial reward said duncan they ought to be ira islamic fundamentalists basque separatists or whatever the latest terrorist group catching the headlines happens to be i sipped the wine it was like velvet i had only tasted such a vintage once before in the home of a friend who possessed a cellar of old wine put down with new money it was a taste that had remained etched in my memory in chapter seven ive come up against a block continued duncan intent on his theme one of the terrorists must somehow come into contact with the newlymarried couple or at least with the bridegroom he paused i should have told you earlier that in the characterbuilding at the beginning of the book one of the students turns out to be a loner while the other two a man and a woman have been living together for some time he began digging into his steak its how i bring the loner and the bridegroom together that worries me any ideas that shouldnt be too hard i said what with restaurant cars snack bars carriages a corridor not to mention a black crew member railway staff and rest rooms yes but it must appear natural duncan said sounding as if he was in deep thought my heart sank as i noticed christabels empty plate being whisked away despite the fact that duncan and i had hardly begun our main courses the chapter ends with the train suddenly coming to a halt about halfway through the tunnel said duncan staring into the distance but how and why i asked thats the whole point its a false alarm quite innocent the youngest child of the american family his names ben pulls the communication cord while hes sitting on the lavatory its such a hitech lavatory that he mistakes it for the chain i was considering if this was plausible when a breast of quail on fondant potatoes with a garnish of smoked bacon was placed in front of christabel she wasted no time in attacking the fowl duncan paused to take a sip of wine now i felt i had to let him know but before i had a chance to say anything he was off again right he said chapter eight the train has come to a halt several miles inside the tunnel but not quite halfway is that significant i asked feebly sure is said duncan the french and british have agreed the exact point inside the tunnel where french jurisdiction begins and british ends as youll discover this becomes relevant later in the plot the waiter began moving round the table topping up our glasses once again with claret i placed a hand over mine not because the wine wasnt pure nectar but simply because i didnt wish to give christabel the opportunity to order another bottle she made no attempt to exercise the same restraint but drank her wine in generous gulps while toying with her quail duncan continued with his story so the holdup said duncan turns out to be nothing more than a diversion and its sorted out fairly quickly child in tears family apologises explanation given by the guard over the trains intercom which relieves any anxieties the passengers might have had a few minutes later the train starts up again and this time it does cross the halfway point three waiters removed our empty plates christabel touched the side of her lips with a napkin and gave me a huge grin so then what happens i asked avoiding her eye when the train stopped the terrorists were afraid that there might be a rival group on board with the same purpose as them but as soon as they find out what has actually happened they take advantage of the commotion caused by young ben to get themselves into the cabin next to the drivers would you care for anything from the dessert trolley madame the ma√Ætre d asked christabel i looked on aghast as she was helped to what looked like a large spoonful of everything on offer its gripping isnt it said duncan misunderstanding my expression for one of deep concern for those on the train but theres still more to come monsieur im full thank you i told the ma√Ætre d perhaps a coffee later no nothing thank you said duncan trying not to lose his thread by the start of chapter nine the terrorists have got themselves into the drivers cabin at gunpoint they force the chef de train and his codriver to bring the engine to a halt for a second time but what they dont realise is that they are now on french territory the passengers are told by the loner over the trains intercom that this time its not a false alarm but the train has been taken over by whichever gang i settle on and is going to be blown up in fifteen minutes he tells them to get themselves off the train into the tunnel and as far away as they possibly can before the explosion naturally some of the passengers begin to panic several of them leap out into the dimly lit tunnel many are looking frantically for their husbands wives children whatever while others begin running towards the british or french side according to their nationality i became distracted when the ma√Ætre d began wheeling yet another trolley towards our table he paused bowed to christabel and then lit a small burner he poured some brandy into a shallow copperbottomed pan and set about preparing a cr√™pe suzette this is the point in the story probably chapter ten where the father of the american family decides to remain on the train said duncan becoming more excited than ever he tells the rest of his tribe to jump off and get the hell out of it the only other passengers who stay on board are the millionaire his wife and the young newlymarried man all will have strong personal reasons for wanting to remain behind which will have been set up earlier in the plot the ma√Ætre d struck a match and set light to the cr√™pe a blue flame licked around the pan and shot into the air he scooped his pi√®ce de r√©sistance onto a warm platter in one movement and placed it in front of christabel i feared we had now passed the point at which i could tell duncan the truth right now i have three terrorists in the cab with the chef de train theyve killed the codriver and there are just four passengers still left on the train plus the black ticket collector who may turn out to be sas in disguise i havent decided yet coffee madame the ma√Ætre d asked when duncan paused for a moment irish said christabel regular please i said decaff for me said duncan any liqueurs or cigars only christabel reacted so at the start of chapter eleven the terrorists open negotiations with the british police but they say they cant deal with them because the train is no longer under their jurisdiction this throws the terrorists completely because none of them speaks french and in any case their quarrel is with the british government one of them searches the train for someone who can speak french and comes across the greek millionaires wife meanwhile the police on either side of the channel stop all the trains going in either direction so our train is now stranded in the tunnel on its own there would normally be twenty trains travelling in either direction between london and paris at any one time he paused to sip his coffee is that so i asked knowing the answer perfectly well it certainly is duncan said ive done my research thoroughly a glass of deep red port was being poured for christabel i glanced at the label taylors this was something i had never had the privilege of tasting christabel indicated that the bottle should be left on the table the waiter nodded and christabel immediately poured me a glass without asking if i wanted it meanwhile the ma√Ætre d clipped a cigar for duncan that he hadnt requested in chapter twelve we discover the terrorists purpose continued duncan namely blowing up the train as a publicity stunt guaranteed to get their cause onto every front page in the world but the passengers who have remained on the train led by the american father are planning a counteroffensive the ma√Ætre d lit a match and duncan automatically picked up the cigar and put it in his mouth it silenced him the selfmade millionaire might feel hes the natural leader i suggested but only for a moment hes a greek if im going to make any money out of this project its the american market i have to aim for and dont forget the film rights duncan said jabbing the air with his cigar i couldnt fault his logic can i have the cheque duncan asked as the ma√Ætre d passed by our table certainly sir he replied not even breaking his stride now my trouble is going to be the ending began duncan as christabel suddenly if somewhat unsteadily rose from her chair she turned to face me and said im afraid the time has come for me to leave its been a pleasure meeting you although i have a feeling we wont be seeing each other again id just like to say how much i enjoyed your latest novel such an original idea it deserved to be number one i stood kissed her hand and thanked her feeling more guilty than ever goodbye duncan she said turning to face her former lover but he didnt even bother to look up dont worry yourself she added ill be out of the apartment by the time you get back she proceeded to negotiate a rather wobbly route across the restaurant eventually reaching the door that led out onto the street the ma√Ætre d held it open for her and bowed low i cant pretend im sorry to see her go said duncan puffing away on his cigar fantastic body great between the sheets but shes totally lacking in imagination the ma√Ætre d reappeared by duncans side this time to place a small black leather folder in front of him well the critics were certainly right about this place i commented duncan nodded his agreement the ma√Ætre d bowed but not quite as low as before now my trouble as i was trying to explain before christabel decided to make her exit continued duncan is that ive done the outline completed the research but i still dont have an ending any ideas he asked as a middleaged woman rose from a nearby table and began walking determinedly towards us duncan flicked open the leather cover and stared in disbelief at the bill the woman came to a halt beside our table i just wanted to tell you how much i enjoyed your new book she said in a loud voice other diners turned round to see what was going on thank you i said somewhat curtly hoping to prevent her from adding to my discomfort duncans eyes were still fixed on the bill and the ending she said so clever i would never have guessed how you were going to get the american family out of the tunnel alive shoeshine boy the stories indicated with an asterisk are based on known incidents some of them embellished with considerable licence the others are the product of my own imagination ja july ted barker was one of those members of parliament who never sought high office hed had what was described by his fellow officers as a good war in which he was awarded the military cross and reached the rank of major after being demobbed in november he was happy to return to his wife hazel and their home in suffolk the family engineering business had also had a good war under the diligent management of teds elder brother ken as soon as he arrived home ted was offered his old place on the board which he happily accepted but as the weeks passed by the distinguished warrior became first bored and then disenchanted there was no job for him at the factory which even remotely resembled active service it was around this time that he was approached by ethel thompson the works convenor and more important for the advancement of this tale chairman of the wedmore branch of the north suffolk conservative association the incumbent mp sir dingle lightfoot known in the constituency as tiptoe had made it clear that once the war was over they must look for someone to replace him we dont want some clever clogs from london coming up here and telling us how to run this division pronounced mrs thompson we need someone who knows the district and understands the problems of the local people ted she suggested might be just the ticket ted confessed that he had never given such an idea a moments thought but promised mrs thompson that he would take her proposal seriously only asking for a week in which to consider his decision he discussed the suggestion with his wife and having received her enthusiastic support he paid a visit to mrs thompson at her home the following sunday afternoon she was delighted to hear that mr barker would be pleased to allow his name to go forward for consideration as the prospective parliamentary candidate for the division of north suffolk the final shortlist included two clever clogs from london one of whom later served in a macmillan cabinet and the local boy ted barker when the chairman announced the committees decision to the local press he said that it would be improper to reveal the number of votes each candidate had polled in fact ted had comfortably outscored his two rivals put together six months later the prime minister called a general election and after a lively threeweek campaign ted was returned as the member of parliament for north suffolk with a majority of over seven thousand he quickly became respected and popular with colleagues on both sides of the house though he never pretended to be anything other than in his own words an amateur politician as the years passed teds popularity with his constituents grew and he increased his majority with each succeeding general election after fourteen years of diligent service to the party nationally and locally the prime minister of the day harold macmillan recommended to the queen that ted should receive a knighthood by the end of the s sir ted he was never known as sir edward felt that the time was fast approaching when the division should start looking for a younger candidate and he made it clear to the local chairman that he did not intend to stand at the next election he and hazel quietly prepared for a peaceful retirement in their beloved east anglia shortly after the election ted was surprised to receive a call from downing street the prime minister would like to see sir ted at tomorrow morning ted couldnt imagine why edward heath should want to see him although he had of course visited number on several occasions when he was a member of parliament those visits had only been for cocktail parties receptions and the occasional dinner for a visiting head of state he admitted to hazel that he was a little nervous ted presented himself at the front door of number at the next day the duty clerk accompanied him down the long corridor on the ground floor and asked him to take a seat in the small waiting area that adjoins the cabinet room by now teds nervousness was turning to apprehension he felt like an errant schoolboy about to come face to face with his headmaster after a few minutes a private secretary appeared good morning sir ted the prime minister will see you now he accompanied ted into the cabinet room where mr heath stood to greet him how kind of you to come at such short notice ted ted had to suppress a smile because he knew the prime minister knew that it would have taken the scurvy or a localised hurricane to stop him from answering such a summons im hoping you can help me with a delicate matter ted continued the prime minister a man not known for wasting time on smalltalk im about to appoint the next governor of st georges and i cant think of anyone better qualified for the job than you ted recalled the day when mrs thompson had asked him to think about standing for parliament but on this occasion he didnt require a week to consider his reply even if he couldnt quite bring himself to admit that although hed heard of st georges he certainly couldnt have located it on a map once hed caught his breath he simply said thank you prime minister id be honoured during the weeks that followed sir ted paid several visits to the foreign and colonial office to receive briefings on various aspects of his appointment thereafter he assiduously read every book pamphlet and government paper the mandarins supplied after a few weeks of boning up on his new subject the governorinwaiting had discovered that st georges was a tiny group of islands in the middle of the north atlantic it been colonised by the british in and thereafter had a long history of imperial rule the islanders having scorned every offer of independence they were one of her majestys sovereign colonies and that was how they wished to remain even before he set out on his adventure ted had become used to being addressed as your excellency but after being fitted up by alan bennett of savile row with two different full dress uniforms ted feared that he looked what was that modern expression ott in winter he was expected to wear an outfit of dark blue doeskin with scarlet collar and cuffs embroidered with silver oakleaves while in the summer he was to be adorned in white cotton drill with a goldembroidered collar and gold shoulder cords the sight of him in either uniform caused hazel to laugh out loud ted didnt laugh when the tailors sent him the bill especially after he learned that he would be unlikely to wear either uniform more than twice a year still think what a hit youll be at fancy dress parties once youve retired was hazels only comment the newlyappointed governor and commanderinchief of st georges and his lady flew out to take up their post on january they were greeted by the prime minister as the colonys first citizen and the chief justice as the legal representative of the queen after the new governor had taken the salute from six offduty policemen standing vaguely to attention the town band gave a rendering of the national anthem the union jack was raised on the roof of the airport terminal and a light splattering of applause broke out from the assembled gathering of twenty or thirty local dignitaries sir ted and lady barker were then driven to the official residence in a spacious but ageing rover that had already served the two previous governors when they reached government house the driver brought the car to a halt and leaped out to open the gates as they continued up the drive ted and hazel saw their new home for the first time the colonial mansion was magnificent by any standards obviously built at the height of the british empire it was vastly out of proportion to either the importance of the island or britains current position in the real world but size as the governor and his wife were quickly to discover didnt necessarily equate with efficiency or comfort the air conditioning didnt work the plumbing was unreliable mrs rogers the daily help was regularly off sick and the only thing teds predecessor had left behind was an elderly black labrador worse the foreign office had no funds available to deal with any of these problems and whenever ted mentioned them in dispatches he was met only with suggestions for cutbacks after a few weeks ted and hazel began to think of st georges as being rather like a great big parliamentary constituency split into several islands the two largest being suffolk and edward island this heartened ted who even wondered if that was what had given the prime minister the idea of offering him the post in the first place the governors duties could hardly have been described as onerous he and hazel spent most of their time visiting hospitals delivering speeches at school prizegivings and judging flower shows the highlight of the year was undoubtedly the queens official birthday in june when the governor held a garden party for local dignitaries at government house and suffolk played edward island at cricket an opportunity for most of the colonys citizens to spend two days getting thoroughly drunk ted and hazel accepted the local realpolitik and settled down for five years of relaxed diplomacy among delightful people in a heavenly climate seeing no cloud on the horizon that could disturb their blissful existence until the phone call came it was a thursday morning and the governor was in his study with that mondays times he was putting off reading a long article on the summit meeting taking place in washington until he had finished the crossword and was just about to fill in the answer to across erring herd twists to create this diversion when his private secretary charles roberts came rushing into his office without knocking ted realised it had to be something important because he had never known charles to rush anywhere and certainly he had never known him to enter the study without the courtesy of a knock its mountbatten on the line charles blurted out he could hardly have looked more anxious had he been reporting that the germans were about to land on the north shore of the island the governor raised an eyebrow admiral of the fleet earl mountbatten of burma said charles as if ted hadnt understood then put him through said ted quietly folding up his copy of the times and placing it on the desk in front of him he had met mountbatten three times over the past twenty years but doubted if the great man would recall any of these encounters indeed on the third occasion ted had found it necessary to slip out of the function the admiral was addressing as he was feeling a little queasy he couldnt imagine what mountbatten would want to speak to him about and he had no time to consider the problem as the phone on his desk was already ringing as ted picked up the receiver he was still wondering whether to call mountbatten my lord as he was an earl commanderinchief as he was a former chief of the defence staff or admiral as admiral of the fleet is a life appointment he settled for good morning sir good morning your excellency i hope i find you well yes thank you sir replied ted because if i remember correctly when we last met you were suffering from a tummy bug thats right sir said the surprised governor he was reasonably confident that the purpose of mountbattens call wasnt to enquire about his health after all these years governor you must be curious to know why i am calling yes sir i am presently in washington attending the summit and i had originally planned to return to london tomorrow morning i understand sir said ted not understanding at all but i thought i might make a slight detour and drop in to see you i do enjoy visiting our colonies whenever i get the chance it gives me the opportunity to brief her majesty on whats happening i hope that such a visit would not be inconvenient not at all sir said ted we would be delighted to welcome you good said mountbatten then i would be obliged if you could warn the airport authorities to expect my aircraft around four tomorrow afternoon i would like to stay overnight but if im to keep to my schedule i will need to leave you fairly early the following morning of course sir nothing could be easier my wife and i will be at the airport to welcome you at four oclock tomorrow afternoon thats kind of you governor by the way id rather things were left fairly informal please dont put yourself to any trouble the line went dead once he had replaced the receiver it was teds turn to run for the first time in several months he found charles striding down the long corridor towards him having obviously listened in on the extension find my wife and get yourself a notepad and then both of you join me in my office immediately immediately ted repeated as he scuttled back into his study hazel arrived a few minutes later clutching a bunch of dahlias followed by the breathless private secretary why the rush ted whats the panic mountbattens coming when hazel asked quietly tomorrow afternoon four oclock that is a good reason to panic hazel admitted she dumped the flowers in a vase on the windowsill and took a seat opposite her husband on the other side of his desk perhaps this isnt the best time to let you know that mrs rogers is off sick you have to admire her timing said ted right well just have to bluff it what do you mean bluff it asked hazel well dont lets forget that mountbattens a member of the royal family a former chief of the defence staff and an admiral of the fleet the last colonial post he held was viceroy of india with three regiments under his command and a personal staff of over a thousand so i cant imagine what hell expect to find when he turns up here then lets begin by making a list of things that will have to be done said hazel briskly charles removed a pen from his inside pocket turned over the cover of his pad and waited to write down his masters instructions if hes arriving at the airport the first thing he will expect is a red carpet said hazel but we dont have a red carpet said ted yes we do theres the one that leads from the dining room to the drawing room well have to use that and hope we can get it back in place before he visits that part of the house charles you will have to roll it up and take it to the airport she paused and then bring it back charles scowled but began writing furiously and charles can you also see that its cleaned by tomorrow interjected the governor i hadnt even realised it was red now what about a guard of honour we havent got a guard of honour said hazel if you remember when we arrived on the island we were met by the prime minister the chief justice and six offduty policemen true said ted then well just have to rely on the territorial army you mean colonel hodges and his band of hopeful warriors they dont even all have matching uniforms and as for their rifles hodges will just have to get them into some sort of shape by four oclock tomorrow afternoon leave that one to me said ted making a note on his pad ill phone him later this morning now what about a band well theres the town band said charles and of course the police band on this occasion theyll have to combine said hazel so we dont offend either of them but they only know three tunes between them said ted they only need to know one said hazel the national anthem right said the governor as there are sure to be a lot of musical feathers that will need unruffling ill leave you to deal with them hazel our next problem is how we transport him from the airport to government house certainly not in the old rover said hazel its broken down three times in the last month and it smells like a kennel henry bendall has a rollsroyce said ted well just have to commandeer that as long as no one tells mountbatten that its owned by the local undertaker and what it was used for the morning before he arrived mick flaherty also has an old rolls piped up charles a silver shadow if i remember correctly but he loathes the british said hazel agreed said ted but hell still want to have dinner at government house when he discovers the guest of honour is a member of the royal family dinner said hazel her voice rising in horror of course we will have to give a dinner in his honour said ted and worse everyone who is anyone will expect to be invited how many can the dining room hold he and hazel turned to the private secretary sixty if pushed replied charles looking up from his notes were pushed said ted we certainly are said hazel because we dont have sixty plates let alone sixty coffee cups sixty teaspoons sixty we still have that royal worcester service presented by the late king after his visit in said ted how many pieces of that are fit for use enough for about fourteen settings at the last count said hazel right then thats dealt with how many people will be at the top table what about the menu asked charles and more important who is going to cook it added ted well have to ask dotty cuthbert if she can spare mrs travis for the evening said hazel no one on the island is a better cook and well also need her butler not to mention the rest of her staff added ted by now charles was onto his third page youd better deal with lady cuthbert my dear said ted ill try to square mick flaherty our next problem will be the drink said hazel dont forget the last governor emptied the cellar a few days before he left and the foreign office refuses to restock it ted reminded her jonathan fletcher has the best cellar on the island and god bless him he wont expect to be at the top table said hazel if were limited to fourteen places the top tables looking awfully crowded already said ted dotty cuthbert the bendalls the flahertys the hodges said hazel writing down the names not to mention the prime minister the chief justice the mayor the chief of police plus their wives lets hope that some of them are indisposed or abroad she was beginning to sound desperate wheres he going to sleep asked charles innocently god i hadnt thought of him sleeping said ted hell have to take our bedroom its the only one with a bed that doesnt sink in the middle said hazel well move into the nelson room for the night and suffer those dreadful woodwormed beds and their ancient horsehair mattresses agreed said hazel ill make sure all our things are out of the queen victoria room by this evening and charles said the governor phone the foreign office would you and find out mountbattens likes and dislikes food drink eccentric habits anything you can discover theyre sure to have a file on him and this is one gentleman i dont want to catch me out the private secretary turned over yet another page of his pad and continued scribbling for the next hour the three of them went over any and every problem that might arise during the visit and after a selfmade sandwich lunch departed in their different directions to spend the afternoon making begging calls all round the island it was charless idea that the governor should appear on the local television stations earlyevening news programme to let the citizens know that a member of the royal family would be visiting the island the following day sir ted ended his broadcast by saying that he hoped as many people as possible would be at the airport to welcome the great war leader when his plane touched down at four the following afternoon while hazel spent the evening cleaning every room that the great war leader might conceivably enter charles with the aid of a torch tended to the flowerbeds that lined the driveway and ted supervised the shuttling of plates cutlery food and wine from different parts of the island to government house now what have we forgotten said ted as he climbed into bed at two oclock that morning heaven only knows hazel said wearily before turning out the light but whatever it is lets hope mountbatten never finds out the governor dressed in his summer uniform with gold piping down the sides of his white trousers decorations and campaign medals across his chest and a wolsey helmet with a plume of redoverwhite swans feathers on his head walked out onto the landing to join his wife hazel was wearing the green summer frock she had bought for the governors garden party two years before and was checking the flowers in the entrance hall too late for that said ted as she rearranged a sprig that had strayed half an inch its time we left for the airport they descended the steps of government house to find two rollsroyces one black one white and their old rover standing in line charles followed closely behind them carrying the red carpet which he dropped into the boot of the rover as his master stepped into the back of the leading rollsroyce the first thing the governor needed to check was the chauffeurs name bill simmons he was informed all you have to remember bill is to look as if youve been doing this job all your life right guv no said ted firmly in front of the admiral you must address me as your excellency and lord mountbatten as my lord if in any doubt say nothing right guv your excellency bill started up the car and drove towards the gates at what he evidently considered was a stately pace before turning right and taking the road to the airport when they reached the terminal fifteen minutes later a policeman ushered the tiny motorcade out onto the tarmac where the combined bands were playing a medley from west side story at least that was what ted charitably thought it might be as he stepped out of the car ted came face to face with three ranks of soldiers from the territorial army standing at ease sixtyone of them aged from seventeen to seventy ted had to admit that although they werent the grenadier guards they werent dads army either and they had two advantages a reallive colonel in full dress uniform and a genuine sergeant major with a voice to match charles had already begun rolling out the red carpet when the governor turned his attention to the hastilyerected barriers where he was delighted to see a larger crowd than he had ever witnessed on the island even at the annual football derby between suffolk and edward island many of the islanders were waving union jacks and some were holding up pictures of the queen ted smiled and checked his watch the plane was due in seventeen minutes the prime minister the local mayor the chief justice the commissioner of police and their wives were lining up at the end of the red carpet the sun beat down from a cloudless sky as ted turned in a slow circle to take in the scene he could see for himself that everyone had made a special effort suddenly the sound of engines could be heard and the crowd began to cheer ted looked up shielded his eyes and saw an andover of the queens flight descending towards the airport it touched down on the far end of the runway at three minutes before the hour and taxied up to the red carpet as four chimes struck on the clock above the flight control tower the door of the plane opened and there stood admiral of the fleet the earl mountbatten of burma kg pc gcb om gcsi gcie gcvo dso frs dcl hon lld hon attired in the full dress uniform of an admiral of the fleet summer wear if thats what he means by fairly informal i suppose we should be thankful that he didnt ask us to lay on an official visit murmured hazel as she and ted walked to the bottom of the steps that had been quickly wheeled into place as mountbatten slowly descended the stairway the crowd cheered even louder once he stepped onto the red carpet the governor took a pace forward removed his plumed hat and bowed the admiral saluted and at that moment the combined bands of town and police struck up the national anthem the crowd sang god save the queen so lustily that the occasional uncertain note was smothered by their exuberance when the anthem came to an end the governor said welcome to st georges sir thank you governor replied mountbatten may i present my wife hazel the governors wife took a pace forward did a full curtsey and shook hands with the admiral how good to see you again lady barker this is indeed a pleasure the governor guided his guest to the end of the red carpet and introduced him to the prime minister and his wife sheila the local mayor and his wife caroline the chief justice and his wife janet and the commissioner of police and his latest wife whose name he couldnt remember perhaps youd care to inspect the guard of honour before we leave for government house suggested ted steering mountbatten in the direction of colonel hodges and his men absolutely delighted said the admiral waving to the crowd as the two of them proceeded across the tarmac towards the waiting guard when they still had some twenty yards to go the colonel sprang to attention took three paces forward saluted and said crisply guard of honour ready for inspection sir mountbatten came to a halt and returned a naval salute which was a sign for the sergeant major standing at attention six paces behind his colonel to bellow out the words commanding officer on parade general salute present arms the front row who were in possession of the units entire supply of weapons presented arms while the second and third rows came rigidly to attention mountbatten marched dutifully up and down the ranks as gravely as if he were inspecting a full brigade of life guards when he had passed the last soldier in the back row the colonel came to attention and saluted once again mountbatten returned the salute and said thank you colonel firstclass effort well done the governor then guided mountbatten towards the white rollsroyce where bill was standing at what he imagined was attention while at the same time holding open the back door mountbatten stepped in as the governor hurried round to the other side opened the door for himself and joined his guest on the back seat hazel and the admirals adc took their places in the black rollsroyce while charles and the admirals secretary had to make do with the rover the governor only hoped that mountbatten hadnt seen two members of the airport staff rolling up the red carpet and placing it in the rovers boot hazel was only praying that they had enough sheets left over for the bed in the green room if not the adc would be wondering about their sleeping habits the islands two police motorcycles with whiteuniformed outriders preceded the three cars as they made their way towards the exit the crowd waved and cheered lustily as the motorcade began its short journey to government house so successful had teds television appearance the previous evening been that the tenmile route was lined with wellwishers as they approached the open gates two policemen sprang to attention and saluted as the leading car passed through in the distance ted could see a butler two underbutlers and several maids all smartly clad standing on the steps awaiting their arrival damn it he almost said aloud as the car came to a halt at the bottom of the steps i dont know the butlers name the car door was smartly opened by one of the underbutlers while the second supervised the unloading of the luggage from the boot the butler took a pace forward as mountbatten stepped out of the car carruthers mlord he said bowing welcome to the residence if you would be kind enough to follow me i will direct you to your quarters the admiral accompanied by the governor and lady barker climbed the steps into government house and followed carruthers up the main staircase magnificent these old government residences said mountbatten as they reached the top of the stairs carruthers opened the door to the queen victoria room and stood to one side as if he had done so a thousand times before how charming said the admiral taking in the governors private suite he walked over to the window and looked out onto the newlymown lawn how very pleasant it reminds me of broadlands my home in hampshire lady barker smiled at the compliment but didnt allow herself to relax is there anything you require mlord asked carruthers as an underbutler began to supervise the unpacking of the cases hazel held her breath no i dont think so said mountbatten everything looks just perfect perhaps youd care to join hazel and me for tea in the drawing room when youre ready sir suggested ted how thoughtful of you said the admiral ill be down in about thirty minutes if i may the governor and his wife left the room closing the door quietly behind them i think he suspects something whispered hazel as they tiptoed down the staircase you may be right said ted placing his plumed hat on the stand in the hall but thats all the more reason to check we havent forgotten anything ill start with the dining room you ought to go and see how mrs travis is getting on in the kitchen when hazel entered the kitchen she found mrs travis preparing the vegetables and one of the maids peeling a mound of potatoes she thanked mrs travis for taking over at such short notice and admitted she had never seen the kitchen so full of exotic foods or the surfaces so immaculately clean even the floor was spotless realising that her presence was superfluous hazel joined her husband in the dining room where she found him admiring the expertise of the second underbutler who was laying out the place settings for that evening as a maid folded napkins to look like swans so far so good said hazel they left the dining room and entered the drawing room where ted paced up and down trying to think if there was anything he had forgotten while they waited for the great man to join them for tea a few minutes later mountbatten walked in he was no longer dressed in his admirals uniform but had changed into a dark grey doublebreasted suit damn it thought ted immediately aware of what hed forgotten to do hazel rose to greet her guest and guided him to a large comfortable chair i must say lady barker your butler is a splendid chap said mountbatten he even knew the brand of whisky i prefer how long have you had him not very long admitted hazel well if he ever wants a job in england dont hesitate to let me know though im bound to say youd be a fool to part with him he added as a maid came in carrying a beautiful wedgwood tea service that hazel had never set eyes on before earl grey if i remember correctly said hazel what a memory you have lady barker said the admiral as the maid began to pour thank god for the foreign office briefing hazel thought as she accepted the compliment with a smile and how did the conference go sir asked ted as he dropped a lump of sugar the one thing he felt might be their own into his cup of tea for the british quite well said mountbatten but it would have gone better if the french hadnt been up to their usual tricks giscard seems to regard himself as a cross between charlemagne and joan of arc his hosts laughed politely no the real problem were facing at the moment ted is quite simply by the time mountbatten had dealt with the outcome of the summit given his undiluted views of james callaghan and ted heath covered the problem of finding a wife for prince charles and mulled over the longterm repercussions of watergate it was almost time for him to change are we dressing for dinner yes sir if that meets with your approval full decorations mountbatten asked sounding hopeful i thought that would be appropriate sir replied ted remembering the foreign offices advice about the admirals liking for dressing up at the slightest opportunity mountbatten smiled as carruthers appeared silently at the door ted raised an eyebrow i have laid out the full dress uniform mlord i took the liberty of pressing the trousers the bedroom maid is drawing a bath for you mountbatten smiled thank you he said as he rose from his chair such a splendid tea he added turning to face his hostess and such wonderful staff hazel i dont know how you do it thank you sir said hazel trying not to blush what time would you like me to come down for dinner ted mountbatten asked the first guests should be arriving for drinks at about sir we were hoping to serve dinner at eight if thats convenient for you couldnt be better declared mountbatten how many are you expecting around sixty sir youll find a guest list on your bedside table perhaps hazel and i could come and fetch you at you run a tight ship ted said mountbatten with approval youll find me ready the moment you appear he added as he followed carruthers out of the room once the door was closed behind him hazel said to the maid molly can you clear away the tea things please she hesitated for a moment it is molly isnt it yes maam said the girl i think he knows said ted looking a little anxious maybe but we havent time to worry about that now said hazel already on her way to carry out a further inspection of the kitchen the mound of potatoes had diminished to a peeled heap mrs travis who was preparing the sauces was calling for more pepper and for some spices to be fetched from a shop in town aware once again that she wasnt needed in the kitchen hazel moved on to the dining room where she found ted the top table was now fully laid with the kings dinner service three sets of wine glasses crested linen napkins and a glorious centrepiece of a silver pheasant which gave added sparkle who lent us that she asked i have no idea replied ted but one things for certain it will have flown home by the morning if we keep the lighting low enough whispered hazel he might not notice that the other tables all have different cutlery heavens just look at the time said ted they left the dining room and walked quickly up the stairs ted nearly barged straight into mountbattens room but remembered just in time the governor rather liked his dark blue doeskin uniform with the scarlet collar and cuffs he was admiring the ensemble in the mirror when hazel entered the room in a pink hardy amies outfit which she had originally thought a waste of money because she never expected it to be given a proper outing men are so vain she remarked as her husband continued to inspect himself in the mirror you do realise youre only meant to wear that in winter i am well aware of that said ted peevishly but its the only other uniform ive got in any case i bet mountbatten will outdo us both he flicked a piece of fluff from his trousers which he had just finished pressing the governor and his wife left the nelson room and walked down the main staircase just before to find yet another underbutler stationed by the front door and two more maids standing opposite him carrying silver trays laden with glasses of champagne hazel introduced herself to the three of them and again checked the flowers in the entrance hall as struck on the longcase clock in the lobby the first guest walked in henry said the governor lovely to see you thank you so much for the use of the rolls and bill come to that he added in a stage whisper my pleasure your excellency henry bendall replied i must say i like the uniform lady cuthbert came bustling through the front door cant stop she said ignore me just pretend im not here dotty i simply dont know what we would have done without you hazel said chasing after her across the hall delighted to lend a hand said lady cuthbert i thought id come bang on time so i could spend a few minutes in the kitchen with mrs travis by the way benson is standing out in the drive ready to rush home if you find youre still short of anything you are a saint dotty ill take you through no dont worry said lady cuthbert i know my way around you just carry on greeting your guests good evening mr mayor said ted as lady cuthbert disappeared in the direction of the kitchen good evening your excellency how kind of you to invite us to such an auspicious occasion and what a lovely dress mrs janson said the governor thank you your excellency said the mayors wife would you care for a glass of champagne said hazel as she arrived back at her husbands side by most of the guests had arrived and ted was chatting to mick flaherty when hazel touched him on the elbow he glanced towards her i think we should go and fetch him now she whispered ted nodded and asked the chief justice to take over the welcoming of the guests they wove a path through the chattering throng and climbed the great staircase when they reached the door of the queen victoria room they paused and looked at each other ted checked his watch he leaned forward and gave a gentle tap carruthers immediately opened the door to reveal mountbatten attired in his third outfit of the day full ceremonial uniform of an admiral of the fleet three stars a gold and blue sash and eight rows of campaign decorations good evening your excellency said mountbatten good evening sir said the governor star struck the admiral took three paces forward and came to a halt at the top of the staircase he stood to attention ted and hazel waited on either side of him as he didnt move they didnt carruthers proceeded slowly down the stairs in front of them stopping on the third step he cleared his throat and waited for the assembled guests to fall silent your excellency prime minister mr mayor ladies and gentlemen he announced the right honourable the earl mountbatten of burma mountbatten descended the stairs slowly as the waiting guests applauded politely as he passed carruthers the butler gave a deep bow the governor with hazel on his arm followed two paces behind he must know whispered hazel you may be right but does he know we know said ted mountbatten moved deftly around the room as ted introduced him to each of the guests in turn they bowed and curtsied listening attentively to the few words the admiral had to say to them the one exception was mick flaherty who didnt stop talking and remained more upright than ted had ever seen him before at eight oclock one of the underbutlers banged a gong which until then neither the governor nor his wife had even realised existed as the sound died away carruthers announced my lord your excellency prime minister mr mayor ladies and gentlemen dinner is served if there was a better cook on st georges than mrs travis no one at the top table had ever been fed by her and that evening she had excelled herself mountbatten chatted and smiled making no secret of how much he was enjoying himself he spent a long time talking to lady cuthbert whose husband had served under him at portsmouth and to mick flaherty to whom he listened with polite interest each course surpassed the one before souffl√© followed by lamb cutlets and an apricot hazelnut meringue to complete the feast mountbatten remarked on every one of the wines and even called for a second glass of port after dinner he joined the guests for coffee in the drawing room and managed to have a word with everyone even though colonel hodges tried to buttonhole him about defence cuts the guests began to leave a few minutes before midnight and ted was amused to see that when mick flaherty bade farewell to the admiral he bowed low and said good night my lord it has been an honour to meet you dotty was among the last to depart and she curtsied low to the guest of honour youve helped to make this such a pleasant evening lady cuthbert mountbatten told her if you only knew just how much thought hazel after the underbutler had closed the door on the last guest mountbatten turned to his hostess and said hazel i must thank you for a truly memorable occasion the head chef at the savoy couldnt have produced a finer banquet perfect in every part you are very kind sir i will pass your thanks on to the staff she just stopped herself from saying my staff is there anything else we can do for you before you retire no thank you mountbatten replied it has been a long day and with your permission ill turn in now and at what time would you like breakfast sir asked the governor would be convenient mountbatten asked that will give me time to fly out at nine certainly said ted ill see that carruthers brings a light breakfast up to your room at unless youd like something cooked a light breakfast will be just the thing mountbatten said a perfect evening your staff could not have done more hazel good night and thank you my dear the governor bowed and his lady curtsied as the great man ascended the staircase two paces behind carruthers when the butler closed the door of the queen victoria room ted put his arm around his wife and said he knows we know you may be right said hazel but does he know we know he knows ill have to think about that said ted arm in arm they returned to the kitchen where they found mrs travis packing dishes into a crate under the supervision of lady cuthbert the long lace sleeves of whose evening dress were now firmly rolled up how did you get back in dotty asked hazel just walked round to the back yard and came in the servants entrance replied lady cuthbert did you spot anything that went badly wrong hazel asked anxiously i dont think so replied lady cuthbert not unless you count mick flaherty failing to get a fourth glass of muscat de venise mrs travis said ted the head chef at the savoy couldnt have produced a finer banquet perfect in every part i do no more than repeat lord mountbattens exact words thank you your excellency said mrs travis hes got a big appetite hasnt he she added with a smile a moment later carruthers entered the kitchen he checked round the room which was spotless once again then turned to ted and said with your permission sir we will take our leave of course said the governor and may i thank you carruthers for the role you and your amazing team have played you all did a superb job lord mountbatten never stopped remarking on it his lordship is most kind sir at what time would you like us to return in the morning to prepare and serve his breakfast well he asked for a light breakfast in his room at then we will be back by said carruthers hazel opened the kitchen door to let them all out and they humped crates full of crockery and baskets full of food to the waiting cars the last person to leave was dotty who was clutching the silver pheasant hazel kissed her on both cheeks as she departed i dont know how you feel but im exhausted said ted bolting the kitchen door hazel checked her watch it was seventeen minutes past one shattered she admitted so lets try and grab some sleep because well also have to be up by seven to make sure everything is ready before he leaves for the airport ted put his arm back around his wifes waist a personal triumph for you my dear they strolled into the hall and wearily began to climb the stairs but didnt utter another word for fear of disturbing their guests repose when they reached the landing they came to an abrupt halt and stared down in horror at the sight that greeted them three pairs of black leather shoes had been placed neatly in line outside the queen victoria room now im certain he knows said hazel ted nodded and turning to his wife whispered you or me hazel pointed a finger firmly at her husband definitely you my dear she said sweetly before disappearing in the direction of the nelson room ted shrugged his shoulders picked up the admirals shoes and returned downstairs to the kitchen his excellency the governor and commanderinchief of st georges spent a considerable time polishing those three pairs of shoes as he realised that not only must they pass inspection by an admiral of the fleet but they must look as if the job had been carried out by carruthers when mountbatten returned to the admiralty in whitehall the following monday he made a full written report on his visit to st georges copies were sent to the queen and the foreign secretary the admiral told the story of his visit at a family gathering that saturday evening at windsor castle and once the laughter had died down the queen asked him when did you first become suspicious it was carruthers who gave it away he knew everything about sir ted except which regiment he had served in thats just not possible for an old soldier the queen had one further question do you think the governor knew you knew i cant be certain lillibet replied mountbatten after some thought but i intend to leave him in no doubt that i did the foreign secretary laughed uproariously when he read mountbattens report and appended a note to the last sheet asking for clarification on two points a how can you be certain that the staff who served dinner were not part of the governors entourage b do you think sir ted knew that you knew the admiral replied by return a after dinner one of the maids asked lady barker if she took sugar in her coffee but a moment later she gave lady cuthbert two lumps without needing to ask b possibly not but he certainly will on christmas day sir ted was pleased to receive a christmas card from lord mountbatten signed best wishes dickie thank you for a memorable stay it was accompanied by a gift hazel unwrapped the little parcel to discover a tin of cherry blossom shoe polish black her only comment was so now we know he knew agreed said ted with a grin but did he know we knew he knew thats what id like to know youll never live to regret it the stories indicated with an asterisk are based on known incidents some of them embellished with considerable licence the others are the product of my own imagination ja july and so it was agreed david would leave everything to pat if one of them had to die at least the other would be financially secure for the rest of their life david felt it was the least he could do for someone whod stood by him for so many years especially as he was the one who had been unfaithful they had known each other almost all their lives because their parents had been close friends for as long as either of them could remember both families had hoped david might end up marrying pats sister ruth and they were unable to hide their surprise and in pats fathers case his disapproval when the two of them started living together especially as pat was three years older than david for some time david had been putting it off and hoping for a miracle cure despite a pushy insurance broker from geneva life called marvin roebuck who had been pressing him to take a meeting for the past nine months on the first monday of the tenth month he phoned again and this time david reluctantly agreed to see him he chose a date when he knew pat would be on night duty at the hotel and asked roebuck to come round to their apartment that way he felt it would look as if it was the broker who had done the chasing david was watering the scarlet clupea harengus on the hall table when marvin roebuck pressed the buzzer on the front door once he had poured his visitor a budweiser david told him he had every type of insurance he could possibly need theft accident car property health even holiday but what about life asked marvin licking his lips thats one i dont need said david i earn a good salary i have more than enough security and on top of that my parents will leave everything to me but wouldnt it be prudent to have a lump sum that comes to you automatically on your sixtieth or sixtyfifth birthday asked marvin as he continued to push at a door that he had no way of knowing was already wide open after all you can never be sure what disaster might lie around the corner david knew exactly what disaster lay around the corner but he still innocently asked what sort of figure are you talking about well that would depend on how much you are currently earning said marvin a year said david trying to sound casual as it was almost double his real income marvin was obviously impressed and david remained silent as he carried out some rapid calculations in his head well said marvin eventually id suggest half a million dollars as a ballpark figure after all he added quickly running a finger down a page of actuarial tables he had extracted from his aluminium briefcase youre only twentyseven so the payments would be well within your means in fact you might even consider a larger sum if youre confident your income will continue to rise over the next few years it has done every year for the past seven said david this time truthfully what kind of business are you in my friend asked marvin stocks and bonds replied david not offering any details of the small firm he worked for or the junior position he held marvin licked his lips again even though they had told him not to do so on countless refresher courses especially when going in for the kill so what amount do you think i should go for asked david continuing to make sure it was always marvin who took the lead well a million is comfortably within your credit range said marvin once again checking his little book of tables the monthly payments might seem a bit steep to begin with but as the years go by what with inflation and your continual salary increases you can expect that in time they will become almost insignificant how much would i have to pay each month to end up getting a million asked david attempting to give the impression he might have been hooked assuming we select your sixtieth birthday for terminating the contract a little over a thousand dollars a month said marvin trying to make it sound a mere pittance and dont forget sixty per cent of it is tax deductible so in real terms youll only be paying around fifteen dollars a day while you end up getting a million just at the time when you most need it and by the way that one thousand is constant it never goes up in fact its inflationproof he let out a dreadful shrill laugh but would i still receive the full sum whatever happens to the market one million dollars on your sixtieth birthday confirmed marvin whatever happens short of the world coming to an end even i cant write a policy for that he said letting out another shrill laugh however my friend if unhappily you were to die before your sixtieth birthday which god forbid your dependants would receive the full amount immediately i dont have any dependants said david trying to look bored there must be someone you care about said marvin a goodlooking guy like you why dont you leave the forms with me mr roebuck and ill think about it over the weekend i promise ill get back to you marvin looked disappointed he didnt need a refresher course to be told that youre supposed to nail the client to the wall at the first meeting not let them get away because that only gave them time to think things over his lips felt dry pat returned from the evening shift in the early hours of the morning but david had stayed awake so he could go over what had happened at the meeting with marvin pat was apprehensive and uncertain about the plan david had always taken care of any problems they had had in the past especially financial ones and pat wasnt sure how it would all work out once david was no longer around to give his advice thank god it was david whod had to deal with marvin pat couldnt even say no to a doortodoor brush salesman so what do we do next asked pat wait but you promised marvin youd get back to him i know but i have absolutely no intention of doing so said david placing his arm round pats shoulder id bet a hundred dollars on marvin phoning me first thing on monday morning and dont forget i still need it to look as if hes the one whos doing the pushing as they climbed into bed pat felt an attack of asthma coming on and decided now was not the time to ask david to go over the details again after all as david had explained again and again there would never be any need for pat to meet marvin marvin phoned at on monday morning hoped to catch you before you went off to sell those stocks and bonds he said have you come to a decision yes i have said david i discussed the whole idea with my mother over the weekend and she thinks i should go for the million because five hundred thousand may not turn out to be such a large sum of money by the time i reach sixty marvin was glad that david couldnt see him licking his lips your mothers obviously a shrewd woman vas his only comment can i leave you to handle all the paperwork asked david trying to sound as if he didnt want to deal with any of the details you bet said marvin dont even think about it my friend just leave all that hassle to me i know youve made the right decision david i promise you youll never live to regret it the following day marvin phoned again to say that the paperwork had been completed and all that was now required was for david to have a medical routine was the word he kept repeating but because of the size of the sum insured it would have to be with the companys doctor in new york david made a fuss about having to travel to new york adding that perhaps hed made the wrong decision but after more pleading from marvin mixed with some unctuous persuasion he finally gave in marvin brought all the forms round to the apartment the following evening after pat had left for work david scribbled his signature on three separate documents between two pencilled crosses his final act was to print pats name in a little box marvin had indicated with his stubby finger as your sole dependant the broker explained should you pass away before september god forbid are you married to pat no we just live together replied david after a few more my friends and even more youll never live to regret its marvin left the apartment clutching the forms all you have to do now is keep your nerve david told pat once he had confirmed that the paperwork had been completed just remember no one knows me as well as you do and once its all over youll collect a million dollars when they eventually went to bed that night pat desperately wanted to make love to david but they both accepted it was no longer possible the two of them travelled down to new york together the following monday to keep the appointment david had made with geneva lifes senior medical consultant they parted a block away from the insurance companys head office as they didnt want to run the risk of being seen together they hugged each other once again but as they parted david was still worried about whether pat would be able to go through with it a couple of minutes before twelve he arrived at the surgery a young woman in a long white coat smiled up at him from behind her desk good morning he said my name is david kravits i have an appointment with dr royston oh yes mr kravits said the nurse dr royston is expecting you please follow me she led him down a long bleak corridor to the last room on the left a small brass plaque read dr royston she knocked opened the door and said mr kravits doctor dr royston turned out to be a short elderly man with only a few strands of hair left on his shiny sunburnt head he wore hornrimmed spectacles and had a look on his face which suggested that his own life insurance policy might not be far from reaching maturity he rose from his chair shook his patient by the hand and said its for a life insurance policy if i remember correctly yes thats right shouldnt take us too long mr kravits fairly routine but the company does like to be sure youre fit and well if theyre going to be liable for such a large amount of money do have a seat he said pointing to the other side of his desk i thought the sum was far too high myself i would have been happy to settle for half a million but the broker was very persuasive any serious illness during the past ten years the doctor asked obviously not interested in the brokers views no the occasional cold but nothing id describe as serious he replied good and in your immediate family any history of heart attacks cancer liver complaints not that im aware of father still alive very much so and hes fit and well jogs every morning and pumps weights in the local gym at the weekend and your mother doesnt do either but i wouldnt be surprised if she outlives him comfortably the doctor laughed any of your grandparents still living all except one my dads father died two years ago do you know the cause of death he just passed away i think at least that was how the priest described it at his funeral and how old was he the doctor asked do you remember eightyone eightytwo good repeated dr royston ticking another little box on the form in front of him have you ever suffered from any of these he asked holding up a clipboard in front of him the list began with arthritis and ended eighteen lines later with tuberculosis he ran an eye slowly down the long list before replying no none of them was all he said not admitting to asthma on this occasion do you smoke never drink socially i enjoy the occasional glass of wine with dinner but i never drink spirits excellent said the doctor and ticked the last of the little boxes now lets check your height and weight come over here please mr kravits and climb onto these scales the doctor had to stand on his toes in order to push the wooden marker up until it was flat across his patients head six feet one inch he declared then looked down at the weighing machine and flicked the little weight across until it just balanced a hundred and seventynine pounds not bad he filled in two more lines of his report perhaps just a little overweight now i need a urine sample mr kravits if you would be kind enough to take this plastic container next door fill it about halfway up leave it on the ledge when youve finished and then come back to me the doctor wrote out some more notes while his patient left the room he returned a few moments later ive left the container on the ledge was all he said good the next thing i need is a blood sample could you roll up your right sleeve the doctor placed a rubber pad around his right bicep and pumped until the veins stood out clearly a tiny prick he said youll hardly feel a thing the needle went in and he turned away as the doctor drew his blood dr royston cleaned the wound and fixed a small circular plaster over the broken skin the doctor then bent over and placed a cold stethoscope on different parts of the patients chest occasionally asking him to breathe in and out good he kept repeating finally he said that just about wraps it up mr kravits youll need to spend a few minutes down the corridor with dr harvey so she can take a chest xray and have some fun with her electric pads but after that youll be through and you can go home to he checked his pad new jersey the company will be in touch in a few days as soon as weve had the results thank you dr royston he said as he buttoned up his shirt the doctor pressed a buzzer on his desk and the nurse reappeared and led him to another room with a plaque on the door that read dr mary harvey dr harvey a smartlydressed middleaged woman with her grey hair cropped short was waiting for him she smiled at the tall handsome man and asked him to take off his shirt again and to step up onto the platform and stand in front of the xray unit place your arms behind your back and breathe in thank you next she asked him to lie down on the bed in the corner of the room she leaned over his chest smeared blodges of paste on his skin and fixed little pads to them while he stared up at the white ceiling she flicked a switch and concentrated on a tiny television screen on the corner of her desk her expression gave nothing away after she had removed the paste with a damp flannel she said you can put your shirt back on mr kravits you are now free to leave once he was fully dressed the young man hurried out of the building and down the steps and ran all the way to the corner where they had parted they hugged each other again everything go all right i think so he said they told me id be hearing from them in the next few days once theyve had the results of all their tests thank god it hasnt been a problem for you i only wish it wasnt for you dont lets even think about it said david holding tightly onto the one person he loved marvin rang a week later to let david know that dr royston had given him a clean bill of health all he had to do now was send the first instalment of to the insurance company david posted a cheque off to geneva life the following morning thereafter his payments were made by wire transfer on the first day of each month nineteen days after the seventh payment had been cleared david kravits died of aids pat tried to remember the first thing he was meant to do once the will had been read he was to contact a mr levy davids lawyer and leave everything in his hands david had warned him not to become involved in any way himself let levy as his executor make the claim from the insurance company he had said and then pass the money on to him if in any doubt say nothing was the last piece of advice david had given pat before he died ten days later pat received a letter from a claims representative at geneva life requesting an interview with the beneficiary of the policy pat passed the letter straight to davids lawyer mr levy wrote back agreeing to an interview which would take place at his clients request at the offices of levy goldberg and levy in manhattan is there anything you havent told me patrick levy asked him a few minutes before the insurance companys claims representative was due to arrive because if there is youd better tell me now no mr levy theres nothing more to tell you pat replied carrying out davids instructions to the letter from the moment the meeting began the representative of geneva life his eyes continually boring into pats bowed head left mr levy in no doubt that he was not happy about paying out on this particular claim but the lawyer stonewalled every question strengthened by the knowledge that eight months before when rigorous tests had been taken geneva lifes doctors had found no sign of davids being hiv positive levy kept repeating however much noise you make your company will have to pay up in the end he added for good measure if i have not received the full amount due to my client within thirty days i will immediately instigate proceedings against geneva life the claims representative asked levy if he would consider a deal levy glanced at pat who bowed his head even lower and replied certainly not pat arrived back at the apartment two hours later exhausted and depressed fearing that an attack of asthma might be coming on he tried to prepare some supper before he went to work but everything seemed so pointless without david he was already wondering if he should have agreed to a settlement the phone rang only once during the evening pat rushed to pick it up hoping it might be either his mother or his sister ruth it turned out to be marvin who bleated im in real trouble pat im probably going to lose my job over that policy i made out for your friend david pat said how sorry he was but felt there was nothing he could do to help yes there is insisted marvin for a start you could take out a policy yourself that might just save my skin i dont think that would be wise said pat wondering what david would have advised surely david wouldnt have wanted to see me fired marvin pleaded have mercy on me my friend i just cant afford another divorce how much would it cost me asked pat desperate to find some way of getting marvin off the line youre going to get a million dollars in cash marvin almost shouted and youre asking me what its going to cost whats a thousand dollars a month to someone as rich as you but i cant be sure that i am going to get the million pat protested thats all been settled marvin told him his voice falling by several decibels im not meant to let you know this but youll be receiving the cheque on the thirtieth of the month the company know that your lawyers got them by the balls you wouldnt even have to make the first payment until after youd received the million all right said pat desperate to be rid of him ill do it but not until ive received the cheque thank you my friend ill drop round with the paperwork tomorrow night no thats not possible said pat lm working nights this month youd better make it tomorrow afternoon you wont be working nights once youve received that cheque my friend said marvin letting out one of his dreadful shrill laughs lucky man he added before he put the phone down by the time marvin came round to the apartment the following afternoon pat was already having second thoughts if he had to visit dr royston again they would immediately realise the truth but once marvin had assured him that the medical could be with any doctor of his choice and that the first payment would be postdated he caved in and signed all the forms between the pencilled crosses making ruth his sole beneficiary he hoped david would have approved of that decision at least thank you my friend i wont be bothering you again promised marvin his final words as he closed the door behind him were i promise you youll never live to regret it pat saw his doctor a week later the examination didnt take long as pat had recently had a complete checkup on that occasion as the doctor recalled pat had appeared quite nervous and couldnt hide his relief when hed phoned to give him the allclear not much wrong with you patrick he said apart from the asthma which doesnt seem to be getting any worse marvin called a week later to let pat know that the doctor had given him a clean bill of health and that he had held on to his job with geneva life im pleased for you said pat but what about my cheque it will be paid out on the last day of the month only a matter of processing it now should be with you twentyfour hours before the first payment is due on your policy just like i said you win both ways pat rang davids lawyer on the last day of the month to ask if he had received the cheque from geneva life there was nothing in this mornings post levy told him but ill phone the other side right now in case its already been issued and is on its way if not ill start proceedings against them immediately pat wondered if he should tell levy that he had signed a cheque for which was due to be cleared the following day and that he only just had sufficient funds in his account to cover it certainly not enough to see him through until his next pay packet all his surplus cash had gone to help with davids monthly payments to geneva life he decided not to mention it david had repeatedly told him that if he was in any doubt he should say nothing ill phone you at close of business tonight and let you know exactly what the position is said levy no that wont be possible said pat im on night duty all this week in fact i have to leave for work right now perhaps you could call me first thing tomorrow morning will do promised the lawyer when pat returned home from work in the early hours he couldnt get to sleep he tossed and turned worrying how he would survive for the rest of the month if his cheque was presented to the bank that morning and he still hadnt received the million dollars from geneva life his phone rang at pat grabbed it and was relieved to hear mr levys voice on the other end of the line patrick i had a call from geneva life yesterday evening while you were at work and i must tell you that youve broken levys golden rule levys golden rule asked pat mystified yes levys golden rule its quite simple really patrick by all means drop anything you like on anyone you like but dont ever drop it all over your own lawyer i dont understand said pat your doctor has supplied geneva life with a sample of your blood and urine and they just happen to be identical to the ones dr royston has in his laboratory in the name of david kravits pat felt the blood draining from his head as he realised the trick marvin must have played on him his heart began beating faster and faster suddenly his legs gave way and he collapsed on the floor gasping for breath did you hear me patrick asked levy are you still there a paramedic team broke into the apartment twenty minutes later but moments before they reached him pat had died of a heart attack brought on by a suffocating bout of asthma mr levy did nothing until he was able to confirm with pats bankers that his clients cheque for had been cleared by the insurance company nineteen months later pats sister ruth received a payment of one million dollars from geneva life but not until they had gone through a lengthy court battle with levy goldberg and levy the jury finally accepted that pat had died of natural causes and that the insurance policy was in existence at the time of his death i promise you marvin roebuck lived to regret it never stop on the motorway the stories indicated with an asterisk are based on known incidents some of them embellished with considerable licence the others are the product of my own imagination ja july diana had been hoping to get away by five so she could be at the farm in time for dinner she tried not to show her true feelings when at her deputy phil haskins presented her with a complex twelvepage document that required the signature of a director before it could be sent out to the client haskins didnt hesitate to remind her that they had lost two similar contracts that week it was always the same on a friday the phones would go quiet in the middle of the afternoon and then just as she thought she could slip away an authorisation would land on her desk one glance at this particular document and diana knew there would be no chance of escaping before six the demands of being a single parent as well as a director of a small but thriving city company meant there were few moments left in any day to relax so when it came to the one weekend in four that james and caroline spent with her exhusband diana would try to leave the office a little earlier than usual to avoid getting snarled up in the weekend traffic she read through the first page slowly and made a couple of emendations aware that any mistake made hastily on a friday night could be regretted in the weeks to come she glanced at the clock on her desk as she signed the final page of the document it was just flicking over to diana gathered up her bag and walked purposefully towards the door dropping the contract on phils desk without bothering to suggest that he have a good weekend she suspected that the paperwork had been on his desk since nine oclock that morning but that holding it until was his only means of revenge now that she had been made head of department once she was safely in the lift she pressed the button for the basement carpark calculating that the delay would probably add an extra hour to her journey she stepped out of the lift walked over to her audi estate unlocked the door and threw her bag onto the back seat when she drove up onto the street the stream of twilight traffic was just about keeping pace with the pinstriped pedestrians who like worker ants were hurrying towards the nearest hole in the ground she flicked on the six oclock news the chimes of big ben rang out before spokesmen from each of the three main political parties gave their views on the european election results john major was refusing to comment on his future the conservative partys explanation for its poor showing was that only fortytwo per cent of the country had bothered to go to the polls diana felt guilty she was among the fiftyeight per cent who had failed to register their vote the newscaster moved on to say that the situation in bosnia remained desperate and that the un was threatening dire consequences if radovan karadzik and the serbs didnt come to an agreement with the other warring parties dianas mind began to drift such a threat was hardly news any longer she suspected that if she turned on the radio in a years time they would probably be repeating it word for word as her car crawled round russell square she began to think about the weekend ahead it had been over a year since john had told her that he had met another woman and wanted a divorce she still wondered why after seven years of marriage she hadnt been more shocked or at least angry at his betrayal since her appointment as a director she had to admit they had spent less and less time together and perhaps she had become anaesthetised by the fact that a third of the married couples in britain were now divorced or separated her parents had been unable to hide their disappointment but then they had been married for fortytwo years the divorce had been amicable enough as john who earned less than she did one of their problems perhaps had given in to most of her demands she had kept the flat in putney the audi estate and the children to whom john was allowed access one weekend in four he would have picked them up from school earlier that afternoon and as usual hed return them to the flat in putney around seven on sunday evening diana would go to almost any lengths to avoid being left on her own in putney when they werent around and although she regularly grumbled about being landed with the responsibility of bringing up two children without a father she missed them desperately the moment they were out of sight she hadnt taken a lover and she didnt sleep around none of the senior staff at the office had ever gone further than asking her out to lunch perhaps because only three of them were unmarried and not without reason the one person she might have considered having a relationship with had made it abundantly clear that he only wanted to spend the night with her not the days in any case diana had decided long ago that if she was to be taken seriously as the companys first woman director an office affair however casual or shortlived could only end in tears men are so vain she thought a woman only had to make one mistake and she was immediately labelled as promiscuous then every other man on the premises either smirks behind your back or treats your thigh as an extension of the arm on his chair diana groaned as she came to a halt at yet another red light in twenty minutes she hadnt covered more than a couple of miles she opened the glove box on the passenger side and fumbled in the dark for a cassette she found one and pressed it into the slot hoping it would be pavarotti only to be greeted by the strident tones of gloria gaynor assuring her i will survive she smiled and thought about daniel as the light changed to green she and daniel had read economics at bristol university in the early s friends but never lovers then daniel met rachael who had come up a year after them and from that moment he had never looked at another woman they married the day he graduated and after they returned from their honeymoon daniel took over the management of his fathers farm in bedfordshire three children had followed in quick succession and diana had been proud when she was asked to be godmother to sophie the eldest daniel and rachael had now been married for twelve years and diana felt confident that they wouldnt be disappointing their parents with any suggestion of a divorce although they were convinced she led an exciting and fulfilling life diana often envied their gentle and uncomplicated existence she was regularly asked to spend the weekend with them in the country but for every two or three invitations daniel issued she only accepted one not because she wouldnt have liked to join them more often but because since her divorce she had no desire to take advantage of their hospitality although she enjoyed her work it had been a bloody week two contracts had fallen through james had been dropped from the school football team and caroline had never stopped telling her that her father didnt mind her watching television when she ought to be doing her prep another traffic light changed to red it took diana nearly an hour to travel the seven miles out of the city and when she reached the first dual carriageway she glanced up at the a sign more out of habit than to seek guidance because she knew every yard of the road from her office to the farm she tried to increase her speed but it was quite impossible as both lanes remained obstinately crowded damn she had forgotten to get them a present even a decent bottle of claret damn she repeated daniel and rachael always did the giving she began to wonder if she could pick something up on the way then remembered there was nothing but service stations between here and the farm she couldnt turn up with yet another box of chocolates theyd never eat when she reached the roundabout that led onto the a she managed to push the car over fifty for the first time she began to relax allowing her mind to drift with the music there was no warning although she immediately slammed her foot on the brakes it was already too late there was a dull thump from the front bumper and a slight shudder rocked the car a small black creature had shot across her path and despite her quick reactions she hadnt been able to avoid hitting it diana swung onto the hard shoulder and screeched to a halt wondering if the animal could possibly have survived she reversed slowly back to the spot where she thought she had hit it as the traffic roared past her and then she saw it lying on the grass verge a cat that had crossed the road for the tenth time she stepped out of the car her headlights shining on the lifeless body suddenly diana felt sick she had two cats of her own and she knew she would never be able to tell the children what she had done she picked up the dead animal and laid it gently in the ditch by the roadside im so sorry she said feeling a little silly she gave it one last look before walking back to her car ironically she had chosen the audi for its safety features she climbed back into the car and switched on the ignition to find gloria gaynor was still belting out her opinion of men she turned her off and tried to stop thinking about the cat as she waited for a gap in the traffic large enough to allow her to ease her way back into the slow lane she eventually succeeded but was still unable to erase the dead cat from her mind diana had accelerated up to fifty again when she suddenly became aware of a pair of headlights shining through her rear windscreen she put up her arm and waved in her rearview mirror but the lights continued to dazzle her she slowed down to allow the vehicle to pass but the driver showed no interest in doing so diana began to wonder if there was something wrong with her car was one of her lights not working was the exhaust billowing smoke was she decided to speed up and put some distance between herself and the vehicle behind but it remained within a few yards of her bumper she tried to snatch a look at the driver in her rearview mirror but it was hard to see much in the harshness of the lights as her eyes became more accustomed to the glare she could make out the silhouette of a large black van bearing down on her and what looked like a young man behind the wheel he seemed to be waving at her diana slowed down again as she approached the next roundabout giving him every chance to overtake her on the outside lane but once again he didnt take the opportunity and just sat on her bumper his headlights still undimmed she waited for a small gap in the traffic coming from her right when one appeared she slammed her foot on the accelerator shot across the roundabout and sped on up the a she was rid of him at last she was just beginning to relax and to think about sophie who always waited up so that she could read to her when suddenly those highbeam headlights were glaring through her rear windscreen and blinding her once again if anything they were even closer to her than before she slowed down he slowed down she accelerated he accelerated she tried to think what she could do next and began waving frantically at passing motorists as they sped by but they remained oblivious to her predicament she tried to think of other ways she might alert someone and suddenly recalled that when she had joined the board of the company they had suggested she have a car phone fitted diana had decided it could wait until the car went in for its next service which should have been a fortnight ago she brushed her hand across her forehead and removed a film of perspiration thought for a moment then manoeuvred her car into the fast lane the van swung across after her and hovered so close to her bumper that she became fearful that if she so much as touched her brakes she might unwittingly cause an enormous pileup diana took the car up to ninety but the van wouldnt be shaken off she pushed her foot further down on the accelerator and touched a hundred but it still remained less than a cars length behind she flicked her headlights onto highbeam turned on her hazard lights and blasted her horn at anyone who dared to remain in her path she could only hope that the police might see her wave her onto the hard shoulder and book her for speeding a fine would be infinitely preferable to a crash with a young tearaway she thought as the audi estate passed a hundred and ten for the first time in its life but the black van couldnt be shaken off without warning she swerved back into the middle lane and took her foot off the accelerator causing the van to draw level with her which gave her a chance to look at the driver for the first time he was wearing a black leather jacket and pointing menacingly at her she shook her fist at him and accelerated away but he simply swung across behind her like an olympic runner determined not to allow his rival to break clear and then she remembered and felt sick for a second time that night oh my god she shouted aloud in terror in a flood the details of the murder that had taken place on the same road a few months before came rushing back to her a woman had been raped before having her throat cut with a knife with a serrated edge and dumped in a ditch for weeks there had been signs posted on the a appealing to passing motorists to phone a certain number if they had any information that might assist the police with their enquiries the signs had now disappeared but the police were still searching for the killer diana began to tremble as she remembered their warning to all woman drivers never stop on the motorway a few seconds later she saw a road sign she knew well she had reached it far sooner than she had anticipated in three miles she would have to leave the motorway for the sliproad that led to the farm she began to pray that if she took her usual turning the blackjacketed man would continue on up the a and she would finally be rid of him diana decided that the time had come for her to speed him on his way she swung back into the fast lane and once again put her foot down on the accelerator she reached a hundred miles per hour for the second time as she sped past the twomile sign her body was now covered in sweat and the speedometer touched a hundred and ten she checked her rearview mirror but he was still right behind her she would have to pick the exact moment if she was to execute her plan successfully with a mile to go she began to look to her left so as to be sure her timing would be perfect she no longer needed to check in her mirror to know that he would still be there the next signpost showed three diagonal white lines warning her that she ought to be on the inside lane if she intended to leave the motorway at the next junction she kept the car in the outside lane at a hundred miles per hour until she spotted a large enough gap two white lines appeared by the roadside diana knew she would have only one chance to make her escape as she passed the sign with a single white line on it she suddenly swung across the road at ninety miles per hour causing cars in the middle and inside lanes to throw on their brakes and blast out their angry opinions but diana didnt care what they thought of her because she was now travelling down the sliproad to safety and the black van was speeding on up the a she laughed out loud with relief to her right she could see the steady flow of traffic on the motorway but then her laugh turned to a scream as she saw the black van cut sharply across the motorway in front of a lorry mount the grass verge and career onto the sliproad swinging from side to side it nearly drove over the edge and into a ditch but somehow managed to steady itself ending up a few yards behind her its lights once again glaring through her rear windscreen when she reached the top of the sliproad diana turned left in the direction of the farm frantically trying to work out what she should do next the nearest town was about twelve miles away on the main road and the farm was only seven but five of those miles were down a winding unlit country lane she checked her petrol gauge it was nearing empty but there should still be enough in the tank for her to consider either option there was less than a mile to go before she reached the turning so she had only a minute in which to make up her mind with a hundred yards to go she settled on the farm despite the unlit lane she knew every twist and turn and she felt confident that her pursuer wouldnt once she reached the farm she could be out of the car and inside the house long before he could catch her in any case once he saw the farmhouse surely he would flee the minute was up diana touched the brakes and skidded into a country road illuminated only by the moon diana banged the palms of her hands on the steering wheel had she made the wrong decision she glanced up at her rearview mirror had he given up of course he hadnt the back of a land rover loomed up in front of her diana slowed down waiting for a corner she knew well where the road widened slightly she held her breath crashed into third gear and overtook would a headon collision be preferable to a cut throat she rounded the bend and saw an empty road ahead of her once again she pressed her foot down this time managing to put a clear seventy perhaps even a hundred yards between her and her pursuer but this only offered her a few moments respite before long the familiar headlights came bearing down on her once again with each bend diana was able to gain a little time as the van continued to lurch from side to side unfamiliar with the road but she never managed a clear break of more than a few seconds she checked the mileometer from the turnoff on the main road to the farm it was just over five miles and she must have covered about two by now she began to watch each tenth of a mile clicking up terrified at the thought of the van overtaking her and forcing her into the ditch she stuck determinedly to the centre of the road another mile passed and still he clung on to her suddenly she saw a car coming towards her she switched her headlights to full beam and pressed on the horn the other car retaliated by mimicking her actions which caused her to slow down and brush against the hedgerow as they shot past each other she checked the mileometer once again only two miles to go diana would slow down and then speed up at each familiar bend in the road making sure the van was never given enough room to pull level with her she tried to concentrate on what she should do once the farmhouse came into sight she reckoned that the drive leading up to the house must be about half a mile long it was full of potholes and bumps which daniel had often explained he couldnt afford to have repaired but at least it was only wide enough for one car the gate to the driveway was usually left open for her though on the odd rare occasion daniel had forgotten and shed had to get out of the car and open it for herself she couldnt risk that tonight if the gate was closed she would have to travel on to the next town and stop outside the crimson kipper which was always crowded at this time on a friday night or if she could find it on the steps of the local police station she checked her petrol gauge again it was now touching red oh my god she said realising she might not have enough petrol to reach the town she could only pray that daniel had remembered to leave the gate open she swerved out of the next bend and speeded up but once again she managed to gain only a few yards and she knew that within seconds he would be back in place he was for the next few hundred yards they remained within feet of each other and she felt certain he must run into the back of her she didnt once dare to touch her brakes if they crashed in that lane far from any help she would have no hope of getting away from him she checked her mileometer a mile to go the gate must be open it must be open she prayed as she swung round the next bend she could make out the outline of the farmhouse in the distance she almost screamed with relief when she saw that the lights were on in the downstairs rooms she shouted thank god then remembered the gate again and changed her plea to dear god let it be open she would know what needed to be done as soon as she came round the last bend let it be open just this once she pleaded ill never ask for anything again ever she swung round the final bend only inches ahead of the black van please please please and then she saw the gate it was open her clothes were now drenched in sweat she slowed down wrenched the gearbox into second and threw the car between the gap and into the bumpy driveway hitting the gatepost on her right hand side as she careered on up towards the house the van didnt hesitate to follow her and was still only inches behind as she straightened up diana kept her hand pressed down on the horn as the car bounced and lurched over the mounds and potholes flocks of startled crows flapped out of overhanging branches screeching as they shot into the air diana began screaming daniel daniel two hundred yards ahead of her the porch light went on her headlights were now shining onto the front of the house and her hand was still pressed on the horn with a hundred yards to go she spotted daniel coming out of the front door but she didnt slow down and neither did the van behind her with fifty yards to go she began flashing her lights at daniel she could now make out the puzzled anxious expression on his face with thirty yards to go she threw on her brakes the heavy estate car skidded across the gravel in front of the house coming to a halt in the flowerbed just below the kitchen window she heard the screech of brakes behind her the leatherjacketed man unfamiliar with the terrain had been unable to react quickly enough and as soon as his wheels touched the gravelled forecourt he began to skid out of control a second later the van came crashing into the back of her car slamming it against the wall of the house and shattering the glass in the kitchen window diana leapt out of the car screaming daniel get a gun get a gun she pointed back at the van that bastards been chasing me for the last twenty miles the man jumped out of the van and began limping towards them diana ran into the house daniel followed and grabbed a shotgun normally reserved for rabbits that was leaning against the wall he ran back outside to face the unwelcome visitor who had come to a halt by the back of dianas audi daniel raised the shotgun to his shoulder and stared straight at him dont move or ill shoot he said calmly and then he remembered the gun wasnt loaded diana ducked back out of the house but remained several yards behind him not me not me shouted the leatherjacketed youth as rachael appeared in the doorway whats going on she asked nervously ring for the police was all daniel said and his wife quickly disappeared back into the house daniel advanced towards the terrifiedlooking young man the gun aimed squarely at his chest not me not me he shouted again pointing at the audi hes in the car he quickly turned to face diana i saw him get in when you were parked on the hard shoulder what else could i have done you just wouldnt pull over daniel advanced cautiously towards the rear door of the car and ordered the young man to open it slowly while he kept the gun aimed at his chest the youth opened the door and quickly took a pace backwards the three of them stared down at a man crouched on the floor of the car in his right hand he held a longbladed knife with a serrated edge daniel swung the barrel of the gun down to point at him but said nothing the sound of a police siren could just be heard in the distance not for sale sally summers won her schools senior art prize at the age of fourteen in her last four years at st brides the only serious competition was for second place when in her final year she was awarded the top scholarship to the slade school of fine art none of her contemporaries was at all surprised the headmistress told the assembled parents on speech day that she was confident sally had a distinguished career ahead of her and that her work would soon be exhibited in one of londons major galleries sally was flattered by all this unqualified praise but still wasnt sure if she had any real talent by the end of her first year at the slade the staff and senior students were already becoming aware of sallys work her drawing technique was regarded as quite exceptional and her brushwork became bolder with each term but above all it was the originality of her ideas that caused other students to stop and stare at her canvases in her final year sally won both the mary rischgitz prize for oil painting and the henry tonks prize for drawing a rare double they were presented to her by sir roger de grey the president of the royal academy and sally was among that tiny group who were spoken of as having a future but surely she told her parents that could be said of the top student in any year and most of them ended up working in the creative departments of advertising agencies or teaching art to bored schoolchildren in farflung parts of the kingdom once she had graduated sally had to decide whether she too would apply for a job with an advertising agency take up a teaching appointment or risk everything and try to put together enough original work for a london gallery to consider her for a onewoman show her parents were convinced that their daughter had real talent but what do parents know when youre their only child thought sally especially when one of them was a music teacher and the other an accountant who were the first to admit that they didnt know much about art but they knew what they liked still they seemed quite willing to support her for another year if she wanted to use an expression of the young to go for it sally was painfully aware that although her parents were fairly comfortably off another year in which she produced no income could only be a burden for them after much soulsearching she told them one year and one year only after that if the paintings arent good enough or if no one shows any interest in exhibiting them ill be realistic and look for a proper job for the next six months sally worked hours that she hadnt realised existed when shed been a student during that time she produced a dozen canvases she allowed no one to see them for fear that her parents and friends would not be frank with her she was determined to finish her portfolio and then listen only to the toughest opinions possible those of the professional gallery owners and tougher still those of the buying public sally had always been a voracious reader and she continued to devour books and monographs on artists from bellini to hockney the more she read the more she became aware that however talented an artist might be it was industry and dedication that ultimately marked out the few who succeeded from the many who failed this inspired her to work still harder and she began to turn down invitations to parties dances even weekends with old friends making use of every spare moment to visit art galleries or to attend lectures on the great masters by the eleventh month sally had completed twentyseven works but she still wasnt sure whether they displayed any real talent nevertheless she felt the time had finally come to allow others to pass judgement on them she looked long and hard at each of the twentyseven paintings and the following morning she packed six of them in a large canvas folder her parents had given her the previous christmas and joined the earlymorning commuters on their journey from sevenoaks into london sally began her quest in cork street where she came across galleries exhibiting works by bacon freud hockney dunston and chadwick she felt overawed at the prospect of even entering their portals let alone submitting her own humble work to the appraisal of their proprietors she humped her canvas folder a couple of blocks north to conduit street and in the windows she recognised the works of jones campbell wczenski frink and paolozzi she became even more discouraged and unwilling to push open any of the galleries front doors sally returned home that night exhausted her canvas folder unopened she understood for the first time how an author must feel after receiving a string of rejection slips she was unable to sleep that night but as she lay awake she came to the conclusion that she must know the truth about her work even if it meant being humiliated she joined the commuters again the following morning and this time headed for duke street st jamess she didnt bother with the galleries exhibiting old masters dutch still lifes or english landscapes and therefore walked straight past johnny van haeften and rafael vails halfway down the street she turned right and finally came to a halt outside the simon bouchier gallery which was exhibiting the sculptures of the late sydney harpley and the paintings of muriel pemberton whose obituary sally had read in the independent only a few days before it was the thought of death that made sally settle on the bouchier gallery perhaps they would be looking for someone young she tried to convince herself someone who had a long career ahead of them she stepped inside the gallery and found herself in a large empty room surrounded by muriel pembertons watercolours can i help you asked a young woman who was sitting behind a desk near the window no thank you sally replied i was just looking the girl eyed sallys canvas folder but said nothing sally decided she would do one circuit of the room and then make good her escape she began to circle the gallery studying the pictures carefully they were good very good but sally believed she could do just as well given time she would have liked to see muriel pembertons work when she was her age when sally reached the far end of the gallery she became aware of an office in which a short balding man wearing an old tweed jacket and corduroy trousers was closely examining a picture he looked about the same age as her father also studying the picture was another man who caused sally to stop in her tracks he must have been a little over six foot with those dark italian looks that people normally only come across in glossy magazines and he was old enough to be her brother was he mr bouchier she wondered she hoped so because if he owned the gallery she might be able to summon up the courage to introduce herself to him once the little man in the scruffy jacket had left at that moment the young man looked up and gave her a huge grin sally turned quickly away and began to study the pictures on the far wall she was wondering if it was worth hanging around any longer when the two men suddenly strolled out of the office and began walking towards the door she froze pretending to concentrate on a portrait of a young girl in pastel blues and yellows a picture that had a matisselike quality about it whats in there asked a cheeky voice sally turned round and came face to face with the two men the smaller one was pointing at her canvas bag just a few pictures sally stammered im an artist lets have a look said the man and perhaps i can decide if youre an artist or not sally hesitated come on come on he teased i havent got all day as you can see i have an important client to take to lunch he added indicating the tall welldressed young man who still hadnt spoken oh are you mr bouchier she asked unable to hide her disappointment yes now am i going to be allowed to look at your pictures or not sally quickly unzipped her canvas bag and laid out the six paintings on the floor both of the men bent down and studied them for some time before either offered an opinion not bad said bouchier eventually not bad at all leave them with me for a few days and then lets meet again next week he paused say monday and if you have any more examples of your recent work bring them with you sally was speechless cant see you before monday he continued because the ras summer exhibition opens tomorrow so for the next few days i wont have a moment to spare now if youll excuse me the younger man was still examining sallys pictures closely at last he looked up at her id like to buy the one of the interior with the black cat on the windowsill how much is it well said sally im not sure nfs said mr bouchier firmly guiding his client towards the door by the way the taller man said turning back i am antonio flavelli my friends call me tony but mr bouchier was already pushing him out onto the street sally returned home that afternoon with an empty canvas folder and was prepared to admit to her parents that a london dealer had shown an interest in her work but it was she insisted no more than an interest the following morning sally decided to go to the opening day of the royal academy summer exhibition which would give her the chance to find out just how good her rivals were for over an hour she stood in the long queue that stretched from the front door right across the carpark and out onto the pavement when she eventually reached the top of the wide staircase she wished she was six feet six tall so that she could see over the tops of the heads of the mass of people who were crowding every room after a couple of hours strolling round the many galleries sally was confident that she was already good enough to enter a couple of her pictures for next years exhibition she stopped to admire a craigie aitchison of christ on the cross and checked in her little blue catalogue to find out the price ten thousand pounds more than she could hope to earn if she were to sell every one of her canvases suddenly her concentration was broken as a soft italian voice behind her said hello sally she swung round to find tony flavelli smiling down at her mr flavelli she said tony please you like craigie aitchison hes superb sally replied i know his work well i had the privilege of being taught by him when i was at the slade i can remember not so long ago when you could pick up an aitchison for two three hundred pounds at the most perhaps the same thing will happen to you one day have you seen anything else you think i ought to look at sally was flattered to have her advice sought by a serious collector and said yes i think the sculpture of books on a chair by julie major is very striking she has talent and im sure she has a future so do you said tony do you think so asked sally its not important what i think said tony but simon bouchier is convinced are you teasing me asked sally no im not as youll find out for yourself when you see him next monday he talked of little else over lunch yesterday the daring brushwork the unusual use of colour the originality of ideas i thought he was never going to stop still hes promised i can have the sleeping cat that never moved once youve both settled on a price sally was speechless good luck tony said turning to leave not that i think you need it he hesitated for a moment before swinging back to face her by the way are you going to the hockney exhibition i didnt even know there was one sally confessed theres a private view this evening six to eight looking straight into her eyes he said would you like to join me she hesitated but only for a moment that would be nice good then why dont we meet in the ritz palm court at before sally could tell him that she didnt know where the ritz was let alone its palm court the tall elegant man had disappeared into the crowd sally suddenly felt gauche and scruffy but then she hadnt dressed that morning with the ritz in mind she looked at her watch and began to wonder if she had enough time to return home change and be back at the ritz by she decided that she didnt have much choice as she doubted if they would let her into such a grand hotel dressed in jeans and a tshirt of munchs the scream she ran down the wide staircase out onto piccadilly and all the way to the nearest tube station when she arrived back home in sevenoaks far earlier than her mother had expected she rushed into the kitchen and explained that she would be going out again shortly was the summer exhibition any good her mother asked not bad sally replied as she ran upstairs but once she was out of earshot she muttered under her breath certainly didnt see a lot that worried me will you be in for supper asked her mother sticking her head out from behind the kitchen door i dont think so shouted sally she disappeared into her bedroom and began flinging off her clothes before heading for the bathroom she crept back downstairs an hour later having tried on and rejected several outfits she checked her dress in the hall mirror a little too short perhaps but at least it showed her legs to best advantage she could still remember those art students who during life classes had spent more time staring at her legs than at the model they were supposed to be drawing she only hoped tony would be similarly captivated bye mum she shouted and quickly closed the door behind her before her mother could see what she was wearing sally took the next train back to charing cross she stepped on to the platform unwilling to admit to any passerby that she had no idea where the ritz was so she hailed a taxi praying she could get to the hotel for four pounds because that was all she had on her her eyes remained fixed on the meter as it clicked past two pounds and then three far too quickly she thought three pounds twenty forty sixty eighty she was just about to ask the cabbie to stop so she could jump out and walk the rest of the way when he drew in to the kerb the door was immediately opened by a statuesque man dressed in a heavy blue trenchcoat who raised his top hat to her sally handed over her four pounds to the cabbie feeling guilty about the measly twenty pence tip she ran up the steps through the revolving door and into the hotel foyer she checked her watch she decided she had better go back outside walk slowly around the block and return a little later but just as she reached the door an elegant man in a long black coat approached her and asked can i help you madam im meeting mr tony flavelli sally stammered hoping he would recognise the name mr flavelli of course madam allow me to show you to his table in the palm court she followed the blackcoated man down the wide deeply carpeted corridor then up three steps to a large open area full of small circular tables almost all of which were occupied sally was directed to a table at the side and once she was seated a waiter asked can i get you something to drink madam a glass of champagne perhaps oh no said sally a coke will be just fine the waiter bowed and left her sally gazed nervously around the beautifully furnished room everyone seemed so relaxed and sophisticated the waiter returned a few moments later and placed a fine cutglass tumbler with cocacola ice and lemon in front of her she thanked him and began sipping her drink checking her watch every few minutes she pulled her dress down as far as it would go wishing she had chosen something longer she was becoming anxious about what would happen if tony didnt turn up because she didnt have any money left to pay for her drink and then suddenly she saw him dressed in a loose doublebreasted suit and an openneck cream shirt he had stopped to chat to an elegant young woman on the steps after a couple of minutes he kissed her on the cheek and made his way over to sally i am so sorry he said i didnt mean to keep you waiting i do hope im not late no no youre not i arrived a few minutes early sally said flustered as he bent down and kissed her hand what did you think of the summer exhibition he asked as the waiter appeared by his side your usual sir he asked yes thank you michael he replied i enjoyed it said sally but but you felt you could have done just as well yourself he suggested i didnt mean to imply that she said looking up to see if he was teasing but the expression on his face remained serious im sure i will enjoy the hockney more she added as a glass of champagne was placed on the table then ill have to come clean said tony sally put down her drink and stared at him not knowing what he meant there isnt a hockney exhibition on at the moment he said unless you want to fly to glasgow sally looked puzzled but you said i just wanted an excuse to see you again sally felt bemused and flattered and was uncertain how to respond ill leave the choice to you he said we could have dinner together or you could simply take the train back to sevenoaks how did you know i live in sevenoaks it was inscribed in big bold letters on the side of your canvas folder said tony with a smile sally laughed ill settle for dinner she said tony paid for the drinks then guided sally out of the hotel and a few yards down the road to a restaurant on the corner of arlington street this time sally did try a glass of champagne and allowed tony to select for her from the menu he could not have been more attentive and seemed to know so much about so many things even if she didnt manage to find out exactly what he did after tony had called for the bill he asked her if she would like to have coffee at my place im afraid i cant she said looking at her watch id miss the last train home then ill drive you to the station we wouldnt want you to miss the last train home would we he said scrawling his signature across the bill this time she knew he was teasing her and she blushed when tony dropped her off at chafing cross he asked when can i see you again i have an appointment with mr bouchier at next monday morning if i remember correctly so why dont we have a celebration lunch together after hes signed you up ill come to the gallery at about goodbye he leaned over and kissed her gently on the lips sitting in a cold smelly carriage on the last train back to sevenoaks sally couldnt help wondering what coffee at tonys place might have been like sally walked into the gallery a few minutes before the following monday to find simon bouchier kneeling on the carpet head down studying some paintings they werent hers and she hoped he felt the same way about them as she did simon looked up good morning sally dreadful arent they you have to look through an awful lot of rubbish before you come across someone who shows any real talent he rose to his feet mind you natasha krasnoselyodkina does have one advantage over you whats that asked sally she would draw the crowds for any opening why because she claims to be a russian countess hints shes a direct descendant of the last tsar frankly i think the pearly queen is about the nearest shes been to royalty but still shes the in face at the moment a sort of minah bird of the nineties what did andy warhol say in the future everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes by that standard natasha looks good for about thirty i see this mornings tabloids are even hinting shes the new love in prince andrews life my bet is theyve never met but if he were to turn up at the opening wed be packed out thats for sure we wouldnt sell a picture of course but wed be packed out why wouldnt you sell anything asked sally because the public are not that stupid when it comes to buying paintings a picture is a large investment for most people and they want to believe that they have a good eye and that theyve invested wisely natashas pictures wont satisfy them on either count with you though sally im beginning to feel they might be convinced on both but first let me see the rest of your portfolio sally unzipped her bulging folder and laid out twentyone paintings on the carpet simon dropped to his knees and didnt speak again for some time when he eventually did offer an opinion it was only to repeat the single word consistent but ill need even more and of the same quality he said after he had risen to his feet another dozen canvases at least and by october i want you to concentrate on interiors youre good at interiors and theyll have to be better than good if you expect me to invest my time expertise and a great deal of money in you young lady do you think you can manage another dozen pictures by october miss summers yes of course said sally giving little thought to the fact that october was only five months away thats good because if you deliver and i only say if ill risk the expense of launching you on an unsuspecting public this autumn he walked into his office flicked through his diary and said october the seventeenth to be precise sally was speechless i dont suppose you could manage an affair with prince charles lasting say from the end of september to the beginning of november that would knock the russian countess from the mile end road off the front pages and guarantee us a full house on opening night im afraid not said sally especially if you expect me to produce another dozen canvases by then pity said simon because if we can attract the punters to the opening im confident theyll want to buy your work the problem is always getting them to come for an unknown he suddenly looked over sallys shoulder and said hello tony i wasnt expecting to see you today perhaps thats because youre not seeing me tony replied ive just come to whisk sally off to what i was rather hoping might be a celebratory lunch the summers exhibition simon said grinning at his little play on words will open not in june at the royal academy but in october at the bouchier gallery october the seventeenth is to be sallys day of reckoning congratulations said tony turning to sally ill bring all my friends im only interested in the rich ones said simon as someone else entered the gallery natasha said simon turning to face a slim darkhaired woman sallys first reaction was that she should have been an artists model not an artist thanks for coming back so quickly natasha have a nice lunch you two he added smiling at tony who couldnt take his eyes off th new arrival natasha didnt notice as her only interest seemed to be in sallys pictures she was unable to conceal her envy as tony and sally walked out of the gallery wasnt she stunning said sally was she said tony i didnt notice i wouldnt blame prince andrew if he was having an affair with her damn said tony placing a hand in his inside pocket i forgot to give simon a cheque i promised him dont move ill be back in a minute tony sprinted off in the direction of the gallery and sally waited on the corner for what seemed like an awfully long minute before he reappeared back on the street sorry simon was on the phone tony explained he took sallys arm and led her across the road to a small italian restaurant where once again he seemed to have his own table he ordered a bottle of champagne to celebrate your great triumph as sally raised her glass in response she realised for the first time just how much work she would have to do before october if she was going to keep her promise to simon when tony poured her a second glass sally smiled its been a memorable day i ought to phone my parents and let them know but i dont think theyd believe me when a third glass had been filled and sally still hadnt finished her salad tony took her hand leaned across and kissed it ive never met anyone as beautiful as you he said and certainly no one as talented sally quickly took a gulp of the champagne to hide her embarrassment she still wasnt sure whether to believe him but a glass of white wine followed by two glasses of red helped to convince her that she should after tony had signed the bill he asked her again if she would like to come back to his place for coffee sally had already decided that she wasnt going to be able to do any work that day so she nodded her agreement in any case she felt she had earned an afternoon off in the taxi on the way to chelsea she rested her head on tonys shoulder and he began to kiss her gently when they arrived at his town house in bywater street he helped her out of the taxi up the steps and through the front door he led her along a dimly lit corridor and into the drawing room she curled up in a corner of the sofa as tony disappeared into another room most of the furniture and the pictures that covered every inch of the walls were a blur to her tony returned a moment later carrying another bottle of champagne and two glasses sally didnt notice that he was no longer wearing his jacket tie or shoes he poured her a drink which she sipped as he sat down next to her on the sofa his arm slipped round her shoulder and he drew her close to him when he kissed her again she felt a little silly dangling an empty glass in midair he took it from her and placed it on a side table then held her in his arms and began to kiss her more passionately as she fell back his hand slipped onto the inside of her thigh and began moving slowly up her leg every time sally was about to stop him going any further tony seemed to know exactly what to do next she had always felt in control in the past whenever an overenthusiastic art student had started to go a little too far in the back row of a cinema but she had never experienced anyone as subtle as tony when her dress fell off her shoulders she hadnt even noticed that he had undone the twelve little buttons down the back they broke away for a second sally felt she ought to make a move to go before it was too late tony smiled and undid the buttons of his own shirt before taking her back in his arms she felt the warmth of his chest and he was so gentle that she did not complain when she realised that the clasp of her bra had come loose she sank back enjoying every second knowing that until that moment she had never experienced what it was like to be properly seduced tony finally lay back and said yes it has been a memorable day but i dont think ill phone my parents to let them know he laughed and sally felt slightly ashamed tony was only the fourth man who had made love to her and she had known the other three for months beforehand in one case years for the next hour they talked about many things but all sally really wanted to know was how tony felt about her he gave her no clue then once again he took her in his arms but this time he pulled her onto the floor and made love to her with such passion that afterwards sally wondered if she had ever made love before she was just in time to catch the last train home but she couldnt help wishing she had missed it over the next few months sally devoted herself to getting her latest ideas onto canvas when each new painting was finished she would take it up to london for simon to comment on the smile on his face became broader and broader with each new picture he saw and the word he kept repeating now was original sally would tell him about her ideas for the next one and he would bring her up to date with his plans for the opening in october tony would often meet her for lunch and afterwards they would go back to his house where they would make love until it was time for her to catch the last train home sally often wished she could spend more time with tony but she was always conscious of the deadline set by simon who warned her that the printers were already proofreading the catalogue and that the invitations for the opening were waiting to be sent out tony seemed almost as busy as she was and lately he hadnt always been able to fit in with her expeditions to london sally had taken to staying overnight and catching an early train home the following morning tony occasionally hinted that she might consider moving in with him when she thought about it and she often did she reflected that his attic could easily be converted into a studio but she decided that before such a move could even be contemplated the exhibition had to be a success then if the hint became an offer she would have her answer ready just two days before the exhibition was due to open sally completed her final canvas and handed it over to simon as she pulled it out of the canvas folder he threw his arms in the air and shouted hallelujah its your best yet as long as were sensible about our prices i think that with a touch of luck we should sell at least half of your pictures before the exhibition closes only half said sally unable to hide her disappointment that wouldnt be at all bad for your first attempt young lady said simon i only sold one leslie anne ivory at her first exhibition and now she sells everything in the first week sally still looked crestfallen and simon realised he had perhaps been a little tactless dont worry any unsold ones will be put into stock and theyll be snapped up the moment you start getting good reviews sally continued to pout how do you feel about the frames and mounts simon asked trying to change the subject sally studied the deep golden frames and lightgrey mounts the smile returned to her face theyre good arent they said simon they bring out the colour in the canvases wonderfully sally nodded her agreement but was now beginning to worry about how much they must have cost and whether she would ever be given a second exhibition if the first one wasnt a success by the way simon said i have a friend at the pa called mike sallis who pa said sally press association mikes a photographer always on the lookout for a good story he says hell come round and take a picture of you standing next to one of the pictures then hell hawk the photo around fleet street and well just have to cross our fingers and pray that natasha has taken the day off i dont want to get your hopes up but someone just might bite our only line at present is that its your first exhibition since leaving the slade hardly a frontpage splash simon paused as once again sally looked discouraged its not too late for you to have a fling with prince charles you know that would solve all our problems sally smiled i dont think tony would like that simon decided against making another tactless remark sally spent that evening with tony at his home in chelsea he seemed a little distracted but she blamed herself she was unable to hide her disappointment at simons estimate of how few of her pictures might be sold after they had made love sally tried to raise the topic of what would happen to them once the exhibition was over but tony deftly changed the subject back to how much he was looking forward to the opening that night sally went home on the last train from charing cross the following morning she woke up with a terrible feeling of anticlimax her room was bereft of canvases and all she could do now was wait her mood wasnt helped by the fact that tony had told her he would be out of london on business until the day of her opening she lay in the bath thinking about him but ill be your first customer on the night he had promised dont forget i still want to buy the sleeping cat that never moved the phone was ringing but someone answered it before sally could get out of the bath its for you shouted her mother from the bottom of the stairs sally wrapped a towel around her and grabbed the phone hoping it would be tony hi sally its simon ive got some good news mike sallis has just called from the pa hes coming round to the gallery at midday tomorrow all the pictures should be framed by then and hell be the first person from the press to see them they all want to be first im trying to think up some wheeze to convince him that its an exclusive by the way the catalogues have arrived and they look fantastic sally thanked him and was about to ring tony to suggest that she stay overnight with him so that they could go to the gallery together the following day when she remembered that he was out of town she spent the day pacing anxiously around the house occasionally talking to her most compliant model the sleeping cat that never moved the following morning sally caught an early commuter train from sevenoaks so she could spend a little time checking the pictures against their catalogue entries when she walked into the gallery her eyes lit up half a dozen of the paintings had already been hung and she actually felt for the first time that they really werent bad she glanced in the direction of the office and saw that simon was occupied on the phone he smiled and waved to indicate that he would be with her in a moment she had another look at the pictures and then spotted a copy of the catalogue lying on the table the cover read the summers exhibition above a picture of an interior looking from her parents drawing room through an open window and out onto a garden overgrown with weeds a black cat lay asleep on the windowsill ignoring the rain sally opened the catalogue and read the introduction on the first page sometimes judges feel it necessary to say its been hard to pick this years winner but from the moment one set eyes on sally summers work the task was made easy real talent is obvious for all to see and sally has achieved the rare feat of winning both the slades major prizes for oils and for drawing in the same year i much look forward to watching her career develop over the coming years it was an extract from sir roger de greys speech when he had presented sally with the mary rischgitz and the henry tonks prizes at the slade two years before sally turned the pages seeing her works reproduced in colour for the first time simons attention to detail and layout was evident on every page she looked back towards the office and saw that simon was still on the phone she decided to go downstairs and check on the rest of her pictures now that they had all been framed the lower gallery was a mass of colour and the newly framed paintings were so skilfully hung that even sally saw them in a new light once she had circled the room sally suppressed a smile of satisfaction before turning to make her way back upstairs as she passed a table in the centre of the gallery she noticed a folder with the initials n k printed on it she idly lifted the cover to discover a pile of undistinguished watercolours as she leafed through her rivals nevertobeexhibited efforts sally had to admit that the nude selfportraits didnt do natasha justice she was just about to close the folder and join simon upstairs when she came to a sudden halt although it was clumsily executed there was no doubt who the man was that the halfclad natasha was clinging on to sally felt sick she slammed the folder shut walked quickly across the room and back up the stairs to the ground floor in the corner of the large gallery simon was chatting to a man who had several cameras slung over his shoulder sally he said coming towards her this is mike but sally ignored them both and started running towards the open door tears flooding down her cheeks she turned right into st jamess determined to get as far away from the gallery as possible but then she came to an abrupt halt tony and natasha were walking towards her arm in arm sally stepped off the pavement and began to cross the road hoping to reach the other side before they spotted her the screech of tyres and the sudden swerve of the van came just a moment too late and she was thrown headlong into the middle of the road when sally came to she felt awful she blinked her eyes and thought she could hear voices she blinked again but it was several moments before she was able to focus on anything she was lying in a bed but it was not her own her right leg was covered in plaster and was raised high in the air suspended from a pulley her other leg was under the sheet and it felt all right she wiggled the toes of her left foot yes they were fine then she began to try to move her arms a nurse came up to the side of the bed welcome back to the world sally how long have i been like this she asked a couple of days said the nurse checking sallys pulse but youre making a remarkably quick recovery before you ask its only a broken leg and the black eyes will have gone long before we let you out by the way she added as she moved on to the next patient i loved that picture of you in the morning papers and what about those flattering remarks your friend made so whats it like to be famous sally wanted to ask what she was talking about but the nurse was already taking the pulse of the person in the next bed come back sally wanted to say but a second nurse had appeared by her bedside with a mug of orange juice which she thrust into her hand lets get you started on this she said sally obeyed and tried to suck the liquid through a bent plastic straw youve got a visitor the nurse told her once shed emptied the contents of the mug hes been waiting for some time do you think youre up to seeing him sure said sally not particularly wanting to face tony but desperate to find out what had happened she looked towards the swing doors at the end of the ward but had to wait for some time before simon came bouncing through them he walked straight up to her bed clutching what might just about have been described as a bunch of flowers he gave her plaster cast a big kiss im so sorry simon sally said before he had even said hello i know just how much trouble and expense youve been to on my behalf and now ive let you down so badly you certainly have said simon its always a letdown when you sell everything off the walls on the first night then you havent got anything left for your old customers and they start grumbling sallys mouth opened wide mind you it was a rather good photo of natasha even if it was an awful one of you what are you talking about simon mike sallis got his exclusive and you got your break he said patting her suspended leg when natasha bent over your body in the street mike began clicking away for dear life and i couldnt have scripted her quotes better myself the most outstanding young artist of our generation if the world were to lose such a talent sally laughed at simons wicked imitation of natashas russian accent you hit most of the next mornings front pages he continued brush with death in the mail still life in st jamess in the express and you even managed splat in the sun the punters flocked into the gallery that evening natasha was wearing a black seethrough dress and proceeded to give the press soundbite after soundbite about your genius not that it made any difference wed already sold every canvas long before their second editions hit the street but more important the serious critics in the broadsheets are already acknowledging that you might actually have some talent sally smiled i may have failed to have an affair with prince charles but at least it seems i got something right well not exactly said simon what do you mean asked sally suddenly anxious you said all the pictures have been sold true but if youd arranged to have the accident a few days earlier i could have jacked up the prices by at least fifty per cent still theres always next time did tony buy the sleeping cat that never moved sally asked quietly no he was late as usual im afraid it was snapped up in the first half hour by a serious collector which reminds me simon added as sallys parents came through the swing doors into the ward ill need another forty canvases if were going to hold your second show in the spring so youd better get back to work right away but look at me you silly man sally said laughing how do you expect me to dont be so feeble said simon tapping her plaster cast its your leg thats out of action not your arm sally grinned and looked up to see her parents standing at the end of the bed is this tony her mother asked good heavens no mother laughed sally this is simon hes far more important mind you she confessed i made the same mistake the first time i met him timeo danaos the stories indicated with an asterisk are based on known incidents some of them embellished with considerable licence the others are the product of my own imagination ja july arnold bacon would have made a fortune if he hadnt taken his fathers advice arnolds occupation as described in his passport was banker for those of you who are pedantic about such matters he was the branch manager of barclays bank in st albans hertfordshire which in banking circles is about the equivalent of being a captain in the royal army pay corps his passport also stated that he was born in was five feet nine inches tall with sandy hair and no distinguishing marks although in fact he had several lines on his forehead which served only to prove that he frowned a great deal he was a member of the local rotary club hon treasurer the conservative party branch vicechairman and was a past secretary of the st albans festival he had also played rugby for the old albanians nd xv in the s and cricket for st albans cc in the s his only exercise for the past two decades however had been the occasional round of golf with his opposite number from the national westminster arnold did not boast a handicap during these excursions round the golf course arnold would often browbeat his opponent with his conviction that he should never have been a banker in the first place after years of handing out loans to customers who wanted to start up their own businesses he had become painfully aware that he himself was really one of natures born entrepreneurs if only he hadnt listened to his fathers advice and followed him into the bank heaven knows what heights he might have reached by now his colleague nodded wearily then holed a sevenfoot putt ensuring that the drinks would not be on him hows deirdre he asked as the two men strolled towards the clubhouse wants to buy a new dinner service said arnold which slightly puzzled his companion not that i can see whats wrong with our old coronation set when they reached the bar arnold checked his watch before ordering half a pint of lager for himself and a gin and tonic for the victor as deirdre wouldnt be expecting him back for at least an hour he stopped pontificating only when another member began telling them the latest rumours about the club captains wife deirdre bacon arnolds longsuffering wife had come to accept that her husband was now too set in his ways for her to hope for any improvement although she had her own opinions on what would have happened to arnold if he hadnt followed his fathers advice she no longer voiced them at the time of their engagement she had considered arnold bacon quite a catch but as the years passed she had become more realistic about her expectations and after two children one of each sex she had settled into the life of a housewife and mother not that anything else had ever been seriously contemplated the children had now grown up justin to become a solicitors clerk in chelmsford and virginia to marry a local boy whom arnold described as an official with british rail deirdre more accurately told her friends at the hairdressers that keith was a train driver for the first ten years of their marriage the bacons had holidayed in bournemouth because arnolds parents had always done so they only graduated to the costa del sol after arnold read in the daily telegraphs sun supplement that that was where most bank managers were to be found during the month of august for many years arnold had promised his wife that they would do something special when it came to celebrating their twentyfifth wedding anniversary though he had never actually committed himself to defining what special meant it was only when he read in the banks quarterly staff magazine that andrew buxton the chairman of barclays would be spending his summer sailing around the greek islands on a private yacht that arnold began writing off to numerous cruise companies and travel agents requesting copies of their brochures after having studied hundreds of glossy pages he settled on a sevenday cruise aboard the princess corina starting out from piraeus to sail around the greek islands ending up at mykonos deirdres only contribution to the discussion was that she would rather go back to the costa del sol and spend the money they saved on a new dinner service she was delighted however to read in one of the brochures that the greeks were famous for their pottery by the time they boarded the coach to heathrow arnolds junior staff fellow members of the rotary club and even a few of his more select customers were becoming tired of being reminded of how arnold would be spending his summer break i shall be sailing around the greek islands on a liner he would tell them not unlike the banks chairman andrew buxton you know if anyone asked deirdre what she and arnold were doing for their holidays she said that they were going on a sevenday package tour and that the one thing she hoped to come home with was a new dinner service the old coronation service that had been given to them by deirdres parents as a wedding gift some twentyfive years before was now sadly depleted several of the plates were chipped or broken while the pattern of crowns and sceptres on the pieces that were still serviceable had almost faded away i cant see whats wrong with it myself said arnold when his wife raised the subject once more as they waited in the departure lounge at heathrow deirdre made no effort to list its defects again arnold spent most of the flight to athens complaining that the aircraft was full of greeks deirdre didnt feel it was worth pointing out to him that if one booked a passage with olympic airways that was likely to be the outcome she also knew his reply would be but it saved us twentyfour pounds once they had landed at hellenikon international airport the two holidaymakers climbed aboard a bus arnold doubted whether it would have passed its mot in st albans but nevertheless it somehow managed to transport them into the centre of athens where arnold had booked them overnight into a twostar hotel two greek stars arnold quickly found the local branch of barclays and cashed one of his travellers cheques explaining to his wife that there was no point in changing more as once they were on board the liner everything had already been paid for he was sure that was how entrepreneurs conducted themselves the bacons rose early the following morning mainly because they hadnt been able to get a great deal of sleep their bodies had continually rolled to the centre of the lumpy concave mattress and their ears ached after a night resting on the brickhard convex pillows even before the sun had risen arnold jumped out of bed and threw open the little window that looked out onto a back yard he stretched his arms and declared he had never felt better deirdre didnt comment as she was already busy packing their clothes over breakfast a meal consisting of a croissant which arnold felt was too sticky and which in any case fell apart in his fingers feta cheese which he didnt care for the smell of and an obstinately empty cup because the management refused to serve tea a long debate developed between them as to whether they should hire a taxi or take a bus to the liner they both came to the conclusion that a taxi would be more sensible deirdre because she didnt want to be crammed into a hot bus with a lot of sweaty athenians and arnold because he wanted to be seen arriving at the gangplank in a car once arnold had settled their bill having checked the little row of figures presented to him three times before he was willing to part with another travellers cheque he hailed a taxi and instructed the driver to take them to the quayside the longer than expected journey in an ancient car with no air conditioning did not put arnold into a good humour when he first set eyes on the princess corina arnold was unable to mask his disappointment the ship was neither as large nor as modern as it had appeared in the glossy brochure he had a feeling his chairman would not be experiencing the same problem mr and mrs bacon ascended the gangplank and were escorted to their cabin which to arnolds dismay consisted of two bunks a washbasin a shower and a porthole without even enough room between the bunks for both of them to be able to undress at the same time arnold pointed out to his wife that this particular cabin had certainly not been illustrated in the brochure even if it had been described on the tariff by the encomium de luxe the brochure must have been put together by an outofwork estate agent he concluded arnold set out to take a turn around the deck not a particularly lengthy excursion on the way he bumped into a solicitor from chester who had been innocently strolling with his wife in the opposite direction after arnold had established that malcolm jackson was a senior partner in his firm and his wife joan was a magistrate he suggested they should join up for lunch once they had selected their meal from the buffet arnold lost no time in telling his newfound friends that he was a born entrepreneur explaining for example the immediate changes he would make to improve efficiency on the princess corina had he been the chairman of this particular shipping line the list i fear turned out to be far too long to include in a short story the solicitor who had not had to suffer any of arnolds opinions before seemed quite content to listen while deirdre chatted away to joan about how she was hoping to find a new dinner service on one of the islands the greeks are famous for their pottery you know she kept saying the conversation didnt vary a great deal when the two couples reunited over dinner that evening although the bacons were tired after their first day on board neither of them slept for more than a few moments that night but arnold was unwilling to admit as they bobbed across the aegean in their little cabin that given the choice he would have preferred the twostar hotel two greek stars with its lumpy mattress and brickhard pillows to the bunks on which they were now being tossed from side to side after two days at sea the ship docked at rhodes and by then even arnold had stopped describing it as a liner most of the passengers piled off down the gangway only too delighted to have the chance of spending a few hours on land arnold and malcolm beat a path to the nearest barclays bank to cash a travellers cheque each while deirdre and joan set off in the opposite direction in search of a dinner service at the bank arnold immediately informed the manager who he was ensuring that both he and malcolm received a tiny improvement on the advertised rate of exchange arnold smiled as they stepped out of the bank and onto the hot dusty cobbled street i should have gone into futures trading you know he told malcolm as they sauntered off down the hill i would have made a fortune deirdres quest for a dinner service didnt turn out to be quite so straightforward the shops were numerous and varied in quality and she quickly discovered that rhodes boasted a great many potters it was therefore necessary for her to establish which of them was the most highly regarded by the locals and then find the shop that sold his work this information was gained by talking to the old women dressed in black who could be found sitting silently on the street corners about one in ten of whom she discovered had some broken english while her husband was at the bank saving a few drachmas deirdre managed to find out all the inside information she required the four of them met up at a small taverna in the centre of the town for lunch over a plate of souvlakia arnold tried to convince deirdre that as they were visiting five islands in the course of the trip it might perhaps be wise to wait until their final port of call so they could purchase the dinner service at the last possible moment prices will undoubtedly fall declared arnold the closer we get to athens he spoke with the air of a true entrepreneur although deirdre had already seen a thirtytwopiece set she liked at a price well within their budget she reluctantly agreed to arnolds suggestion her acquiescence was largely brought about by the fact that it was her husband who was in possession of all the travellers cheques by the time the ship had docked at heraklion on crete arnold had vetted all the british nationals on board and had permitted a major territorial reserve and his spouse to join their table for lunch but only after discovering that the fellow held an account at barclays a dinner invitation followed once it had been established that the major occasionally played bridge with arnolds area manager from that moment arnold spent many happy hours at the bar explaining to the major or to malcolm neither of whom actually listened any longer why he should never have taken his fathers advice and followed him into the bank as he was after all one of natures born entrepreneurs by the time the ship had weighed anchor and sailed from santorini deirdre knew exactly the type of dinner service she wanted and how to establish quickly which potter she should trade with as soon as they set foot in a new port but arnold continued to insist that they should wait for the bigger market as they approached athens more competition forces prices down he explained for the umpteenth time deirdre knew there was no point in telling him that prices seemed to be rising with each knot they covered on their journey back towards the greek capital p√°ros only served as further proof of deirdres suspicions if proof were still needed as the prices there were noticeably steeper than they had been on santorini as the princess corina steamed on towards mykonos deirdre felt that although their final port of call would probably be able to supply her with a satisfactory dinner service it would surely no longer be at a price they could afford arnold kept assuring her with the confidence of a man who knows about such things that all would be well he even tapped the side of his nose with his forefinger the major and malcolm had reached the stage of simply nodding at him to indicate that they were still awake deirdre was among the first down the gangplank when they docked at mykonos that friday morning she had told her husband that she would carry out a recce of the pottery shops while he did the same with the banks joan and the majors wife were happy to accompany deirdre as by now she had become something of an expert on the subject of greek pottery the three ladies began their search at the north end of the town and deirdre was relieved to find that there was a greater variety of shops in mykonos than there had been on any of the other islands she was also able to discover with the help of several blackclad ladies that the town boasted a potter of genuine fame whose work could only be purchased from one shop the house of p√©tros once deirdre had located this establishment she spent the rest of the morning inspecting all the dinner services they had to offer after a couple of hours she came to the conclusion that the delphi set which was prominently displayed in the centre of the shop would be a prized possession for any housewife in st albans but as it was double the cost of anything she had seen on any of the other islands she knew that arnold would dismiss it as being out of their price range as the three ladies finally left the shop to join their husbands for lunch a goodlooking young man in a grubby tshirt and torn jeans with a couple of days stubble on his chin jumped out in front of them and asked you english deirdre stopped and stared into his deep blue eyes for a moment but said nothing her companions stepped out into the cobbled road and quickened their pace pretending it was not them to whom the stranger had spoken deirdre smiled at him as he stood to one side allowing her to continue on her way arnold had warned her never to engage in conversation with the natives when they reached œÅŒ≠Œ≥Œ≥Œ± Œ∫ŒøŒ∫Œ∫ŒπŒΩŒ∑ the restaurant at which theyd arranged to meet up for lunch the three ladies found their husbands drinking imported lager at the bar arnold was explaining to the major and malcolm why he had refused to pay his subscription to the conservative party that year not a penny will i part with he insisted while they cant get their own house in order deirdre suspected that his unwillingness to pay had rather more to do with his recent defeat when he had stood as chairman of the local branch arnold passed the next hour offering his views on everything from defence cuts to new age travellers to singleparent families all of which he was resolutely against when the bill for lunch was finally presented he spent some considerable time working out what each of them had eaten and therefore how much they should contribute towards the total arnold had already resigned himself to the fact that he would have to allocate part of his afternoon to bargaining on deirdres behalf now that she had finally found the dinner service she had set her heart on everyone else had agreed to come along and watch the born entrepreneur at work when arnold entered the house of p√©tros he had to admit that deirdre seemed to have located the correct establishment he kept repeating this observation as if to prove that he had been right all along to insist that she wait until their final port of call before the big decision was taken he seemed blissfully unaware of how the price of pottery had increased from island to island and deirdre made no attempt to enlighten him she simply guided him over to the delphi service displayed on a large table in the centre of the room and prayed they all agreed it was quite magnificent but when arnold was told the price he shook his head sadly deirdre would have protested but she like so many of the banks customers over the years had seen that look on her husbands face before she therefore resigned herself to settling for the pharos set excellent but unquestionably second best and far more expensive than comparable sets had been on any of the other four islands the three wives began selecting the pieces they would like to buy while their husbands gravely reminded them how much they could afford the choices having been made arnold spent a considerable time haggling with the shopkeeper he finally managed to get a twenty per cent discount on the total once the figure had been established arnold was dispatched to find an english bank at which he could change the necessary travellers cheques with passports and signed cheques in hand he left the shop to carry out his mission as he stepped onto the pavement the young man who had approached deirdre leaped into his path and asked you english naturally replied arnold sidestepping him and marching on briskly in order to avoid any further conversation with such a scruffy individual as he had told the major over lunch timeo danaos et dona ferentis it was the one snippet of latin he could still recall from his schooldays when he had selected a bank arnold marched straight into the managers office and changed everyones cheques at a minutely better rate than the one displayed on the board in the window pleased with his saving of fifty drachmas he headed back to the house of p√©tros he was displeased to find the young man was still loitering on the pavement outside the shop arnold refused to favour the unshaven ruffian with even a glance but he did catch the words you want to save money englishman arnold stopped in his tracks as any born entrepreneur would and turned to study more closely the loutish youth who had addressed him he was about to continue on his way when the young man said i know where pottery is everything half price arnold hesitated once again and looked through the shop window to see his companions standing around waiting for his return on the counter stood six large packages already wrapped up and awaiting payment arnold turned back to take a closer look at the inarticulate foreigner potter comes from village called kalafatis he said bus journey only half hour then everything half price while arnold was digesting this piece of information the young greeks hand shot out hopefully arnold extracted a fiftydrachma note from the roll of money he had obtained at the bank willing to speculate with the profit he had made on that particular transaction in exchange for the information he had just acquired the act of a true entrepreneur he thought as he marched triumphantly into the shop i have made an important discovery he announced and beckoned them all into a corner to impart his inside information deirdre did not seem at all convinced until arnold suggested perhaps we might even be able to afford the delphi set you hankered after my dear in any case why pay double when the only sacrifice you need to make is a halfhour bus journey malcolm nodded his agreement as if listening to sage advice from senior counsel and even the major though grumbling a little finally fell into line as we set sail for athens early this evening declared the major we ought to take the next bus to kalafatis arnold nodded and without another word led his little band out of the shop not even glancing towards the packages that were left behind on the counter when they stepped out onto the street arnold was relieved to find that the young man who had given him the tipoff was no longer to be seen they came to a halt at the bus stop where arnold was a little disappointed to discover several passengers from the ship already standing in the queue but he persuaded himself that they would not be heading for the same destination they waited in the hot sun for another forty minutes before a bus eventually pulled up when arnold first saw the vehicle his heart sank just think of how much money well be saving he said when he noticed the looks of despair on the faces of his companions the journey across the island to the east coast might well have taken thirty minutes had it been in a range rover with no reason to slow down but as the bus driver picked up everybody he saw along the way without regard to official stops they eventually arrived in kalafatis an hour and twenty minutes later long before they had clambered off the ancient vehicle deirdre was exhausted joan was exasperated and the majors wife was developing a migraine bus goes no further said the driver as arnold and his companions filed off leave for return journey to kh√≥ra one hour last bus of the day the little band gazed up at the narrow winding track that led to the potters workplace the journey was worth it for the view alone gasped arnold as he came to a halt halfway along the path and gazed out over the aegean his companions didnt even bother to stop and look let alone offer an opinion it took them another ten minutes of determined walking before they reached their destination and by then even arnold had fallen silent as the six weary tourists finally entered the pottery what breath they had left was taken away they stood mesmerised by shelf after shelf of beautiful objects arnold felt a warm glow of triumph deirdre immediately went about her business and quickly located the delphi dinner service it looked even more magnificent than she remembered but when she checked a little label that hung from a soup tureens handle she was horrified to discover that the cost was only a little less than it had been at the house of p√©tros deirdre came to a decision she turned to face her husband who was toying with a pipe stand and declared in a clarion voice that all could hear as everything is at half price arnold presumably i can go ahead and buy the delphi the other four swung round to see how the great entrepreneur would react arnold seemed to hesitate for a moment before he placed the pipe stand back on the shelf and said of course my dear isnt that why we came all this way in the first place the three women immediately began selecting items from the shelves finally gathering between them one dinner service two tea sets one coffee set three vases five ashtrays two jugs and a toast rack arnold abandoned the pipe stand when the bill for deirdres purchases was presented to her husband he hesitated once again but he was painfully aware that all five of his shipmates were glaring at him he reluctantly cashed his remaining travellers cheques unwilling to bring himself even to glance at the disadvantageous exchange rate that was displayed in the window deirdre made no comment malcolm and the major silently signed away their own travellers cheques with little appearance of triumph showing on either of their faces the goods having been paid for the six tourists emerged from the workshop laden down with carrier bags as they began to retrace their steps back down the winding track the door of the pottery was closed behind them well have to get a move on if were not going to miss the last bus shouted arnold as he stepped into the centre of the path avoiding a large cream mercedes that was parked outside the workshop but what a worthwhile excursion he added as they trundled off down the track you have to admit i saved you all a fortune deirdre was the last to leave the shop she paused to rearrange her numerous bags and was surprised to see a number of the potterys staff forming a queue at a table by the side of the shop a handsome young man in a grubby tshirt and torn jeans was presenting each of them in turn with a small brown envelope deirdre couldnt take her eyes off the young man where had she seen him before he looked up and for a moment she stared into those deep blue eyes and then she remembered the young man shrugged his shoulders and smiled deirdre returned the smile picked up her bags and set off down the path after her companions as they clambered onto the bus deirdre was just in time to hear arnold declare you know major i should never have taken my fathers advice and settled for the life of a banker you see im one of natures born entre deirdre smiled again as she looked out of the window and watched the goodlooking young man speed past them in his large cream mercedes he smiled and waved to her as the last bus began its slow journey back to mykonos an eye for an eye the stories indicated with an asterisk are based on known incidents some of them embellished with considerable licence the others are the product of my own imagination ja july sir matthew roberts qc closed the file and placed it on the desk in front of him he was not a happy man he was quite willing to defend mary banks but he was not at all confident about her plea of not guilty sir matthew leaned back in his deep leather chair to consider the case while he awaited the arrival of the instructing solicitor who had briefed him and the junior counsel he had selected for the case as he gazed out over the middle temple courtyard he only hoped he had made the right decision on the face of it the case of regina v banks was a simple one of murder but after what bruce banks had subjected his wife to during the eleven years of their marriage sir matthew was confident not only that he could get the charge reduced to manslaughter but that if the jury was packed with women he might even secure an acquittal there was however a complication he lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply something his wife had always chided him for he looked at victorias photograph on the desk in front of him it reminded him of his youth but then victoria would always be young death had ensured that reluctantly he forced his mind back to his client and her plea of mitigation he reopened the file mary banks was claiming that she couldnt possibly have chopped her husband up with an axe and buried him under the pigsty because at the time of his death she was not only a patient in the local hospital but was also blind as sir matthew inhaled deeply once again there was a knock on the door come in he bellowed not because he liked the sound of his own voice but because the doors of his chambers were so thick that if he didnt holier no one would ever hear him sir matthews clerk opened the door and announced mr bernard casson and mr hugh witherington two very different men thought sir matthew as they entered the room but each would serve the purpose he had planned for them in this particular case bernard casson was a solicitor of the old school formal punctilious and always painstakingly correct his conservatively tailored herringbone suit never seemed to change from one year to the next matthew often wondered if he had purchased half a dozen such suits in a dosingdown sale and wore a different one every day of the week he peered up at casson over his halfmoon spectacles the solicitors thin moustache and neatly parted hair gave him an oldfashioned look that had fooled many an opponent into thinking he had a secondclass mind sir matthew regularly gave thanks that his friend was no orator because if bernard had been a barrister matthew would not have relished the prospect of opposing him in court a pace behind casson stood his junior counsel for this brief hugh witherington the lord must have been feeling particularly ungenerous on the day witherington entered the world as he had given him neither looks nor brains if he had bestowed any other talents on him they were yet to be revealed after several attempts witherington had finally been called to the bar but for the number of briefs he was offered he would have had a more regular income had he signed on for the dole sir matthews clerk had raised an eyebrow when the name of witherington had been mooted as junior counsel in the case but sir matthew just smiled and had not offered an explanation sir matthew rose stubbed out his cigarette and ushered the two men towards the vacant chairs on the other side of his desk he waited for both of them to settle before he proceeded kind of you to attend chambers mr casson he said although they both knew that the solicitor was doing no more than holding with the traditions of the bar my pleasure sir matthew replied the elderly solicitor bowing slightly to show that he still appreciated the old courtesies i dont think you know hugh witherington my junior in this case said sir matthew gesturing towards the undistinguished young barrister witherington nervously touched the silk handkerchief in his breast pocket no i hadnt had the pleasure of mr witheringtons acquaintance until we met in the corridor a few moments ago said casson may i say how delighted i am that you have been willing to take on this case sir matthew matthew smiled at his friends formality he knew bernard would never dream of calling him by his christian name while junior counsel was present im only too happy to be working with you again mr casson even if you have presented me on this occasion with something of a challenge the conventional pleasantries over the elderly solicitor removed a brown file from his battered gladstone bag i have had a further consultation with my client since i last saw you he said as he opened the file and i took the opportunity to pass on your opinion but i fear mrs banks remains determined to plead not guilty so she is still protesting her innocence yes sir matthew mrs banks emphatically claims that she couldnt have committed the murder because she had been blinded by her husband some days before he died and in any case at the time of his death she was registered as a patient at the local hospital the pathologists report is singularly vague about the time of death sir matthew reminded his old friend after all they didnt discover the body for at least a couple of weeks as i understand it the police feel the murder could have been committed twentyfour or even fortyeight hours before mrs banks was taken to the hospital i have also read their report sir matthew casson replied and informed mrs banks of its contents but she remains adamant that she is innocent and that the jury will be persuaded of it especially with sir matthew roberts as my defender were the exact words she used if i remember correctly he added with a smile i am not seduced mr casson said sir matthew lighting another cigarette you did promise victoria interjected the solicitor lowering his shield but only for a moment so i have one last chance to convince her said sir matthew ignoring his friends comment and mrs banks has one last chance to convince you said mr casson touch√© said sir matthew nodding his appreciation of the solicitors neat riposte as he stubbed out his almost untouched cigarette he felt he was losing this fencing match with his old friend and that the time had come to go on the attack he returned to the open file on his desk first he said looking straight at casson as if his colleague were in the witness box when the body was dug up there were traces of your clients blood on the collar of the dead mans shirt my client accepts that said casson calmly checking his own notes but second said sir matthew before casson had a chance to reply when the instrument that had been used to chop up the body an axe was found the following day a hair from mrs bankss head was discovered lodged in its handle we wont be denying that said casson we dont have a lot of choice said sir matthew rising from his seat and beginning to pace around the room and third when the spade that was used to dig the victims grave was finally discovered your clients fingerprints were found all over it we can explain that as well said casson but will the jury accept our explanation asked sir matthew his voice rising when they learn that the murdered man had a long history of violence that your client was regularly seen in the local village either bruised or with a black eye sometimes bleeding from cuts around the head once even nursing a broken arm she has always stated that those injuries were sustained when working on the farm where her husband was manager that places a strain on my credulity which its quite unable to withstand said sir matthew as he finished circling the room and returned to his chair and we are not helped by the fact that the only person known to have visited the farm regularly was the postman apparently everyone else in the village refused to venture beyond the front gate he flicked over another page of his notes that might have made it easier for someone to come in and kill banks suggested witherington sir matthew was unable to hide his surprise as he looked across at his junior having almost forgotten that he was in the room interesting point he said unwilling to stamp on witherington while he still had it in his power to play the one trump card in this case the next problem we face he went on is that your client claims that she went blind after her husband struck her with a hot frying pan rather convenient mr casson wouldnt you say the scar can still be seen clearly on the side of my clients face said casson and the doctor remains convinced that she is indeed blind doctors are easier to convince than prosecuting counsels and worldweary judges mr casson said sir matthew turning another page of his file next when samples from the body were examined and god knows who was willing to carry out that particular task the quantity of strychnine found in the blood would have felled a bull elephant that was only the opinion of the crowns pathologists said mr casson and one i will find hard to refute in court said sir matthew because counsel for the prosecution will undoubtedly ask mrs banks to explain why she purchased four grams of strychnine from an agricultural supplier in reading shortly before her husbands death if i were in his position i would repeat that question over and over again possibly said casson checking his notes but she has explained that they had been having a problem with rats which had been killing the chickens and she feared for the other animals on the farm not to mention their nineyearold son ah yes rupert but he was away at boarding school at the time was he not sir matthew paused you see mr casson my problem is a simple one he closed his file i dont believe her casson raised an eyebrow unlike her husband mrs banks is a very clever woman witness the fact that she has already fooled several people into believing this incredible story but i can tell you mr casson that she isnt going to fool me but what can we do sir matthew if mrs banks insists that this is her case and asks us to defend her accordingly asked casson sir matthew rose again and paced around the room silently coming to a halt in front of the solicitor not a lot i agree he said reverting to a more conciliatory tone but i do wish i could convince the dear lady to plead guilty to manslaughter wed be certain to gain the sympathy of any jury after what shes been put through and we can always rely on some womens group or other to picket the court throughout the hearing any judge who passed a harsh sentence on mary banks would be described as chauvinistic and sexually discriminatory by every newspaper leader writer in the land id have her out of prison in a matter of weeks no mr casson we must get her to change her plea but how can we hope to do that when she remains so adamant that she is innocent asked casson a smile flickered across sir matthews face mr witherington and i have a plan dont we hugh he said turning to witherington for a second time yes sir matthew replied the young barrister sounding pleased to at last have his opinion sought even in this rudimentary way as sir matthew volunteered no clue as to the plan casson did not press the point so when do i come face to face with our client asked sir matthew turning his attention back to the solicitor would eleven oclock on monday morning be convenient asked casson where is she at the moment asked sir matthew thumbing through his diary holloway replied casson then we will be at holloway at eleven on monday morning said sir matthew and to be honest with you i cant wait to meet mrs mary banks that woman must have real guts not to mention imagination mark my words mr casson shell prove a worthy opponent for any counsel when sir matthew entered the interviewing room of holloway prison and saw mary banks for the first time he was momentarily taken aback he knew from his file on the case that she was thirtyseven but the frail greyhaired woman who sat with her hands resting in her lap looked nearer fifty only when he studied her fine cheekbones and slim figure did he see that she might once have been a beautiful woman sir matthew allowed casson to take the seat opposite her at a plain formica table in the centre of an otherwise empty creampainted brick room there was a small barred window halfway up the wall that threw a shaft of light onto their client sir matthew and his junior took their places on either side of the instructing solicitor leading counsel noisily poured himself a cup of coffee good morning mrs banks said casson good morning mr casson she replied turning slightly to face the direction from which the voice had come you have brought someone with you yes mrs banks i am accompanied by sir matthew roberts qc who will be acting as your defence counsel she gave a slight bow of the head as sir matthew rose from his chair took a pace forward and said good morning mrs banks then suddenly thrust out his right hand good morning sir matthew she replied without moving a muscle still looking in cassons direction im delighted that you will be representing me sir matthew would like to ask you a few questions mrs banks said casson so that he can decide what might be the best approach in your case he will assume the role of counsel for the prosecution so that you can get used to what it will be like when you go into the witness box i understand replied mrs banks i shall be happy to answer any of sir matthews questions im sure it wont prove difficult for someone of his eminence to show that a frail blind woman would be incapable of chopping up a vicious sixteenstone man not if that vicious sixteenstone man was poisoned before he was chopped up said sir matthew quietly which would be quite an achievement for someone lying in a hospital bed five miles from where the crime was committed replied mrs banks if indeed that was when the crime was committed responded sir matthew you claim your blindness was caused by a blow to the side of your head yes sir matthew my husband picked up the frying pan from the stove while i was cooking breakfast and struck me with it i ducked but the edge of the pan caught me on the left side of my face she touched a scar above her left eye that looked as if it would remain with her for the rest of her life and then what happened i passed out and collapsed onto the kitchen floor when i came to i could sense someone else was in the room but had no idea who it was until he spoke when i recognised the voice of jack pembridge our postman he carried me to his van and drove me to the local hospital and it was while you were in hospital that the police discovered your husbands body that is correct sir matthew after i had been in parkmead for nearly two weeks i asked the vicar who had been to visit me every day to try and find out how bruce was coping without me did you not think it surprising that your husband hadnt been to see you once during the time you were in hospital asked sir matthew who began slowly pushing his cup of coffee towards the edge of the table no i had threatened to leave him on several occasions and i dont think the cup fell off the table and shattered noisily on the stone floor sir matthews eyes never left mrs banks she jumped nervously but did not turn to look in the direction of the broken cup are you all right mr casson she asked my fault said sir matthew how clumsy of me casson suppressed a smile witherington remained unmoved please continue said sir matthew as he bent down and began picking up the pieces of china scattered across the floor you were saying i dont think oh yes said mrs banks i dont think bruce would have cared whether i returned to the farm or not quite so said sir matthew after he had placed the broken pieces on the table but can you explain to me why the police found one of your hairs on the handle of the axe that was used to dismember your husbands body yes sir matthew i can i was chopping up some wood for the stove before i prepared his breakfast then i am bound to ask why there were no fingerprints on the handle of the axe mrs banks because i was wearing gloves sir matthew if you had ever worked on a farm in midoctober you would know only too well how cold it can be at five in the morning this time casson did allow himself to smile but what about the blood found on your husbands collar blood that was shown by the crowns forensic scientist to match your own you will find my blood on many things in that house should you care to look closely sir matthew and the spade the one with your fingerprints all over it had you also been doing some digging before breakfast that morning no but i would have had cause to use it every day the previous week i see said sir matthew let us now turn our attention to something i suspect you didnt do every day namely the purchase of strychnine first mrs banks why did you need such a large amount and second why did you have to travel twentyseven miles to reading to purchase it i shop in reading every other thursday mrs banks explained there isnt an agricultural supplier any nearer sir matthew frowned and rose from his chair he began slowly to circle mrs banks while casson watched her eyes they never moved when sir matthew was directly behind his client he checked his watch it was he knew his timing had to be exact because he had become uncomfortably aware that he was dealing not only with a clever woman but also an extremely cunning one mind you he reflected anyone who had lived for eleven years with such a man as bruce banks would have had to be cunning simply to survive you still havent explained why you needed such a large amount of strychnine he said remaining behind his client we had been losing a lot of chickens mrs banks replied still not moving her head my husband thought it was rats so he told me to get a large quantity of strychnine to finish them off once and for all were his exact words but as it turned out it was he who was finished off once and for all and undoubtedly with the same poison said sir matthew quietly i also feared for ruperts safety said mrs banks ignoring her counsels sarcasm but your son was away at school at the time am i not correct yes you are sir matthew but he was due back for half term that weekend have you ever used that supplier before regularly said mrs banks as sir matthew completed his circle and returned to face her once again i go there at least once a month as im sure the manager will confirm she turned her head and faced a foot or so to his right sir matthew remained silent resisting the temptation to look at his watch he knew it could only be a matter of seconds a few moments later the door on the far side of the interview room swung open and a boy of about nine years of age entered the three of them watched their client closely as the child walked silently towards her rupert banks came to a halt in front of his mother and smiled but received no response he waited for a further ten seconds then turned and walked back out exactly as he had been instructed to do mrs bankss eyes remained fixed somewhere between sir matthew and mr casson the smile on cassons face was now almost one of triumph is there someone else in the room asked mrs banks i thought i heard the door open no said sir matthew only mr casson and i are in the room witherington still hadnt moved a muscle sir matthew began to circle mrs banks for what he knew had to be the last time he had almost come to believe that he might have misjudged her when he was directly behind her once again he nodded to his junior who remained seated in front of her witherington removed the silk handkerchief from his breast pocket slowly unfolded it and laid it out flat on the table in front of him mrs banks showed no reaction witherington stretched out the fingers of his right hand bowed his head slightly and paused before placing his right hand over his left eye without warning he plucked the eye out of its socket and placed it in the middle of the silk handkerchief he left it on the table for a full thirty seconds then began to polish it sir matthew completed his circle and observed beads of perspiration appearing on mrs bankss forehead as he sat down when witherington had finished cleaning the almondshaped glass object he slowly raised his head until he was staring directly at her then eased the eye back into its socket mrs banks momentarily turned away she quickly tried to compose herself but it was too late sir matthew rose from his chair and smiled at his client she returned the smile i must confess mrs banks he said i would feel much more confident about a plea of guilty to manslaughter one mans meat could anyone be that beautiful i was driving round the aldwych on my way to work when i first saw her she was walking up the steps of the aldwych theatre if id stared a moment longer i would have driven into the back of the car in front of me but before i could confirm my fleeting impression she had disappeared into the throng of theatregoers i spotted a parking space on my lefthand side and swung into it at the last possible moment without indicating causing the vehicle behind me to let out several appreciative blasts i leapt out of my car and ran back towards the theatre realising how unlikely it was that id be able to find her in such a melee and that even if i did she was probably meeting a boyfriend or husband who would turn out to be about six feet tall and closely to resemble harrison ford once i reached the foyer i scanned the chattering crowd i slowly turned degrees but could see no sign of her should i try to buy a ticket i wondered but she could be seated anywhere the stalls the dress circle even the upper circle perhaps i should walk up and down the aisles until i spotted her but i realised i wouldnt be allowed into any part of the theatre unless i could produce a ticket and then i saw her she was standing in a queue in front of the window marked tonights performance and was just one away from being attended to there were two other customers a young woman and a middleaged man waiting in line behind her i quickly joined the queue by which time she had reached the front i leant forward and tried to overhear what she was saying but i could only catch the box office managers reply not much chance with the curtain going up in a few minutes time madam he was saying but if you leave it with me ill see what i can do she thanked him and walked off in the direction of the stalls my first impression was confirmed it didnt matter if you looked from the ankles up or from the head down she was perfection i couldnt take my eyes off her and i noticed that she was having exactly the same effect on several other men in the foyer i wanted to tell them all not to bother didnt they realise she was with me or rather that she would be by the end of the evening after she had disappeared from view i craned my neck to look into the booth her ticket had been placed to one side i sighed with relief as the young woman two places ahead of me presented her credit card and picked up four tickets for the dress circle i began to pray that the man in front of me wasnt looking for a single do you have one ticket for tonights performance he asked hopefully as the threeminute bell sounded the man in the booth smiled i scowled should i knife him in the back kick him in the groin or simply scream abuse at him where would you prefer to sit sir the dress circle or the stalls dont say stalls i willed say circle circle circle stalls he said i have one on the aisle in row h said the man in the box checking the computer screen in front of him i uttered a silent cheer as i realised that the theatre would be trying to sell off its remaining tickets before it bothered with returns handed in by members of the public but then i thought how would i get around that problem by the time the man in front of me had bought the ticket on the end of row h i had my lines well rehearsed and just hoped i wouldnt need a prompt thank goodness i thought i wasnt going to make it i began trying to sound out of breath the man in the ticket booth looked up at me but didnt seem all that impressed by my opening line it was the traffic and then i couldnt find a parking space my girlfriend may have given up on me did she by any chance hand in my ticket for resale he looked unconvinced my dialogue obviously wasnt gripping him can you describe her he asked suspiciously shortcropped dark hair hazel eyes wearing a red silk dress that ah yes i remember her he said almost sighing he picked up the ticket by his side and handed it to me thank you i said trying not to show my relief that he had come in so neatly on cue with the closing line from my first scene as i hurried off in the direction of the stalls i grabbed an envelope from a pile on the ledge beside the booth i checked the price of the ticket twenty pounds i extracted two tenpound notes from my wallet put them in the envelope licked the flap and stuck it down the girl at the entrance to the stalls checked my ticket f six rows from the front on the righthand side i walked slowly down the aisle until i spotted her she was sitting next to an empty place in the middle of the row as i made my way over the feet of those who were already seated she turned and smiled obviously pleased to see that someone had purchased her spare ticket i returned the smile handed over the envelope containing my twenty pounds and sat down beside her the man in the box office asked me to give you this thank you she slipped the envelope into her evening bag i was about to try the first line of my second scene on her when the house lights faded and the curtain rose for act one of the real performance i suddenly realised that i had no idea what play i was about to see i glanced across at the programme on her lap and read the words an inspector calls by j b priestley i remembered that the critics had been full of praise for the production when it had originally opened at the national theatre and had particularly singled out the performance of kenneth cranham i tried to concentrate on what was taking place on stage the eponymous inspector was staring into a house in which an edwardian family were preparing for a dinner to celebrate their daughters engagement i was thinking of getting a new car the father was saying to his prospective soninlaw as he puffed away on his cigar at the mention of the word car i suddenly remembered that i had abandoned mine outside the theatre was it on a double yellow line or worse to hell with it they could have it in partexchange for the model sitting next to me the audience laughed so i joined in if only to give the impression that i was following the plot but what about my original plans for the evening by now everyone would be wondering why i hadnt turned up i realised that i wouldnt be able to leave the theatre during the interval either to check on my car or to make a phone call to explain my absence as that would be my one chance of developing my own plot the play had the rest of the audience enthralled but i had already begun rehearsing the lines from my own script which would have to be performed during the interval between acts one and two i was painfully aware that i would be restricted to fifteen minutes and that there would be no second night by the time the curtain came down at the end of the first act i was confident of my draft text i waited for the applause to die down before i turned towards her what an original production i began quite modernistic i vaguely remembered that one of the critics had followed that line i was lucky to get a seat at the last moment i was just as lucky she replied i felt encouraged i mean to find someone who was looking for a single ticket at such short notice i nodded my names michael whitaker anna townsend she said giving me a warm smile would you like a drink i asked thank you she replied that would be nice i stood up and led her through the packed scrum that was heading towards the stalls bar occasionally glancing back to make sure she was still following me i was somehow expecting her no longer to be there but each time i turned to look she greeted me with the same radiant smile what would you like i asked once i could make out the bar through the crowd a dry martini please stay here and ill be back in a moment i promised wondering just how many precious minutes would be wasted while i had to wait at the bar i took out a fivepound note and held it up conspicuously in the hope that the prospect of a large tip might influence the barmans sense of direction he spotted the money but i still had to wait for another four customers to be served before i managed to secure the dry martini and a scotch on the rocks for myself the barman didnt deserve the tip i left him but i hadnt any more time to waste waiting for the change i carried the drinks back to the far corner of the foyer where anna stood studying her programme she was silhouetted against a window and in that stylish red silk dress the light emphasised her slim elegant figure i handed her the dry martini aware that my limited time had almost run out thank you she said giving me another disarming smile how did you come to have a spare ticket i asked as she took a sip from her drink my partner was held up on an emergency case at the last minute she explained just one of the problems of being a doctor pity they missed a quite remarkable production i prompted hoping to tease out of her whether her partner was male or female yes said anna i tried to book seats when it was still at the national theatre but they were sold out for any performances i was able to make so when a friend offered me two tickets at the last minute i jumped at them after all its coming off in a few weeks she took another sip from her martini what about you she asked as the threeminute bell sounded there was no such line in my script me yes michael she said a hint of teasing in her voice how did you come to be looking for a spare seat at the last moment sharon stone was tied up for the evening and at the last second princess diana told me that she would have loved to have come but she was trying to keep a low profile anna laughed actually i read some of the crits and i dropped in on the offchance of picking up a spare ticket and you picked up a spare woman as well said anna as the twominute bell went i wouldnt have dared to include such a bold line in her script or was there a hint of mockery in those hazel eyes i certainly did i replied lightly so are you a doctor as well as well as what asked anna as well as your partner i said not sure if she was still teasing yes im a gp in fulham there are three of us in the practice but i was the only one who could escape tonight and what do you do when youre not chatting up sharon stone or escorting princess diana to the theatre im in the restaurant business i told her that must be one of the few jobs with worse hours and tougher working conditions than mine anna said as the oneminute bell sounded i looked into those hazel eyes and wanted to say anna lets forget the second act i realise the plays superb but all i want to do is spend the rest of the evening alone with you not jammed into a crowded auditorium with eight hundred other people wouldnt you agree i tried to recall what she had just said i expect we get more customer complaints than you do was the best i could manage i doubt it anna said quite sharply if youre a woman in the medical profession and you dont cure your patients within a couple of days they immediately want to know if youre fully qualified i laughed and finished my drink as a voice boomed over the tannoy would the audience please take their seats for the second act the curtain is about to rise we ought to be getting back anna said placing her empty glass on the nearest window ledge i suppose so i said reluctantly and led her in the opposite direction to the one in which i really wanted to take her thanks for the drink she said as we returned to our seats small recompense i replied she glanced up at me questioningly for such a good ticket i explained she smiled as we made our way along the row stepping awkwardly over more toes i was just about to risk a further remark when the house lights dimmed during the second act i turned to smile in annas direction whenever there was laughter and was occasionally rewarded with a warm response but my supreme moment of triumph came towards the end of the act when the detective showed the daughter a photograph of the dead woman she gave a piercing scream and the stage lights were suddenly switched off anna grabbed my hand but quickly released it and apologised not at all i whispered i only just stopped myself from doing the same thing in the darkened theatre i couldnt tell how she responded a moment later the phone on the stage rang everyone in the audience knew it must be the detective on the other end of the line even if they couldnt be sure what he was going to say that final scene had the whole house gripped after the lights dimmed for the last time the cast returned to the stage and deservedly received a long ovation taking several curtain calls when the curtain was finally lowered anna turned to me and said what a remarkable production im so glad i didnt miss it and im even more pleased that i didnt have to see it alone me too i told her ignoring the fact that id never planned to spend the evening at the theatre in the first place we made our way up the aisle together as the audience flowed out of the theatre like a slowmoving river i wasted those few precious moments discussing the merits of the cast the power of the directors interpretation the originality of the macabre set and even the edwardian costumes before we reached the double doors that led back out into the real world goodbye michael anna said thank you for adding to my enjoyment of the evening she shook me by the hand goodbye i said gazing once again into those hazel eyes she turned to go and i wondered if i would ever see her again anna i said she glanced back in my direction if youre not doing anything in particular would you care to join me for dinner authors note at this point in the story the reader is offered the choice of four different endings you might decide to read all four of them or simply select one and consider that your own particular ending if you do choose to read all four they should be taken in the order in which they have been written rare burnt overdone √° point rare thank you michael id like that i smiled unable to mask my delight good i know a little restaurant just down the road that i think you might enjoy that sounds fun anna said linking her arm in mine i guided her through the departing throng as we strolled together down the aldwych anna continued to chat about the play comparing it favourably with a production she had seen at the haymarket some years before when we reached the strand i pointed to a large grey double door on the other side of the road thats it i said we took advantage of a red light to weave our way through the temporarily stationary traffic and after wed reached the far pavement i pushed one of the grey doors open to allow anna through it began to rain just as we stepped inside i led her down a flight of stairs into a basement restaurant buzzing with the talk of people who had just come out of theatres and waiters dashing plates in both hands from table to table ill be impressed if you can get a table here anna said eyeing a group of wouldbe customers who were clustered round the bar impatiently waiting for someone to leave i strolled across to the reservations desk the head waiter who until that moment had been taking a customers order rushed over good evening mr whitaker he said how many are you just the two of us follow me please sir mario said leading us to my usual table in the far corner of the room another dry martini i asked her as we sat down no thank you she replied i think ill just have a glass of wine with the meal i nodded my agreement as mario handed us our menus anna studied hers for a few moments before i asked if she had spotted anything she fancied yes she said looking straight at me but for now i think ill settle for the fettucini and a glass of red wine good idea i said ill join you but are you sure you wont have a starter no thank you michael ive reached that age when i can no longer order everything im tempted by the too i confessed i have to play squash three times a week to keep in shape i told her as mario reappeared two fettucini i began and a bottle of half a bottle please said anna ill only have one glass ive got an early start tomorrow morning so i shouldnt overdo things i nodded and mario scurried away i looked across the table and into annas eyes ive always wondered about women doctors i said immediately realising that the line was a bit feeble you mean you wondered if were normal something like that i suppose yes were normal enough except every day we have to see a lot of men in the nude i can assure you michael most of them are overweight and fairly unattractive i suddenly wished i were half a stone lighter but are there many men who are brave enough to consider a woman doctor in the first place quite a few said anna though most of my patients are female but there are just about enough intelligent sensible uninhibited males around who can accept that a woman doctor might be just as likely to cure them as a man i smiled as two bowls of fettucini were placed in front of us mario then showed me the label on the halfbottle he had selected i nodded my approval he had chosen a vintage to match annas pedigree and what about you asked anna what does being in the restaurant business actually mean im on the management side i said before sampling the wine i nodded again and mario poured a glass for anna and then topped up mine or at least thats what i do nowadays i started life as a waiter i said as anna began to sip her wine what a magnificent wine she remarked its so good i may end up having a second glass im glad you like it i said its a barolo you were saying michael you started life as a waiter yes then i moved into the kitchens for about five years and finally ended up on the management side hows the fettucini its delicious almost melts in your mouth she took another sip of her wine so if youre not cooking and no longer a waiter what do you do now well at the moment im running three restaurants in the west end which means i never stop dashing from one to the other depending on which is facing the biggest crisis on that particular day sounds a bit like ward duty to me said anna so who turned out to have the biggest crisis today today thank heaven was not typical i told her with feeling that bad said anna yes im afraid so we lost a chef this morning who cut off the top of his finger and wont be back at work for at least a fortnight my head waiter in our second restaurant is off claiming he has the flu and ive just had to sack the barman in the third for fiddling with the books barmen always fiddle with the books of course but in this case even the customers began to notice what he was up to i paused but i still wouldnt want to be in any other business under the circumstances im amazed you were able to take the evening off i shouldnt have really and i wouldnt have except i trailed off as i leaned over and topped up annas glass except what she said do you want to hear the truth i asked as i poured the remains of the wine into my own glass ill try that for starters she said i placed the empty bottle on the side of the table and hesitated but only for a moment i was driving to one of my restaurants earlier this evening when i spotted you going into the theatre i stared at you for so long that i nearly crashed into the back of the car in front of me then i swerved across the road into the nearest parking space and the car behind almost crashed into me i leapt out ran all the way to the theatre and searched everywhere until i saw you standing in the queue for the box office i joined the line and watched you hand over your spare ticket once you were safely out of sight i told the box office manager that you hadnt expected me to make it in time and that you might have put my ticket up for resale after id described you which i was able to do in great detail he handed it over without so much as a murmur anna put down her glass of wine and stared across at me with a look of incredulity im glad he fell for your story she said but should i yes you should because then i put two tenpound notes into a theatre envelope and took the place next to you the rest you already know i waited to see how she would react she didnt speak for some time im flattered she eventually said and touched my hand i didnt realise there were any oldfashioned romantics left in the world she squeezed my fingers and looked me in the eyes am i allowed to ask what you have planned for the rest of the evening nothing has been planned so far i admitted which is why its all been so refreshing you make me sound like an after eight mint said anna with a laugh i can think of at least three replies to that i told her as mario reappeared looking a little disappointed at the sight of the halfempty plates was everything all right sir he asked sounding anxious couldnt have been better said anna who hadnt stopped looking at me would you like some coffee i asked yes said anna but perhaps we could have it somewhere a little less crowded i was so taken by surprise that it was several moments before i recovered i was beginning to feel that i was no longer in control anna rose from her place and said shall we go i nodded to mario who just smiled once we were back out on the street she linked her arm with mine as we retraced our steps along the aldwych and past the theatre its been a wonderful evening she was saying as we reached the spot where i had left my car until you arrived on the scene it had been a rather dull day but youve changed all that it hasnt actually been the best of days for me either i admitted but ive rarely enjoyed an evening more where would you like to have coffee annabels or why dont we try the new dorchester club if you dont have a wife your place if you do i dont i told her simply then thats settled she said as i opened the door of my bmw for her once she was safely in i walked round to take my seat behind the wheel and discovered that i had left my sidelights on and the keys in the ignition i turned the key and the engine immediately purred into life this has to be my day i said to myself sorry anna said turning in my direction we were lucky to miss the rain i replied as a few drops landed on the windscreen i flicked on the wipers on our way to pimlico anna told me about her childhood in the south of france where her father had taught english at a boys school her account of being the only girl among a couple of hundred teenage french boys made me laugh again and again i found myself becoming more and more enchanted with her company whatever made you come back to england i asked an english mother who divorced my french father and the chance to study medicine at st thomass but dont you miss the south of france especially on nights like this i asked as a clap of thunder crackled above us oh i dont know she said i was about to respond when she added in any case now the english have learnt how to cook the place has become almost civilized i smiled to myself wondering if she was teasing me again i found out immediately by the way she said i assume that was one of your restaurants we had dinner at yes it was i said sheepishly that explains how you got a table so easily when it was packed out why the waiter knew it was a barolo you wanted without your having to ask and how you could leave without paying the bill i was beginning to wonder if i would always be a yard behind her was it the missing waiter the fourandahalffingered chef or the crooked bartender the crooked bartender i replied laughing but i sacked him this afternoon and im afraid his deputy didnt look as if he was coping all that well i explained as i turned right off millbank and began to search for a parking space and i thought you only had eyes for me sighed anna when all the time you were looking over my shoulder and checking on what the deputy barman was up to not all the time i said as i manoeuvred the car into the only space left in the mews where i lived i got out of the car and walked round to annas side opened the door and guided her to the house as i closed the door behind us anna put her arms around my neck and looked up into my eyes i leaned down and kissed her for the first time when she broke away all she said was dont lets bother with coffee michael i slipped off my jacket and led her upstairs and into my bedroom praying that it hadnt been the housekeepers day off when i opened the door i was relieved to find that the bed had been made and the room was tidy ill just be a moment i said and disappeared into the bathroom as i cleaned my teeth i began to wonder if it was all a dream when i returned to the bedroom would i discover she didnt exist i dropped the toothbrush into its mug and went back to the bedroom where was she my eyes followed a trail of discarded clothes that led all the way to the bed her head was propped up on the pillow only a sheet covered her body i quickly took off my clothes dropping them where they fell and switched off the main lights so that only the one by the bed remained aglow i slid under the sheets to join her i looked at her for several seconds before i took her in my arms i slowly explored every part of her body as she began to kiss me again i couldnt believe that anyone could be that exciting and at the same time so tender when we finally made love i knew i never wanted this woman to leave me she lay in my arms for some time before either of us spoke then i began talking about anything that came into my head i confided my hopes my dreams even my worst anxieties with a freedom i had never experienced with anyone before i wanted to share everything with her and then she leaned across and began kissing me once again first on the lips then the neck and chest and as she slowly continued down my body i thought i would explode the last thing i remember was turning off the light by my bed as the clock on the hall table chimed one when i woke the following morning the first rays of sunlight were already shining through the lace curtains and the glorious memory of the night before was instantly revived i turned lazily to take her in my arms but she was no longer there anna i cried out sitting bolt upright there was no reply i flicked on the light by the side of the bed and glanced across at the bedside clock it was i was about to jump out of bed and go in search of her when i noticed a scribbled note wedged under a corner of the clock i picked it up read it slowly and smiled so will i i said and lay back on the pillow thinking about what i should do next i decided to send her a dozen roses later that morning eleven white and one red then i would have a red one delivered to her on the hour every hour until i saw her again after i had showered and dressed i roamed aimlessly around the house i wondered how quickly i could persuade anna to move in and what changes she would want to make heaven knows i thought as i walked through to the kitchen clutching her note the place could do with a womans touch as i ate breakfast i looked up her number in the telephone directory instead of reading the morning paper there it was just as she had said dr townsend listing a surgery number in parsons green lane where she could be contacted between nine and six there was a second number but deep black lettering requested that it should only be used in case of emergencies although i considered my state of health to be an emergency i dialled the first number and waited impatiently all i wanted to say was good morning darling i got your note and can we make last night the first of many a matronly voice answered the phone dr townsends surgery dr townsend please i said which one she asked there are three dr townsends in the practice dr jonathan dr anna and dr elizabeth dr anna i replied oh mrs townsend she said im sorry but shes not available at the moment shes just taken the children off to school and after that she has to go to the airport to pick up her husband dr jonathan whos returning this morning from a medical conference in minneapolis im not expecting her back for at least a couple of hours would you like to leave a message there was a long silence before the matronly voice asked are you still there i placed the receiver back on the hook without replying and looked sadly down at the handwritten note by the side of the phone dear michael i will remember tonight for the rest of my life thank you anna burnt thank you michael id like that i smiled unable to mask my delight hi anna i thought i might have missed you i turned and stared at a tall man with a mop of fair hair who seemed unaffected by the steady flow of people trying to pass him on either side anna gave him a smile that i hadnt seen until that moment hello darling she said this is michael whitaker youre lucky he bought your ticket and if you hadnt turned up i was just about to accept his kind invitation to dinner michael this is my husband jonathan the one who was held up at the hospital as you can see hes now escaped i couldnt think of a suitable reply jonathan shook me warmly by the hand thank you for keeping my wife company he said wont you join us for dinner thats very kind of you i replied but ive just remembered that im meant to be somewhere else right now id better run thats a pity said anna i was rather looking forward to finding out all about the restaurant business perhaps well meet again sometime whenever my husband next leaves me in the lurch goodbye michael goodbye anna i watched them climb into the back of a taxi together and wished jonathan would drop dead in front of me he didnt so i began to retrace my steps back to the spot where i had abandoned my car youre a lucky man jonathan townsend was the only observation i made but no one was listening the next word that came to my lips was damn i repeated it several times as there was a distressingly large space where i was certain id left my car i walked up and down the street in case id forgotten where id parked it cursed again then marched off in search of a phone box unsure if my car had been stolen or towed away there was a pay phone just around the corner in kingsway i picked up the handset and jabbed three nines into it which service do you require fire police or ambulance a voice asked police i said and was immediately put through to another voice charing cross police station what is the nature of your enquiry i think my car has been stolen can you tell me the make colour and registration number please sir its a red ford fiesta registration h shv there was a long pause during which i could hear other voices talking in the background no it hasnt been stolen sir said the officer when he came back on the line the car was illegally parked on a double yellow line its been removed and taken to the vauxhall bridge pound can i pick it up now i asked sulkily certainly sir how will you be getting there ill take a taxi then just ask the driver for the vauxhall bridge pound once you get there youll need some form of identification and a cheque for with a bankers card that is if you dont have the full amount in cash one hundred and five pounds i repeated in disbelief thats correct sir i slammed the phone down just as it started to rain i scurried back to the corner of the aldwych in search of a taxi only to find that they were all being commandeered by the hordes of people still hanging around outside the theatre i put my collar up and nipped across the road dodging between the slowmoving traffic once i had reached the far side i continued running until i found an overhanging ledge broad enough to shield me from the blustery rain i shivered and sneezed several times before an empty cab eventually came to my rescue vauxhall bridge pound i told the driver as i jumped in bad luck mate said the cabbie youre my second this evening i frowned as the taxi manoeuvred its way slowly through the rainswept posttheatre traffic and across waterloo bridge the driver began chattering away i just about managed monosyllabic replies to his opinions on the weather john major the england cricket team and foreign tourists with each new topic his forecast became ever more gloomy when we reached the car pound i passed him a tenpound note and waited in the rain for my change then i dashed off in the direction of a little portakabin where i was faced by my second queue that evening this one was considerably longer than the first and i knew that when i eventually reached the front of it and paid for my ticket i wouldnt be rewarded with any memorable entertainment when my turn finally came a burly policeman pointed to a form scotchtaped to the counter i followed its instructions to the letter first producing my driving license then writing out a cheque for payable to the metropolitan police i handed them both over with my cheque card to the policeman who towered over me the mans sheer bulk was the only reason i didnt suggest that perhaps he ought to have more important things to do with his time like catching drug dealers or even car thieves your vehicle is in the far corner said the officer pointing into the distance over row upon row of cars of course it is i replied i stepped out of the portakabin and back into the rain dodging puddles as i ran between the lines of cars i didnt stop until i reached the farthest corner of the pound it still took me several more minutes to locate my red ford fiesta one disadvantage i thought of owning the most popular car in britain i unlocked the door squelched down onto the front seat and sneezed again i turned the key in the ignition but the engine barely turned over letting out only the occasional splutter before giving up altogether then i remembered i hadnt switched the sidelights off when i made my unscheduled dash for the theatre i uttered a string of expletives that only partly expressed my true feelings i watched as another figure came running across the pound towards a range rover parked in the row in front of me i quickly wound down my window but he had driven off before i could shout the magic words jumper cables i got out and retrieved my jumper cables from the trunk walked to the front of the car raised the hood and attached them to the battery i began to shiver once again as i settled down for another wait i couldnt get anna out of my mind but accepted that the only thing id succeeded in picking up that evening was the flu in the following forty raindrenched minutes three people passed by before a young black man asked so whats the trouble man once i had explained my problem he manoeuvred his old van alongside my car then raised his bonnet and attached the jumper cables to his battery when he switched on his ignition my engine began to turn over thanks i shouted rather inadequately once id revved the engine several times my pleasure man he replied and disappeared into the night as i drove out of the car pound i switched on my radio to hear big ben striking twelve it reminded me that i hadnt turned up for work that night the first thing i needed to do if i wanted to keep my job was to come up with a good excuse i sneezed again and decided on the flu although theyd probably taken the last orders by now gerald wouldnt have closed the kitchens yet i peered through the rain searching the pavements for a pay phone and eventually spotted a row of three outside a post office i stopped the car and jumped out but a cursory inspection revealed that theyd all been vandalized i climbed back into the car and continued my search after dashing in and out of the rain several times i finally spotted a single phone box on the corner of warwick way that looked as if it might just be in working order i dialled the restaurant and waited a long time for someone to answer laguna said an italiansounding young girl janice is that you its mike yes its me mike she whispered reverting to her lambeth accent id better warn you that every time your names been mentioned this evening gerald picks up the nearest meataxe why i asked youve still got nick in the kitchen to see you through nick chopped the top off one of his fingers earlier this evening and gerald had to take him to hospital i was left in charge hes not best pleased oh hell i said but ive got the sack said another voice and this one wasnt whispering gerald i can explain why you didnt turn up for work this evening i sneezed then held my nose ive got the flu if id come in tonight i would have given it to half the customers would you said gerald well i suppose that might have been marginally worse than giving it to the girl who was sitting next to you in the theatre what do you mean i asked letting go of my nose exactly what i said mike you see unfortunately for you a couple of our regulars were two rows behind you at the aldwych they enjoyed the show almost as much as you seemed to and one of them added for good measure that he thought your date was absolutely stunning he must have mistaken me for someone else i said trying not to sound desperate he may have done mike but i havent youre sacked and dont even think about coming in to collect your pay packet because there isnt one for a head waiter whod rather take some bimbo to the theatre than do a nights work the line went dead i hung up the phone and started muttering obscenities under my breath as i walked slowly back towards my car i was only a dozen paces away from it when a young lad jumped into the front seat switched on the ignition and lurched hesitatingly into the centre of the road in what sounded horribly like third gear i chased after the retreating car but once the youth began to accelerate i knew i had no hope of catching him i ran all the way back to the phone box and dialled once again fire police or ambulance i was asked for a second time that night police i said and a moment later i was put through to another voice belgravia police station what is the nature of your enquiry ive just had my car stolen i shouted make model and registration number please sir its a red ford fiesta registration h shv i waited impatiently it hasnt been stolen sir it was illegally parked on a double no it wasnt i shouted even more loudly i paid to get the damn thing out of the vauxhall bridge pound less than half an hour ago and ive just seen it being driven off by a joyrider while i was making a phone call where are you sir in a phone box on the corner of vauxhall bridge road and warwick way and in which direction was the car travelling when you last saw it asked the voice north up vauxhall bridge road and what is your home telephone number sir o and at work like the car i dont have a job any longer right ill get straight onto it sir well be in touch with you the moment we have any news i put the phone down and thought about what i should do next i hadnt been left with a great deal of choice i hailed a taxi and asked to be taken to victoria and was relieved to find that this driver showed no desire to offer any opinions on anything during the short journey to the station when he dropped me i passed him my last note and patiently waited while he handed over every last penny of my change he also muttered an expletive or two i bought a ticket for bromley with my few remaining coins and went in search of the platform youve just about made it mate the ticket collector told me the last trains due in at any minute but i still had to wait for another twenty minutes on the cold empty platform before the last train eventually pulled into the station by then i had memorised every advertisement in sight from guinness to mates while continuing to sneeze at regular intervals when the train came to a halt and the doors squelched open i took a seat in a carriage near the front it was another ten minutes before the engine lurched into action and another forty before it finally pulled into bromley station i emerged into the kent night a few minutes before one oclock and set off in the direction of my little terraced house twentyfive minutes later i staggered up the short path to my front door i began to search for my keys then remembered that id left them in the car ignition i didnt have the energy even to swear and began to grovel around in the dark for the spare frontdoor key that was always hidden under a particular stone but which one at last i found it put it in the lock turned it and pushed the door open no sooner had i stepped inside than the phone on the hall table began to ring i grabbed the receiver mr whitaker speaking this is the belgravia police weve located your car sir and thank god for that i said before the officer had a chance to finish the sentence where is it at this precise moment sir its on the back of a pickup lorry somewhere in chelsea it seems the lad who nicked it only managed to travel a mile or so before he hit the kerb at seventy and bounced straight into a wall im sorry to have to inform you sir that your cars a total writeoff a total writeoff i said in disbelief yes sir the garage who towed it away has been given your number and theyll be in touch with you first thing in the morning i couldnt think of any comment worth making the good news is weve caught the lad who nicked it continued the police officer the bad news is that hes only fifteen doesnt have a drivers licence and of course he isnt insured thats not a problem i said im fully insured myself as a matter of interest sir did you leave your keys in the ignition yes i did i was just making a quick phone call and thought id only be away from the car for a couple of minutes then i think its unlikely youll be covered by your insurance sir not covered by my insurance what are you talking about its standard policy nowadays not to pay out if you leave your keys in the ignition youd better check sir were the officers final words before ringing off i put the phone down and wondered what else could possibly go wrong i slipped off my jacket and began to climb the stairs but came to a sudden halt when i saw my wife waiting for me on the landing maureen i began you can tell me later why the car is a total writeoff she said but not until youve explained why you didnt turn up for work this evening and just who this classy tart is that gerald said you were seen with at the theatre overdone no im not doing anything in particular said anna i smiled unable to mask my delight good i know a little restaurant just down the road that i think you might enjoy that sounds just fine said anna as she made her way through the dense theatre crowd i quickly followed having to hurry just to keep up with her which way she asked i pointed towards the strand she began walking at a brisk pace and we continued to talk about the play when we reached the strand i pointed to a large grey double door on the other side of the road thats it i said i would have taken her hand as she began to cross but she stepped off the pavement ahead of me dodged between the stationary traffic and waited for me on the far side she pushed the grey doors open and once again i followed in her wake we descended a flight of steps into a basement restaurant buzzing with the talk of people who had just come out of theatres and waiters dashing plates in both hands from table to table i dont expect youll be able to get a table here if you havent booked said anna eyeing a group of wouldbe customers who were clustered round the bar impatiently waiting for someone to leave dont worry about that i said with bravado and strode across to the reservations desk i waved a hand imperiously at the head waiter who was taking a customers order i only hoped he would recognise me i turned round to smile at anna but she didnt look too impressed after the waiter had taken the order he walked slowly over to me how may i help you sir he asked can you manage a table for two victor victors off tonight sir have you booked no i havent but the head waiter checked the list of reservations and then looked at his watch i might be able to fit you in around at the latest he said not sounding too hopeful no sooner i pleaded i dont think we can wait that long anna nodded her agreement im afraid not sir said the head waiter we are fully booked until then as i expected said anna turning to leave once again i had to hurry to keep up with her as we stepped out onto the pavement i said theres a little italian restaurant i know not far from here where i can always get a table shall we risk it cant see that weve got a lot of choice replied anna which direction this time just up the road to the right i said as a clap of thunder heralded an imminent downpour damn said anna placing her handbag over her head for protection im sorry i said looking up at the black clouds its my fault i should have stop apologising all the time michael it isnt your fault if it starts to rain i took a deep breath and tried again wed better make a dash for it i said desperately i dont expect well be able to pick up a taxi in this weather this at least secured her ringing endorsement i began running up the road and anna followed closely behind the rain was getting heavier and heavier and although we couldnt have had more than seventy yards to cover we were both soaked by the time we reached the restaurant i sighed with relief when i opened the door and found the dining room was halfempty although i suppose i should have been annoyed i turned and smiled hopefully at anna but she was still frowning everything all right i asked fine its just that my father had a theory about restaurants that were halfempty at this time of night i looked quizzically at my guest but decided not to make any comment about her eye makeup which was beginning to run or her hair which had come loose at the edges id better carry out some repair work ill only be a couple of minutes she said heading for a door marked signorinas i waved at mario who was serving no one in particular he hurried over to me there was a call for you earlier mr whitaker mario said as he guided me across the restaurant to my usual table if you came in i was to ask you to phone gerald urgently he sounded pretty desperate im sure it can wait but if he rings again let me know immediately at that moment anna walked over to join us the makeup had been restored but the hair could have done with further attention i rose to greet her you dont have to do that she said taking her seat would you like a drink i asked once we were both settled no i dont think so i have an early start tomorrow morning so i shouldnt overdo things ill just have a glass of wine with my meal another waiter appeared by her side and what would madam care for this evening he asked politely i havent had time to look at the menu yet anna replied not even bothering to look up at him i can recommend the fettucini madam the waiter said pointing to a dish halfway down the list of entr√©es its our speciality of the day then i suppose i might as well have that said anna handing him the menu i nodded indicating me too and asked for a halfbottle of the house red the waiter scooped up my menu and left us do you can i you first i said attempting a smile do you always order half a bottle of the house wine on a first date she asked i think youll find its pretty good i said rather plaintively i was only teasing michael dont take yourself so seriously i took a closer look at my companion and began to wonder if id made a terrible mistake despite her efforts in the washroom anna wasnt quite the same girl id first seen admittedly at a distance when id nearly crashed my car earlier in the evening oh my god the car i suddenly remembered where id left it and stole a glance at my watch am i boring you already michael anna asked or is this table on a time share yes i mean no im sorry ive just remembered something i should have checked on before we came to dinner sorry i repeated anna frowned which stopped me saying sorry yet again is it too late she asked too late for what to do something about whatever it is you should have checked on before we came to dinner i looked out of the window and wasnt pleased to see that it had stopped raining now my only hope was that the latenight traffic wardens might not be too vigilant no im sure it will be all right i said trying to sound relaxed well thats a relief said anna in a tone that bordered on the sarcastic so whats it like being a doctor i asked trying to change the subject michael its my evening off id rather not talk about my work if you dont mind for the next few moments neither of us spoke i tried again do you have many male patients in your practice i asked as the waiter reappeared with our fettucini i can hardly believe im hearing this anna said unable to disguise the weariness in her voice when are people like you going to accept that one or two of us are capable of a little more than spending our lives waiting hand and foot on the male sex the waiter poured some wine into my glass yes of course absolutely no i didnt mean it to sound like that i sipped the wine and nodded to the waiter who filled annas glass then what did you mean it to sound like demanded anna as she stuck her fork firmly into the fettucini well isnt it unusual for a man to go to a woman doctor i said realising the moment i had uttered the words that i was only getting myself into even deeper water good heavens no michael we live in an enlightened age ive probably seen more naked men than you have and its not an attractive sight i can assure you i laughed in the hope that it would ease the tension in any case she added quite a few men are confident enough to accept the existence of women doctors you know im sure thats true i said i just thought you didnt think michael thats the problem with so many men like you i bet youve never even considered consulting a woman doctor no but yes but no but yes but lets change the subject before i get really angry anna said putting her fork down what do you do for a living michael it doesnt sound as if youre in a profession where women are treated as equals im in the restaurant business i told her wishing the fettucini was a little lighter ah yes you told me in the interval she said but what does being in the restaurant business actually mean im on the management side or at least thats what i do nowadays i started life as a waiter then i moved into the kitchens for about five years and finally found you werent very good at either so you took up managing everyone else something like that i said trying to make light of it but annas words only reminded me that one of my other restaurants was without a chef that night and that that was where id been heading before id allowed myself to become infatuated by anna ive lost you again anna said beginning to sound exasperated you were going to tell me all about restaurant management yes i was wasnt i by the way hows your fettucini not bad considering considering considering this place was your second choice i was silenced once again its not that bad she said taking another reluctant forkful perhaps youd like something else instead i can always no thank you michael after all this was the one dish the waiter felt confident enough to recommend i couldnt think of a suitable response so i remained silent come on michael you still havent explained what restaurant management actually involves said anna well at the moment im running three restaurants in the west end which means i never stop dashing from one to the other depending on which is facing the biggest crisis on that particular day sounds a bit like ward duty to me said anna so who turned out to have the biggest crisis today today thank heaven was not typical i told her with feeling that bad said anna yes im afraid so we lost a chef this morning who cut off the top of his finger and wont be back at work for at least a fortnight my head waiter in our second restaurant is off claiming he has flu and ive just had to sack the barman in the third for fiddling the books barmen always fiddle the books of course but in this case even the customers began to notice what he was up to i paused wondering if i should risk another mouthful of fettucini but i still wouldnt want to be in any other business in the circumstances im frankly amazed you were able to take the evening off i shouldnt have really and wouldnt have except i trailed off as i leaned over and topped up annas wine glass except what she said do you want to hear the truth i asked as i poured the remains of the wine into my own glass ill try that for starters she said i placed the empty bottle on the side of the table and hesitated but only for a moment i was driving to one of my restaurants earlier this evening when i spotted you going into the theatre i stared at you for so long that i nearly crashed into the back of the car in front of me then i swerved across the road into the nearest parking space and the car behind almost crashed into me i leapt out ran all the way to the theatre and searched everywhere until i saw you standing in the queue for the box office i joined the line and watched you hand over your spare ticket once you were safely out of sight i told the box office manager that you hadnt expected me to make it in time and that you might have put my ticket up for resale once id described you which i was able to do in great detail he handed it over without so much as a murmur more fool him said anna putting down her glass and staring at me as if id just been released from a lunatic asylum then i put two tenpound notes into a theatre envelope and took the place next to you i continued the rest you already know i waited with some trepidation to see how she would react i suppose i ought to be flattered anna said after a moments consideration but i dont know whether to laugh or cry one things for certain the woman ive been living with for the past ten years will think its highly amusing especially as you paid for her ticket the waiter returned to remove the halffinished plates was everything all right sir he asked sounding anxious fine just fine i said unconvincingly anna grimaced but made no comment would you care for coffee madam no i dont think ill risk it she said looking at her watch in any case i ought to be getting back elizabeth will be wondering where ive got to she stood up and walked towards the door i followed a yard behind she was just about to step onto the pavement when she turned to me and asked dont you think you ought to settle the bill that wont be necessary why she asked laughing do you own the place no but it is one of the three restaurants i manage anna turned scarlet im so sorry michael she said that was tactless of me she paused for a moment before adding but im sure youll agree that the food wasnt exactly memorable would you like me to drive you home i asked trying not to sound too enthusiastic anna looked up at the black clouds that would be useful she replied if its not miles out of your way wheres your car she said before i had a chance to ask where she lived i left it just up the road oh yes i remember said anna when you jumped out of it because you couldnt take your eyes off me im afraid you picked the wrong girl this time at last we had found something on which we could agree but i made no comment as we walked towards the spot where i had abandoned my car anna limited her conversation to whether it was about to rain again and how good she had thought the wine was i was relieved to find my volvo parked exactly where i had left it i was searching for my keys when i spotted a large sticker glued to the windscreen i looked down at the front offside wheel and saw the yellow clamp it just isnt your night is it said anna but dont worry about me ill just grab a cab she raised her hand and a taxi skidded to a halt she turned back to face me thanks for dinner she managed not altogether convincingly and added even less convincingly perhaps well meet again before i could respond she had slammed the taxi door closed as i watched her being driven away it started to rain i took one more look at my immovable car and decided i would deal with the problem in the morning i was about to rush for the nearest shelter when another taxi came around the corner its yellow light indicating that it was for hire i waved frantically and it drew up beside my clamped car bad luck mate said the cabbie looking down at my front wheel my third tonight i attempted a smile so where to guv i gave him my address in lambeth and climbed into the back as the taxi manoeuvred its way slowly through the rainswept posttheatre traffic and across waterloo bridge the driver began chattering away i just about managed monosyllabic replies to his opinions on the weather john major the england cricket team and foreign tourists with each new topic his forecast became ever more gloomy he only stopped offering his opinions when he came to a halt outside my house in fentiman road i paid him and smiled ruefully at the thought that this would be the first time in weeks that id managed to get home before midnight i walked slowly up the short path to the front door i turned the key in the lock and opened the door quietly so as not to wake my wife once inside i went through my nightly ritual of slipping off my jacket and shoes before creeping quietly up the stairs before i had reached the bedroom i began to get undressed after years of coming in at one or two in the morning i was able to take off all my clothes fold and stack them and slide under the sheets next to judy without waking her but just as i pulled back the cover she said drowsily i didnt think youd be home so early with all the problems you were facing tonight i wondered if she was talking in her sleep how much damage did the fire do the fire i said standing in the nude in davies street gerald phoned a few moments after youd left to say a fire had started in the kitchen and had spread to the restaurant he was just checking to make certain you were on your way hed cancelled all the bookings for the next two weeks but he didnt think theyd be able to open again for at least a month i told him that as youd left just after six youd be with him at any minute so just how bad is the damage i was already dressed by the time judy was awake enough to ask why i had never turned up at the restaurant i shot down the stairs and out onto the street in search of another cab it had started raining again a taxi swung round and came to a halt in front of me where to this time guv √° point thank you michael id like that i smiled unable to mask my delight hi pipsqueak i thought i might have missed you i turned and stared at a tall man with a mop of fair hair who seemed unaffected by the steady flow of people trying to pass him on either side anna gave him a smile that i hadnt seen until that moment hello jonathan she said this is michael whitaker youre lucky he bought your ticket and if you hadnt turned up i was just about to accept his kind invitation to dinner michael this is my brother jonathan the one who was held up at the hospital as you can see hes now escaped i couldnt think of a suitable reply jonathan shook me warmly by the hand thank you for keeping my sister company he said wont you join us for dinner thats kind of you i replied but ive just remembered that im meant to be somewhere else right now id better youre not meant be anywhere else right now interrupted anna giving me the same smile dont be so feeble she linked her arm in mine in any case wed both like you to join us thank you i said theres a restaurant just down the road that ive been told is rather good said jonathan as the three of us began walking off in the direction of the strand great im famished said anna so tell me all about the play jonathan said as anna linked her other arm in his every bit as good as the critics promised said anna you were unlucky to miss it i said but im rather glad you did said anna as we reached the corner of the strand i think thats the place im looking for said jonathan pointing to a large grey double door on the far side of the road the three of us weaved our way through the temporarily stationary traffic once we reached the other side of the road jonathan pushed open one of the grey doors to allow us through it started to rain just as we stepped inside he led anna and me down a flight of stairs into a basement restaurant buzzing with the talk of people who had just come out of theatres and waiters dashing plates in both hands from table to table ill be impressed if you can get a table here anna said to her brother eyeing a group of wouldbe customers who were clustered round the bar impatiently waiting for someone to leave you should have booked she added as he began waving at the head waiter who was fully occupied taking a customers order i remained a yard or two behind them and as mario came across i put a finger to my lips and nodded to him i dont suppose you have a table for three asked jonathan yes of course sir please follow me said mario leading us to a quiet table in the corner of the room that was a bit of luck said jonathan it certainly was anna agreed jonathan suggested that i take the far chair so his sister could sit between us once we had settled jonathan asked what i would like to drink how about you i said turning to anna another dry martini jonathan looked surprised you havent had a dry martini since anna scowled at him and said quickly ill just have a glass of wine with the meal since when i wondered but only said ill have the same mario reappeared and handed us our menus jonathan and anna studied theirs in silence for some time before jonathan asked any ideas it all looks so tempting anna said but i think ill settle for the fettucini and a glass of red wine what about a starter asked jonathan no im on first call tomorrow if you remember unless of course youre volunteering to take my place not after what ive been through this evening pipsqueak id rather go without a starter too he said how about you michael dont let our domestic problems get in your way fettucini and a glass of red wine would suit me just fine three fettucini and a bottle of your best chianti said jonathan when mario returned anna leaned over to me and whispered conspiratorially its the only italian wine he can pronounce correctly what would have happened if wed chosen fish i asked her hes also heard of frascati but hes never quite sure what hes meant to do when someone orders duck what are you two whispering about asked jonathan as he handed his menu back to mario i was asking your sister about the third partner in the practice not bad michael anna said you should have gone into politics my wife elizabeth is the third partner jonathan said unaware of what anna had been getting at she poor darling is on call tonight you note two women and one man said anna as the wine waiter appeared by jonathans side yes there used to be four of us said jonathan without explanation he studied the label on the bottle before nodding sagely youre not fooling anyone jonathan michael has already worked out that youre no sommelier said anna sounding as if she was trying to change the subject the waiter extracted the cork and poured a little wine into jonathans glass for him to taste so what do you do michael asked jonathan after he had given a second nod to the wine waiter dont tell me youre a doctor because im not looking for another man to join the practice no hes in the restaurant business said anna as three bowls of fettucini were placed in front of us i see you two obviously swapped life histories during the interval said jonathan but what does being in the restaurant business actually mean im on the management side i explained or at least thats what i do nowadays i started life as a waiter then i moved into the kitchens for about five years and finally ended up in management but what does a restaurant manager actually do asked anna obviously the interval wasnt long enough for you to go into any great detail said jonathan as he jabbed his fork into some fettucini well at the moment im running three restaurants in the west end which means i never stop dashing from one to the other depending on which is facing the biggest crisis on that particular day sounds a bit like ward duty to me said anna so who turned out to have the biggest crisis today today thank heaven was not typical i said with feeling that bad said jonathan yes im afraid so we lost a chef this morning who cut off the top of his finger and wont be back at work for at least a fortnight my head waiter in our second restaurant is off claiming he has flu and ive just had to sack the barman in the third for fiddling the books barmen always fiddle the books of course but in this case even the customers began to notice what he was up to i paused but i still wouldnt want to be in any other a shrill ring interrupted me i couldnt tell where the sound was coming from until jonathan removed a tiny cellular phone from his jacket pocket sorry about this he said hazard of the job he pressed a button and put the phone to his ear he listened for a few seconds and a frown appeared on his face yes i suppose so ill be there as quickly as i can he flicked the phone closed and put it back into his pocket sorry he repeated one of my patients has chosen this particular moment to have a relapse im afraid im going to have to leave you he stood up and turned to his sister how will you get home pipsqueak im a big girl now said anna so ill just look around for one of those black objects on four wheels with a sign on the top that reads taxi and then ill wave at it dont worry jonathan i said ill drive her home thats very kind of you said jonathan because if its still pouring by the time you leave she may not be able to find one of those black objects to wave at in any case its the least i can do after i ended up getting your ticket your dinner and your sister fair exchange said jonathan as mario came rushing up is everything all right sir he asked no it isnt im on call and have to go he handed over an american express card if youd be kind enough to put this through your machine ill sign for it and you can fill in the amount later and please add fifteen per cent thank you sir said mario and rushed away hope to see you again said jonathan i rose to shake him by the hand i hope so too i said jonathan left us headed for the bar and signed a slip of paper mario handed him back his american express card as anna waved to her brother i looked towards the bar and shook my head slightly mario tore up the little slip of paper and dropped the pieces into a wastepaper basket it hasnt been a wonderful day for jonathan either said anna turning back to face me and what with your problems im amazed you were able to take the evening off i shouldnt have really and wouldnt have except i trailed off as i leaned over and topped up annas glass except what she asked do you want to hear the truth i asked as i poured the remains of the wine into my own glass ill try that for starters she said i placed the empty bottle on the side of the table and hesitated but only for a moment i was driving to one of my restaurants earlier this evening when i spotted you going into the theatre i stared at you for so long that i nearly crashed into the back of the car in front of me then i swerved across the road into the nearest parking space and the car behind almost crashed into me i leapt out ran all the way to the theatre and searched everywhere until i saw you standing in the queue for the box office i joined the line and watched you hand over your spare ticket once you were safely out of sight i told the box office manager that you hadnt expected me to make it in time and that you might have put my ticket up for resale after id described you which i was able to do in great detail he handed it over without so much as a murmur anna put down her glass of wine and stared across at me with a look of incredulity im glad he fell for your story she said but should i yes you should because then i put two tenpound notes into a theatre envelope and took the place next to you i continued the rest you already know i waited to see how she would react she didnt speak for some time im flattered she said eventually i didnt realise there were any oldfashioned romantics left in the world she lowered her head slightly am i allowed to ask what you have planned for the rest of the evening nothing has been planned so far i admitted which is why its all been so refreshing you make me sound like an after eight mint said anna with a laugh i can think of at least three replies to that i told her as mario reappeared looking a little disappointed at the sight of the halfempty plates is everything all right sir he asked sounding anxious couldnt have been better said anna who hadnt stopped looking at me would you like a coffee madam mario asked her no thank you said anna firmly we have to go in search of a marooned car heaven knows if it will still be there after all this time i said as she rose from her place i took annas hand led her towards the entrance back up the stairs and out onto the street then i began to retrace my steps to the spot where id abandoned my car as we strolled up the aldwych and chatted away i felt as if i was with an old friend you dont have to give me a lift michael anna was saying its probably miles out of your way and in any case its stopped raining so ill just hail a taxi i want to give you a lift i told her that way ill have your company for a little longer she smiled as we reached a distressingly large space where i had left the car damn i said i quickly checked up and down the road and returned to find anna laughing is this another of your schemes to have more of my company she teased she opened her bag and took out a mobile phone dialled and passed it over to me which service do you require fire police or ambulance a voice asked police i said and was immediately put through to another voice charing cross police station what is the nature of your enquiry i think my car has been stolen can you tell me the make colour and registration number please sir its a blue rover registration k shv there was a long pause during which i could hear other voices talking in the background no it hasnt been stolen sir said the officer who had been dealing with me when he came back on the line the vehicle was illegally parked on a double yellow line its been removed and taken to the vauxhall bridge pound can i pick it up now i asked certainly sir how will you be getting there ill take a taxi then just ask the driver for the vauxhall bridge pound once you get there youll need some form of identification and a cheque for with a bankers card that is if you dont have the full amount in cash i said quietly thats correct sir anna frowned for the first time that evening worth every penny i beg your pardon sir nothing officer goodnight i handed the phone back to anna and said the next thing im going to do is find you a taxi you certainly are not michael because im staying with you in any case you promised my brother youd take me home i took her hand and hailed a taxi which swung across the road and came to a halt beside us vauxhall bridge pound please bad luck mate said the cabbie youre my fourth this evening i gave him a broad grin i expect the other three also chased you into the theatre but luckily they were behind me in the queue i said to anna as i joined her on the back seat as the taxi manoeuvred its way slowly through the rainswept posttheatre traffic and across waterloo bridge anna said dont you think i should have been given the chance to choose between the four of you after all one of them might have been driving a rollsroyce not possible and why not pray asked anna because you couldnt have parked a rollsroyce in that space but if hed had a chauffeur that would have solved all my problems in that case i would simply have run him over the taxi had travelled some distance before either of us spoke again can i ask you a personal question anna eventually said if its what i think it is i was about to ask you the same thing then you go first no im not married i said nearly once but she escaped anna laughed and you i was married she said quietly he was the fourth doctor in the practice he died three years ago i spent nine months nursing him but in the end i failed im so sorry i said feeling a little ashamed that was tactless of me i shouldnt have raised the subject i raised it michael not you its me who should apologise neither of us spoke again for several minutes until anna said for the past three years since andrews death ive immersed myself in work and i seem to spend most of my spare time boring jonathan and elizabeth to distraction they couldnt have been more understanding but they must be heartily sick of it by now i wouldnt be surprised if jonathan hadnt arranged an emergency for tonight so someone else could take me to the theatre for a change it might even give me the confidence to go out again heaven knows she added as we drove into the car pound enough people have been kind enough to ask me i passed the cabbie a tenpound note and we dashed through the rain in the direction of a little portakabin i walked up to the counter and read the form sellotaped to it i took out my wallet extracted my driving licence and began counting i only had eighty pounds in cash and i never carry a chequebook anna grinned and took the envelope id presented to her earlier in the evening from her bag she tore it open and extracted the two tenpound notes added a fivepound note of her own and handed them over to me thank you i said once again feeling embarrassed worth every penny she replied with a grin the policeman counted the notes slowly placed them in a tin box and gave me a receipt its right there in the front row he said pointing out of the window and if i may say so sir it was perhaps unwise of you to leave your keys in the ignition if the vehicle had been stolen your insurance company would not have been liable to cover the claim he passed me my keys it was my fault officer said anna i should have sent him back for them but i didnt realise what he was up to ill make sure he doesnt do it again the officer looked up at me i shrugged my shoulders and led anna out of the cabin and across to my car i opened the door to let her in then nipped round to the drivers side as she leant over and pushed my door open i took my place behind the wheel and turned to face her im sorry i said the rain has ruined your dress a drop of water fell off the end of her nose but you know youre just as beautiful wet or dry thank you michael she smiled but if you dont have any objection on balance id prefer to be dry i laughed so where shall i take you i asked suddenly aware that i didnt know where she lived fulham please parsons green lane its not too far i pushed the key into the ignition not caring how far it was i turned the key and took a deep breath the engine spluttered but refused to start then i realised i had left the sidelights on dont do this to me i begged as anna began laughing again i turned the key a second time and the motor caught i let out a sigh of relief that was a close one anna said if it hadnt started we might have ended up spending the rest of the night together or was that all part of your dastardly plan nothings gone to plan so far i admitted as i drove out of the pound i paused before adding still i suppose things might have turned out differently you mean if i hadnt been the sort of girl you were looking for something like that i wonder what those other three men would have thought of me said anna wistfully who cares theyre not going to have the chance to find out you sound very sure of yourself mr whitaker if you only knew i said but i would like to see you again anna if youre willing to risk it she seemed to take an eternity to reply yes id like that she said eventually but only on condition that you pick me up at my place so i can be certain you park your car legally and remember to switch your lights off i accept your terms i told her and i wont even add any conditions of my own if we can begin the agreement tomorrow evening once again anna didnt reply immediately im not sure i know what im doing tomorrow evening neither do i i said but ill cancel it whatever it is then so will i said anna as i drove into parsons green lane and began searching for number fortynine its about a hundred yards down on the left she said i drew up and parked outside her front door dont lets bother with the theatre this time said anna come round at about eight and ill cook you some supper she leant over and kissed me on the cheek before turning back to open the car door i jumped out and walked quickly round to her side of the car as she stepped onto the pavement so ill see you around eight tomorrow evening she said ill look forward to that i hesitated and then took her in my arms goodnight anna goodnight michael she said as i released her and thank you for buying my ticket not to mention dinner im glad my other three wouldbe suitors only made it as far as the car pound i smiled as she pushed the key into the lock of her front door she turned back by the way michael was that the restaurant with the missing waiter the fourandahalffingered chef or the crooked bartender the crooked bartender i replied with a smile she closed the door behind her as the clock on a nearby church struck one
