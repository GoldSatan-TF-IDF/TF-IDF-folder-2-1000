white witch black curse kim harrison to the guy who finishes my sentences and gets my jokes even the lame ones one the bloody handprint was gone wiped from kistens window but not from my memory and it ticked me off that someone had cleaned it as if they were trying to steal what little recollection i retained about the night hed died the anger was misplaced fear if i was honest with myself but i wasnt most days it was better that way stifling a shiver from the december chill that had taken the abandoned cruiser now in dry dock rather than floating on the river i stood in the tiny kitchen and stared at the milky plastic as if willing the smeared mark back into existence in the near distance came the overindulgent powerful huff of a diesel train crossing the ohio river the scrape of fords shoes on the metallic boarding ladder was harsh and worry pinched my brow the federal inderland bureau had officially closed the investigation into kistens murderinderland security hadnt even opened onebut the fib wouldnt let me into their impound yard without an official presence that meant intelligent awkward ford since edden thought i needed more psychiatric evaluation and i wouldnt come in anymore not since i fell asleep on the couch and everyone in the fibs cincinnati office had heard me snoring i didnt need evaluation what i needed was somethinganythingto rebuild my memory if it was a bloody handprint then so be it rachel wait for me the fibs psychiatrist called shifting my worry to annoyance like i cant handle this im a big girl besides there wasnt anything left to see the fib had cleaned everything up ford had obviously been out here earliergiven the ladder and the unlocked doormaking sure everything was sufficiently tidy before our appointment the clatter of dress shoes on teak pushed me forward and i untangled my arms from themselves and reached for the tiny galley table for balance as i headed to the living room the floor was still which felt weird beyond the short curtains framing the nowclean window were the dirty gray and brilliant blue tarps of boats at dry dock the ground a good six feet below us will you hold up ford asked again the light eclipsing as he entered i cant help if youre a room away im waiting i grumbled coming to a halt and tugging my shoulder bag up though hed tried to hide it ford had some difficulty getting his butt up the ladder i thought the idea of a psychiatrist afraid of heights was hilarious until the amulet he wore around his neck turned a bright pink when i mentioned it and ford went red with embarrassment he was a good man with his own demons to circle he didnt deserve my razzing fords breathing slowed in the chill silence wan but determined he gripped the table his face whiter than usual which made his short black hair stand out and his brown eyes soulful listening in on my feelings was draining and i appreciated his wading through my emotional crap to help me piece together what had happened i gave him a thin smile and ford undid the top few buttons of his coat to reveal a professional cotton shirt and the amulet he wore while working the metallic ley line charm was a visual display of the emotions he was picking up he felt the emotions whether he was wearing the charm or not but those around him had at least the illusion of privacy when he took it off ivy my roommate and business partner thought it stupid to try to break witch magic with human psychology in order to recover my memory but i was desperate her efforts to find out who had killed kisten were getting nowhere fords relief at being surrounded by walls was almost palpable and seeing him release his death grip on the table i headed for the narrow door to the living room and the rest of the boat the faint scent of vampire and pasta brushed against meimagination stoked by a memory it had been five months my jaw clenched and i kept my eyes on the floor not wanting to see the broken door frame there were smudges of dirt on the lowmat carpet that hadnt been there before marks left by careless people who didnt know kisten had never known his smile the way he laughed or the way his eyes crinkled up when he surprised me technically an inderland death without human involvement was out of the fibs jurisdiction but since the is didnt care that my boyfriend had been turned into a blood gift the fib had made an effort just for me murder was never taken off the books but the investigation had been officially shelved this was the first chance id had to come out here to try to rekindle my memory someone had nicked the inside of my lip trying to bind me to them someone had murdered my boyfriend twice someone was going to be in a world of hurt when i found out who they were stomach fluttering i looked past ford to the window where the bloody handprint had been left like a signpost to mock my pain without giving any prints to follow coward the amulet around fords neck flashed to an angry black his eyes met mine as his eyebrows rose and i forced my emotions to slow i couldnt remember crap jenks my backup and other business partner had dosed me into forgetting so i wouldnt go after kistens murderer i couldnt blame him the pixy was only four inches tall and it had been his only option to keep me from killing myself on a suicide run i was a witch with an unclaimed vampire bite and that couldnt stand up to an undead vampire no matter how you sliced it you sure youre up to this ford asked and i forced my hand down from my upper arm again it throbbed with a pain long since gone as a memory tried to surface fear stirred in me the recollection of being on the other side of the door and trying to break it down was an old one it was nearly the only memory i had of that night i want to know i said but my voice sounded wobbly even to me i had kicked the freaking door open i had used my foot because my arm had hurt too much to move id been crying at the time and my hair had been in my eyes and mouth i had kicked the door down a memory sifted from what i knew and my pulse hammered as something was added the recollection of me falling backward hitting a wall my head hit a wall breath held i looked across the living room staring at the featureless paneling right there i remember ford came unusually close you dont have to do it this way pity was in his eyes i didnt like it there directed at me and his amulet turned silver as i gathered my will and passed through the door frame i do i said boldly even if i dont remember anything the fib guys might have missed something the fib was fantastic at gathering information even better than the is it had to be since the humanrun institution had to rely on finding evidence not sweeping the room for emotions or using witch charms to discover who committed the crime and why everyone was capable of missing something though and that was one of the reasons i was out here the other was to remember now that i was i was scared my head hit the walljust over there ford came in behind me watching as i scanned the lowceilinged living room that stretched from one side of the boat to the other it looked normal here apart from the unmoving cincy skyline visible through the narrow windows my hand went to my middle as my stomach cramped i had to do this no matter what i remembered i meant ford said as he put his hands in his pockets ive other ways to trigger memories meditation i said embarrassed for having fallen asleep in his office feeling the beginnings of a stress headache i strode past the couch where kisten and i had eaten dinner past the tv that got lousy reception not that we ever really watched it and past the wet bar inches from the undamaged wall my jaw began to ache slowly i put a hand to the paneling where my head had hit curling my fingers under when they started to tremble my head had hit the wall who shoved me kisten his killer but the memory was fragmented there was no more turning away i shoved my hand in my pocket to hide the slight shaking my breath slipped from me in an almostvisible cloud and i tugged my coat closer the train was long gone nothing moved past the curtains but a flapping blue tarp instinct told me kisten hadnt died in this room i had to go deeper ford said nothing as i walked into the dark narrow hallway blind until my eyes adjusted my pulse quickened as i passed the tiny bathroom where id tried on the sharp caps kisten had given me for my birthday and i slowed listening to my body and realizing i was rubbing my fingertips together as they silently burned my skin tingled and i halted staring at my fingers recognizing the memory of feeling carpet under my fingers hot from friction i held my breath as a new thought surfaced born from the longgone sensation terror helplessness i had been dragged down this hall a flash of remembered panic rose and i squelched it forcing my breath out in a slow exhalation the lines id made in the carpet had been erased by the fib vacuuming for evidence erased from my memory by a spell only my body had remembered and now me ford stood silently behind me he knew something was trickling through my brain ahead was the door to the bedroom and my fear thickened that was where it had happened that was where kisten had lain his body torn and savaged slumped against the bed his eyes silvered and truly dead what if i remember it all right here in front of ford and break down rachel i jumped startled and ford winced we can do this another way he coaxed the meditation didnt work but hypnosis might its less stressful shaking my head i moved forward and reached for the handle of kistens room my fingers were pale and cold looking like mine but not hypnosis was a false calm that would put off the panic until the middle of the night when id be alone im fine i said then pushed the door open taking a slow breath i went in the large room was cold the wide windows that let in the light doing little to keep out the chill arm clutched against me i looked to where kisten had been propped up against the bed kisten there was nothing my heart ached as i missed him behind me ford started to breathe with an odd regularity working to keep my emotions from overwhelming him someone had cleaned the carpet where kisten had died for the second and final time not that there had been much blood the fingerprint powder was gone but the only prints they had found were from me ivy and kistenscattered like signposts thered been none from his murderer not even on kistens body the is had probably cleaned his corpse between when id left to kick some vampire ass and my bewildered return with the fib after id forgotten everything the is didnt want the murder solved a courtesy to whoever kistens last blood had been given as a thankyou inderland tradition came before societys laws apparently the same people id actually once worked for were covering it up and that pissed me off my thoughts vacillated between rage and a debilitating heartache ford panted and i tried to relax for him if nothing else blinking back the threatened tears i stared at the ceiling breathing in the cold quiet air and counting backward from ten running through the useless exercise ford had given me to find a light state of meditation at least kisten had been spared the sordidness of being drained for someones pleasure he had died twice in quick succession both times probably trying to save me from the vampire hed been given to his necropsy had been no help at all whatever had killed him the first time had been repaired by the vampire virus before he died again and if what id told jenks before losing my memory was true hed died his second death by biting his attacker mixing their undead blood to kill them both unfortunately kisten hadnt been dead for long it might only have left his much older attacker simply wounded i just didnt know i mentally reached zero and calmer i moved toward the dresser there was a shirt box on it and i almost bent double in heartache when i recognized it oh god i whispered my hand went out turning to a fist before my fingers slowly uncurled and i touched it it was the lace teddy kisten had given me for my birthday id forgotten it was here im sorry ford rasped and my gaze blurring from tears i saw him slumped in the threshold my eyes squinted shut to make the tears leak out and i held my breath my head pounded and i took a gasping breath only to hold it again struggling for control damn it he had loved me and i had loved him it wasnt fair it wasnt right and it was probably my fault a soft sound from the threshold told me ford was struggling and i forced myself to breathe i had to get control of myself i was hurting ford he was feeling everything i was and i owed him a lot ford was the reason i hadnt been hauled in for questioning by the fib despite my working for them occasionally he was human but his curse of being able to feel anothers emotions was better than a polygraph or truth charm he knew id loved kisten and was terrified of what had happened here you okay i asked when his breathing evened out fine yourself he said in a wispy voice peachy keen i said gripping the top of the dresser im sorry i didnt know it was going to be this bad i knew what i was in for when i agreed to bring you out here he said wiping a tear from his eye that i no longer would cry for myself i can take anything you dish out rachel i turned away guilty ford stayed where he was the distance helping him cope with the overload he never touched anyone except by accident it had to be a crappy way to live but as i rocked away from the dresser there was a soft pull as my fingertips left the underside of the dresser top sticky sniffing my fingertips i found the faint bite of propellant sticky web someone had used sticky web and smeared it off on the underside of the dresser top me kistens murderer sticky web worked only on fairies and pixies it was little more than an irritant to anyone else like a spiderweb jenks had begged off coming out here on the excuse of it being too cold which it was but maybe he knew more than he was saying my heartache eased from the distraction and kneeling i dug in my bag for a penlight and shined it on the underside of the lip of the dresser id be willing to bet no one had dusted it ford came close and i snapped the light off and stood i didnt want fib justice i wanted my own ivy and i would come out later and do our own recon test the ceiling for evidence of hydrocarbons too shake jenks down to find out just how long hed been with me that night fords disapproval was almost palpable and i knew if i looked his amulet would be a bright red from picking up my anger i didnt care i was angry and that was better than falling apart with a new feeling of purpose i faced the rest of the room ford had seen the smeared mess the fib would reopen the case if they found one good printother than the one id just made that is this might be the last time i was allowed in here leaning back against the dresser i closed my eyes and crossed my arms trying to remember nothing i needed more wheres the stuff i asked both dreading and eager to realize what else lay hidden in my mind ready to surface there was the sound of sliding plastic and ford reluctantly handed me a packet of evidence bags and a stack of photos rachel we should leave if theres a viable print the fib has had five months i said nervous as i took them its my turn and dont give me any crap about disturbing evidence the entire department has been through here if theres a print its probably one of theirs he sighed as i turned to the dresser and arranged the plastic bags print side down i took up the photos first my gaze rising to the reflection of the room behind me i moved the picture of the smeared bloody handprint on the kitchen window to the back of the stack and tidied the pile with several businesslike taps i got nothing from the handprint apart from the feeling that it wasnt mine or kistens the picture of kisten was absent thank god and i crossed the room with a photo of a dent in the wall ford was silent as i touched the paneling and i decided by the lack of phantom pain that i hadnt made it thered been a fight here other than mine over me probably i slid the photo behind the stack under it was a closeup of a shoe imprint taken under the bank of windows my head started to throb and with that as a warning i knew something was here lurking in my thoughts jaw tight i forced myself to the window kneeling to run a hand over the smooth carpet trying to spark a memory even as i feared it the print was of a mans dress shoe not kistens it was too mundane for that kisten had kept only the latest fashions in his closet had the shoe been black or brown i thought willing something to surface nothing frustrated i closed my eyes in my thoughts the scent of vampire incense mixed with an unfamiliar aftershave a quiver rose through me and not caring what ford thought i put my face on the carpet to breathe in the smell of fibers somethinganythingplease panic fluttered at the edge of my thoughts and i forced myself to breathe more deeply not caring that my butt was in the air as primitive switches in my brain fired and scents were given names musky shadows that never saw the sun the cloying scent of decayed water earth silk candlescented dust they added up to the undead if id been a vampire i might have been able to find kistens killer by scent alone but i was a witch tense i breathed again searching my thoughts and finding nothing slowly the feeling of panic subsided and my headache retreated i exhaled in relief id been mistaken there was nothing here it was just carpet and my mind had been inventing smells as it tried to fulfill my need for answers nothing i murmured into the carpet inhaling deeply one last time before i sat up a pulse of terror washed through me as i breathed in the scent of vampire shocked i awkwardly scrambled to my feet staring down at the carpet as if having been betrayed damn it in a cold sweat i turned away and tugged my coat straight ivy ill ask her to come out and smell the carpet i thought then almost laughed catching it back in a harsh gurgle i pretended to cough fingers cold as i shifted to the next photo oh even better i thought sarcastically scratch marks on the paneling my breath came fast and my gaze shot straight to the wall by the tiny closet as my fingertips started to throb almost panting i stared refusing to go look and confirm that my finger span matched the marks afraid i might remember something even as i wanted to i didnt recall making the marks on the wall but it was obvious my body did id seen fear before id seen fear bright and shiny when death comes at you in an instant and you can only react i knew the nauseating mix of fear and hope when death comes slow and you frantically try to find a way to escape it id grown up with old fear the kind that stalks you from a distance death lurking on the horizon so inevitable and inescapable that it loses its power but this outright panic with no visible reason was new and i trembled as i tried to find a way to deal with it maybe i can ignore it that works for ivy clearing my throat i tried for an air of nonchalance as i set the remaining pictures on the dresser and spread them out but i wasnt fooling anyone smears of bloodnot splattered but smeared kistens according to the fib guys a picture of a split drawer that had been slid back out of sight another useless bloody handprint on the deck where kistens killer had vaulted over the side none of them hit me like the scratches or carpet and i struggled with wanting to know but was afraid to remember slowly my pulse eased and my shoulders lost their stiffness i set the pictures down bypassing the bags of dust and lint the fib had vacuumed up seeing my strands of red curls among the carpet fuzz and sock fluff i watched myself in the mirror as my fingers touched the hair band in a clear evidence bag it was one of mine and it had held my braid together that night a dull throb in my scalp lifted through my awareness and ford shifted uneasily shit the band meant something talk to me ford said and i pressed my thumb into the rubber cord through the plastic trying to keep the fear from gaining control again evidence pointed at me to be kistens killer hence the notquitehidden mistrust i now felt at the fib but i hadnt done it id been here but i hadnt done it at least ford believed me someone had left the stinking bloody handprints this is mine i said softly so my voice wouldnt quaver i thinksomeone undid my hair feeling unreal i turned the bag over to see that it had been found in the bedroom and a surge of panic rose from out of nowhere my heart hammered but i forced my breathing to steady memory trickled back pieces and nothing of use fingers in my hair my face against a wall kistens killer taking my hair out of its braid no wonder i hadnt let jenkss kids touch my hair much the last five months or why id freaked when marshal had tucked my hair behind my ear queasy i dropped the bag dizzy when the edges of my sight dimmed if i passed out ford would call someone and that would be that i wanted to know i had to the last piece of evidence was damning and turning to rest my backside against the dresser i shook a small unbroken blue pellet to the corner of its bag it was filled with a nowdefunct sleepytime charm it was the only thing in my arsenal that would drop a dead vampire a faint prickling of the hair on the back of my neck grew as a new thought lifted through me and a whisper of memory clenched my heart my breath came out in a pained rush and my head bowed i was crying swearing pointing my splat gun i pulled the trigger and laughing he caught the spell he caught it i whispered closing my eyes so they wouldnt fill i tried to shoot him and he caught it without breaking it my wrist pulsed in pain and another memory surfaced thin fingers gripped my wrist my hand went numb a thump when my gun hit the floor he hurt my hand until i dropped my splat gun i said i think i ran then afraid i looked at ford seeing his amulet purple with shock my little red splat gun had never been missing was never recorded as having been here all my potions were accounted for someone had clearly put the gun back where it belonged i didnt even remember making the sleepytime charms but this was clearly one of mine where the other six were was a good question in a surge of anger i kicked the dresser with the ball of my foot the shock went all the way up my leg and the furniture thumped into the wall it was stupid but it felt good uh rachel ford said and i kicked it again grunting im fine i shouted sniffing back the tears im freaking fine but my lip was throbbing where someone had bitten me my body was trying to get my mind to remember but i simply wouldnt let it had it been kisten who had bitten me his attacker i hadnt been bound thank god ivy said so and she would know yeah you look fine ford said dryly and i pulled my coat closed and tugged my shoulder bag up he was smiling at my lost temper and it made me even madder stop laughing at me i said and he smiled wider taking off his amulet and tucking it away as if we were finished and im not done with those i added as he gathered the pictures yes you are he said and i frowned at his unusual confidence youre angry thats better than confused or grieving i hate using clichés but we can move forward now psychobabble bull i scoffed grabbing the evidence bags before he could take them too but he was right i did feel better i had remembered something maybe human science was as strong as witch magic maybe ford took the bags from me talk to me he said standing in front of me like a rock my good mood vanished replaced by the urge to flee grabbing the shirt box from the dresser i pushed past him i had to get out i had to put some distance between me and the scratch marks on the walls i couldnt wear the teddy kisten had given me but i couldnt leave it here either ford could gripe all he wanted about removing evidence from the crime scene evidence of what that kisten had loved me rachel ford said as he followed his steps silent on the carpet in the hall what do you recall all i get is emotion i cant go back and tell edden you remembered nothing sure you can i said my pace fast and my blinders on as we crossed the living room no i cant he said catching up with me at the broken door frame im a lousy liar i shivered as i crossed the threshold but the cold brightness of late afternoon beckoned and i lurched for the door lying is easy i said bitterly just make something up and pretend its real i do it all the time rachel ford reached out and drew me to a surprised stop in the cockpit he was wearing winter gloves and had only touched my coat but it proved how upset he was the sun glinted on his black hair and his eyes were squinting from the glare the cold wind shifted his bangs and i searched his expression wanting to find a reason to tell him what i remembered to let go of the themversusus attitude between human and inderlander and just let him help me behind him cincinnati spread in all her mixedup comfortable messiness the roads too tight and the hills too steep and i could sense the security that so many lives entangled together engendered my eyes fell to my feet and the crushed remains of a leaf the wind had dropped here fords shoulders eased as he felt my resolve weaken i remembered bits and pieces i said and his feet shifted against the polished wood kistens killer took my hair out of my braid before i kicked the door off the frame im the one who made the scratches by the closet but i only remember making them not who i was trying toget away from my hand fisted and i shoved it in a pocket leaving the shirt box tucked under an arm the splat ball is mine i remember shooting it i said throat tight as i flicked my eyes to his and saw his sympathy i was aiming at the other vampire not kisten he hasbig hands a new pulse of fear zinged through me and i nearly lost it when i remembered the soft feel of thick fingers on my jawline i want you to come in tomorrow ford said his brow pinched in worry now that you have something to work with i think hypnosis might bring it all together bring it all together does he have any idea what in hell he is asking the blood drained from my face and i pulled out of his reach no if ford put me under i had no idea what might come out fleeing i dipped under the railing and swung my weight out and onto the ladder marshal waited in his bigass suv below and i wanted to be in it with the heater going to try to drive away the chill fords words had started i hesitated wondering if i should drop the shirt box or keep it tucked under an arm rachel wait there was the rattle of the lock being replaced and leaving the box under my arm i started down watching the side of the boat as i descended i toyed with the idea of taking the ladder away to leave him stranded but he would probably put it in his report besides he did have his cell phone finally i reached the ground head down i placed my boots carefully in the slush aiming for marshals car parked behind fords in the maze of impounded boats marshal had offered to bring me out after id complained during a hockey game that my little red car would get stuck in the ruts and ice out here and since my car wasnt made for the snow id said yes guilt tugged at me for avoiding fords help i wanted to find out whod killed kisten and tried to make me their shadow but there were other things i wanted to keep to myself like why id survived a common but lethal blood disease that was also responsible for my being able to kindle demon magic or what my dad had done in his spare time or why my mother had nearly gone off her rocker to keep me from knowing my birth father wasnt the man whod raised me marshals eyes showed his concern when i got in his suv and slammed the door two months ago the man had shown up on my doorstep back in cincinnati after the mackinaw weres had burned his garage down fortunately hed saved both the house and the boat that had been his livelihoodnow sold to pay for getting his masters at cincys university wed met last spring when i was up north rescuing jenkss eldest son and nick my old boyfriend despite my better judgment wed been out more than a few times realizing we had enough in common to probably make a good go of itif it werent for my habit of getting everyone close to me killed not to mention that he was coming off a psycho girlfriend and wasnt looking for anything serious the problem was we both liked to relax doing athletic stuff ranging from running at the zoo to iceskating at fountain square wed kept it friendly but platonic for two months now shocking the hell out of my roommates the lack of stress from not wondering willwe wontwe was a blessing curbing my natural tendencies and instead keeping our relationship casual had been easy i couldnt bear it if he got hurt kisten had cured me of foolish dreams dreams could kill people at least mine could and did you okay marshal asked his low voice with his upnorth accent heavy with worry peachy i muttered as i tossed the box with the teddy onto the backseat and wiped a cold finger against the underside of my eye when i didnt say anything more he sighed rolling his window down to talk to ford the fib officer was making his way to us i had half a mind to accuse ford of asking marshal to drive me here and back knowing id probably need a shoulder to cry on and though he wasnt my boyfriend marshal was a hundred percent better than taking my raw turmoil back to ivy ford looked up as he angled to my door not marshals and the tall man behind the wheel silently pressed a button to roll my window down i tried to roll it back up but he locked the controls and i gave him a dirty look rachel ford said as soon as he closed the distance between us you wont be out of control for even an instant thats how it works damn it he had guessed why i was afraid and embarrassed that he was bringing this up in front of marshal i frowned we dont have to do it at my office if youre uncomfortable he added squinting from the bright december sun no one needs to know i didnt care if the fib knew i was seeing their psychiatrist hell if anyone needed counseling it was me but stillim not crazy i muttered as i angled the blowing vents to me and my hair flew up from under my hat ford put a hand on the open window in a show of support youre probably the sanest person i know you only look crazy because youve got a lot of weird stuff to deal with if you want while youre relaxed i can give you a way to keep your mouth shut about anything you want under just about any circumstance completely confidential between you and your subconscious surprised i stared at him and he finished i dont even have to know what youre keeping to yourself im not afraid of you i said but my knees felt funny what has he figured out about me that he isnt saying shifting his feet in the slush ford shrugged yes you are i think its cute he glanced at marshal and smiled big bad runner who can take down black witches and vampires afraid of little helpless me i am not afraid of you and youre not helpless i exclaimed as marshal chuckled then youll do it ford said confidently and i made a noise of frustration yeah whatever i muttered then fiddled with the vent again i wanted to get out of here before he really figured out what was going on in my headand then told me i have to tell edden about the sticky silk ford said but ill wait until tomorrow my eyes flicked to the ladder still propped against the boats side thanks i said and he nodded responding to the heavy emotion of gratitude i knew i must be throwing off my roommate would have time to come out with the jr detective kit she probably had stashed in her labelstrewn closet and take whatever prints she wanted not to mention sniffing the carpet ford smiled at a private thought since you wont come in how about me coming over tonight aboutsix somewhere after my dinner and before your lunch i stared at him for his brazenness im busy how about next month he ducked his head as if embarrassed but he was still smiling when he met my gaze i want to talk to you before i talk to edden tomorrow three oclock im picking my brother up at the airport at three i said quickly ill be with him and my mother the rest of the day sorry ill see you at six he said firmly by then youll be home trying to get away from your brother and your mom ready for some relaxation i can teach you a trick for that too god i hate it when you do that i said messing with my seat belt so he would take the hint and go away i was more embarrassed than angry that hed caught me trying to evade him hey i leaned out the window as he turned to go dont tell anyone i had my face on the floor okay from beside me marshal made a wondering sound and i turned to him you either no problem he said thunking the suv into gear and moving forward a few feet my window went up and i loosened my scarf as the vehicle warmed ford slowly managed the slushy ruts back to his car pulling his phone from his pocket as he went remembering my own phone on vibrate i dug my cell out of my bag scrolling through the menu to put it on ring i wondered how i was going to tell ivy what i remembered without both of us flaking out with a small noise of concern marshal put his suv back into park and my head came up ford was standing beside his open door with his phone stuck to his ear a bad feeling began to trickle through me when he started back to us it grew worse when marshal put his window down and ford stopped beside it the psychiatrists eyes carried a heavy worry that was edden ford said as he closed his phone and returned it to his belt case glenns been hurt glenn i leaned over the center console toward him getting a good whiff of the scent of redwood coming off marshal the fib detective was eddens son and one of my favorite people and now he was hurt because of me is he okay marshal stiffened and i leaned back ford was shaking his head and looking at the nearby river he was off duty investigating something he probably shouldnt have they found him unconscious im going to the hospital to see how much damage hes suffered to his head his head ford meant his brain someone had beat him up im coming too i said reaching for my seat belt i can drive you out marshal offered but i was winding my scarf back up and grabbing my bag no but thanks marshal i said my pulse fast as i gave his shoulder a quick touch fords going out there ill ah call you later okay marshals brown eyes were worried and his black hair tight to his skull hardly shifted as he nodded it had been growing in for only a few months but at least he had eyebrows now okay he echoed not giving me any grief for ditching him take care of yourself i exhaled glancing once at ford waiting impatiently for me then back to marshal thanks i said softly and gave him an impulsive kiss on the cheek youre a great guy i got out and pace fast followed ford to his car my thoughts and stomach churning at what we might find at the hospital someone had hurt glenn sure he was a fib officer and ran the risk of injury all the time but i had a feeling this involved me it had to i was an albatross just ask kisten two well take the next elevator the tidy woman said with an overly bright smile as she pulled her confused friend back into the hall and the silver doors slid shut before ford and me wondering i glanced at the huge lift the thing was big enough for a gurney ford and i were the only two people in here but then the womans harsh whisper of black witch came in just before the doors met telling me all i needed to know the turn take it i muttered tugging my bag back up on my shoulder beside me ford edged away not enjoying my angry emotions as i fumed i wasnt a black witch okay so my aura was covered with demon smut and yeah id been filmed last year being dragged down the street on my ass by a demon it probably didnt help that the entire universe knew id summoned one into an is courtroom to testify against piscary cincinnatis top vampire and my roommates former master but i was a white witch wasnt i depressed i stared at the dull silver panels of the hospital elevator ford was a dark blur beside me his head bowed as i stewed i wasnt a demon to be pulled back to the everafter when the sun rose but my children would bethanks to the illegal genetic tinkering of the nowdead senior kalamack he had unknowingly broken the checks and balances that elves magicked into the demons genome thousands of years ago effectively allowing only magically stunted demon children to survive the elves named the new species witches telling us lies and convincing us to fight demons in their war when we found out the truth we abandoned the elves and demons both migrating out of the everafter and doing our best to forget our origins which we did admirably to the point where i was the only witch to know the truth ceri had filled in the gaps of mr hastons sixthgrade history class having been a demons familiar before i rescued her shed read up on it between twisting curses and planning orgies no one knew the truth but me and my partners and al the demon i had a standing teaching date with every saturday and newt the everafters most powerful demon there was als parole officer dali mustnt forget trent and whoever hed told but that was likely going to be no one seeing that his dads breaking of the genetic roadblock had been a stupid thing to do no wonder theyd killed all the geneticists at the turn too bad theyd missed trents dad ford jiggled on his feet then looking embarrassed he pulled a black metal flask from a coat pocket twisted off the top tilted his head to the ceiling and took a swig watching his adams apple move i gave him a questioning look its medicinal he said a charming shade of red as he fumbled recapping it well we are in a hospital i said dryly then snatched it ford protested as i took a sniff then touched it to my lips my eyes widened vodka looking even more embarrassed the slight man took it from my unresisting fingers capped it and tucked it away the elevator chimed and the panels slid apart before us was a hallway like any other in the building with its lowmat carpet white walls and banister my worry for glenn came rushing back and i lurched forward ford and i bumped as we got out and i felt a wash of chagrin i knew he didnt like to touch anyone can i steady myself on your elbow he asked and i glanced at the pocket he had dropped the flask into lightweight i said reaching out for him careful to touch him only through his coat im not drunk he said sourly linking his arm in mine in a motion that held absolutely no romance but rather desperation the emotions are sharp in here the alcohol helps im in overload and id rather feel your emotions than everyone elses oh feeling honored i strode forward with him and past the two orderlies pushing a hamper my good mood soured when one of them whispered should we call security fords grip tightened when i spun to give them my opinion and the two skittered away like i was the boogeyman theyre just afraid ford said his fingers tightening on me we continued down the hall and i wondered if they could kick me out the beginnings of a headache pulsed im a white witch damn it i said to no one and the guy in a lab coat coming toward us gave us a cursory glance ford was looking pale and i tried to calm myself before they admitted him i should step up my efforts to find a muffler for himother than alcohol that is thanks he whispered as he picked up on my concern then voice stronger he added rachel you summon demons youre good at it get over it then find a way to make it work for you its not going to go away i huffed ready to tell him he had no right to sound so high and mighty but turning a liability into an asset was exactly what he had done with his gift i gave his arm a squeeze then started when i saw ivy my roommate bending over the nurses desk not caring that a male orderly had just walked into a wall watching her her black jeans were low and tight but she had the body of a model and could get away with it the matching cotton pullover was cut high to give a glimpse of her lower back as she craned to see what was on the computer in deference to the cold her long leather coat was draped over the counter ivy was a living vampire and she looked it svelte dark and broody it made it hard to live with her but i was no picnic either and we knew each others quirks ivy i called and her head turned her short enviably straight hair with the gold tips swinging as she came up how did you find out about glenn fords shoulders slumped all his tension slipping from him as he held my arm he looked happy but he would seeing that he was picking up my emotions and i was happy to see ivy perhaps i might invest in a little talk time about ivy when ford and i got together again i could use his insight into our uneasy relationship i wasnt ivys blood shadow but her friend that a vampire could be friends with anyone without sharing blood was unusual but we had an additional complication ivy liked both boys and girls mixing blood and sex into one and the same shed been clear that she wanted me too in any capacity but i was straight apart from a confusing year of trying to separate blood lust from gender preference that shed bitten me more than once hadnt helped it had seemed like a good idea at the time the rush from a vampire bite was too close to sexual ecstasy to dismiss and it had taken me thinking id been bound to kistens killer to wake me up the risk of becoming a shadow was too great i trusted ivy it was her blood lust i was worried about so we lived together in the church that was also our runner business sleeping across the hall from each other and doing our best to not push each others buttons one might think ivy would be ticked off after wasting a year chasing me but she had a blissful happiness that vampires didnt often find apparently my telling her i wasnt ever going to let her sink her teeth into me again was the only way shed believe i liked her for her and not the way she could make me feel i just admired the hell out of anyone who could be that hard on herself and still be so incredibly strong and i loved her i didnt want to sleep with her but i did love her ivy came to meet us her small lips closed and her slim boots silent on the carpet she moved with a memorable grace and there was a slight grimace on her usually placid face her features held a slight asian cast having an oval face a small nose and a heartshaped mouth it was seldom she smiled afraid the emotion would break her selfcontrol i think that was one of the reasons we were friendsi laughed enough for both of us that and the fact that she thought i could find a way to save her soul when she died and became an undead right now i was just looking to find the rent money id get to my roommates soul later edden called the church first she said by way of greeting her thin eyebrows high as she spotted fords arm linked in mine hi ford the man reddened at the lilt shed put in her last words but i wouldnt let him take his arm back i liked being needed hes having trouble with the background emotion i said and hed rather be abused by yours nice do you know what room glenn is in i said as fords arm slipped away she nodded her dark eyes not missing a thing this way hes still not conscious ivy headed down the hallway with us in tow but when we passed the desk one of the nurses stood determination on her nononsense face im sorry no visitors except family a pang of fear went through me not because i might not see glenn but that his condition was so serious they wouldnt let anyone in ivy didnt slow down though and neither did i the nurse started after us my pulse quickened but another waved us on then turned to the first nurse its ivy the second nurse said as if that meant something you mean the vampire whos the first nurse said but she was pulled back to the desk before i heard the rest i turned to ivy seeing that her pale complexion had shifted to pink the vampire whos what i asked remembering her stint here as a candy striper ivys jaw tightened glenns room is down here she said avoiding my question whatever an unexpected sense of panic hit me when ivy made a sharp left into a room and vanished behind the oversize door i stared at it hearing the soft sounds of delicate machinery memories of sitting with my dad as he took his last struggling breaths swam up then more recent of watching quen fight for his life i froze unable to move behind me ford stumbled as if i had slapped him crap i flushed embarrassed that he was feeling my misery im sorry i gushed as he stood in the hallway and held up a hand to tell me he was all right i thanked god ivy had already gone in and wasnt seeing what id done to him its okay his eyes were weary as he came close again hesitant until he knew i had the old pain safely tucked away can i ask who i swallowed hard my dad eyes down he guided me to the door you were about twelve thirteen and then we were inside and i could see that it wasnt the same room at all slowly my shoulders eased my dad had died with nothing to save him as a law enforcer glenn was getting the best of everything his father was in the rocker pulled up to his bedside ramrod straight glenn was being taken care of edden was the one in pain the small stocky man tried to smile but he couldnt do it in the few hours since learning about his sons attack his pale face had acquired wrinkles id only seen hints of before in his grip was a winter hat his short fingers working the rim around and around he stood and my heart went out to him when he exhaled the sound carrying all his fear and worry edden was the captain of the fibs cincinnati division the exmilitary man bringing to the office the hard succeedagainstallodds determination hed gained in the service seeing him down to the bare bones of himself was hard the lingering questions in the fib as to my convenient amnesia concerning kistens death had never occurred to edden he trusted me and because of that he was one of the few humans i absolutely trusted in return his son unconscious on the bed was another thank you for coming he said automatically his gravelly voice cracking and i worked to keep from crying when he ran a blunt hand over his shortcropped graying hair in a recognizable sign of stress i came close to give him a hug and the familiar scent of old coffee hit me you know we wouldnt let you do this alone ivy said from her corner where shed folded herself stiffly into a padded chair quietly giving support the only way she could how is he i asked as i turned to glenn they wont give me a straight answer he said his voice higher than usual hes been beaten up pretty bad head trauma his voice broke and he went silent i looked at glenn on the bed his very dark skin standing out starkly against the sheets there was a white bandage around his head and they had shaved a swath of his tightly curling black hair bruises marked his face and he had a split lip a nasty swath of bruised skin ran from his shoulder to under the sheets and his fingers resting on the blanket were swollen edden sank into his chair and looked at his sons damaged hand they wouldnt let me in he said softly they didnt believe i was his father bigoted bastards slowly his hand went out and he cradled glenns hand as if it were a baby bird i swallowed hard at the love edden had adopted glenn when he married his mothermust have been at least twenty years agoand though they looked nothing like each other they were exactly alike where it counted both strong in their convictions and consistently putting their lives in danger to fight injustice im sorry i almost croaked feeling his pain in the threshold ford closed his eyes clenched his jaw and leaned against the frame grabbing a chair i dragged it across the linoleum to where i could see edden and glenn both my bag went on the floor and my hand on the fib captains shoulder who did this edden took a slow breath in her corner ivy sat up he was working on something on his own the man said after hours in case what surfaced would be better left off the record one of our officers died last week after a long wasting illness he was a friend of glenns and glenn found out hed been cheating on his wife edden glanced up keep that to yourselves ivy got to her feet interested she poisoned her husband the fib captain shrugged thats what glenn thought according to his notes he went to talk to the mistress this morning thats where his voice cut off and we patiently waited while he steadied himself the working theory is he said softly that the husband was there and freaked out attacked glenn and then they both left him for dead in their living room oh my god i whispered going cold he was off duty edden continued so he lay there almost an hour before someone checked on him because he didnt come in to work hes a smart kid and one of his friends knew what he was doing and where he had gone my breath caught when edden turned to me pain etched deep in his brown eyes as he tried to find an answer we never would have found him otherwise not in time they left him there they could have called and fled but they left my boy to die the warm prick of tears hit me and i gave the stocky heartbroken man a sideways hug hes going to be okay i whispered i know it my gaze went to ford as he came in to stand at the foot of the bed right ford gripped the footboard as if struggling for balance can i have a moment with glenn alone he asked i cant work with all of you in here immediately i stood sure ivy touched the lump that was glenns feet as she passed and she was gone edden slowly stood letting go of his sons hand with an obvious reticence leaning over glenn he whispered in a severe tone ill be right back dont go anywhere young man you hear me i drew edden out of the room come on ill get you some coffee theres gotta be a machine around here somewhere i looked back as we left glenn looked like crap but as long as his mind was undamaged hed be okay ford could tell couldnt he as i escorted edden down the hallway in ivys wake i felt a moment of guilty relief at least glenn hadnt been hurt because of someone trying to get to me it might sound like vanity on my part but it had happened before ivys old master vampire had raped her to get her to kill me had given kisten to his death for the same reason piscary was dead now kisten too i was alive and i wasnt going to let others get hurt for me again edden pulled out of my grip when we reached a bench across from a vending machine everything was done in institutional comfort soothing shades of taupe and cushions not soft enough to encourage lingering a wide window opened onto the snowplowed parking lot and i sat so my feet were in the shaft of dusky sunlight coming in there was no warmth edden sat beside me with his elbows on his knees his forehead cupped in his hands i didnt like seeing the intelligent quickfingered man so depressed i didnt think he even remembered i was here hes going to be okay i said and edden took a deep breath i know he will he said with a forcefulness that said he wasnt sure whoever did this was a professional glenn stumbled into something bigger than a wife cheating on her husband ah hell maybe it is my fault ivys shadow fell on us and i looked up her silhouette was sharp against the bright window and i leaned back into shadow ill find out who did this she said then turned to me we both will and dont insult us by offering to pay for it my lips parted in surprise she had tried to hide herself in shadow but her words gave away her anger i thought you didnt like glenn i said stupidly then went hot her hand moved to her hip this isnt a matter of like or dislike someone mauled a law officer and left him for dead the is wont do anything about it and anarchy cant be allowed a toehold she turned and the sun came in i dont think a human did that to him she said as she moved to sit across from us whoever it was knew exactly how to cause an excruciating amount of pain without letting him pass out from it ive seen it before i could almost hear her think vampire eddens hands clenched then he visibly forced himself to relax i agree unable to sit still i squirmed hes going to be okay i said damn it i didnt know what else to say ivys entire vampiric culture was based on monsters who worked outside the law people who treated people like boxes of chocolates the biggest and baddest the ones who made the rules got away with anything ivy leaned across the wide space between us give me the address where he was found she demanded i want to look edden pressed his lips together making his mustache bunch out it was the first sign of him regaining himself ivy i appreciate your offer he said his voice firm but we can handle it i have people out there right now her eye twitched and though it was hard to tell i think her pupils were dilating in pique give me the address she repeated if an inderlander did this youre going to need rachel and me the is wont help you not to mention that the fib will probably miss the inderland stuff i thought settling myself with a soft huff more firmly in the thin padding edden eyed her clearly peeved himself my department is working on it glenn will be conscious in a few days and then his eyes closed and he became silent ivy stood agitated almost brutal she said if you dont put the heat on whoever did this in the next few hours they will be gone edden met her eyes and she added more gently let us help youre too involved the entire fib is you need someone out there who can look at what happened with dispassion not a desire for revenge i made a small noise and crossed my arms over my middle revenge was on my mind come on edden this is what we do for a living i said why wont you let us help a dry humor was in the short mans eyes as he looked askance at me its what ivy does for a living youre not a detective rachel youre a haulthemingirl and none better ill let you know when we find out who it is and if its a witch ill give you a call that hit me with all the pleasure of a slap in the face and my eyes narrowed ivy saw my irritation and she leaned back content to let me yell at him but instead of standing up and telling him to get turnedwhich wouldnt do anything but get us thrown outi swallowed my pride contenting myself with bobbing my foot in anger then give ivy the address i said wanting to accidentally kick him in the shins she can find a fairy fart in a windstorm i said borrowing one of jenkss favorite expressions and what if it is an inderlander you want to risk losing them because of your human pride maybe that was low but i was tired of looking at crime scenes after the cleaning crew edden looked from ivys mocking expectancy to my admirably contained redhead anger then pulled out a palmsize spiral notebook i smiled at the scratch of the pencil as he wrote something down a pleasant slurry of contentment and anticipation filling me wed find whoever attacked glenn and left him to die and whoever it was better hope i was there with ivy or theyd be subjected to her own personal version of justice the sound of the paper tearing free was loud and with a wry grimace he extended the strip of white and blue to ivy she didnt look at it handing it to me instead thank you i said crisply tucking it away a soft scrape of shoe on carpet brought my attention up and i followed ivys gaze over my shoulder ford was shuffling to us his head bowed and my bag in his grip i felt a moment of panic and in response he looked up smiling my eyes closed glenn was okay thank you god edden whispered standing up i had to hear it though and as ford handed me my forgotten bag and took the cup of coffee ivy gave him i asked hes going to be okay ford nodded eyeing us over the rim of the paper cup his mind is fine he said grimacing at the coffees taste theres no damage hes deep into his psyche but as soon as his body repairs itself enough he will regain consciousness a day or two eddens breath shook as he exhaled and ford stiffened when the fib captain shook his hand thank you thank you ford if theres anything i can do for you let me know ford smiled thinly im glad i could give you good news regaining his hand he backed up a step excuse me i need to try to convince the nurses to back off on the meds hes not in as much pain as they think and its slowing down his recovery ill do it ivy eased into motion ill tell them i can smell it they wont know the difference the beginnings of a smile curved my lips up as she almost sauntered down the hall calling out to one nurse by name edden couldnt stop smiling and i could see a hint of tears in his eyes as he shifted from foot to foot i need to make a couple of calls he reached for his cell phone then hesitated ford can glenn hear me when i talk to him ford nodded smiling tiredly he might not remember it but he can edden looked from me to ford clearly wanting to be with glenn go i said giving him a happy little push tell glenn i want to talk to him when he wakes up his steps fast edden strode toward glenns room i sighed glad this story would have a happy ending i was tired of the other kind ford looked pleased and that was good too his life must be hell no wonder he didnt tell anyone he could do this theyd work him to death what happened to glenns mom i asked now that we were alone ford watched edden wave to the nurses as he passed beyond the wide smooth door and into glenns room she died fifteen years ago during a sixtydollar stabandgrab thats why hes a cop i thought theyve had only each other for a long time i added and ford nodded starting for the elevators he looked whipped ivy joined us after a last comment to the nurse falling into place on my other side she looked across me to ford what happened at the marina she asked as she shrugged into her long coat and the afternoons memories rushed back her tone was slightly mocking and i gave her a sidelong glance i knew she was secure in her belief that her slow steady investigations would find kistens killer faster than my reconstructing my memories it was with no little pleasure that i glanced at ford then said to her do you have time to go out tonight and smell the carpet ford chuckled and ivy stared rocking to a halt at the elevators excuse me i punched the button for the lift your nose is better than mine i said simply ivy blinked her face blanker than usual you found something the fib missed i nodded as ford pretended not to listen theres sticky silk stuck to the rim of the dressers top there might be a print ah other than the one i made today and the floor under the window smells like vampire its not you or kisten so it might be his murderer again ivy stared looking uncomfortable you can tell the difference the elevator doors slid open and we all entered cant you i said backing up and pushing the button for the street level with a booted toe just because i could im a vampire she said as if this made all the difference ive lived with you for over a year i said wondering if i wasnt supposed to be able to tell the difference i know what you smell like i muttered embarrassed its no big deal yes it is she whispered as the doors closed and i hoped ford hadnt heard i watched the numbers count down so youll go out tonight ivys eyes were black yes i stifled a shiver glad when the doors opened to show the busy lobby thank you my pleasure she said her graysilk voice so thick with anticipation that i almost pitied the vampire who had killed kisten almost three i gripped the wheel of my car tighter in annoyance as jenks continued to sing though the sun was going down and the roads had an arid frozenness the interior of the car was hot i had half a mind to turn off the heat anything to get jenks to shut up five trolls in draaaaag the fourinch man sang from my shoulder four purple condoms three french ticklers two horny vamps and a succubus in the snow jenks enough i shouted and from the passenger seat ivy snickered idly tracing a hand on the inside of the misted window to clear a spot from which to gaze out at the evening the street was thick with holiday lights and it was holy and serene in a moneyoriented middleclass sort of way unlike jenkss carol which was thirteenyearold humor to the max on the eighth day of christmas my true love gave to me i checked behind me and thunked the brakes ivy with her vamp reflexes easily caught herself but jenks was catapulted from my shoulder he shortstopped himself inches from the windshield his dragonflylike wings were a blur of red and silver but not a shadow of dust slipped from him saying hed half expected this the smirk on his angular face was classic jenks what he complained hands on his hips in his best peter pan pose shut up i rolled through the stop sign it was icy safer that way at least that was going to be my story if a zealous is cop stopped me jenks laughed his highpitched voice sounding right with the easy companionship that filled the car and the festive warmth displayed outside it thats the trouble with you witches no christmas spirit he said going to sit on the rearview mirror it was his favorite spot and i turned the heater down a smidge he wouldnt be there if he was cold christmas is over i muttered squinting to see the street sign in the dusk i was sure we were close ive got plenty of holiday spirit its just not christian in origin and though im no expert i dont think the church would be happy with you singing about succubi maybe youre right he said as he shifted the layers of green cloth matalina had draped over himher attempt at pixy winter wear theyd rather hear about rutting incubi the pixy yelped and i jumped when he darted off the mirror ivys hand just inches from smacking him shut up pixy the softspoken vamp said her graysilk voice severe her working leathers made her look like a biker chick gone sophisticate slim and sleek and her eyes were pupil black under her harleylogo cap jenks took the hint and muttering something it was probably just as well i didnt hear he settled on my big hoop earring to snuggle in between my neck and the soft red scarf i had worn for just this reason i shivered when his wings brushed my neck a whisper of chill that felt like water a sustained temperature below fortyfive would send him into hibernation but he could handle short protected trips from the car to wherever and after hed found out about glenn there was no stopping him from coming out with us if we hadnt invited him to the crime scene id find his halffrozen body in my shoulder bag as a stowaway frankly i think he was out here trying to get away from his brood of kids spending the winter in my desk jenks though was worth five fib investigators and that was on a bad day pixies excelled in sneaking around making them experts at finding the smallest thing out of place their curiosity keeping them interested after everyone else had come and gone their dust didnt leave a lasting impression and their fingerprints were invisible unless you used a microscope in my opinion making them excellent firstins at a crime scene course no one at the is had cared what i thought and it wasnt often that a pixy would work in anything other than a temporary backup position anyway that was how id met jenks and it had been my good fortune i wouldve taken him with me to the boat earlier today but he would have had severe problems with the temperature ivy sat up inadvertently telling me we were close and i started paying attention to house numbers it looked like a human neighborhood on the outskirts of cincinnati in what was probably a lowerto lowermiddleclass neighborhood it wasnt a highcrime district from the number of lights and the general tidiness of the homes but it held a slightly rundown soft comfortableness id be willing to bet the area was mostly retirees or new families just starting out it reminded me of the neighborhood id grown up in and i could hardly wait until tomorrow when id be picking up my brother robbie at the airport he had worked through the solstice but had somehow managed to get new years off that the lights around me now were the green and red of christmas didnt mean it was a human neighborhood most vampires celebrated christmas and lots of humans celebrated the solstice ivy still had her tree up in the living room and we exchanged presents when we felt like it not on a specific date usually that was about an hour after i got back from shopping delayed gratification was ivys thing not mine thats got to be it ivy said softly and jenks shivered his wings for warmth tickling me down the street on the left was a cluster of fib cruisers parked with their lights off and looking gray in the dim light at the corner in a drop of light two people stood gossiping their dogs tugging at their leashes to go in there werent any news vans yet but there would be i could almost smell them not an is cruiser in sight which was a relief since theyd probably send denon out here i hadnt seen the living lowblood vampire since blowing apart his coverup of the were murderers last summer and id be willing to bet that he had suffered another demotion looks like the is isnt coming i said softly and ivy shrugged why would they they dont care if an fib officer gets beat up i pulled to the curb and parked the car they might if it was an inderlander who did it jenks laughed doubt it he said and i felt a tug on my hat as he ducked under the soft yarn for the trip inside unfortunately he was right whereas the is policed the supernatural species they would and did ignore a crime if it suited them hence the humanrun fib that had come into being i had once thought that the fib was way outclassed by the is but after working with them for a year i was impressed and shocked by the information they could dig up and put together it had been only forty years ago during the turn that the combined inderland species of vamp witch were and more had actively lent a hand to prevent humans from becoming the latest endangered species when a badly engineered genetically altered tomato mutated and wiped out a large chunk of the human population though to be honest if humans had died out most of inderland would suffer when vamps started preying on us instead of soft naive happy humans not to mention that mr joe vampire and ms sue were liked their highmaintenance lifestyles impossible without the backing of a large population what are you doing ivy said her hand on the door as i fumbled around under the seat ive got an fib sign in here somewhere i muttered fingers jerking back as they unexpectedly found something cold and squishy a closedlipped smile came over ivy the entire fib knows your car making a soft sound of agreement i gave up and tugged on my gloves yeah they did seeing that theyd given it to me in payment for helping them out once something most of them seemed to be forgetting lately ready jenks i called and got a halfheard stream of curses back something about my cream rinse and puking fairies ivy and i got out together the excitement of a run hit me when the doors thumped shut standing by my car i pulled the sharp dry air all the way to the bottom of my lungs the clouds had that solid feel that they only get right before a heavy snow and i could smell the pavement white with salt and so dry and cold it would burn your fingers if you touched it heels snapping ivy came around the car and i followed her to the small house the crunchy five inches of snow had been packed down but a sadlooking threefoot snowman presided over a corner of the yard his face melted and his hat covering his eyes the curtains were open and the yellow rectangles of light on the snow were starting to become obvious red and green lights from a neighbors display made an odd counterpoint and i could hear the conversation from the duo on the corner cold i tugged my bag up higher as we walked more neighbors were coming out i felt a surge of disgust when the slowcreeping lights of a van with an antenna showed under the streetlight crap they were here already id wanted to talk to the neighbors before the interviewers had them thinking sensationalism instead of realism i was sure edden had interviewed the closest but his people wouldnt ask the questions i wanted answers to there ivy murmured and i followed her gaze to the dark shadow coming out from the garages side door to meet us hey hi i called out pitching my voice high to give the impression we were harmless yeah right edden asked us to come out were from vampiric charms asked us it was more like forced into it but why bring that up the young fib officer flicked on the outside lights washing the crusty drive in an artificial glare can i see some id he asked then did a double take oh he said tucking his clipboard back under an arm youre the witch and the vamp from my hat came a disgusted and a really cold pixy can you hurry it up rache i think my nads fell off i stifled a grimace pasting on a fake smile id rather be known by our company name than the witch and the vamp but at least edden had told them we were coming maybe he wasnt going to be such a pain in the butt about us helping i watched the officers body language but couldnt tell if his impatience was from the fibs new distrust or simply the cold yes vampiric charms were here to help with the possible inderland connection i said before ivy could get all vampy her pulling an aura and scaring the crap out of him wouldnt helpas entertaining as it might be can we go in ivy asked with a faint promise of threat and jenks snickered sure the officers head was down as he wrote something put on a pair of booties okay ivy was halfway to the door off the garage her motions stiff at his assumption that she didnt know her way around a crime scene i glanced back at the street hesitating the news crew had set up and the huge light they had was gathering people like a bonfire hey uh ivy i murmured and she hesitated a long gloved hand resting on the open door she smiled with half her mouth you want to go talk to them i nodded and she added youll be okay jenks oh crap i swore under my breath id forgotten about him im fine he barked and i felt a soft tug as he settled himself nothings going to change inside but i want to hear what the neighbors say gossip ivy thats where the truth is its all about the gossip i didnt know about gossip but if he said hed be okay id rather get first impressions than stale regurgitated comments after everyone had had a chance to think ivy frowned clearly of the opinion that crimes were solved by carefully gathered evidence not nebulous feelings and hunches but with a shrug she went inside and i headed out into the night pace fast i found a spot at the back of the growing crowd trying to stay out of the cameras line of sight jenks was probably hearing twice what i could and i went on tiptoe to glimpse the man with red cheeks in the felt coat the newscaster was interviewing i didnt think it was live seeing that it wasnt six yet and i eased closer jostling for position they were the nicest people the man was saying his eyes bright with excitement nice people i never would have expected anything like this from them they kept to themselves and were real quiet my eyebrows rose and jenks snorted sounded like inderlanders to me but then the kid next to me made a rude sound and jenks tugged my hair when the boy said snidely to his friend like he knew him the guy is a creep and the woman is whacked got it jenks i whispered so he would stop yanking on my hair slow and steady investigation was nice but i wanted to find them before the sun went nova smiling i turned to find a young man in a black knit hat with the howlers emblem and encouraged by the show of inderland acceptance i felt an unusual surge of kinship he wasnt wearing a coat and his hands were jammed into his jeans pockets whacked i said giving his friend a quick smile to include him in the conversation you think i know he shot back then fidgeted i was guessing he was in high school and i turned the mrs robinson charm on full yeah i said almost bumping into him as the crowd grew noisy when the newscaster looked for fresh meat dont you love how they always say one thing in front of the camera but at the bar the truth comes out he grinned clearly thinking i thought he was older than he was from under my hat came jenkss impressed nice reel him in rache so you know them i said linking my arm in his and easing him from the news crew i kept us close so as not to leave the highly charged atmosphere the news van was creating angling so that if a camera should point our way all theyd get would be my back his friend had stayed behind and was currently jumping to try to get in the background of the shot he didnt have a coat either and i thought it unfair that they were warm and i was freezing my butt off out here witches had a lower cold tolerance than just about everyone else excluding pixies youre not a reporter he said and i smiled glad he was smarter than id thought im from vampiric charms i said digging in my bag until i found a bent card and handed it to him im rachel rachel morgan righteous he said his face becoming animated my name is matt i live over there hey ive heard of you he said tapping the card against his hand is that really you in that shot being dragged down the street on my ass i finished for him adjusting my hat to send a whiff of cold air under it to get jenks to stop laughing yeah thats me but i dont really summon demons much thats cool thats cool he said seeming to grow three inches taller youre trying to find the tilsons a jolt of adrenaline made me shiver edden hadnt told me their names more than just about anything do you know where they went he shook his head trying to look older than he was as he gave his friend a superior look no but they are weird the entire family i mowed their lawn this summer the guy is a janitor at my school he says hes allergic to grass matt smirked hes allergic to work if you ask me but if you make him mad stuff happens to you my eyes widened magic were they inderlanders like ivy thought matt shook his head and looked ill no stuff like your dog dying but his wife is even weirder i dont see her much she stays inside a lot with their kid she talked with my mom once and she wouldnt let my mom touch her baby no kidding i said hoping hed say more and that baby of theirs is just as freaky as they are he said glancing at his friend got these weird blue eyes that follow you around shes quiet like shes deaf or something her mom never puts her down mrs tilson wears the pants in the family thats for hell sure is that so i prompted and matt bobbed his head last year someone put a firecracker in the can in the back toilet blew shit all over the place tilson was screaming about killing someone so they sent him home i mowed their lawn the next day i was scared man but my dad made me tilson is nuts he thought i knew who blew up the john and he pinned me against the fence god i thought i was going to die but then she came out and he went all soft and stuff he even apologized freakiest shit ive ever seen shes smaller than you and all she did was say his name and he went all meek and shit i blinked my mind racing as i tried to figure it out mr tilson was a homicidal maniac with a chip on his shoulder mrs tilson was in charge and the kid was weird living vampires maybe how old is the baby i asked trying to keep him talking this was pure gold matt made a face i dont know a year my mom says shes going to be a spoiled brat and mrs tilson shouldnt wait five years before having another one like she says she wants some kind of medical reason she wants five or six kids my mom says five or six i said truly surprised maybe the tilsons were weres and the woman was from a highly dominant pack but why space them out over five years thats a lot yeah the kid said scoffing im not having any kids but if i do im going to have them all right away get it over with i dont want to be sixty and changing diapers i shrugged there was eight years between me and robbie and i didnt see anything wrong with it hed raised me as much as my parents and i had no complaints but my mom was a witch so changing diapers at sixty was about the norm glenns attack was sounding more and more like an inderland incident thanks i said suddenly wanting to get inside jenks was probably freezing i should get in there but thank you you really helped the boys expression became disappointed and i smiled hey i could use someone this spring to mow my graveyard i hesitated if you dont think thats too weird my number is on the card he beamed fingering it yeah that would be great he said then glanced at the house i dont think my dad will let me mow their lawn anymore call me about april i said and he nodded thanks matt you were a big help no problem he said and i gave him a final smile and walked away when i looked over my shoulder he had his head bent to his friends and they were ogling my phone number you okay jenks i said hoofing it away from the lights and back to the garage damn wait until ivy heard what id found out yeah he said gripping my hair harder but will you slow down unless you want pixy barf in your hair immediately i checked my pace tripping when i took the curb without looking so i wouldnt have to tilt my head jenks swore when i stumbled but my pulse jackhammered when my head swung up it wasnt the almostfall that shook me but who was standing by my car staring at it tom bansenit had to bethe same man who had tried to kill me by way of al holy crap its tom i said then shouted get away from my car as i started to jog son of a fairy whore jenks swore whats he doing here i dont know caution slowed me down as i approached better be quiet if he knows youre here all he has to do is knock my hat off and matalina is a single parent jenks became quiet tom continued to stand with his hands in his pockets looking at my car as if debating something nervousness coated my anger as i halted a careful five feet back puffing out white clouds in the streetlight and looking at the man like the snake he was id heard hed gotten fired from the isprobably for the stupidity of being caught summoning demons to murder someonebut since id been the one tom had been trying to off the is had done nothing more than that what are you doing here i said not anxious to have to defend myself but not wanting to let him poke around in my car either the young man had a new hardness in his blue eyes as he stood on the shoveled sidewalk and looked speculatively at me in the lamplight he was clearly cold in his parka and hat the chill almost killing the redwood scent that all witches had id once thought he was attractive in a tidy almostscholarly wayi still did actuallybut freeing al to kill or abduct me had long since shifted the attraction to disgust trying to make a living he answered a tinge of red showing on his cheeks ive been shunned thanks to you my jaw dropped and i backed up i wasnt surprised but i wasnt going to take the blame for it either i wasnt the one kidnapping girls to pay demons for black curses i said maybe you should rethink your logic sherlock he smiled in a notnice way turning as if to leave he said ill be around if you want to talk i sputtered in disbelief at the invitation and he added nice car before he walked away hands still jammed into his big pockets hey i shouted almost going after him but the thought of his shunning and jenks in my hat changed my mind rocking back on my boot heels i exhaled loudly shunned the coven of ethical and moral standards had shunned him damn i hadnt thought theyd go that far sure he summoned demons but that didnt get one shunned it must have been kidnapping that girl for black magic shunning was exactly what it sounded like and the man was in trouble getting the ethical and moral standards coven to reverse a decision was like surviving an is death threat he was absolutely cut off and any witch associating with him ran the risk of being shunned in turn making a living i thought as i watched him tom had probably gone independent seeing that the is wouldnt touch him now even under the table and looking like he was having a hard time of it i added as he got into a rustcut chevy and drove away i headed for the tilsons house jerking to a halt at a sudden thought fingers fumbling in my bag i pulled out my key ring and the lethalmagic detection amulet on it the thing had saved my life a couple of times and tom had a vested interest in seeing me gone rache jenks complained as i started to make a slow circuit around my vehicle you want to be blown up smaller than fairy dust i muttered and he tugged on my hair toms a weenie the pixy protested but i finished my circuit breathing easier when the amulet stayed a nice healthy green tom hadnt spelled my car but a sense of unease lingered even as i turned to the cordonedoff house and crossed the street and it wasnt because i might have some competition in the independentrunner arena my car had originally belonged to an is agent who died in a car bombing not this car obviously but a bomb had killed him just that fast my life can end tom hadnt left a charm on my car but it wouldnt hurt to ask edden if hed have one of his dogs sniff around it boot heels clacking i reached the door off the garage and went inside jenks sighed heavily but i didnt care if i did look like a paranoid chicken when i asked edden for a ride home i was done with being stupid about these kinds of things four the sudden cessation of wind as i passed into the garage was a blessed relief and i paused taking in the curious mix of space and clutter the edges stacked with old boxes from grocery stores and mailorder places close to the steps leading inside were several large toys bright with primarycolored plastic the toddler sled had been used from the looks of it but the rest was summer stuff it had been a good christmas apparently tracks of flattened snow showed where a bigassed truck had been on the otherwise swept cement there wasnt room for two vehicles and i wondered if mr tilson was overcompensating for something course maybe it was mrs tilson who had the truck fetish i sniffed deeply for the scent of inderlander finding only the dry smell of old concrete and dust and i shivered i eyed the storage boxes remembering what my dad had once told me when id tried to get out of cleaning the garage people put things in garages that they dont want but cant get rid of dangerous stuff sometimes too dangerous to keep inside and too dangerous to throw out and risk someone finding mr and mrs tilson had a very full garage come on rache jenks complained tugging on my hair im cold giving the boxes a last look i went up the cement steps the hum of a vacuum was a faint presence as i opened the cheerfully painted door and entered a seventies kitchen nodding to the officer with a clipboard seated at the table the window above the sink looked out over the front yard and the news van a high chair done in pinks and yellows was pulled up beside the square table a box of throwaway boot covers was on it and i sighed taking my gloves off and tucking them in my coat pockets plush baby toys were in a large basket tucked neatly out of the way and i could almost hear a contented gurgling laughter the sink held a bowl of cookiedoughencrusted utensils a dozen sugar cookies sat on the counter cooling for the last eight hours a tearaway tag was tied to the oven the upper part signed and dated with the time stating that officer mark butte had turned off the oven the tilsons had left in a hurry the kitchen was a curious mix of warmth and cold the heater on to combat the inandout traffic and i unzipped my coat my first impression of the house was just as jumbled everything to make a home was here but it feltempty there was the chatter of work in the next room and when i bent to put a blue bootie over my boot jenks shot out from under my hat holy crap he swore flitting over the entire kitchen in three seconds giving the seated officer a coronary it smells like green baby paste in here hey edden he said louder where you at and he darted out his wings a gray blur from deeper in the house came an exclamation as jenks probably startled another fib officer a set of heavy steps approached and i straightened id gotten my boots at veronicas crypt and covering them in blue paper should be outlawed eddens squat figure suddenly took up the archway to the rest of the house jenks was on his shoulder and the fib captain looked better now that he was doing something to help his son he nodded to the seated officer and smiled briefly at me but it didnt reach his eyes he was still in his street clothes in truth he probably shouldnt be out here but no one was going to tell him he couldnt oversee the investigation of his sons mauling rachel he said in greeting and i coyly waved a bootiecovered foot at him hi edden can i come in i asked hardly sarcastic at all he frowned but before he could start in on me about my lousy investigation techniques i remembered tom in the street hey can i ask a favor i said hesitantly you mean more than letting you in here he said so dryly that i was sorely tempted to tell him about the sticky silk at kistens boat which theyd missed but i held my tongue knowing hed find out about it tomorrow after ivy had had a chance to go out im serious i said as i undid my scarf can someone check out my car the squat mans eyebrows rose having trouble with the transmission i flushed wondering if he knew i was the one whod trashed it while learning how to drive a stick shift uh i saw tom bansen at my car maybe im being paranoid bansen he blurted out and jenks nodded from his shoulder this is the same witch you tagged in his basement for summoning demons he was looking at my car i said thinking it sounded lame he said something about making a living and seeing that there are lots of people who want to see me uh dead i let my thought trail off i kept to myself that hed been shunned and jenks didnt say a word it was a witch thing when someone got shunned it was an embarrassment to all of us i checked for lethal charms but i wouldnt know a car bomb from an odometer cable the fib captains expression grew hard no problem ill have the dog unit come out actually he looked at the seated officer and smiled alex go wait by ms morgans car for the explosives team the man stiffened and i winced apologetically dont let anyone get within ten feet edden continued it might turn you into a toad if you touch it it will not i complained thinking being a toad might be pleasant compared to what tom could probably do edden shook his head there is a news van in the street im not taking any chances jenks snickered and i warmed chances were good nothing was wrong with my car and i felt like a baby but eddens hand on my shoulder made me feel better all the way up until he turned me back to the kitchens door and alexs retreating back maybe alex should take you home right now he said so he can check out your church for your own safety oh for gods sake hes trying to get rid of me thats why weve got a gargoyle in the eaves i said sharply and slipping out from under him i resolutely paced deeper into the house take me home for my own safety my ass he was letting ivy stay why couldnt i rachel edden protested his compact bulk spinning to follow jenks laughed taking to the air and saying give it up fib man itll take more than you to get her out remember what ivy and i did to your finest last spring add rachel to that and you can say your prayers from behind me came eddens dry you think ivy wants another stint as a candy striper but i was here and he was going to let me in on the evidencegathering part of things the fib was confident that mr tilson had attacked glenn seeing that it was his house but his lawyer might try to pass it off on a burglar or something else not cool nice house i said eyes roving over the bright walls low ceilings and clean but worn carpet we passed a short hallway then stepped down into a large living room immediately i stopped oh my god i said taking it in they have shag carpet green shag carpet this might be why mr tilson was nuts it would make me nuts there were only a few fib personnel still here doing their fib thing one of them flagged edden over and he left me with a stern look that said not to touch anything the faint tickle of fingerprint dust caught in my nose ivy was in the corner with a tall woman who by the twin cameras draped over her had to be the photographer they were both looking at her laptop and the shots she had taken earlier it was bright and overly warm and jenks left edden to park it on the top of the curtains warmer up there probably the fib had been here most of the day before letting us in here not wanting to chance my messing up their precious virgin site but it still looked raw to me the greentiled coffee table between the oliveandorangestriped couch and the brick fireplacepainted to match the floor incidentallywas on its side and shoved into the raised hearth the curtains over the wide windows were open to the backyard god help me but the curtains matched the putrid color combination looking at everything i started to feel nauseous as if the seventies had taken refuge here against extinction and were preparing to take over the world there was no blood except a small splatter against the couch and wall an ugly brown against the yellowish green paint from glenns broken nose perhaps an armchair had been shoved into an upright piano and looseleaf sheets of music were stacked on the bench leaning up against the wall by the large window overlooking the snowcovered swing set was a picture it had fallen turned against the wall and i wanted to see what it was in the worst way a christmas tree was propped up in the corner disheveled and clearly having fallen at some point if the dark spot on the rug where the water had drained out wasnt enough of a clue there were a lot of decorations for one room and they were a curious mix of style most were the inexpensive massproduced variety but there was what was probably a twohundreddollar snow globe and an antique tiffanystyle mistletoe display weird three stockings hung from the mantel and these too looked expensivetoo classy for most of the decorations only the smallest had a name holly the babys probably the mantel was empty of pictures which i thought was odd seeing as there was a new baby in the house the top of the piano was bare as well jenks had dropped down to talk with the guy at the piano ivy had her head next to the photographers edden wasnt paying me any attention everyone looked busy so i wandered to the fireplace and ran a finger over the smooth wood for evidence that the mantel had once held pictures no dust hey the man with edden exclaimed what do you think youre doing his face red he glanced at edden clearly ticked off because he wanted to kick me out but couldnt faces turned and embarrassed i backed up sorry ivy glanced up from the laptop in the sudden quiet both she and the photographer wore questioning expressions as they stared at me looking like yin and yang with ivys short black hair and the photographers long blond tresses i remembered seeing the photographer at trents stables taking pictures but ivy hadnt been there and i wondered how she had gotten chummy enough in fifteen minutes to have their heads together discussing the niceties of angles and shadows almost smiling edden harrumphed head bowed and stubbyfingered hand in the air to say he was taking care of it he rocked into motion ivy gave the photographer one of our cards then crossed the room to join me jenks landed on her shoulder halfway there and i saw her lips move in a soft comment that made the pixy laugh by the time they all reached me i had cocked my hip and crossed my arms over my chest im not going to touch anything else i exclaimed wondering if the harsh expressions on the fib officers faces were for me breaking protocol or a lingering doubt about my involvement in kistens death i knew edden had done his best to squelch it but that meant little to a lifetime of prejudice rolling his eyes at ivy edden took my elbow to lead me into the hallway ivy too was smiling but as soon as the privacy of the hall took us she became serious rachels here now so how about showing us where glenn was beat up she asked surprising me thats it edden said glancing past me and into the living room everything else looks untouched i jerked my elbow from edden and leaned against the wall jenkss wings clattered as he flew to snuggle in my scarf and ivy shook her head there isnt enough emotion in the room for someone having been mauled she said you say it happened this morning no way eddens face scrunched up and i looked at ivy a vampire could read the pheromones left in a room giving a qualitative though not terribly quantitative impression of the emotions that had been given free rein by the way edden looked i guessed he knew about the ability but didnt trust it neither did the courts disallowing a vampires testimony unless they were trained registered and attended quarterly calibration seminars ivy didnt but if she said there wasnt a sign of a struggle here then id believe her over a bloodsplattered wall the rest of the house is undisturbed he said and ivy frowned do you want me to tell you what we do know while we tour the house for signs ofemotion he finished and i smirked wait until they heard what i found out but ivy shot me a look to shut up and my breath slipped from me okayill wait im listening she said to edden as she went down the short hall her stride was long and confident and the man toting the fib evidence vacuum pressed into the wall to let her pass she went first into a tidy opulent bedroom with pillows rich drapes rugs and beautiful things arranged on what looked like an antique carved bedroom set drawers were open and the closet clearly had hangers missing the rich femininity didnt match the rest of the house not at all well except for the snow globe stockings and mistletoe display the mortgage is in mr and mrs tilsons names edden said his hands in his pockets as he rocked back on his heels clearly not interested in the incongruity of decorating styles theyre human he added and i almost blurted no they arent biting my tongue instead he and his wife bought the house about a year and a half ago edden continued and jenks snorted silent to all but me shes a stayathome mom caring for their daughter but weve found that holly is registered at three day cares mr tilson works as a janitor retired from being a science teacher in kentucky took early retirement i guess and wanted something to do and to supplement his pension like clean crap from the walls of the boys bathroom yeah that sounded right we have a tap on the phone and were watching the credit cards edden was saying as ivy skulked around the room theres no extended family that we know of yet on either side but everyone is out for the holidays and its taking a long time to get anything his words broke off suddenly and he stared at me why are you smiling immediately i forced my expression to go innocent no reason what else have you got very little he eyed me well find them ivy eased around the carved furniture like a shadow using a pen to shift the curtains and nodding at the securitysystem sticker on the window her sleek leather made her look like a wellpaid assassin against the elegant surroundings hidden inside the depths of the house someone had excellent tastes and i didnt think it was mr tilson the janitor mr tilson the hit man maybe heres a recent picture edden said handing me a piece of paper with a copy of tilsons school id jenks startled me when he vaulted from the folds of soft yarn to hover over the ninebyeleven paper the face not smiling back at me was blurry but according to the tag he was blond and blue eyed there were some wrinkles but not a lot and he had a receding hairline pretty harmless looking for someone who can beat up an fib detective jenks said its the quiet ones you have to watch out for i murmured silently asking jenks if he was done before handing the paper back to edden ivy hadnt come over to look so shed probably seen it already we dont have anything yet on mrs tilson edden said starting when ivy jerked into a fast pace and left the room but were working on it his last words were rather distant and i could guess why ivy was edging into the eerie vamp quickness she took pains to hide from me her unnerving speed aside i enjoyed seeing her like this wrapped up in thinking work was the only time she let herself forget the misery of her wants and needs and found a feeling of selfworth edden followed me into the hallway it wasnt hard to figure out where ivy had gone jenks had already flown past the open door to the bathroom and there was a frightened older fib officer leaning against a wall at the end of the hall she in there edden asked the man who clearly had not been expecting an intense vampire in leather to burst in on him edden gave the sweating man a pat on the shoulder will you find out if the fingerprints have been sent off yet the officer walked away gratefully and edden and i entered what was clearly the babys room if ivy looked out of place in the bedroom she looked like she was from mars next to the crib frilly lace curtains and brightly colored expensive toys the child had been lavished with attention from the looks of it and where ivy stuck out jenks fit right in hovering with his hands on his hips and staring in disgust at a framed shot of tinker bell were gathering information for a trial more than searching for a way to find them edden said to keep the conversation going and cover the pain in the back of his eyes im not letting a lawyer uphold the constitution so far that we have to let them go i jumped when one of the toys burst into music jenks just about hit the ceiling in a cloud of dust clearly the guilty party you cant pack up a baby and go that fast without leaving a trail i said adrenaline flooding me i heard the woman dotes on her kid i gazed at the mounds of toys all youll have to do is post a man at the toy store youll have them in a week i want them now edden said grimly the music cut off and seeing jenks hovering miserably in the middle of the room edden added dont worry jenks we were done here oh sure i get yelled at and the pixy gets told it doesnt matter but as ivy poked around i drifted to the books in the overstuffed rocking chair smiling at a familiar title i reached for them not wanting to leave this spot of innocence and good taste a feeling of melancholy had overtaken me i knew it was from my dilemma about having kids if it had just been my blood disease i might have taken my chances but i couldnt face my children being demons i had let the hideandseek book slip from my fingers when ivy gingerly came to a halt among the stuffed animals and pastel colors standing as if the soft domesticity might be catching is this the last room she asked and when edden nodded with a tired motion she added are you sure glenn wasnt attacked somewhere else and dropped here pretty sure his prints on the walk come right to the door her calm face showed a glimmer of anger theres nothing in this room either she said softly nothing not even a whisper from a cranky baby seeing her ready to go i stacked the books on a small table the thump of a small cardboard doll hitting the floor drew my attention and i picked it up the lavish hideandseek book was extravagant for a small house in a depressed neighborhood but after seeing the bedroom i wasnt surprised it was obvious they spared no expense when it came to their kid nothing fit nothing made sense jenks flitted to ivys shoulder clearly trying to cheer her up she was having none of it and waved him away edden waited for me by the door as i leafed through the book to put the doll back but there was already a hard bump in the pocket where it belonged just a minute i said using two fingers to dig it out i didnt know why but the doll needed to go back in her bed and i was the only one who could do it thats what the oversize print said and i was feeling melancholy edden could wait but when my fingertips connected with the smooth bump in the pocket i jerked my hand out jamming my fingers into my mouth before i knew what i was doing ow i yelped from around my fingers then stared at the book now fallen onto the chair eddens face became wary and jenks flew to me ivy stopped dead on the threshold staring with eyes black from the surge of adrenaline id given off embarrassed i took my fingers out of my mouth and pointed somethings in there i said feeling quivery inside it moved something is in that book and its furry and warm and it shocked the hell out of me ivy came back in but it was edden who took his pen and stuck it in the pocket the three of us crouched over the book while jenks stood nearby and bent to look in its a stone he said as he straightened looking at me quizzically a black stone it was furry i backed up a step i felt it move edden wedged the pen in and a black crystal came sliding out to glint dully in the electric light theres your mouse he said dryly and i felt the blood fall to my feet as i recognized it it was a banshee tear it was a freaking banshee tear thats a banshee tear both ivy and i said together and jenks gave a little yelp taking flight to flit madly between me and ivy until he finally landed on my shoulder i stepped back wringing my hand as if i could erase having touched it damn id touched a banshee tear double damn it was probably evidence it felt furry the pixy said and i nodded eyeing my fingers they looked okay but it had been a banshee tear and it gave me the creeps eddens expression of confusion slowly cleared ive heard of these he said tapping it with his pen tip then he straightened to his entire height and looked me directly in the eye this is why theres no emotion here isnt it i nodded deciding this was why it looked like a home but didnt feel like it the banshee tear explained everything the love had been sucked right out they leave them where theres likely to be a lot of emotion i said wondering why ivy had gone pale well paler than usual sometimes they will tip the scales and make things worsesort of push everyone to a higher pitch the tear soaks everything up and then the banshee comes back to collect it and i had touched it euwie a banshee did this edden said his anger slipping through a crack in his veneer of calm made that man hurt my son probably not i said thinking about what matt had told me and glancing at ivy if mrs tilson was cheating on her husband thats reason enough for a banshee to leave a tear i bet she got it in here by posing as a babysitter or something i looked at the tear heavy and dark with the stored emotion of glenns maulingand i shivered remembering how warm it had felt the is has a record on every banshee in cincinnati i said you can analyze the tear find out who made it the banshee might know where they went they usually choose their victims carefully and will follow them from place to place if the pickings are good though they prefer to feed passively they can suck a person dry in seconds i thought that was illegal edden slid the crystal into an evidence bag and sealed it it is ivys voice was mild but i thought she looked ill jenks was picking up on her mood too you okay he said and she blinked her softly almondshaped eyes once no she said her gaze falling to the tear even if mrs tilson was cheating on her husband the suspect knew exactly where to hit glenn to hurt but not maim the house is clean to the point of obsession but theres too much money being spent on the little girl and the wife for him to be a wife beater the man doesnt even have a remote for the tv for gods sake she said pointing to the unseen living room yet they have silk sheets and a baby computer you think the woman beat him up i interrupted and ivy frowned edden though was interested if she was an inderlander maybe a living vampire she could do it shed know how to induce pain without damage too ivy make a noise of negation id be able to smell it if a vampire had visited much less lived here she said but i had my doubts last year i would have said it was impossible to make a charm to cover an inderlanders scent from another inderlander but my mom had spelled my dad into smelling like a witch for their entire marriage i stood there and tried to figure it out both jenks and me jumping when edden clapped his hands once out he said suddenly and i protested when he manhandled me into the hall ivy you and jenks can stay but rachel i want you out wait a minute i complained but he kept me moving yelling for someone to bring the vacuum ivy just shrugged giving me an apologetic smile sorry rachel edden said when we reached the activity of the living room his brown eyes glinting with amusement you can poke around in the garage if you want excuse me i exclaimed he knew i hated the cold it was an offer that really wasnt one how come ivy gets to stay and help because ivy knows how to handle herself that was just rude you suckwad im the one who found the tear i said as i stood in the archway to the living room and watched everyone buzz about the new development several heads turned but i didnt care i was being gotten rid of eddens face darkened with emotion but his next words were postponed when alex the officer he had sent to watch my car came in cold on his breath and snow on his boots ah they wont be able to have a dog out to look at your car for a couple of hours he said nervously seeing eddens anger directed at me theres a big brimstone bust out at the hollows airport i jumped as suddenly ivy was next to me whats wrong with your car she asked and i let my air out in a huff tom bansen was standing next to it i said im being paranoid ivy smiled dont worry about him she said youre under rynn cormels protection he wouldnt dare unless the vampires want me dead i thought then turned back to edden edden i complained but the squat man put a hand on my shoulder and moved me to the kitchen alex take ms morgan home he said rachel ill call you if we need you if you dont want to leave you can wait in the kitchen but its going to be hours probably not until tomorrow you might as well go home he wasnt telling ivy to go home i took a breath to whine some more but someone had called his name and he was gone leaving only the faint scent of coffee a familiar wing clatter drew my attention to jenks sitting on top of a picture frame and he dropped to me sorry rache he said and i slumped back into the wall disgusted im staying i said loud enough for everyone to hear and alex exhaled in relief going to stand over a heating vent how come ivy gets to help i asked jenks already knowing the answer and envious of how she a vampire who had once beaten up an entire floor of fib guys was fitting in better than me a witch who had helped them bring in the citys master vampire in their own back room it wasnt my fault skimmer killed him hell i thought maybe i should take some classes on crime scene protocol anything would be better than standing on the sidelines and watching everyone else play i was not a bench warmer not by a long shot jenks landed on my shoulder in a show of support i knew he wanted to help and i appreciated his loyalty at his movement edden looked up from his cell phone is your finger okay he asked suddenly and i glanced at it it looked fine not answering him i pushed from the wall and stomped out jenks rose to follow me at head height into the empty kitchen rache he started and i grimaced stay with ivy if you want i said bitterly zipping up my coat and wrapping my scarf around my neck i wasnt going home not yet ill be in the garage his tiny features became relieved thanks rache ill let you know what we find out he said slipping a trail of gold dust as he zipped back to the nursery its so unfair i thought as i took my blue booties off so my protocol sucked dishwater i was getting results faster than a houseful of fib agents leaving i slammed the screen door and stomped down the cement steps home yeah maybe id make cookies gingerbread men with little fib badges then id bite their freaking heads off but when my feet hit the cement floor i slowed oh i was still mad but edden had said i could look through the garage i thought hed offered only because he knew it was too cold but why not hands on my hips i used a boot tip to unwedge the informal closure on the nearest box it popped open to show a mishmash of stuff that looked like classic postyardsale clutter books knickknacks photo albums and several cameras expensive ones photo albums i questioned looking at the silent walls who keeps their photo albums in the garage maybe it was temporary for christmas to make room for all the baby toys i moved to the next box slipping on my gloves for warmth as i opened it to find more books and clothes from the seventiesexplaining their living room perhaps under it was another box that contained last years styles i held up the firsta dress that i might find in my mothers closetthinking that mrs tilson must have been heavy once the dress was way bigger than me but not a maternity cut it didnt match matts description it didnt match what id seen in the open closet either frowning i put the dress back digging to the bottom to find a stack of yearbooks bingo i whispered kneeling to feel the cold cement go right through my jeans i didnt have to wait until eddens office dug up a photo of them i could see for myself my knees were cramping so i pulled the kiddie sled over and sat on it knees almost to my ears as i leafed through a yearbook with clair smith penciled on the front flap clair had graduated from a high school a few hundred miles upstate and was apparently popular if the overwhelming number of signatures meant anything lots of promises to write apparently she toured europe before going to college there was another yearbook from a local college where shed gotten her fouryear journalism degree majoring in photography and had met joshua according to the hearts and flowers around his signature my gaze slid to the box of albums so maybe it was school stuff it might explain the cameras too she was a member of the photography club in high school and had graduated in i stared at the picture of the young woman standing on the bleachers surrounded by awkward teenagers my finger resting on her name unless there was a misprint clair was a rather round young woman with a cheerful smile not the slight mild woman matt had described she wasnt fat but she wasnt my size either and if shed graduated in that would make herover forty now i felt my face lose its expression and i turned to look at the wall of the house as if i could pull ivy out here with my thoughts over forty with one kid and wanting five more spacing them five years apart she had to be an inderlander witches lived a hundred and sixty years and could have kids the entire span apart from twenty years on either side maybe that was the source of strife mr tilson found out his wife was a witch but it didnt smell like a witch lived here or a vampire or a were i exhaled setting the book aside and shuffling until i found one with joshua tilson printed on the front cover his school had splurged for real fakeleather bindings nice joshua had graduated from kentucky state the same year as clair i thumbed through the pages looking for him my lips parted and a chill tightened my muscles slowly i brought the page closer to my nose wishing the light were brighter out here joshua didnt look anything like the photo edden had shown me my eyes went to the surrounding stuff then remembered eddens comments about mr tilson retiring then matts complaint that the same man ought to be able to mow his own lawn the rage mr tilson had fallen into how young his family was and how they were going to have lots more kids stuff in the garage they didnt want in the house but couldnt risk throwing away i didnt think mr and mrs tilson were the people who lived here they were someone else and couldnt risk being found out by calling the ambulance so they had fled i shivered the motion reaching all the way to my fingertips iiiiivyyyyy i shouted ivy come see this i listened to the silence for a moment she wasnt coming annoyed i got up book in hand my knees were stiff from the cold and i almost fell jerking myself straight when ivy poked her head out find something she said amusement in her dark eyes not are you still here or i thought you left but find something and her amusement wasnt at my expense but eddens who was now behind her i smiled telling her i had indeed found something glenn wasnt beaten up by mr tilson i said smugly rachel edden started and i triumphantly held up the yearbook and came forward have you gotten your fingerprints back yet i asked no its going to be almost a week be sure to check them against known inderland criminal offenders i said shoving the book at him but ivy took it you wont find them matching up to mr tilsons record and thats assuming he has one i think the tilsons are dead and whoever is living here took their names along with their lives five thanks alex i shouted waving to the fib officer as he drove down the shadowy snowquiet street to leave me standing on the sidewalk outside our church ivy was already halfway up the walk anxious to be on her own turf where she had her ironclad ways of coping shed been quiet all the way home and i didnt think it was from us needing a ride because i was too chicken to open my car door and see if i exploded alexs taillights flashed as he rolled through a stop sign at the end of the road and i turned away the church that ivy jenks and i lived in was lit up and serene the colors bleeding out of the stainedglass windows and onto the untouched snow in a fabulous swirl i studied the roofline to try to spot bis our resident gargoyle but there was nothing between the white puffs of my breath the church was pretty with its christmas and solstice decorations of live garlands and cheerful bows and i smiled glad to live in such a unique place this last fall jenks had finally fixed the spotlights angling onto the steeple and it added to the beauty the building hadnt been used as a church for years but it was sanctifiedagain ivy had originally chosen the church to operate our runner firm from to tick off her undead mother and wed never moved to more professional digs when the opportunity had arisen i felt safe here so did ivy and jenks needed the garden out back to feed his almost four dozen kids hurry up rache jenks complained from under my hat ive got icicles hanging smirking i followed ivy up the walk to the worn front steps jenks had been silent on the ride home too and id have almost been willing to find out what happened on the ninth day of christmas just so i wouldnt have had to keep the conversation going with alex all by myself i couldnt tell if my roommates ivy especially had been thinking or just mad maybe she thought id shown her up by discovering that the tilsons were impostors before she had or maybe she was upset that i wanted her to go out to kistens boat shed loved him too loved him more deeply than me and longer id have thought shed be eager for the chance to find his killer and the vampire who had tried to turn me into a blood toy ivys pace ground to a stop on the salted steps and my head came up when a soft curse slipped from her halting i sent my gaze to follow hers to our business sign over the door damn it all to the turn and back i whispered seeing the spraypainted black wit and a halfscripted c trailing down the brass plaque to drip onto the twin oak doors what is it jenks shrilled unable to see and tugging on my hair someone redecorated the sign ivy said blandly but i could tell she was mad we need to start leaving some lights on she muttered yanking open the door and going inside lights i exclaimed the place is already lit up like aa church ivy was inside and i stood there with my hands on my hips getting more and more pissed it was an attack on me and i felt it to my core after the hint of fib animosity at the crime site son of a bitch bis i shouted as i looked up and wondered where the little guy was you out here rache jenks said as he tugged on my hair i gotta check on matalina and my kids sorry i muttered pulling my coat tight about me i passed into the church and yanked the door shut angry i let the locking bar thump down though technically we were open until midnight there was a soft lifting of my hat and jenks darted off into the sanctuary i slowly took my hat off and hung it on the hook my mood easing at the highpitched chorus of hellooos from his kids it had taken me four hours to scrape the paint from the brass the last time where in hell was bis i hoped he was okay the artists had clearly been interrupted maybe i should spell the sign i thought but i didnt think there was a charm to make metal impervious to paint i could put a black spell on it to give whoever touched it acne but that would be illegal and despite what the graffiti said i was a white witch damn it the warmth of the church soaked into me as i hung my coat on a peg past the dark shadow of the windowless foyer was my desk at the back of the sanctuary where the altar used to be the oak rolltop currently covered with plants and serving as a winter home for jenks and his family it was safer than hibernating in the stump in the backyard and since i didnt ever use my desk it was only a matter of enduring the indignity of finding pixy girls playing in my makeup or using the hair in my brush to fashion hammocks across from my desk was an informal grouping of furniture around a low coffee table there was a tv and a stereo but it was more of a place to interview clients than a real living room our undead patrons had to come around to the back and the unsanctified part of the church and our more private living room thats where ivys christmas tree was with one present still under it after ruining davids coat trying to tag tom id had to get him a new one he was in the bahamas right now at an insurance seminar with the ladies one front corner of the church held ivys baby grand pianoout of sight from where i now stoodand across from that a mat where id taken to exercising when ivy was out ivy went to the gym to keep her figure at least thats where she said she was going when she left anxious and came home rested relaxed and satiated in the middle of it all was kistens battered pool table rescued from the curb whereas kisten himself hadnt been my mood slowly shifted from anger to melancholy as i took off my boots and left them under my coat a passel of jenkss kids were in the open rafters singing carols and it was hard to stay upset with their ethereal threepart harmony mixing with the smell of brewing coffee coffee i thought as i flopped onto the couch and pointed the remote at the stereo crystal method filled the air fast and aggressive and i tossed the remote to the table and put my feet up out of the draft coffee would make everything better but i probably had at least five minutes until it was done after that close ride in the cop car ivy needed some space jenks dropped down onto the elaborate centerpiece ivys dad had brought over one night the thing was all glitter and gold but jenks went well with it standing on the painted sticks that looped in and around he had one of his kids with him the little pixy boy had his wings glued shut again tear tracks giving away his misery dont let it get to you rache jenks said as he sifted dust from himself and wedged it in the fold his sons wings made ill help you clean the paint off tomorrow i can do it i muttered not relishing the idea that whoever put it up there would probably do a driveby to see me busting my ass on a ladder jenks helping me was a nice thought but no way would it be warm enough i dont get it i complained then did a double take at the tiny cutout snowflakes now decorating the windows thats why the glue they were the size of my pinkie nail and were the sweetest things id ever seen no one cares about the good stuff i do i said as jenkss son squirmed under his dads attention so what if i had to summon a demon if it all ended well i mean you tell me cincinnati isnt better without piscary rynn cormel is a way better crime boss than he was ivy likes him too youre right the pixy said as he gently pulled his sons wings apart behind him rex jenkss cat peeked in from the dark foyer pulled from the belfry by the sound of her fourinch masters voice just last week jenks had installed a cat door in the belfry stairway tired of asking one of us to open the door for his cat the beast loved the belfry with its high windows it made easy access for bis too not that the catsize gargoyle came in much and trent i said watching rex since jenks was preoccupied with a flightless child beloved city son and idiot billionaire goes and gets caught in the everafter who has to bust her butt and make a deal with demons to get him back the one who got him there jenks said and my eyes narrowed hey kitty kitty hows my sweetest fluff ball he crooned which i thought risky but hey it was his cat it was trents idea i said foot bobbing and now its my tail in the everafter paying for his rescue do i even get one thankyou no i get trash painted on my front door you got your life back jenks said and an end to al trying to kill you got an understanding in the everafter that any demon messing with you is messing with al you got trents silence as to what you are he could have brought you down right there it wouldnt be graffiti on your door but a burning stake in the front yard with you tied to it i froze shocked what i am trent kept silent as to what i am i should be thankful he didnt tell anyone if he told anyone what i was hed have to explain how i got that way which would put him on the stake next to me but jenks was smiling at his son oblivious there you go jerrimatt he said fondly as he gave the youngster a boost into the air where he hung shedding bright sparkles to pool on the table and if glue should somehow end up in jacks mittens i wont have any idea who did it the small pixys wings fanned into motion and a cloud of silver dust enveloped both of them thanks papa jerrimatt said and his tearwet eyes took on a familiar glint of deviltry jenks watched his son fly away with a fond look rex watched too tail twitching turning back to me jenks saw my sour mood trent kept silent as to what i am eh i mean the pixy backpedaled what trents dad did to you mollified i took my feet from the table and put them on the floor yeah whatever i muttered as i rubbed my wrist and the demon mark there i had another on the bottom of my foot since al hadnt traded it back for his summoning name yet enjoying my owing him two marks i lived with the worry that id be pulled into someones demon circle some night but no one had summoned al and gotten me insteadyet the demon marks were hard to explain and more people than i liked knew what they were it was the victors who wrote the history books and i wasnt winning but at least i wasnt living in the everafter playing blowup doll to a demon no i was just playing his student leaning my head back and looking at the ceiling i shouted ivy that coffee done rex skittered under the pool table at my voice and at ivys positive call i clicked off the music and lurched to my feet jenks went to help matalina break up a fight about glitter and i paced down the long hall that bisected the back end of the church i passed the hisandher bathrooms that had been converted into ivys opulent bathroom and my more spartan facilities that also boasted the washer and dryer our separate bedrooms were next my best guess putting them originally as clergy offices though the dark hallway didnt change the feeling of the air did as i entered the unsanctified back end of the church added on later this was where the kitchen and private living room were and if it had been sanctified i would have slept here put simply i loved my kitchen ivy had remodeled it before i had moved in and it was the best room in the place a bluecurtained window over the sink looked out on the small witchs garden beyond that was the graveyard that had bothered me at first but after mowing the site for a year i had a fondness for the weathered stones and forgotten names inside it was all gleaming stainless steel and bright fluorescent light there were two stovesone gas one electricso i didnt have to do my spells and cook on the same surface the counter space was expansive and i used it all when i spelled which was often since the charms i used were expensive unless i made them myself then they were dirt cheap literally in the center was an island counter with a circle etched into the linoleum around it i used to keep my spell books in the open rack under it until al had burned one in a fit of pique now they were in the belfry the counter made for a secure place to spell unsanctified or not up against the interior wall was a heavy antique farm table ivy was sitting at the back corner of it near the archway to the hall with her computer printer and stacks of carefully filed papers when wed moved in i had the use of one end of it now i was lucky if i got a corner to eat on so of course id taken over the rest of the kitchen ivy looked up from her keyboard and i dropped my bag on yesterdays unopened mail and collapsed in my chair you want some lunch i asked seeing as it was nearing midnight she shrugged eyeing the bills sure i knew it bugged her so i left the mail where it was under my bag and i lurched back to my feet with tomato soup and cheese crackers in mind if she wanted something more shed say so a pang of worry went through me as i pulled a can of soup off the pantry shelves glenn liked tomatoes god i hoped he was okay that he was unconscious had me concerned ivy clicked through a couple of web pages as i made good with the can opener i hesitated at the sight of my copper spell pots then reached for a more mundane saucepan mixing spell prep and food prep wasnt a good idea research i asked hearing in her silence that she was still upset about something looking up banshees she said shortly and i hoped she didnt know how coy she looked with the end of the pen between her teeth her canines were sharp like a cats but she wouldnt get the extended ones until she was dead she wouldnt get the light sensitivity or the physical need for blood to survive until then either ivy still had a taste for it however and though it made her devilishly hard to live with she could do without the lid came off with a ting and i sighed ivy im sorry her foot moved back and forth like an angry cats tail for what she said mildly then stilled her foots motion as she saw me notice it that my methods are getting faster results than yours i thought but what i said was for sending you out to kistens boat i hated the question in my voice but i didnt know what was bothering her ivy looked up and i studied the rim of brown around her eyes it was wide and full telling me she had control of her emotions i can handle it she said and i frowned hearing something else turning my back on her i shook the congealed soup into the pan with a dull thwap i dont mind going out with you i did but i was going to offer ive got it covered she said more forcefully sighing i searched for a wooden spoon ivy dealt with the uncomfortable by ignoring it and though i wasnt averse to avoiding issues to maintain a pleasant living space i tended to poke sticks at sleeping vampires when i thought i could get away with it the phone rang and i caught ivys dark glare as i whipped around to answer it vampiric charms i said politely into the receiver how can we help i used to answer with my name until the first graffiti incident rachel its edden came the fib captains gravelly voice glad youre home hey were having trouble getting the fingerprints out reeeeally i interrupted making a mocking face at ivy and turning the receiver so she could hear him with her extraordinary vamp hearing imagine that they keep going to the wrong office the man continued too intent to hear my sarcasm but we do know the banshee tear belongs to a mia harbor the womans been around since cincinnati was a pig farm and i wanted to ask you to come down tomorrow about nine and help us interview her i leaned against the counter with a hand to my forehead what he wanted was for me to bring a truth amulet humans were adept at reading body language but a banshee was devilishly hard to interpret or so id heard the is never sent witches after banshees ivy was staring at me brownrimmed eyes wide she looked surprised no shocked nine is too early i said wondering what was up with her how about noon noon he echoed we need to move quickly on this so why did you kick me out when i was making progress i need the morning to make up a truth charm those things are expensive unless you want a fivehundreddollar bill for it tacked onto my consultants fee edden was silent but i could hear his frustration noon noon i said feeling like id won some points actually i had a truth amulet in my charm cupboard two feet away but i didnt get up until eleven most days as long as were done by two ive got to pick up my brother at the airport not a problem he said ill send a car see you here hey has anyone looked at my car yet i said but the line had gone dead tomorrow i said with a smile setting the phone back in its cradle i waltzed to the fridge for the milk then looked at ivy when i realized she was still just sitting there whats the matter ivy leaned back into her chair her expression worried i met mia harbor once right before i was assigned to work with you in the is shes aninteresting lady nice lady i asked as i dumped in the milk if she had been around since cincy was a pig town then she was probably a really old nice lady ivys brow was furrowed when i glanced at her and she put her eyes on her screen her behavior was off what is it i asked as neutrally as i could the pen she was tapping stilled nothing i made a scoffing sound somethings bothering you what is it nothing she said loudly and jenks buzzed in grinning the pixy landed on the island counter between us in his best peter pan pose i think ivys pissed cause you found the banshee tear and she didnt he said and ivys pen started tapping again it was so fast it almost hummed nice going jenks i muttered as i stirred the milk into the soup the ticking of the burner was loud until the gas lit with a whoosh and i turned it to low wheres that buddy gargoyle of yours hes supposed to keep watch at night i dont know he said not worried at all but hes as hard as a rock i wouldnt worry about him maybe hes visiting his folks he does have a life unlike some of us here i think rachel finding that tear was great ivy said tightly i glanced over my shoulder at jenks and at my encouragement he went to make irritating circles around her he could get away with a lot i couldnt and if we didnt find out soon what was bothering her it might be too late to head it off when we did then youre mad because youve been working on kistens murder for six months and rachel got farther in six minutes by sniffing the floor he guessed ivy leaned her chair back on two legs balancing as she measured his flight probably calculating where shed have to be to catch him both are valid ways of investigation she said her pupils widening and its only been three months i didnt look the first three i continued to stir the soup with a clockwise motion as jenks rose up in a column of sparkles and darted out of the kitchen the pixy noise in the sanctuary had reached dangerous levels and i knew he wanted to handle it to give matalina a break she was doing great this winter but we were all still worried about her nineteen was old for a pixy that ivy hadnt done anything to find kistens killer for the first three months wasnt a surprise the hurt had been that bad and she thought she might have been the one who had done it i dont mind going out with you tonight i offered again ford left the ladder im doing this myself i bowed my head over the soup breathing in the acidic scent and feeling ivys pain now that jenks wasnt here cluttering everything up id been kistens girlfriend but ivy had loved him toodeeper on a gut level with the strength of the past not like my new love based on the idea of a future and here i was making her deal with the pain are you okay i asked softly no she said again her voice flat my shoulders slumped i miss him too i whispered i turned to see her perfect face frozen in grief i couldnt help it and risking a misunderstanding i crossed the room its going to be okay i said touching her shoulder for an instant before i withdrew and went into the pantry for the crackers ivy had her head bowed when i came out and i said nothing as i found two bowls and set them on the table with the crackers between them shoving my bag and the mail out of the way uncomfortable with the silence i hesitantly stood before her im uh starting to remember a little i said and her dark eyes flicked to mine i didnt want to tell you in front of edden because ford thinks hell reopen the case when he finds out fear flickered behind her eyes and my breath caught ivy is scared what did you remember she said and my mouth went dry ivy was never scared ticked seductive chill occasionally out of control but never scared i shrugged trying to look nonchalant when i pulled back a sliver of my own fear sliding under my skin i know for sure its a man i got that today he caught a splat ball without breaking it when i tried to shoot him and he dragged me down the hall on my stomach after i tried to get out i looked at my fingertips then put a hand to my middle eyes on the hallway behind her i whispered i tried to claw my way out through a wall ivys voice was a thin whisper a man youre sure she doesnt still think it was her does she i nodded and her entire posture slumped ivy i told you it wasnt you i blurted god i know what you smell like and you werent there how many times do i have to say it i didnt care that it was really weird i knew what ivy smelled like hell wed been living together for a year she knew what i smelled like ivy put her elbows on either side of her keyboard and dropped her forehead into the cradle of her fingers i thought it was skimmer she said flatly i thought skimmer had done it she still wont see me and i thought that was why my lips parted as it started to make sense no wonder ivy hadnt been hellbent on finding kistens killer skimmer had been both her best friend and girlfriend in high school the two sharing their blood and bodies while ivy was out in a private school on the west coast the intelligent devious vampire had moved east to get piscary out of prison and hopefully become a member of a foreign camarilla to be with ivy and the topofherclass lawyer would cheerfully kill kisten or me if thats what it would take that the petite but deadly woman had killed piscary only added to the travesty of vampire logic she was in jail for the crime of killing a city masterin front of witnessesand would likely stay there until she died and became an undead herself kisten couldnt be taken down by another living vampire i said pitying ivy for having lived with this alone for six freaking months her deep brown eyes had lost their fear when they met mine hed let skimmer kill him if piscary gave him to her ivy looked at the mirrored black square the night had turned the window into she hated him she hates you ivys words caught and she shifted her keyboard in a nervous reaction im glad it wasnt her the bubbling soup was threatening to run over and i got up giving her shoulder a squeeze of support before i went to turn it down it was a man i said blowing on the top and flicking the gas off its going to be okay well find him and we can put an end to it my back was to her and i froze as a faint tingle started at my neck the scar shed given me hidden under my cursesmoothed skin i felt the muscles in my face grow slack and my motion of stirring the soup slowed as the feeling deepened into a soft anticipation that struck the pit of my being and rebounded knowing ivy couldnt see i let my eyes close i knew this feeling missed it even as i struggled against my instincts to push it away in her relief that skimmer hadnt killed kisten ivy had unconsciously filled the air with pheromones to soothe and relax a potential source of blood and ecstasy she wasnt after my blood but shed been uptight for the last six months which was probably why just this hint of pheromones felt really good i breathed them in enjoying the rush of desire that tightened my gut and set my thoughts spinning i wasnt going to act on it ivy and i had a safe secure platonic relationship i wanted to keep it that way but that wouldnt stop me from this tiny little indulgence sighing i forced myself to focus on what i was doing i adjusted my posture and shoved the whisper of desire deep where i could ignore it if i didnt ivy would sense my willingness and wed be right back where wed been six months ago unsure uneasy and way too confused are you going to open your mail sometime this century ivy asked her voice distant youve got something from the university glad for the distraction i tapped the spoon and set it in the spoon cozy really i said turning to find her eyeing the halfhidden stack of mail wiping my fingers off on my jeans i came closer pulling the slim envelope with the university emblem on it out from under my bag but leaving the rest as it so clearly bothered her id registered for a couple of ley line classes right before winter break and this was probably the confirmation i could use ley lines but everything i knew had been learned by the seat of my pants i was in desperate need of some formal classes before i fried my synapses ivy shifted her crossed legs and focused on her computer as i ran my finger under the seal having to tear the envelope to actually get it open i pulled the letter out hesitating as my check floated to the floor ivy was on it in a flash short hair swinging as she bent to pick it up ive been denied entrance i said bewildered as i scanned the formal letter they say there was a problem with my check my eyes shot to the date under the letterhead crap i had missed early registration and now id have to tack on another fee did i forget to sign it or something ivy shrugged handing it to me no i think this has more to do with the professor dying the last time you took a class wincing i jammed everything back in the envelope problem with my check i had money in my account this was crap shes not dead shes in trents basement playing ms fixit with the elven genetic code the woman is in heaven dead ivy said smiling to show a slip of teeth i looked away stifling a quiver at the sight of her fangs this is so unfair the harsh clatter of pixy wings gave us a second of warning and i dropped the letter in disgust as jenks buzzed in ivys eyes were wide in question as she gazed at him and turning i was surprised to see a stream of red sparkles slipping from him we got trouble he said and i jumped looking down when a faint bump came from under the floor ivy stood and looked at the faded linoleum someones under there thats what im telling you jenks said sounding almost snotty as he hovered between us with his hands on his hips there was a masculine muffled shout and a series of thumps holy crap i shouted dancing backward that sounded like marshal ivy was a blur headed for the back door i jumped to follow jerking to a halt when the rear door in the back living room thumped open unseen bis who rented out the belfry flew into the kitchen at shoulder height his skin a stark white to match the snow and his eyes glowing like a demons the catsize gargoyle beat his wings in my face and i backed up get out of my way bis i shouted squinting at the draft and thinking about jenkss cold sensitivity what the turn is going on out there there was a commotion in the living room but bis wouldnt get out of my way shouting in his resonant voice about how he was sorry and hed clean it up that he had followed the kids with the paint and didnt know it was a distraction i was ready to smack him one when he landed on my shoulder i could barely feel his weight but vertigo hit me and i slumped back into the counter shocked into thoughtlessness the sensation wasnt unexpected but it got me every timewith biss touch every single ley line in cincinnati became clear and present in my mind it was sensory overload and i wavered on my feet focus blurred it was worse when he was excited and i almost passed out that jenkss kids were darting among the hanging pots didnt help get off i breathed forcefully and looking chagrined the gargoyle beat his wings three times and perched himself sullenly on top of the fridge the pixy kids scattered shrieking as if he were death itself biss creased face scowled at me with teenage bad temper and his pebbly skin shifted to match the stainless steel of the appliance he looked like a sulky gargoyle peering over the edge like that but thats what he was my head jerked up when ivy shoved a snowanddirtcovered man into the kitchen his face was hidden by a hood and frozen chunks of dirty snow scattered across the floor leaving streaks of mud as the kitchens warmth thawed them the odor of cold earth rose and i wrinkled my nose thinking it almost smelled like the man who had killed kisten but not quite ivy sauntered in behind him to take a stance in the door with her arms crossed over her chest marshal was behind her and he came in sliding around ivy with no hesitation and grinning from ear to ear excited and bright eyed under his knit hat his coat and knees were covered in dirt as well but at least he hadnt rolled in it the unknown man in the parka lifted his head and i almost flew at him tom i shouted then checked myself it was tom again under my house instead of looking at my car fear slid through me replaced with anger what are you doing under my house jenks was at the ceiling yelling at his kids to get out and when the last fled with their wooden swords and plasticcoated straightened paper clips tom pulled himself upright and pushed his hood back his lips were blue with cold and his eyes held an irritated anger it was then that i noticed the ley line zipstrip on his wrist where his gloves ended he was basically magically neutered and my estimation of marshal went up a notch for not only knowing what to do with an experienced ley line witch but for having a zipstrip to begin with i was coming over to drop off that box you left in my car marshal said shifting to stand between tom and me thats when i saw thishe gave tom a shove and the man caught himself against the island countercoming over the far wall so i parked and watched he gave a couple of kids a can of black spray paint and a twenty and after bis chased them off your front door he snuck around back and broke the lock on your crawl space access mouth open in anger i thought about giving tom a shove myself you paid someone to ruin our sign i shouted do you know how long it took me to clean it the first time toms lips were starting to pink up and he pressed them together refusing to answer behind him i saw bis sneak out of the kitchen the small gargoyle had gone entirely white to match the ceiling and only the rims of his ears his long clawlike nails and a thick stripe down his whiplike tail were still gray he was crawling along the ceiling like a bat wings held to make sharp angles and claws extended it just about broke my creepy meter rachel marshal said gently he did it to get rid of bis marshal took off his hat and unzipped his coat sending a wave of redwood into the kitchen heady from whatever magic hed used to catch tom whats important is finding out what he was doing under your church we all turned to look at tom good question i said got an answer witch tom was silent and ivy cracked her knuckles one by one i hadnt even known she could but thats what she was doing pop pop pop ivy i said when it was clear he wasnt going to say anything why dont you call the is they might be interested in this tom snickered his arrogance clear sure you do that he said im sure the is would love to know a shunned witch was in your kitchen who do you think theyll believe if i tell them i was buying charms from you oh shit my gut twisted and i frowned when marshals eyes widened at the word shunned without a word ivy set the phone down her eyes a dangerous black she eased closer a threatening haze seemed to drift a few seconds behind her as she placed her finger under his chin and asked in a soft voice is there a contract out on rachel fear bubbled against my skull and i caught it before it triggered something worse in ivy id lived with a death threat before and it was hard if not for ivy and jenks i would have died tom took a step back and rubbed his wrist shed be dead already if there was jenks bristled his wings a sharp clatter as he came to stand on my shoulder oooooh im scared i said to hide my relief what are you doing here then the angry witch smiled to wish you a happy new year my eyes narrowed and fist on my hip i looked at the dirty puddles his boots were making gaze slowly rising i took in his white nylon pants and his gray coat his face was calm but the hatred was there and when ivy shifted her feet he jerked tense id start talking she threatened if youre shunned no one will care if you dont show up for church next week the tension started to rise and my gaze broke from tom when bis flew back in tinks diaphragm jenks shouted when did he leave rachel did you even see him leave here rachel the gargoyle said as he dropped an amulet and my hand flashed out to catch it the metallic circlet hit my palm with a cool sensation smelling like redwood and frozen dirt i found it stuck to the floorboards it was the only one toms jaw went stiff as he clenched his teeth my anger grew as i recognized it from the days when id sit with my dad while he prepped his spells for a night at work its a bug i said as i handed it to marshal to look at ivys face grew even grimmer and spreading her feet she tossed her short goldtipped hair out of her eyes why are you bugging our kitchen tom didnt say anything but he didnt have to id found him in front of the tilsons house he had told me he was working he probably thought wed have the inside scoop on the situation and since he didnt have access to anything magical or the inderland database he was going to steal what we knew and use it to jerk the tag out from under us this is about the tilsons isnt it i said and i knew i was right when his eyes went to the soup scumming over you want to tell me now save me the trouble of having ivy beat it out of you stay away from her tom said vehemently ive been watching that woman for five months and shes mine got it i leaned back nodding as he confirmed my thoughts tom knew they werent the tilsons and was probably working on the murders already he seemed to think the woman had done it im just doing my job tom i said starting to feel better sure he had bugged me but my car was probably not wired to explode dead people dont talkusually tell you what you stay out of my way ill stay out of yours and the best witch will win okay sure the man said confidence suddenly flowing from him good luck with that youre going to come begging to talk to me before this is all over i guarantee it jenkss wings made a cool draft on my neck get the cookie out of here he said sharply and marshal came forward to manhandle him out ivy beat him to it gripping toms wrist and twisting his arm into a painful angle to propel him into the hall dont forget his amulet i called after her and bis darted down to take it from marshal and fly after them i heard a muttered comment from ivy and then the back door shut bis didnt come back i assumed hed gone with her she can handle him okay marshal asked and i nodded my knees suddenly shaky oh yeah shell be fine its tom im worried about my stomach hurt damn it it had been ages since anyone had dared to violate the security of my home and now that it was over i didnt like it grimacing i stirred the soup nervous energy making me slop it over jenks was flitting like a mad thing and while wiping up my spill i muttered park it jenks the kitchen grew quiet apart from the rasp of marshal taking off his coat but it was the gurgle of him pouring two cups of coffee that brought my attention back i managed a thin smile when he brought me one jenks was on his shoulder which was unusual but the man had saved us a lot of trouble and jenks had to appreciate that since he couldnt go outside and bis was just one gargoyleand a young inexperienced one at that thanks i said turning from the soup and taking a sip of coffee as i leaned against the counter for tom as well as the coffee i added looking satisfied and smug marshal pulled a chair around and sat with his back to the wall and his legs in the middle of the room not a problem rachel im glad i was here trailing a thin green dust jenks flew to land beside me pretending to feed his brine shrimp on the sill i knew marshal thought my estimation of the danger i could attract was overrated but even id admit that his catching a shunned ley line witch was impressive i breathed deep as i listened to the pixy playbyplay filtering in from the sanctuary of what ivy was doing to tom the subtly masculineflavored scent of redwood eased about me a witchs characteristic smell it was nice smelling it in my kitchen mixing with vampire and the light garden scent i was starting to recognize as pixy marshal was eyeing the ceiling in an expectant way and chuckling i went to sit with him all right i said as i touched his hand encircling his coffee i admit it you saved me you saved me from whatever tom had planned youre my great big freaking hero okay he laughed at that and it felt good you want that box from my car he said starting to gather himself to stand i thought about what was in it and froze no will you throw it out for me im not throwing kisten away i thought guiltily but to keep his last gift in my bottom drawer was pathetic uh thanks again for going with me out to the boat marshal shifted his chair angling it to face me no problem is your fib friend okay i nodded my thoughts drifting to glenn ford says hell be awake in a few days jenks had gotten himself a pixysize mug of coffee from the stilldripping machine and he settled between us on the box of crackers he was unusually quiet but he was probably keeping an ear on his kids there was a sound of rising awe from the sanctuary when ivy did something and i winced my eyes went to the corner of the envelope and in a sudden surge of irritation i picked it out hey will you do something for me i asked as i handed it to marshal im trying to pay for some classes and i need to get this to the registrars office like yesterday i thought registration ended jenks piped up and marshals eyebrows went high as he took it it did he said and i shrugged they sent my check back i complained can you see if they will take it use your connections to get it in the system i dont want to have to pay the late fee nodding he folded the envelope over and slid it into a back pocket to look at later brow furrowed he leaned back in his chair thinking you want some soup i asked and marshal smiled no thanks he said then his eyes brightened hey ive got tomorrow off its a teacher workday at the university but its not like ive got any papers to grade you want to go do something blow off some steam after i get your check in that is i hear they opened up a new skate park on vine whereas two months ago the offer would have tripped all my warning flags now my lips curled up in a smile marshal wasnt my boyfriend but we did stuff together all the time i dont think i can i said annoyed that i couldnt say yes and go ive got this murder im working onand my sign to clean jenkss wings clattered i said id help you with that rache he said brightly and i smiled and curved my hand around him its too cold jenks i protested then turned back to marshal then ive got to pick up my brother at the airport at three talk to ford at six and then go back to my moms and do the gooddaughter thing by having dinner with her and robbie saturday im in the everafter with al my words trailed off next week maybe marshal nodded in understanding and suddenly seeing a golden opportunity to avoid being badgered at my moms i blurted out uh unless you want to come with me to my moms for dinner shes making lasagna the man laughed you want me to play boyfriend so your life doesnt look pathetic right marshal i gave his shoulder a smack but i was redfaced god he knew me too well well am i right he needled his eyes glinting under his hatflattened hair i made a face then said you going to help me here or not you bet he said brightly i like your mom is she making piiiie he stressed the word as if it meant the world to him and i grinned feeling better about tomorrow already if she knows youre coming shell make two marshal chuckled and as i sipped my coffee and smiled back content and happy jenks flew out of the kitchen on quiet wings a green trail of dust spilling from him to slowly fade to nothing six the fibs lobby was noisy and cold gray street slush had been tracked in making a soggy mess of the rug and creating a slowly diminishing black path to the front desk set back from the twin glass doors the fib emblem in the middle of the room was dingy from a hundred footprints it reminded me of the emblem on the floor of the demons law offices a joke al had said but i had my doubts i shifted nervously in the nasty orange chairs they had out here saturday and my teaching date with algaliarept always seemed to come up too fast trying to explain to robbie and my mom why i was going to be incommunicado all day would be tricky i had cheerfully strode into the fib about ten minutes beforemy mood excellent since alex had brought my car homemy snappy boots leaving prints on their emblem as i went to the front desk to announce who i wasonly to be asked to take a seat like i was some weirdo off the street sighing i hunched over with my elbows on my knees and tried to find a comfortable position i wasnt happy about being asked to wait if ivy had been here they wouldve fallen all over themselves but not for mea memorychallenged witch they didnt trust anymore ivy was currently out on the street trying to pick up the sixthmonthold trail of kistens killer guilt for not having done anything sooner had gotten her up long before me jenks had come with me today in the hopes that wed stop at a charm shop on the way home he wasnt interested in a charm but the stuff that went into making themthings that a gardenloving pixy cheating hibernation cant get in december matalina wasnt doing well and i knew he was upset ready and willing to spend some of the rent money he got from ivy and me on his wife sitting here in the fibs lobby was a poor use for both our days not to mention that it was cold i straightened to swing my bag between my knees to try to burn off some irritation and snuggled into my scarf jenks wiggled to life whats up rache he asked landing on my hands to get me to stop swinging my bag nothing i said shortly his brow rose and he gave me a look then why did your pulse quicken and your temperature rise he made a face your perfume stinks god what did you do bathe in it i stared at the receptionist avoiding jenkss question i couldnt tell him i was worried about his wife not making it through the winter he buzzed his wings for my attention and i tapped the banshee report on my knee i had written it for edden this morningwhich only made me madder i was here to help and they left me waiting with distraught parents and thugs cuffed to the walls nice lookie here rache jenks said not a speck of dust falling from him as he flew heavily two seats down and landed on a discarded paper you made some print what expecting the worst i leaned over and snatched it up jenks laboriously flew back and settled on my hand as i held the paper up scanning the picture this was all i needed but my worry eased when i found it was just a shot of the tilsons house with a crowd and a news van out front the caption said yearend brimstone bust gone wrong and you couldnt even tell it was me unless you knew it gonna save it for your scrapbook jenks asked as i quickly read the article no i tossed the paper back where it had been then stretched to turn the picture side down drug bust eh good for them keep it that way hands on his hips jenks flew into my line of sight but i was saved from whatever smartass remark he was going to gift me with when the doors cycled open and two uniformed fib guys roughly escorted in a thin santa the man was shrieking about his reindeer the cold draft hit us and jenks dove for my scarf tinks titties you think you could put a little more perfume on rache he complained and i shivered as his wings brushed my bare skin its from ivy i said oh i sighed as i settled in to wait id found the new bottle of citrusy scent on the kitchen table this morning id known what it meant and had immediately dabbed on a splash apparently after yesterday ivy thought it prudent to reinstate our practice of trying to muddle the mixing of our natural scents we hadnt had to resort to chemical warfare on her instincts for a while but wed been trapped in the church with the windows closed for months the santa broke from the officers and bolted for the door i jerked upright then relaxed as the two officers fell on him all three slid into the doors with a thump the guy was cuffed how far was he going to get damn i swore softly wincing thats going to leave a mark a presence of old coffee tickled my nose and i wasnt surprised when edden appeared at my elbow the one on the bottom is chad hes new i think hes trying to impress you my irritation at having to wait returned and i looked up at the squat fib captain he was in his usual khakis and dress shirt no tie but his brown dress shoes were polished and he held himself with his familiar uprightness his eyes too looked more determined tired but the fear was gone glenn must be doing better im impressed i said catching the drama out of the corner of my eye as chad dragged santa into the back cant you bring the loonies in the rear door edden shrugged its too icy and wed get sued from my scarf jenks said and crashing into the door like that is soooo much safer resisting arrest with lots of witnesses he said id say thats safer then he tilted his head and peered at my scarf hi jenks i didnt see you kind of cold isnt it enough to freeze my balls together yeah jenks said peeking out at the sound of eddens louder voice you got anyplace warmer between the cold and rachels perfume id be more comfortable at a fairys bris the short man smiled and he extended a hand to take the banshee essay that id written for him in my copious spare time come on back sorry to make you wait here new rules new rules i thought sourly as i stood new rules or new mistrust old mistrust maybe given new life at least chad liked me no problem i said sourly not wanting to let him know how much it bothered me he knew it was there i knew it was there why rub my nose in it hows glenn doing has he regained consciousness yet edden had a hand on the small of my back and where id usually take offense he could get away with it edden was cool no he said his eyes down with a thought but hes doing better more brain activity once away from the cold draft jenks left my scarf and i nodded thinking i should go out and see glenn tonight after dinner id be ready for some silent company by then maybe tickle his feet until he woke up or peed his sheets or something i smiled at the thought almost missing it when edden made an unexpected left away from the interrogation rooms arent we going to the interrogation rooms i said and edden led me to his office no we cant find mia harbor my pace didnt slow but me cooling my heels in the lobby was making a lot more sense so much for the truth amulet stuffed in my bag jenks was starting to slip a thin trail of dust telling me he was warm and in good form she went awol the small pixy said flying backward to create a small commotion among the watching officers edden wasnt impressed with jenkss aerial display and he held the door to his office open and gestured for me to enter yup he said but he didnt follow me in she moved without filing her new address weve a warrant out for her arrest so if you want her shes all yours rachel a banshee i said laughing me how much money you got edden i dont do suicide runs edden tossed my essay on his desk hesitating as if trying to decide whether i was kidding you want some coffee he finally said how about you jenks i think i saw a honey packet from someones biscuits in the fridge hell yes he exclaimed before i could protest and edden nodded leaving the door open as he went in search of it i gave jenks a wry look as he buzzed over eddens office to check out the new bowling trophy spinning the chair around i plunked into it and set my bag at my feet i was really hoping youd be sober for this i said and jenks landed on eddens cluttered desk with his hands on his hips why he said unusually belligerent you dont need me if the banshee isnt here give me a break like ive been honey drunk any longer than five minutes i looked away in disapproval and he buzzed a harsh flight to eddens pencil cup to sulk crossing my knees i bobbed my foot i was waiting again but it was warmer quieter and i had the promise of coffee eddens office was a pleasant mix of organized clutter that i could identify with and was part of the reason i had taken to him so quickly last year the man was exmilitary but youd never know it by the dust and stacks of files still i bet he could put his finger on anything he wanted in three seconds flat the pictures on the walls were few but in one of them he was shaking hands with denon my old boss at the is it would worry me if i hadnt once heard the pleasure edden had taken in jerking a case out from under him the smell of old coffee seemed embedded in the gray tiles and institutionalyellow walls a new laptop sat open on his desk instead of a monitor and the clock that had once been behind him was now behind me otherwise it was the same as the last time i had sat here waiting for edden to bring me coffee i heard eddens footsteps before his bulky silhouette showed through the blinds between his office and the rest of the other offices all open the man came in with two china mugs instead of the expected foam ones new rules again one was clearly his by the brownstained rim i got the clean one with rainbows how sweet jenks rose up in a column of blue sparkles as edden sat behind his desk the pixy taking the packet almost as large as he was and retreating to a corner out of my reach thanks edden he said wrestling with the plastic to tear it open i leaned to shut the door with my foot and edden eyed me you have something to say in private rachel he asked and i shook my head taking the packet from jenks i tore it open and handed it back trust me i said thinking that having the harried fib officers deal with a drunk pixy was too much to ask for my reputation was bad enough as it was so i said to draw eddens attention from jenks who was humming happily and starting to list already one wing not fanning as fast as the other isnt a felony charge a little harsh for failure to register a new address eddens gaze darted from me to jenks and then back its not for failure to register its because shes a suspect s good honey eddie jenks interrupted and i set my coffee mug down loud enough to make his wings hum the banshee is a suspect i questioned why all she did was leave a tear edden leaned back in his chair and sipped his coffee alex took her photo out to the neighbors to see if she had been near the scene recently babysitter cosmetics lady whatever every single person asked idd ms harbor as mrs tilson what i yelped sitting up fast holy crap jenks swore almost crashing into the stack of files on eddens desk as he took flight with his honey packet the banshee took a humans name what the hell for my first wash of surprise ebbed into an uneasy answer and by looking at eddens severe face i knew he had the same idea mia had killed them and was trying to cover it up good god tom is trying to tag a banshee by himself go for it coffin bait that might explain why tom bansen was under our kitchen floor yesterday i said and edden started under your kitchen floor i finished all dressed up like a military guy on urbanassault detail bis and one of my friends caught him trying to bug the church why didnt you call me edden said and i made a face while jenks slurred something about the gargoyle because toms been ah shunned i said flushing no inderlander will hire him the is included he has no choice but to go independent bringing in a banshee will probably earn him enough money to get himself set up somewhere he can live his life out in the wilds he warned me off the case now that i think about it he told me specifically to stay away from mia he probably knows at least as much as we do then why bug you he asked and i shrugged because if hes been shunned he lacks the resources of both the fib and the is i guess he figured hed listen in to what we found and act on it before we did tom probably knows exactly where shes gone maybe i should try to bug him edden looked grim rubbing his mustache when i finally looked back want a car at your house immediately i shook my head no but one at my moms might be nice within the hour he promised the pen almost lost in his grip as he made a note jenks had started climbing eddens desk files like a drunken mountaineer and i blushed when i found out what happened on the tenth day of pixy christmas shaking off the visual i turned to edden if mia is mrs tilson we need to find her fast the man with her is in danger edden made an ugly sound and just about threw the pen in the cup i dont care hes liable to wind up dead i protested then took a sip of my coffee now that jenks wasnt hiding behind it my eyes closed in bliss for a moment id give the fib one thing they knew how to make coffee a banshees liveins never live long i said and if mia has a baby her emotion requirements will be almost triple i paused in my motion to take another drink that was probably why she had to put five years between her children eddens mustache was bunched up and his expression was hard im not concerned about mias accomplice he said he was healthy enough to beat up my son we pulled his record this morning by way of his fingerprints his name is remus and we would never have found him this fast but hes got a file thicker than my fist starting from high school with an attempted date rape up to about three years ago when he spent time in a psychiatric jail for an especially foul animalcruelty charge they let him out and he dropped off the face of the earth no credit card activity no rental history no w forms nothing until now so you can understand if i dont rush out and try to find him for the sake of his own health my stomach hurt god the two of them had probably killed the tilsons together they had killed those happy faces that were in that yearbook and taken their names their lives everything shoved what they didnt want into boxes in their garage jenks dropped the empty honey packet staggering under the desk lamp and staring up at it realizing that he was singing to it to get it to turn on i flicked the switch jenks exploded into gold sparkles and collapsed giggling my expression went blank he was stuck on the tenth day of christmas but finally he gave up and started singing about four purple condoms i looked at edden and shrugged maybe the little girl belongs to remus i said and edden jerked the topmost file out from under jenks the pixy rose three inches before falling down mumbling as he pillowed his head on his folded arms and fell asleep in the artificial warmth of the light edden handed me the file and i opened it what is this he leaned back to lace his hands over his middle everything we have on mia that baby makes her a lot easier to track without her remus wouldnt exist we found another licensed day care that mia frequents making four now and at least two more informal ones i leafed through the small packet to read the addresses impressed again with the fibs investigative techniques the day cares were mostly in ohio on cincys outskirts i called them all this morning edden said mia didnt show up anywhere yesterday and the one she was scheduled for was concerned apparently she always stays to help instead of paying them for care claiming that she wants holly to have more socialization skills no kidding i said eyebrows high i could buy that but not if she was taking her daughter to five other day cares to do the same thing no no no jenks slurred from under the glaring light his eyes werent open and i was surprised he was conscious enough to listen much less comment on the conversation kid isnt socializing the kid is sucking down emotion like his words trailed off in confusion and i offered a pixy with honey jenks cracked an eye and gave me a thumbsup yeah his eyes closed and he started to snore i didnt know why but i unwound my scarf and covered him embarrassment maybe edden was watching us with a questioning expression and i lifted a shoulder and let it fall mias probably trying to spread her daughters damage around edden made a noncommittal grunt and i continued to leaf through the information the neighbor kid who mowed their lawn said that mia told his mom she wanted a lot of kids but had to space them out five years apart i said that would go along with holly being a banshee you cant have two kids around like that hell a banshee usually has a kid once every hundred years or so so if mia is thinking another one in five years she must have a really good way to keep from killing people to support her daughters growth my words drifted to nothing either that or someone with her who knew how to abduct people in a way so that they never went reported as missing someone like a homicidal maniac capable of serial murders sort of like remussomeone who would enjoy hunting people and bringing them back for his wife and darling baby to drain that might be why remus was in good enough health to beat up an fib officer feeding his two tigers well enough that mia could plan on adding to her little family this was really not good edden was quietly waiting for me to come to just that conclusion and i closed the file numb and feeling sick i glanced at jenks out cold then to edden silently waiting im not doing this i said dropping the packet on his desk the draft shifted jenkss hair and the pixy grimaced in his drunken stupor banshees are dangerousapex predators and i thought you didnt want myexcuse meour help at my blatant accusation edden reddened who is going to bring her in then the is i talked to them this morning they dont care his eyes went everywhere but to mine if we dont bring her in no one will he muttered and he would want justice seeing that she had something to do with his son being in the hospital frowning i slid the file back off eddens desk and onto my lap but i didnt open it next question i said my tone clearly stating i wasnt taking the jobyet what makes you so sure the is isnt covering it up i wasnt about to get on the iss bad side for a paycheck id done that before and was smarter now yeah it had felt great showing up the is but then denon took my license and i was stuck riding the bus again eddens expression went tight what if they are my face scrunched up and i fingered the file yeah it left a bad taste in my mouth too according to the woman i talked to at the is edden said there should be a trail almost eighteen months long on this woman starting with several simultaneous deaths at the time of hollys conception and continuing on to today thats probably when the tilsons were murdered ms harbor is devious clever and has a tremendous knowledge of the city about the only thing going for us is that she wont leave cincinnati banshees are highly territorial and dependent upon the people theyve been siphoning off for generations i bobbed my foot and looked at the essay i had written why did you ask me to write this if you already knew it i asked my feelings hurt i didnt know it yesterday you were sleeping rachel edden said dryly then hid his slight guilt behind a sip of coffee i talked to audrey something or other in records this morning she was going to make me fill out a years worth of forms until i dropped your name a faint smile replaced his concern and i relaxed i know her i said you can trust what she said edden laughed making jenks mumble in his sleep especially after i promised youd babysit for her he ran a hand over his mustache to hide a smile she was kind of cranky you witches arent at your best before noon are you no i said then my smile faded audrey had three kids last i checked crap i was going to have to have jenks help me otherwise theyd railroad me into a closet or trick me into letting them eat candy audrey said mias net of people is probably so intricate that she cant risk leaving cincy if she does the deaths to support the baby will be fast and easy to find rather than the carefully chosen hidden ones he hesitated and a flash of worry for his son crossed his face is that true they already killed an fib officer that wasting disease was probably mia right he was too far away for me to reach out and touch his hand in support but i wanted to i really needed to visit glenn and look at his aura it wasnt as if i could help him but id like to know if thats why he was still unconscious edden im sorry i finally said glenn will be okay and we will find them they wont be allowed to think they can do this with impunity the older mans jaw clenched then relaxed i know i just wanted to hear from you that we have a chance and that they didnt hop a plane and are in mexico sucking the children there dry from under my scarf came a highpitched sigh and jenks mumbled on the eleventh day of christmas my lover gave to me i nudged the stack of files hush jenks i said then pulled my eyes to edden softening my gaze we will get them edden promise jenkss mumbling grew loud and i felt uneasy when i realized he was apologizing to matalina that was a hindsight better than what the drummers had been doing with the pipers pipes but his heartfelt whining was almost worse then youll help us edden asked rather unnecessarily i might add it was a banshee but with ivys helpand a lot of planningwe three could do it ill look into it i said trying to drown out jenkss vow that he would never touch honey again if she would get better this was getting depressing edden too was glancing at my scarf as he rummaged around in a top drawer he found what he was looking for and extended his fist palm down then you might need this he said and i reached for whatever it was the smooth feel of crystal fell into my palm and i jerked back heart pounding i stared at the opaque drop of nothing warming fast against my skin i waited for my hand to cramp up or the stone to feel fuzzy or move or something but it just sat there looking like a cheap foggy crystal that earth witches sell ignorant humans down at finley market where did you get this i asked feeling squeamish even as the tear did nothing is it one of mias it seemed to wiggle in my hand and it was all i could do not to drop it but then id have to tell him why and then he might take it back so i blinked at him my fingers going stiff in an open cradle we found a stash of them in a glass flower vase disguised as decorative stones edden said i thought you might be able to make one into a locator amulet it was a great idea and i dropped the crystal into my coat pocket deeming id held the squirmy thing long enough my held breath slipped from me and the hesitant almost belligerent embarrassment he was hiding gave me pause until i realized he had taken the tear from evidence ill give it a try i said and he grimaced eyes lowered i had to pick up my brother at the airport but i might be able to squeeze in a stop at the university library as well as a charm shop for jenks before that a locator charm was devilishly hard i honestly didnt know if i could pull it off the library would be the only place i could find the recipe well besides the internet but that was asking for trouble my scarf was now spouting poetry waxing lovingly about matalinas charms in beautifully poetic to downright lustful terms giving the stack of papers a push i flicked off the light jenks let out a long complaint and i stood come on mr honeypot i said to jenks we gotta go i flicked my scarf off him and the pixy didnt move apart from huddling into a ball edden stood up and together we eyed him i was starting to get a bad feeling about this usually when jenks got honey drunk he was a happy drunk this looked depressed and i felt my face lose its expression when i realized jenks was saying matalinas name over and over oh crap i whispered as he started making promises he couldnt keep asking her to make one she couldnt my own heart breaking i carefully scooped him up holding the unaware pixy in my hands cupping him in a soothing darkness and warmth damn it this wasnt fair no wonder jenks took the opportunity to get drunk his wife was dying and there was nothing he could do to stop it is he going to be all right edden whispered as i stood in front of the desk not knowing how i was going to get home with him like this i couldnt just shove him in my bag and hope for the best yes i said absently deep in thought edden shifted from foot to foot is his wife okay i brought my eyes up unshed tears for jenks warming them as i found a deep understanding in eddens gaze the understanding of a man who had lost his wife no i said pixies live only twenty years i could feel jenks light and warm in my hands and i wished he was bigger so i could just help him into the car take him home and cry with him on the couch but all i could do was carefully slide him into the masculine glove edden was holding out to me the lined leather would keep him warm whereas my scarf wouldnt jenks hardly noticed the move and i could get him to the car safely and in a dignified manner i tried to tell edden thanks but the words stuck in my throat instead i picked up the folder thanks for the addresses i said softly and i turned to go ill give them to ivy she can make sense out of rat tails in the dust edden opened the door and the noise of the open offices hit me like a slap jerking me back to reality i wiped my eyes and tugged my bag higher up on my shoulder i held eddens glove carefully ivy and i would map out mias network starting with the day cares then move on to see if she worked at elderly day care centers or volunteered at the hospital this could get really ugly there was a soft pull on my elbow as i rocked into motion and i paused edden had his eyes on the tile and i waited until he brought them to mine tell me when jenks needs someone to talk to he said and my throat closed recalling what ford had told me about eddens wife dying in a stabandgrab i mustered a smile and nodded my boots clicked fast on the tile as i made for the door head high and eyes unseeing i wondered if edden would talk to me next year when we went through the same ordeal with jenks seven the airport was noisy and i leaned against a support beam and tried not to fidget as i waited jenks and i had been here for nearly an hour but i was glad id gotten here early when security stopped me at the spellchecker gate it had either been my truth amulet or my lethalspell detector interfering with theirs because they were about the only invoked charms i had on me dumping out my bag for three uniformed stiffs to paw through was not my idea of how to meet guys jenks had thought it was hilarious no one else was getting searched the pixy was currently down the hall at the flower cart not a single indication that he had been honey drunk earlier he was working a deal with the owner for some fern seed if he could entice a few people to buy roses for their departing loved ones he had still been out cold when we passed the charm shop and i hadnt stopped either there or the library but if he could get the fern seed hed be a happy pixy it was cool in the drafty terminal but vastly warmer than the blue white and gray world outside the huge plateglass windows plows kept the runways clear and the mounds of snow at the outskirts just begged to be played on the people around me were a mix of hurried harassment bored irritation and anxious expectation i fell into the last and as i waited for robbies plane to clear checks and disembark i felt a shiver of anticipationthough some of that might have been lingering anxiety from having been stopped at the heavymagic detector witches had always worked in aviation both on the ground and in the air but during the turn theyd taken it over and hadnt given it back changing the laws until there had to be at least one highly qualified witch on duty at each security checkpoint even before the turn witches had been using heavymagic detectors right along with the mundane metal detectors what had looked like a random check on a harmlesslooking man or woman had often been a covert search for contraband magic why id been stopped i didnt know bothered i tried to smooth out my brow and relax unless robbie was in first class it would be a while a cloying toosweet scent of cinnamon and the rich aroma of coffee gave a glimmer of contentment to the rising excitement the conversations grew loud when the door opened and the first yawning person pushed through intent on reaching the rentacar stand his eyes glazed and his pace fast a few feet from me was a mom with three toddlers like stair steps probably waiting for their dad the eldest wiggled from his mom and ran for the huge windows and i jumped when the mom set a circle to stop the toddler dead in his tracks a smile curved over my face when the little boy screamed in frustration pounding at the faintly shimmering barrier glowing a thin blue that had been something id never had to worry about when i was little mom sucked dishwater at making circles i hadnt been able to walk until i was three anyway too sick to do much more than survive before then it was a miracle id made it past my second birthdayan illegal medical miracle that worried me every time i went through something like the heavymagic detection field there was no way to detect the tampering done to my mitochondria but i worried anyway anxious i shifted my weight to my other foot i was eager to see robbie but tonights dinner wasnt going to be fun at least id have marshal to take some of the heat off me the toddlers screaming shifted from frustration to recognition and i turned when his mother dropped her circle she was beaming looking absolutely beautiful despite the weariness of keeping three energetic children within societys norms i followed the toddler with my eyes as he ran to an attractive young woman in a smartlooking suit the woman bent to pick him up and the five of them came together in a wash of happiness they all began to move in a confused tangle and after a heartfelt kiss between the two women the one in the suit exchanged a trendy bag for a gurgling infant it looked noisy messy and utterly comforting my smile slowly faded as they moved away and my thoughts went to ivy wed never have such a recognizable relationship where we somehow fell into normal roles that could function within societys parameters not that i was looking for something so traditionally nontraditional ivy and i did have a relationship but if we tried to make it fit her ideas or go past my limits it would blow everything to hell something older than the spoken word tickled my instinct and i pulled my eyes from the couples vanishing backs my gaze landed on my brother and i smiled he was still in the tunnel obvious over the shorter people ahead of him his red hair stood out like a flag and he had a sparse beard sunglasses almost made him look cool but the freckles ruined it seeing his smile widen as our eyes met i pushed from the piling and waited anticipation tingling my toes god id missed him people finally moved out from between us and i could see his narrowshouldered frame he had on a light jacket and was carrying a shiny leather satchel and his guitar at the head of the tunnel he stopped and thanked a short awkwardlooking salesmantype guy who handed him a piece of luggage and vanished into the crowd carrying it for him so he wouldnt have to check it i suppose robbie i called unable to stop myself and his smile grew his long legs ate up the distance and he was before me dropping his things and giving me a squeeze hi sis he said his hug growing fierce before he let go and stepped back the crowd flowed around us but no one minded little pockets of reunion were going on all over the terminal you look good he said tousling my hair and earning a slug on his shoulder he caught my fist but not until after id connected and he looked at my hand smiling at the little wooden pinkie ring still not liking your freckles eh he said and i shrugged like i was going to tell him i didnt have freckles as the side effect of a demon curse instead i gave him another hug noticing that we were almost the same height with me in heels and him inloafers laughing i looked him up and down you are going to freeze your butt off outside yeah i love you too he said grinning as he removed his sunglasses and tucked them away cut me some slack it was seven in the morning and seventytwo degrees when i left i havent had any sleep but for four hours on the plane and im going to crash if i dont get some coffee in me he leaned to pick up his guitar mom still making that nasty excuse for road paste smiling as if i would never stop i picked up the larger bag remembering the last time id carried his luggage wed better stop and get some now besides im waiting for jenks to finish up with something and i want to talk to you about mom robbie straightened from trying to grip his satchel and guitar in the same hand his green eyes looking worried is she okay i stared for a moment then realized what my last words must have sounded like moms happier than a troll under a toll bridge what happened out there with you anyway she came back tan and humming show tunes whats up with that robbie took the bag from me and we angled to the nearest coffee stand it wasnt me he said it was her ah traveling companion my brow furrowed and my pulse quickened takata id thought as much shed gone out to the west coast to spend time with her college sweetheart and i wasnt sure what i thought about him i mean i knew who he was but i didnt know him silently we got in line and as i stood shoulder to shoulder with robbie i suddenly felt tall takata was birth father to both of us a college sweetheart who gave our mom the children her human husbandand takatas best friend incidentallycouldnt while takata ran off and traded his life for fortune and fame down to dying his hair and changing his name i couldnt think of him as dad my real dad had died when i was thirteen and nothing would change that but standing beside robbie now i snuck sidelong glances at him seeing the older rocker in him hell i could look in the mirror and see takata in me my feet robbies hands my nose and both our heights definitely my hair takatas might be blond where mine was red but it curled the same way robbie turned from the overhead menu and gave me a sideways hug dont be mad at him he said instinctively knowing where my thoughts were hed always been able to do that even as kids which had been really frustrating when i was trying to get away with something hes good for her he added shoving his luggage farther along the line shes moving past the guilt of dad dying i uh spent some time with them he said nervousness making his words soft he loves her and she feels special with him im not mad at him i said then smacked his shoulder just hard enough to make him notice im mad at you why didnt you tell me takata was our dad the businessman in front of us turned around briefly and i made a face at him robbie moved forward another foot right he murmured like im going to call you up and tell you our mom was a groupie i made a scoffing noise thats not what happened he looked at me and made his eyes wide it makes more sense than what did happen for christs sake you would have laughed your ass off if i had told you our real dad was a rock star then you would have asked mom and then she would havecried cried i thought nice of him to not say go off her rocker because thats what she would have done it had been bad enough when the truth came out a sigh shifted my shoulders and i scooted forward to the counter when the guy ahead of us ordered his tall latte something or other and moved off ill have a grande latte double espresso italian blend robbie said his eyes on the menu light on the froth heavy on the cinnamon can you make that with whole milk the barista nodded as he wrote on the paper cup this together he asked looking up yeah um just give me a mediumsize cup of the house blend i said suddenly disconcerted i couldnt be sure but i thought that robbies order had sounded exactly like how minias took his coffee you want a shot of something in it the barista persisted and i shook my head as i ran my card through the machine before robbie could just black robbie was struggling with his stuff so i grabbed both cups when they came up and followed him to a table too small and sticky to encourage anything but the shortest of stays i can carry stuff now i said as i watched him stagger under it he gave me a sideways smile not while im around sit so i sat and it felt good as he bustled about arranging his things and asking an old couple if he could have one of their chairs i had a moment of panic when i realized the abandoned paper on the table was folded to show that shot of the tilsons house snatching it up i jammed it in my bag just as robbie joined me landing heavy in his chair he took the lid off his coffee and inhaled his first deep sniff followed by a deep draft thats good he said around a sigh and i followed suit for a moment he was silent and then he eyed me expectantly over his paper rim so hows mom the businessman who had been ahead of us had foam on his nose as he stood and looked at the departure screens fine robbie silently cracked his knuckles do you have anything to say to me he asked so smugly that i turned to look at him theres a cop car outside moms house and youll want to know why im doing a murder investigation and it might spill over into my home life the university wont let me attend classes i have a date every saturday in the everafter with big al the demon and thanks to trent kalamacks dad im the source of the next demon generation uh no i said and he laughed scooting his guitar closer you bailed on the is he said green eyes showing his amusement i told you joining them was a bad idea but nooooo my little sister has to do things her way then work twice as hard to get out of them im proud of you for realizing it was a mistake by the way oh that relieved i took the lid off my coffee and blew across the top of the rich blackness giving him a sideways look bailed wouldnt quite be the word i would use stupidly quit might be more appropriate or attempted suicide thanks i managed though what i wanted to do was start a tirade about how it hadnt been a mistake in the first place see i can learn they arent still after you are they he asked glancing to the side and shifting uncomfortably i shook my head and his long face became relievedapart from a remaining hint of caution good he took a deep breath working for them was too dangerous anything could have happened and usually did i thought as the first hot sip of coffee slipped down and i closed my eyes in bliss like what im doing now is that safe i said as my eyes opened jeez robbie im twentysix i can take care of myself im not the puny ninetypound nothing i was when you left it might have been a tad harsh but the resentment of his trying to stop me from going into the is remained all i meant was that the people who run it are liars and corrupt vamps he cajoled it wasnt just the danger you would never have been taken seriously there rachel witches never are you hit that glass ceiling and there you sit for the rest of your life i would have gotten mad but looking in hindsight at the last year i spent at the is i knew he was right dad didnt do too bad i said he could have done a lot more actually he had done a lot more robbie didnt know it but our dad had probably been a mole in the is passing information and warnings to trents dad crap i thought in sudden realization just like francis no not like francis francis had done it for money dad must have done it for the greater good which begged the question of what hed seen in the elves to risk his life helping them stay out of extinction it hadnt been in return for the illegal medicine to save my life they had been friends even before i was born rachel i took another sip of my coffee scanning the busy terminal for jenks a sense of unease was growing in me and i almost choked on my drink when i spotted the security guard looking at us from across the hall just standing there watching this keeps getting better and better earth to rachelcome in rachel i gave myself a mental shake and pulled my gaze from the air cop sorry what he looked me up and down you got quiet all of a sudden i forced my eyes to stay off the armed guard another one had joined him just thinking i hedged robbie looked into his coffee thats a switch he needled but there were three rentacops now two i could handle but three was iffy where are you jenks i wanted to get out of here and i pretended to accidentally knock my coffee over whoops i exclaimed brightly and while robbie jumped up to avoid getting soaked i scurried for the napkins to get a better look at the terminal police two weres i thought and a witch they had joined forces and were making their slow way over here shit think you can walk and drink at the same time i muttered to robbie when i returned and started mopping up the mess we need to find jenks and get out of here the cops he said and my eyes jerked to his in surprise you didnt have to waste good coffee like that to get me to move you know i said and he grimaced his green eyes showing more than a hint of anger theyve been dogging me since i got to the airport he said his lips barely moving as he put the lid on his cup and hoisted his bag i was all but stripsearched at security and i swear the air marshal was sitting beside me on the plane what did you do little sister me i almost hissed peeved that his first thought was that they were after me i wasnt the one who played in brimstonelaced dives and went on seasonlong tours moving to a new city every night no i just stayed in little old cincinnati bumping into city leaders the way most people run into their neighbors at the grocery store can we just get out of here i said thinking this might explain why id been searched on the way in robbie made a noise of agreement and as i shouldered one of his bags and picked up his instrument he handed me his coffee and took his guitar back you break things he said in explanation and the strap slipped from my grip the cops swaggered behind us as we headed to the luggage claim and it gave me the creeps robbie was silent until we hit one of the moving sidewalks and in the soft hum of it he pulled me close and whispered are you sure the is isnt still after you for quitting positive i insisted but i was starting to wonder i was working on a twin murder involving a banshee and a human edden said they didnt care about mia but what if they were covering something up not again i thought dismally but they would have sent denon to threaten me by now maybe hed gotten a promotion instead the last time id seen the ghoul hed looked better we were nearing the end of the sidewalk and robbie hoisted his bag higher in such a way that he could glance at the armed men behind us the twenty feet had become fifteen and i was getting edgy jenkss distinctive wing chirp pulled my attention to a flower cart and seeing him busy i pointed to the baggage claim then jerked my head behind me he made a burst of light in acknowledgment which delighted the woman with him and we continued on jenks robbie said softly thats your backup right yes i frowned as i shifted robbies bag to a more comfortable position youll like him hes getting something for his wife i dont know why those guys are following us youre not trying to get out of dinner tonight are you robbie said loudly as we got off the walk and i forced a laugh maybe i said willing to play along i have a few things i have to do ive got a library book to return and a sick friend in the hospital i want to visit tonight dont you dare robbie said for the benefit of security as we slowed to funnel through a small hallway by the security gates i need you there as a buffer in case mom gets the photo albums out i smirked knowing exactly what he meant mmmm you should have brought cindy with you im bringing someone tonight not fair he exclaimed as we passed into the unsecured part of the airport and i glanced behind us to see that our escort had dropped to one thank god its the witch one witch i can handle even without jenks yes fair i said as i pointed to the hallway we had to take his name is marshal and he works at the university as a swim coach he helped me once on a run and hes the first guy ive ever hung with who isnt trying to get a little something so be nice robbie eyed me as we got on the escalator hes not i looked over at his hesitation to see him holding the moving railing with his pinkie delicately extended and i smiled with half my mouth no hes straight i can be with a straight guy whos single and not sleep with him god well ive never seen it robbie said and i shoved him burning off a little of the adrenaline from the three security guys hey he exclaimed goodnaturedly catching himself in time to handle the end of the escalator with no problem we were silent as we scanned the monitors for his flight number and carousel then slowly joined the growing group of people angling for a good spot any day jenks you still living in that church my blood pressure spiked and i dropped his bag with a thump with that vampire yes how does he hit my buttons so fast his gaze on the bags spilling out one by one robbie made a noise deep in his throat what does mom think im sure youll hear all about it tonight i said tired already actually my mom was pretty cool about it and with marshal there she might not bring it up at all there it is robbie blurted out saving me from further conversation and then his expression became concerned i think its mine he added and i dropped back when he wedged himself between two shorter women to lug the rolling suitcase off the belt the clatter of pixy wings and the soft sound of cooing people told me jenks was around and i wound my scarf around my neck to give him a place to warm up the lights had been bright around the flower cart but it was drafty here by the doors hi rache jenks said as he landed on my shoulder with the scent of cheap fertilizer get what you want i asked as robbie lugged his rolling suitcase off the belt no he said and i could hear the annoyance in his voice everything had a waxy preservative on it why by tinks little red shoes are three cops following you i have no idea robbie trundled his suitcase to us his head down and looking annoyed hey robbie i want you to meet jenks my business partner i said as my brother halted before us disgust clear in the way he yanked the pull lever up someone broke the lock on my suitcase he said then forced the irritation from his face when jenks flew down to look at it yep the pixy said hovering before it with his hands on his hips then darting up making robbies head snap back its a pleasure to finally meet you jenks said youre the one keeping my sister out of trouble robbie said as he offered jenks a hand to light upon his smile honest and full thanks i owe you big naahh jenkss wings turned a delicate shade of red even as they hummed to life shes not that hard to watch its my kids who run me ragged robbie sent his eyes to me then back to jenks youve got kids you dont look old enough almost four dozen he said justifiably proud that he could keep that many children alive lets get out of here before cookiefarts over there starts to have delusions of grandeur and tries to search your underwear again lips parted i glanced at the security cop standing thirty feet backsmiling at me what in hell was going on you want to see if anything is gone i asked no he frowned at the busted lock jenks is right theres nothing in there but clothes and a half ream of music i know jenks said i was listening to the radio chatter at the flower cart i should have guessed it was you they were talking about rache did you hear why theyre watching us i asked heart pounding is it the is jenks shook his head they didnt say if you go for another coffee i can find out i looked at robbie in a question but he was shifting uneasily from foot to foot i glanced at the security guy now standing with his arms crossed over his chest as if begging me to complain no robbie said as he started gathering his things its not worth it where are you parked idaho i quipped but inside i was getting upset why did they search my brothers bag if im the one theyre watching sotell me about cindy i asked as we neared the big glass doors jenks dove for my scarf as they slid open and we went out into the bright but cold afternoon robbies face lost its uneasy expression beaming as he launched into a stream of happy conversation as id hoped he would i made the right sounds at the right times almost having to force my interest in his girlfriend as robbie and i found our way to my car all the way to the lot i scanned faces watched the horizon checked behind me and breathed deep for the distinctive scent of were vampire or witch while trying to pretend everything was normal and keeping up my end of the conversation about new bands and what id been listening to though still uptight i breathed easier when we got to my car and found that denon wasnt waiting for me it helped that my badmojo amulet on my key ring stayed a nice bright green clearly glad to be going home robbie continued to chat while we loaded his bags in the back and bundled into the front seat i cranked the heater on full for jenks who immediately started cussing about perfume and left me to settle on robbies shoulder i think it was more because my vastly underdressed brother had angled all the vents toward himself than my perfume the conversation bobbled when robbie noticed the lethalmagic detection charm hanging from my keys he knew what it washed watched our dad prep for work tooand though his face creased in concern because his little sister had to have an amulet to warn her of car bombs he didnt say anything it wasnt until we hit the expressway and started for home that i began to relax but all the while i was checking my rearview mirror for the flashing of is lights and thinking am i coming too close again to one of their coverups and if i am am i going to back off or bust it open once more eyes squinting because of the bright sun as much as my sour mood i recalled the look of anger on robbies face when he saw that his stuff had been pawed through and i decided that yup i was going to crack it open and let the sun shine in eight the draft from the heater made my curls tickle my neck as i sat at ivys antique table and looked through one of my dads old demon texts for a recipe for twisting a locator amulet a curse to be excruciatingly honest jenks was reading over my shoulder hovering an irritating two feet up i dont think he was pleased that even though id found a locatoramulet recipe in my safely mundane earthmagic books i was still looking most detecting charms be they earth or ley line magic were sympathetic magicusing something you have to detect whatever it is youre interested in car bombs shoplifters listening devices whatever earthmagic locator charms however worked by finding auras over long distances it was very sophisticated magic and i was hoping that the demons had an easier version chances were good they did id escaped my moms about an hour before claiming i had work to do and promising that id be back at midnight robbie hadnt said anything to mom about the airport cops but i was still peeved his stuff had been searched worried really but i handled anger better than fear the sun was going down now and a dark gloom had taken the kitchen past the blue curtains the sky was a dull gray and wanting to get jenks off my shoulder i stood open book tingling in my hand as i went to thunk on the rocker switch by the archway jenkss wings hummed as bright fluorescent light flickered into existence and i shuffled to the center counter the curse book thumped down and still not looking up from the pages i crossed my ankles and leaned over the book using the end of a pencil to turn the page id like to say that the book was cold from having been in the unheated belfry but i knew better jenks buzzed closer his wings managing to sound disapproving rex watched from the threshold her ears pricked and the little bell jenks had put on her last fall gleaming id try to coax her in but i knew better the only reason she was here was jenks hovering an inch above the yellow pages jenks put his hands on his hips and looked at me i couldnt help but notice that the dust he was letting slip was making the handpenned words glow interesting raaaache jenks drawled in warning im just looking i said waving him off before turning another page demon books didnt have indexes most didnt have titles i was reduced to browsing it made for slow going especially since i was one to linger curious as to how bad a bad curse could be or how neutral some of them were some were easy to tell by just the ingredients but others seemed to be a curse only because of the mixing of earth and ley line magic that all demon curses contained they were black only because they threw natures book so far out of balance i was hoping the demon equivalent of a locator charm was one of these i had decided last year that i wasnt going to avoid twisting a demon curse solely on the basis of the smut id been given a brain and i was going to use it unfortunately the rest of society might not agree with me jenks apparently wanted to play the part of jiminy cricket and he was reading the pages as carefully as i thats an excellent one he said sounding almost reluctant to admit it as he dusted the curse that detailed out how to twist a broomsticksize rod of redwood into flight there was an earth charm to do the same thing but it was twice as complicated id priced it out last year deciding the only flying this little witch was going to do would be in the seat of an airplane mmmm i said turning the page i could pay my rent for a year for just what the stick costs the next page was a curse to turn human flesh into wood yuck jenks shivered and i turned the page sending his blue sparkles sifting to the floor like i said some of these were really easy to tell they were black rachel jenks coaxed clearly thrown im not doing that one so relax his wings buzzed fitfully and he sank an inch in height preventing me from easily turning the page exhaling i stared at him to get him to move by my will alone crossing his arms over his chest he stared right back he wasnt going to give an inch but when two of his kids in front of the dark kitchen window started arguing over a seed theyd found in a crack in the floor the distraction lifted him up enough so that i could turn the page my fingertips resting on the faded yellow pages were going numb and i curled them into a fist but my heart started beating faster when i thought i recognized what was a locator charm under them if i was reading it right the demon curse used sympathetic magic like a detection spell not auras like regular locator charms though a curse the magic before me looked a hell of a lot easier than the aurabased one in the earthmagic book all the better to tempt you with my dear hey look at this i said softly as jenks gave a warning chirp to his offspring to settle their argument together we read through the ingredients the attunement object has to be stolen i questioned not liking that so it was no surprise that i jumped when the front doorbell rang hands on his hips jenks alternated his stern gaze between me and his two children their faces red and wings dusting a black haze into the sink ill get it he said before i could move and you two better have this decided before i get back or ill decide it for you he added to his kids before he darted out their volume dropped and i smiled it was almost six which meant human or witch possibly were or a living vampire if its a client ill see them in the sanctuary i called after him not wanting to have to hide my books if they should peek into my kitchen on the way to the back living room gotcha jenks shouted faintly rex had run off under him her tail up ears pricked and little bell jingling the two pixies at the window started right back up again their hushed high voices almost worse than their loud ones i gave a last look at the curse before i marked the page and closed the book i had everything i needed but the identifying object in this case the crystal tear had to be stolen that was kind of nasty but i wouldnt go so far as to say that made it a black curse earth magic had a few ingredients like that rue for example worked best when it was sown while cursing and it didnt work in a charm unless you stole it which was why mine was planted by the gate for easy pilfering jenks stole mine for me i didnt ask from where the charms made from stolen rue were not considered black so would this one be standing i crossed the room to my coat for the tear edden had given me he had stolen it from evidence wondering if that was enough i pulled the tear out shocked to see that it had lost its clarity and had turned black whoa i whispered and i looked up as fords voice became obvious in the hall immediately i looked at the clock six crap id forgotten he was coming over today i was in no mood for his mumbo jumbo especially if it worked ford came in with a tired smile his dull dress shoes making wet spots as they lost the last of their snow rex trailed behind with feline interest sniffing at the saltandwater mix a mess of jenkss kids were with him all talking in a swirl of silk and pixy dust fords brow was creased in pain and they were clearly sending him into overload hi rachel he said taking off his coat in such a way that it made half the pixies retreat but they came right back whats this about you being followed at the airport i gave jenks a dark look and he shrugged gesturing for ford to sit i dropped the demon book on the stack id brought down from the belfry and wiped my hands on my jeans they were just harassing me i said not knowing how my brother fit into it but sure it was me they were after not him hey what do you think about this it was clear this morning when edden gave it to me ford sat at ivys spot and held out his hand shaking his head when a trio of pixy girls asked him if they could braid his hair i shooed them away when i came around the counter to give the tear to him and the girls flitted to the windowsill to take sides in the seed issue tinks tampons jenks yelped when he saw the tear on fords palm what did you do to it rache nothing at least it hadnt felt furry or wiggled when i touched it ford squinted as he held it to the artificial light the argument at the sink was starting to spill into the rest of the room and i gave jenks a pointed look the pixy though was with ford fascinated by the black swirls running through the gray crystal edden gave it to me to make a locator charm i said but it didnt look like that it must have picked up the emotions at the airport when they were following us ford looked at me over the tear you got angry well a little i was more peeved than anything else jenks darted to the window as the argument reached an eyeballhurting intensity peeved nothing she was like a pimple on a fairy princesss ass red and ready to pop he said then started speaking to his kids too fast for me to follow instant pixy silence ensued jeez jenks i exclaimed warming i wasnt that upset ford shifted the tear back and forth between his fingers it must have absorbed the emotions from not only you but everyone there he hesitated then added did the teartake your emotions away seeing his hope i shook my head he thought it might be a way to help him muffle emotions perhaps no i said sorry leaning across the corner of the table ford handed the tear back doing a pretty good job of hiding his disappointment well he said settling into ivys chair and pulling rex onto his lap im on the clock where would you be most comfortable cant we just have coffee instead i suggested as i tucked the tear back in my coat pocket for lack of anywhere better im not in the mood to try to remember kistens killer stupid cat wont let me touch her but a perfect stranger gets head butts and kitty kisses his dark eyes went to the silent coffeemaker like anyone ever is he said softly ford i whined and then one of the pixy kids shrieked ford shuddered and turned a shade whiter irritated i looked at jenks jenks can you get your kids out of here theyre giving me a headache jumoke gets the seed jenks said flatly cutting off the rising protests with a sharp wing chirp i said you wouldnt like it he exclaimed get out jumoke ask your mother where she hides her seeds it will be safe there until spring it also would ensure that she wouldnt die without someone else knowing where she hid their valuable seed stash pixy life spans sucked thanks papa the exuberant pixy shouted then fled trailing the rest of them in a calliope of sound and color relieved i came around the counter to sit at my spot ford looked better already and he shifted to a more comfortable position when rex followed the pixies out jenks dropped down before him in his best peter pan pose hands on his hips sorry he said they wont come back ford glanced at the coffeemaker again one of them is still in here i shoved the demon texts next to the mundane university textbooks to make some space cheeky bugger i muttered standing up to get ford a coffee jenkss brow furrowed and he made a harsh whistle smirking i waited to see who the eavesdropping pixy was but no one showed maybe i could fritter all our time away and that would be that talk about jenks maybe thanks rachel ford said with an exhale i could use some caffeine its real yes pouring a cup i slid it into the microwave and hit fast cook decaf is cruel and unusual punishment jenks was buzzing around the kitchen like a firefly from hell shedding sparkles to make artificial sunbeams i cant find anyone he grumbled i must be getting old are you sure ford cocked his head and seemed to be listening yup its a person a smile came over jenks as the sensitive man included pixies as people not everyone did ill go do a nose count be right back he zipped out and i opened the nuker fords cup was steaming and leaning close as i set it by him i whispered can we go out and talk about jenks instead of me why ford asked as if knowing i was stalling then took a sip his emotions are stable its yours that are jumping like bunnies in a fryer i frowned at the connotation then sat in my own chair pulling my cold coffee close its matalina i said softly hoping the eavesdropper couldnt hear much less jenks ford set his mug down but his fingers didnt leave it seeking the warmth rachel he said even more softly i dont mean to sound trite but death comes to everyone and he will find a way to deal with it everyone does my head went back and forth and i felt a sliver of fear thats just it i said hes not human or witch or vampire hes a pixy when she dies he might go with her will himself to death it was a wildly romantic notion but i had a feeling it was standard pixy fare he has too much to live for fords knobby fingers tightened on the porcelain then released you the firm his children then his eyes lost their focus maybe you can ask one of his kids if thats common im afraid to i admitted there was the buzz of jenkss wings darting past the arch as he went into the living room and fords expression became neutral whats this edden was saying about marshal catching someone under your church i rolled my eyes tom bansen formerly of the is arcane division was bugging the church marshal was returning the box i forgot in his car and he caught him i managed a smile despite the pang of hurt from what id asked marshal to throw away marshal is coming to dinner tonight with my mom and brother mmmm it was long and drawn out and i brought my gaze up to see the usually stoic fib psychologist wearing a wan smile whats that supposed to mean mmmm i said tartly ford sipped from his mug his dark brown eyes twinkling deviously youre taking someone to meet the family its good to see you moving forward im proud of you i stared at him then laughed he thought marshal and i marshal and me i said with a guffaw no way hes coming over as a buffer so i dont walk out of there tonight facing a blind date with my moms paperboy marshal was great yeah but it was also nice knowing i could leave things alone if i tried right his voice dripped disbelief and i set my mug down marshal is not my boyfriend we just do stuff together so no one hits on either of us its nice and comfortable and im not going to let you turn it into anything more with your psychobabble bull ford placidly arched his eyebrows at me and i stiffened when jenks zipped in and said you musta hit pretty close to the mark there sheriff to get her riled up like that hes just a friend i protested relenting ford dropped his eyes and shook his head thats how good relationships start rachel he said fondly look at you and ivy i felt the muscles in my face go slack and i blinked excuse me youve got a great relationship there he said busying himself with his coffee again better than a lot of married couples i see sex ruins it for some people im glad youre learning that you can love someone without having to prove it with sex uh yeah i said uneasily hey let me top your coffee off there i could hear him shift as i turned my back on him and went to get the carafe and he wanted to put me under hypnosis no freaking way he knew too much about me already ford jenks said gruffly your spider sense is whacked all my kids are accounted for maybe its bis he looked at the corners bis you in here i smiled as i poured half a cup into fords mug not while the sun is up hes not i saw him on the front eave when i went out for the paper this afternoon taking a sip of coffee ford smiled there are three emotion sets in this room other than mine someones nose got counted twice look its okay he added when jenks started dripping green sparkles forget about it the soft strains of zz tops sharp dressed man drifted into existence muffled but annoying it was fords phone and i eyed him with interest thinking it an odd sort of tune for the straitlaced guy but then my lips parted when i realized it was coming from my bag my phone but i knew id had it on vibrate at the very least it wouldnt be playing that song cripes jenks i said scrambling for my bag will you leave my phone alone i havent touched your phone he said belligerently and dont be blaming it on my kids either i bent their wings back last time and they all said it wasnt them i frowned wanting to believe him unless it was general nuisance jenkss kids usually didnt make the same mischief twice dropping my bag on my lap i pulled out my phone finding the call to be from an unlisted number then why does it keep going off vibrate i almost died of embarrassment the night i tagged trent flipping it open i managed a courteous hello jenks landed on fords shoulder smiling it started playing white wedding ford laughed and i pulled the phone from my ear there was no one there clicking through the menu i put it on vibrate leave it alone i growled and it went off again jenks i exclaimed and the pixy flew up to the ceiling grinning from ear to ear its not me he chimed out but he was having too much fun for me to believe him it wasnt worth trying to catch him so i dropped the phone in my bag and let it ring ford was very still and a wave of apprehension swept me at the look in his eyes scared almost someone else is in this room he said softly and jenkss laughter cut off i watched as ford pulled out his amulet it was a swirl of emotions confusing and chaotic no wonder he liked to work one on one both of you go back by the fridge he said and it was as if the warmth left my body shit what in hell is going on go he said waving and i stood up totally creeped out maybe its a demon i thought not really here but here on the other side of the everafter looking at us with his second sight the sun wasnt down yet but it was close jenks silently landed on my shoulder and we backed up until the amulet shifted to a frustrated black and he or she is extremely frustrated ford said mildly he i think i didnt believe this how could he be so calm you sure it isnt a pixy i almost whined and when ford shook his head i asked is it a demon fords amulet flashed a confused orange maybe ford offered and when the amulet turned the purple of anger he shook his head not a demon i think you have a ghost what jenks yelped the burst of yellow pixy dust settling onto the floor to slowly fade how come we didnt know before weve been here a year we do live next to a graveyard i looked over my kitchen feeling it was alien suddenly damn it i should have gone with my first gut feelings when i saw the tombstones this wasnt right and my knees werent feeling all that sturdy a ghost i stammered in my kitchen then my heart did a flipflop and my gaze shot to my demon library down from the belfry is it my dad i shouted ford put a hand to his head back up back up he cried youre too close heart pounding i looked at the eight feet between us and pressed into the fridge i think he meant for the ghost to back up jenks said dryly my knees started to shake this is freaking me out jenks i dont like it yeah jenks said like im all peach fuzz and nectar here fords expression eased and the amulet around his neck went a sorrowful brown tinged with the red of embarrassment hes sorry ford said gaze unfocused as he concentrated he didnt mean to scare you a smile came over him unusually soft he likes you i blinked and jenks started to swear in onesyllable sentences in a way that only a pixy can manage likes me i stammered then got the willies oh god i moaned ive got a peeping tom of a ghost who is it the amulet went entirely red ford looked down at it as if needing confirmation id say not a peeping tom im getting that hes frustrated benevolent and hes starting to feel better now that you know hes here fords eyes slid to my bag ten to one hes the person who has been changing your ring tones i fumbled for a chair yanked it to the fridge and sat down but my phone has been doing this since the fall i said looking at jenks for confirmation months anger started trickling in hes been here all that time spying on me again the amulet went an embarrassed red hes been trying to get your attention ford said gently as if the ghost needed an advocate i put my elbows on my knees and dropped my head into my hands swell clearly frustrated jenks landed on the sill beside his brine shrimp tank who is it he demanded ask him his name emotions jenks ford said not words taking a calming breath i looked up well if its not my dad i went cold kisten i warbled feeling my entire world take a hit god if it was kisten there was a spell to talk to the dead who were stuck in purgatory but kistens soul was gone or was it ford seemed to waver and i held my breath no he finally said and the amulet swirled with black and purple i ah dont think he liked kisten jenks and i exhaled together and ford straightened in his chair i didnt know what i was feeling relief disappointment sir ford said to a corner in the kitchen and my skin crawled think about your contact to this plane ah that would be rachel probably again i held my breath jenks was shedding gold sparkles colors shifted across fords amulet but i didnt know enough to interpret them when they were all mixed up like that im feeling the excitement of a past danger shared ford said softly of fondness gratitude heavy gratitude to you his eyes opened and i stifled a shiver at the alien look in them they were his but they carried the shadow of the soul of the person he was picking up on have any of your clients died ford asked someone you were trying to help brett jenks said peter i blurted out but the amulet went a negative gray nick jenks said nastily and the color on the metal disk became a violent shade of purple ford blinked trying to divorce himself from the hate id say no he whispered this was really weird whoever it was knew my old boyfriends my eyes closed in a wash of guilt i had known a lot of people who were now dead i was a freaking albatross rachel it was gentle and caring and i opened my eyes to find ford looking at me with compassion you are worthy of accepting love he said and i flushed stop eavesdropping on me i mumbled and jenkss wings hummed an agitated whisper the ghost thinks so too ford added i swallowed a lump are you sure it isnt my dad fords smile turned benevolent its not your dad but he does want to protect you hes frustrated watching you these pastmonths and being unable to help i let out my breath in a huff jenkss wings hit a higher pitch and he took to the air great i really needed another white knight not who is it jenks said almost angry then in a burst of sparkles that rivaled the lights he shouted rache wheres your ouija board i stared at the wildly darting pixy then understanding what he wanted to do i shuffled through ivys papers for the back of one she wouldnt miss i dont have one i said turning over a handdrawn map of the conservatory and writing out the alphabet in big bold letters they give me the creeps feeling lightheaded i pushed the handdrawn alphabet in front of ford and backed up ford gave me a wondering look and i said run your finger under the letters when you feel a positive emotion thats the first letter of his name i looked at the emptyseeming kitchen okay the amulet went gold in affirmation and i sat down to hide my shaking knees this was really really weird id say hes okay with that but ford looked uneasy for the first time with a single finger he began at a running over them with a deliberate slowness i watched as he paused at one then backed up p ford said my thoughts flashed to peter then piscary one dead the other really dead both impossible but what if it was peter he was living as an undead but if his soul was in purgatory and i could get it into his body would he be whole was this ivys answer i licked my lips and watched ford reach the end of the alphabet and start over i he said then hesitated yes i my exhale was long not peter then but piscary ford had said the ghost was benevolent and the vampire hadnt been unless it was a trick or piscary had been a good man before hed become a vampire did their souls renew themselves at death not disintegrate revert to a state before everything went wrong ford reached the end and started again e he said looking as if he was more relaxed not piscary then and i felt better pie jenks said snidely did you kill a baker we dont know about rachel i leaned forward breathless shut up jenks fords finger stopped again almost immediately r he said and i felt myself go cold then hot no freaking way oh my god i shouted jumping to my feet jenks hit the ceiling at my outburst and ford covered his ears eyes closed in pain i know who it is i exclaimed eyes wide and my heart pounding i could not believe it i could not freaking believe it but it had to be him rachel jenks was in my face shedding gold sparkles stop youre killing ford knock it off his hand to his head ford smiled its okay he said grinning this is good stuff from both of you wonder filled me and i shook my head as i looked around my kitchen unbelievable i whispered then more loudly said where are you i thought you were at peace i stopped hands falling to my side disappointed somehow wasnt saving sarah enough ford was leaning back in his chair grinning as if he was witnessing a family reunion but jenks was pissed who the hell are you talking to rache tell me or im going to pix you so help me tink hand gesturing at nothing i stood in the middle of my kitchen still not believing it pierce i said and fords amulet glowed its pierce nine the dusty box my mom had brought over last fall was pretty much empty there was a scarily small tshirt from disneyland some bricabrac my old diary which i had started some time after my dad died and i realized pain could be remade once you gave it the permanence of words the books that had once filled the box were now in the kitchen but the eighthundredlevel ley line arcane textbook robbie had given me for the winter solstice hadnt been among them i hadnt thought it was here but i had wanted to check before i went over to my moms and got her stirred up by looking for it in her attic it had to be somewhere but it wasnt in my closet and sitting back on my heels i pushed a long curl out of my eyes and exhaled gazing at the singlepaned nightdarkened stainedglass window my bedroom had without the book i had no hope of recreating the spell id done eight years ago to give a spirit in purgatory a temporary body i was missing a few hardtofind ley line tools as well not to mention that the charm needed a whopping big boost of communal energy being at the closing of the circle at fountain square on the solstice would do it i knew that from experience but the solstice was come and gone i was banned from the howlers arena so that was out even if they did have a game in the snow new years was my next best bet they didnt close the circle but there would be a party and when people started singing auld lang syne the energy flowed i had three days to find everything it didnt look good well tink loves a duck i said and jenks resting on my dresser among my perfumes buzzed his wings the pixy hadnt left my side since finding out we had a ghost i thought it was funny pierce had been here almost a year why it bothered jenks now i had no idea though our hour had come and gone ford was still in the kitchen slowly talking to pierce one letter at a time as i listened in while whipping up a batch of earthmagic locator amulets the demon curse would have been easier but i wasnt going to twist demon magic in front of ford i had a bad feeling id done the complex charm wrong since nothing happened when i invoked the first potion with a drop of my blood and spilled it on the amulet mia was probably outside the quartermile radius within which it worked but i shouldve smelled something you think the book is still at your moms jenks asked his wings a blur though his butt was still settled on my dresser the sound of his kids playing with rex was loud and i wondered how long the cat would last before she hid from them ill find out tonight i said firmly as i refolded the box and shoved it into a pile of boots i must have left it at moms when i moved out i said around a stretch to get the kinks out of my back its probably in the attic along with the stuff to do it i hope i stood glancing at my alarm clock i was meeting marshal at his apartment in less than an hour and from there we were driving to my moms so it would look more like a date finding an excuse to get up into the attic might be hard but marshal could help i didnt want to ask my mom about the book the first time id used it id gotten in major trouble with the is hands on my hips i gazed at the unusual sight of the back of my closet shoes and boots were everywhere and the thought of newt possessing me clearing out my closet in the search for her memory rose up suddenly nervous i shoved the box away and began carefully putting my boots back jenks took to the air his legs unfolding to reach the top of the dresser and his face tight with worry why do you want to give him a body anyway you dont even know why hes here how come ford hasnt asked him that huh hes been spying on us wondering where that had come from brought my head up jenks hes been dead for a hundred years why would pierce be spying on us i huffed nudging the last of my boots into line if hes not spying on us then why is he here jenks asked arms crossed belligerently hand on my hip i gestured in exasperation i dont know maybe because i helped him once and he thinks i can help him again thats what we do you know whats with you jenks youve been bitchy all night the pixy sighed his wings stopping to look gossamer and silk i dont like it he said hes been here for a year watching us messing with your phone hes been trying to get noticed the air pressure shifted and ivys footsteps echoed in the sanctuary ivy jenks said loudly then he darted out hearing ivys steps i started throwing my shoes in the closet trying to get it shut before ivy offered to help me organize my thoughts went back to that solstice night trying to remember the charm i saw robbie pick up the rare redandwhite shallow bowl before we fled fountain square but what he did with it between that and pierce and me going to the vamps house and saving the girl i didnt know the kitchen had been clean by the time i was strong enough to stand again and i had assumed dads ley line stuff was back in the attic i never did see the book again my mom hadnt said much about me summoning a ghost out of purgatory and it would be just like her to hide everything to keep me from doing it again especially when id been trying to summon my dad not a young man accused of witchcraft and buried alive in the mids ivys shadow passed my door jenks a small glow and a hushed voice of panic on her shoulder hi ivy i called as i kicked the last shoe in and forced the door shut then knowing how she disliked surprises i added ford is in the kitchen from ivys room came a preoccupied hi rachel then a terse get out of my way jenks followed by a soft thump hey wheres my sword my eyebrows rose nudging my flipflops under the bed i went to the hall you left it in the belfry stairway after you oiled it the last time i hesitated hearing jenks tattling on me ah whats up ivy was halfway back to the sanctuary her long winter coat swayed and her boots hit the wood floor with purpose gold sparkles fell from jenks as he flitted back and forth in front of her flying backward i hated it when he did that to me and by her stiff arm movements i figured ivy did too its a ghost ivy he shrilled rachel summoned it when she was a kid and its back leaning against the door frame with my arms crossed i said i was eighteen not a kid his sparkles shifted to silver and he likes her he added oh for gods sake i thought losing sight of them in the dark foyer but for jenkss glow we have a randy ghost ivy asked faintly amused and my eyes narrowed this isnt funny jenks snapped hes not randy i said loudly more embarrassed by jenks than anything else pierce was probably hearing every word hes a nice guy but my gaze became distant as i remembered pierces eyes the flinty black of them and how id shivered when he kissed me on my front porch ready to go off to tag the bad vampire and thinking he could make me stay behind i smiled remembering my past emotional inexperience id been eighteen and totally impressed by a charismatic witch with mischievous eyes but it had been the turning point in my life together pierce and i had saved a little girl from a pedophile vampthe same vampire whod gotten him buried alive in the s which i thought beautiful justice id expected the deed would have been enough to put his soul at rest but apparently not that night had been the first time id felt alive the adrenaline and endorphins making my body still recovering from disease feelnormal it was then that i realized id risk anything to feel that way all the timeand most days i did ivys lithe shape seemed to ghost across the dim sanctuary toward me pixies whirling in her wake with too many questions she had her sheathed sword in her hand and concern hit me what do you need your sword for i asked then froze shed been out to the boat shed found something and was going to follow it up with cold steel before sunrise crap youve been to the boat her perfect oval face was placid but the intent eagerness of her pace tightened my gut ive been to the boat ivy said but i dont know yet who else was out there if thats what youre asking dont you have a date tonight with marshal its not a date i said ignoring jenks hovering nearby shedding frustrated sparkles hes rescuing me from my overzealous mother how come the sword if you dont know who was at the boat the hell with the sword ivy jenks shouted and i didnt wonder that his kids were now whispering in the sanctuarys shadowed rafters this is serious its been here for months changing her ring tones and scaring my cat spying on us pierce is not spying on us god jenks lighten up i exclaimed and ivy came out of her room with her sword a rag and the cleaner she used on her steel i dont mind skipping dinner at my moms you want to take a girls night out i asked eyeing her blade no but thanks for the offer ivy eased the blade out an inch and the biting scent of oiled metal tickled my nose i got a look at the list of people who visited piscary when he was in jail her smile made me stifle a shudder and when i dropped my gaze she added the sword is a conversation starter rynn a faint blush marred her pale complexion and she started for the kitchen im not his scion but hes letting me lean on him lips pressed i couldnt help but wonder what she gave him in exchange then squelched it not my business as long as ivy was happy i was happy so did your chat with ford bring anything to light ivy asked over her shoulder and i pushed into motion behind her headed for the kitchen just that weve got a freaking ghost jenks said loud enough to make my eyeballs hurt rex padded at ivys heels ears pricked up and eager arent you listening i think its one of her old boyfriends she killed spying on us jenks listen to me pierce is not an old boyfriend i said exasperated as i followed them i only knew him one night and he was dead when i found him ivy chuckled you could fall in love in an afternoon when we worked at the is she said then added but hes dead thats what ive been saying jenks shouted flitting from me to her tinks little green panties you got fairy dust in your ears i entered the kitchen through a sheet of glittering sparkles the room was a mess and i flushed when ivy stopped short and stared my spelling cupboards were all open stuff strewn across the counters evidence of me cooking up the locator amulets i should have just used the demon curse and been done with it cause the last two hours had been a big waste of time i hadnt even bothered invoking the last six potions lined up at the back of the counter ford looked up from the far corner where he had put himself to talk to pierce beside him was the makeshift ouija board and a pocketsize notebook with fords messy scrawl filling a page seeing us the man brushed cookie crumbs from himself and leaned back i wondered if i should say hi to pierce he was in heresomewhere ill tell her ford said softly when rex jingled in and twined around his feet the psychiatrist clearly wasnt talking to us and his amulet turned a thankful blue rich and deep jenks darted about like a hummingbird on steroids tell her what what did the ghost say he asked and i glared his paranoia was getting old her eyes still wide and questioning ivy delicately nudged a mesh sack of herbs down the counter to make room for her sword doing a little cooking she asked mildly uh a locator amulet to find mia i said not wanting to admit that my first attempt hadnt worked shifting my shoulders i started to put things away if youd let me organize your stuff you wouldnt make such a mess she said and after pushing a box of candles to the back of the counter she shifted the toaster forward hi ford she added sashaying to the fridge then coming out with the bagels rachel giving you problems ford chuckled it wouldnt be rachel if she wasnt i took in a breath to complain catching it when jenks unexpectedly dropped in front of me hands on his hips his green shirt had a tear in it which was unusual for the usually meticulous pixy tell her what youre trying to do he demanded putting his arms down to hide the small rip when i noticed it tell her rolling my eyes i turned to ivy if i can find it im going to spell pierce a temporary body so i can talk to him ivy paused with the sliced bagel in one hand my ceremonial ley line knife in the other the ornate handle looked odd in her fingers and her expression was amused thats the ghost right a burst of light came from jenks hes been spying on us he yelled and i wondered why he was freaking out ivy and ford werent tinks titties doesnt anyone see a problem with this hes been here a year listening to everything do you have any idea the crap weve been through in the last twelve months and you want to give this guy a voice my brow furrowed as i realized jenks had a point secrets they were what kept me alive trent being an elf me being a protodemon my arrangement with al crap pierce probably knew als summoning name mine too everything pierce wouldnt say anything i said but jenks took my soft voice for insecurity and he flew triumphantly to ivy ignoring him ivy shoved the bread in the toaster you can do that she said still facing away give a ghost a body her voice cut off and she turned the hint of hope was like thin ice rimming her eyes fragile it hurt to see it there i knew where her thoughts had gone kisten was dead seeing her hope as well jenks lost some of his vim i shook my head and the skin around her eyes tightened almost imperceptibly its a temporary spell i said reluctantly it only works if a persons sprit is stuck in purgatory and only if you have a huge amount of communal energy to work it im going to have to wait until new years before i can even try im sorry but it cant bring kisten back even for a night i took a careful breath if kisten were in purgatory wed have known it by now she nodded as if she didnt care but her face was sad when she reached for a plate i didnt know you could talk to the dead she said in an even voice to ford dont tell anyone or theyll make you an inderlander and the is will put you to work ford shifted uneasily on his chair her depression probably getting to him i cant talk to the dead he admitted but this guy smiling faintly he pointed to where rex was now sitting in the threshold staring at me like the creepy little cat she was hes unusually coherent ive never run into a ghost who knows he or she is dead and is open to communication most are stuck in a pattern of compulsive behavior trapped in their own personal hell kneeling i stacked the stillclean copper spelling pots under the counter with my cherry red loaded splat gun nestled in the smallest i kept it at crawling height for good reason but when ivy gasped i popped back up this is mine she exclaimed waving the map of the conservatory i had scribbled the alphabet on ford was scrunched back in his chair and her eyes were going black sorry ford offered shrinking back while trying not to look as if he was jenks took flight and i brushed the salt from my knees i did it i said i didnt know it was important sorry ill erase it ivy stopped short and fumed her short black hair with the gold tips swinging as jenks landed protectively on fords shoulder the man winced at the close contact but he didnt move as ivy seemed to catch herself dont bother she said stiffly and when her bagel jumped in the toaster she smacked the paper back down on the table in front of ford wincing i wiped the crumbs from my ceremonial knife and slid her a table knife instead leave it to a vamp to slice her bagel with a ceremonial device designed for black magic ivy slowly lost her stiff posture as she layered a thick swath of cream cheese on the bagel she glanced at the drawer where i had stashed my knife and with what i thought was a huge concession on her part she broke the silence with a terse its not a big deal ford tucked his amulet away as if getting ready to leave going out ivy he asked she turned with her bagel on a plate and leaned against the far counter just chatting with a few people she said flashing her sharp canines as she took a careful bite ive been out to the boat she said around her chews thanks for waiting i appreciate that the man bobbed his head and the tension in the room eased find anything i already knew the answer and i dipped below the level of the counter to shove my twentypound bag of sea salt into a back cupboard the deepfat fryer went in front of it and i shut the door with a hard thump thinking the last couple of hours had been a real waste i couldnt remember the last time id worked a charm and gotten no result maybe i could ask my mom she was good at earth charms it might be an excuse to get into the attic too an undead vampire killed kisten ivy said her graysilk voice holding so much repressed fury it chilled me but we knew that already he smells familiar she added and i turned with a stack of ceramic spelling spoons in hand her eyes were going black but i didnt think it was from my rising pulse which is good she said her voice almost husky hes probably a cincy vamp and still here as rynn cormel suggested i know ive smelled him before i just cant place him maybe i ran into him in a blood house once itd be easier if the scent wasnt six months old that last was more than slightly accusing and i quietly returned to putting things away i was glad i hadnt been there to watch ivy discover she knew the vampire who had killed kisten it had to be someone outside the camarilla or she would have noticed his scent the morning wed found kisten this wouldnt have been a problem if someone hadnt dosed me with a forget spell i said dryly and jenks lit up in a burst of white i said i was sorry about that he shouted his kids scattered and fords head jerked up you were going to try to stake the bastard rachel and i had to stop you before you killed yourself ivy wasnt here and im too damned small shocked i reached after him as he flew out jenks i called jenks im sorry thats not the way i wanted it to sound depressed i turned to ford and ivy i was acting like an insensitive jerk no wonder jenks was in a bad mood here ivy and i were trying to find kistens killer and jenks was the one who had destroyed the easy answer sorry i said and ford met my guilty gaze that was thoughtless ford pulled his legs back under him dont beat yourself up youre not the only one who makes quick decisions that come back to bite them jenks has a few guilt issues he needs to work out is all ivy snorted as she turned her bagel to get a better grip on it is that your professional opinion ford chuckled youre the last person to be throwing stones he said ignoring a lead for six months because you felt guilty that you werent there to save the two people you love the most surprised i turned to ivy her first startled look turned into a oneshouldered embarrassed shrug ivy i said as i leaned against the counter kistens death is not your fault you werent even there but if i had been it might not have happened she said softly ford cleared his throat looking at the archway as jenks buzzed back in sullen matalina was hovering at the lintel her arms crossed and a severe expression on her face apparently the wise pixy woman was doing a bit of psychoanalyzing herself and didnt want jenks sulking in the desk sorry rache he said as he lit on my shoulder i shouldnt have flown out like that dont worry about it i murmured i only said what i did because i was so far from putting blame on you that what i sounded like never occurred to me you saved my life and well get my memory back you did okay i just want to know what happened ford leaned back and tucked his pencil away you will its starting to surface can we get back to the ghost jenks said his wings making my hair fly and the wanlooking human smiled he says thank you by the way ford said glancing at his notebook he didnt find his rest much to his shame but he wouldnt be allowed to walk as he is if it hadnt been for al freeing him al i exclaimed squinting to see fords smile through the cloud of sparkles jenks had made hovering in midair in shock even ivy paused bagel halfway to her mouth what does al have to do with this i stammered as jenks made selfcongratulatory sounds i knew it he crowed i knew it all along but ford was still smiling the faint wrinkles around his eyes making him look tired nothing intentionally im sure remember that tombstone your demon cracked i shook my head biting back my ire at his use of the term your demon then i changed the motion into a nod the night i rescued ceri i said then blinked my god pierce is buried here in our backyard if pixies could have coronaries jenks was having one sputtering he hovered his face frightened and a steady stream of black sparkles puddling on the center counter to spill over and eddy about my stocking feet youre talking about the one with the weirdass statue of the angel he managed and ford nodded no way i thought wondering if i had enough time to find my flashlight and go out and look at it before marshal got here the name was scratched off jenks shrilled and rex stretched going to twine about my feet as she tried to get closer to her tiny master take a chill pill jenks i said before you set your dust on fire you shut up he shouted then flew to ivy i told you didnt i tell you you dont chisel off someones name unless his eyes widened and hes in unsanctified ground he squeaked rachel hes trouble and hes dead doesnt it bother you that hes dead how come hes dead ivys dark eyes went from me to jenks and then to ford who was sitting back and watching it all in a rather clinical way he was dead when i met him i said dryly and he was nice enough then besides a good slice of cincys population is dead yeah but they arent lurking in our church spying on us he yelled getting right in my face why are you trying to make him real i had endured just about enough slamming a cupboard door shut i stepped forward to push him back hes been trying to make contact i said eyes narrowed and inches from him making him solid is the only way i can talk to him without a frickin ouija board if you have to know he was cemented into the ground because he was accused of being a witch in the s hes probably trying to find a way to get out of purgatory and just die so lighten up ivy cleared her throat her bagel perched on her fingertips he was accused of being a witch she asked i thought you guys were really careful before the turn i backed off from jenks and took a cleansing breath the vamp he tagged as a blood pedophile ratted on him i said told everyone he was a witch the ignorant sobs cemented him into the ground alive hes not a black witch any more than i am fords chair scraped as he rose grabbing his coat he came forward as he shuffled into it i have to go he said giving my shoulder a squeeze ill call you tomorrow and we can set up a time to do the hypnosis sure i said absently glaring at jenks glowing fiercely by the fridge pierce wanted me to tell you that hes been here since al cracked his stone it made a path a willing spirit could use and he followed his thoughts back to you ford was smiling at me as if it was good news but i couldnt smile back damn it i had been in such a great mood and now it was gone first the thing with the failed earth charms and now jenks thought pierce was a demon spy this is bad ivy jenks said lighting on her shoulder i dont like it my anger flared i wanted him to shut up i dont care if you like it or not i snapped pierce is the first person i helped the first person who needed me and if he needs my help again im going to give it frustrated i threw a handful of ley line stuff in a drawer and shut it so hard rex darted away ford shifted from foot to foot i have to go no doubt after my little show of temper jenks got in his way and the man hesitated ford he said sounding desperate tell rachel this is a bad idea you dont bring back the dead not ever my heart seemed to clench but ford raised a placating hand i think its a great idea pierce is not malevolent and what harm can she do to him in one night jenkss wings hit an unreal pitch and his sparkles sifted to gray i dont think you grasp the situation here he said we dont know this guy from tink so rachel feels sorry for him and brings him back for a night he was buried alive in blasphemed ground we dont know the way to bring him all the way back from the dead but i bet a demon does and whats to stop this guy from whispering in some demons ear exchanging our secrets for a new life thats enough i shouted jenks you need to apologize to pierce right now trailing a ribbon of sparkles like a wayward sunbeam jenks flew to me i will not he said vehemently dont do this rachel you cant risk it none of us can jenks hovered before me tense and determined behind him ivy looked at me suddenly i didnt know what to say id met pierce saved a little girl with him but had i been looking at him through innocent eighteenyearold eyes easily misled and hoodwinked jenks ford said looking pained by my sudden doubt the small pixy darted up his frustration obvious can i talk to you in private he said looking angry enough to pix the man head down ford nodded angling to leave the kitchen let me know if you cant find the spell rachel and ill come over and you can talk to pierce some more sure i crossed my arms over my chest and leaned against the counter id appreciate that my jaw was clenched and i was getting a headache rex followed jenks and ford out and i wondered if the cat was following them or pierce the sound of fords feet faded and then a soft onesided conversation started up from the sanctuary ivy could probably hear ford clearly enough to make out the words but i couldnt and thats all jenks was after forcing my teeth apart i looked at ivy across the long length of the kitchen she had gotten out another small plate and as i nodded sourly she put the other half of her dinner on it and handed it to me i stiffly took it you dont think this is a bad idea do you i asked and ivy sighed staring at nothing is it a demon curse she asked the one to give pierce a temporary body i mean my head moved back and forth and i took a bite of bagel no its simply hard her dark eyes focused on me and she lifted a thin shoulder good she said i think you should do it jenks is a paranoid old man relief brought my shoulders down and i managed a thin smile turning my bagel to get to the side with the most cream cheese i took a bite and the tart tang of cheese hit my tongue pierce isnt up to anything i said as i chewed i just want to help him if i can he helped me realize what i wanted to do with my life and i sort of owe him i looked at her seeing her eyes distant in thought you know what i mean owing someone for changing your life in a good way her attention flicked to me uh yeah she said then set her plate down to go to the fridge i know i can do the spell all i need is the recipe the equipment and a gathering of witches to siphon off the power i looked at my bagel and sighed this was going to be hard ivy was silent as she poured a glass of orange juice then said softly im sorry this means a lot to you jenks is being an ass ignore him i ate another bite of my bagel and said nothing pierce was one of the few people who knew me before i had demon marks or smut or anything else i had to help him if i could ivy shifted to the sink to wash the crumbs from her plate and knowing my agitation was hard on her instincts i slid away a few feet cant you just buy the book she asked gazing at the porch light shining on the snowy garden if its not demon magic it should be out there my head nodded it was nice that someone didnt think pierce was a spy im sure it is but leveleighthundred arcane ley line textbooks arent common they usually dont show up unless someone is teaching a class getting one before new years will be a problem that and the crucible if robbie doesnt know where it is it might take months the front door thumped shut and jenks darted in with the icy scent of a summer field on a winter night he was in a much better frame of mind and i couldnt help but wonder what ford had told him im out of here i said snagging my bag from the far chair before jenks could try to start a conversation i probably wont be back until almost four its going to be bad i said around a sigh robbie has a girlfriend and my moms nuts about her ivy smiled a closedlipped smile have fun i glanced at her sword on the counter thinking id rather go with her and face ugly vampires than my mom and robbie and the inevitable when are you going to settle down conversation okay im out of here i glanced around the almosttidy kitchen and wondered if they would think it was weird if i said bye to pierce you going to be okay here alone with pierce jenks i mocked as i shoved the invoked locator amulet in my bag to ask my mom about and jenks flashed an annoyed red yeah ill be fine he muttered well have a nice chat mr ghost and me a little onesided isnt it i said and jenks smiled his eagerness worrying me just the way i like it he cant talk back to me the way my kids do my coat and boots were in the foyer call me if you need me i said and ivy gave me a wave jenks was already on her shoulder and the two clearly had things to discuss even more worrisome giving them a last look i headed to the front of the church keys jingling against my lethalmagic detector the pixies were busy in the corner with a terrified mouse and ignoring the drama i wiggled my feet into my boots and tightened them up i shrugged into my coat and looked out from the dark room into the shadowed sanctuary still decorated with ivys christmas stuff and my solstice things a soft warm feeling took me relaxing me i wondered if i could really smell the scent of coal dust and shoe polish or if it was just my imagination i hesitated when the tinkling of rexs bell joined the noise of the pixies and i watched her sit primly in the opening to the hallway to stare at me maybe she was staring at pierce bye pierce i whispered dont mind jenks he just wants to keep me safe and with a small smile i pushed open the door and headed out into the cold ten the dishcloth had long since become damp but we were almost done and it wasnt worth the effort to get a dry one robbie was washing i was drying and marshal was putting away with the help of my mom the truth was she was out here supervising so robbie and i didnt lapse into one of our infamous water fights i smiled and handed a bowl to marshal the scent of roast beef and butterscotch pie was heavy in the air a big trigger for the memories of the sunday nights when robbie would come over i had been twelve and robbie twenty and then it had all stopped when dad died robbie saw my mood shift and he made a fist half in the water half out squeezing his hand he made a short burst of water arc up and splash into my side of the sink knock it off i complained then shrieked when he squirted me again mom robbie mom didnt even look up from arranging the coffee tray i didnt do anything he protested and my moms eyes glinted when she turned then dont do anything a little faster she complained honestly i never understood why it took you two so long to get the kitchen cleaned up put some hustle into it marshal is the only one out here working she beamed at him making the young man flush when robbie muttered a goodnatured suckup robbie and marshal had hit it off great the two of them spending much of the evening with talk about college sports and music marshal was closer to robbies age than mine and it was nice seeing my brother actually approve of one of my boyfriends not that marshal was a boyfriend but watching them made me wistful as if i was getting a glimpse of something id turned my back on this was what a normal family must be like with siblings bringing new people into the family becoming part of something biggerbelonging it didnt help that most of the dinner conversation had centered on robbie and cindy they were obviously serious about each other and i could just see my mother becoming happier by the moment because robbie might start a family and find himself part of the circle of life id given up on the white picket fence after kisten had diedfinding out my kids would be demons was the nail in the coffinbut seeing robbie getting kudos for doing something i deemed not socially responsible for me to pursue was irritating sibling rivalry sucked with marshal here i could at least pretend both mom and robbie were impressed that hed just sold his own business with enough profit to put him through getting his masters without having to work at all the swimcoach thing now was just to lower his tuition and give him a whole lot more disposable income id hoped hed heard from admissions about my declined check by now but apparently not everyone was working over the winter break giving robbie a light smack from the back of her hand for the suckup comment my mother pointed out to marshal where the glasses went then busied herself arranging the last of the solstice cookies on a plate the round sugar cookies were bright with solstice green and gold and lettered with runes of good fortune my mom put her heart into everything she did as soon as her back was turned robbie threatened to shoot another jet of water at me i closed my eyes and ignored him id been trying to get him alone all night to ask him about that book but between marshal and my mother i hadnt had the chance i was going to have to bring in some help marshal wasnt devious by nature but he wasnt slow on the uptake either humming happily my mom sashayed out with a plate of cookies the stereo in the living room went on and i grimaced i had thirty seconds tops marshal i said pleading with my eyes as i handed him a plate ive got a big favor to ask ill tell you all about it later but will you keep my mom busy for about ten minutes robbie stopped what he was doing and just looked at me whats up firefly my mom came back in and following the pattern wed laid down when we were conniving kids robbie turned back to the sink as if id said nothing please i whispered to marshal when he came back from sliding the stack of plates away ive got to talk to robbie about something oblivious my mom puttered with the coffeemaker jostling robbie and me aside and looking small next to us as she filled the carafe marshal robbie said eyes twinkling as they met mine behind my moms back you look as tired as a dead carp rachel and i can finish here why dont you go and sit in the living room and wait for coffee look at a few photo albums immediately my mother brightened what a fantastic idea marshal you must see the photos we took on our last summer vacation rachel was twelve and just starting to have some strength she said taking his elbow and rachel will bring the coffee out when its done smiling she turned to me dont be too long you two she said but the lilt in her voice gave me pause i think she knew i was getting rid of them my mom was nuts she was not stupid i slipped my hands into the warm water and pulled out a dripping serving platter from the front of the house came marshals resonant voice it sounded good balanced against my moms dinner had been pleasant but again almost painful listening to robbie go on and on about cindy my mom joining in when they talked about her two weeks out there i was jealous but everyone i got attached to seemed to end up hurt dead or crooked everyone but ivy and jenks and i wasnt sure about the crooked part with them well what is it robbie said dropping the silverware so the rinse water splashed quietly i ran the back of my hand across my chin and here i am trying to resurrect a ghost maybe i could be friends with a ghost i wouldnt be able to kill him remember that book you gave me for the winter solstice i asked no my eyes came up but he wouldnt meet them his jaw was clenched making his long face appear longer the one that i used to bring i started no it was forceful and my lips parted when i realized he meant no as in im not telling not i dont know robbie i exclaimed softly youve got it my brother rubbed his eyebrows it was one of his tells he was either lying or about to ive no clue what youre talking about he said as he wiped off the suds hed just put there liar i accused and his jaw tightened its mine i said then softened my voice when marshal raised his voice to cover us up you gave it to me i need it where is it no his gaze was intent and his voice determined as he scoured the pan the roast had been in it was a mistake to give it to you and its going to stay right where it is which is i prompted but he continued to scrub his short hair moving as he did you gave it to me i exclaimed frustrated and hoping he wasnt going to tell me it was four time zones away you have no right to try to summon dad again only now would he look at me and his temper was showing mom had a devil of a time pulling herself back together after that little stunt took me two weeks and almost five hundred dollars in phone bills yeah well i spent seven years putting her back together when you left after dad died so i think were even robbies shoulders slumped thats not fair neither is leaving us for a stinking career i said my heart pounding god no wonder shes so screwed up you did the same thing takata did to her youre both exactly alike my brothers face became closed and he turned away immediately i wished i could take it back even if it was true robbie im sorry i said and he flicked a glance at me i shouldnt have said that its justi really need that book its not safe im not eighteen anymore i exclaimed dish towel on my hip you sure act like it i dropped the dry silverware in the drawer slammed it shut and turned seeing my frustration robbie softened and with his voice carrying a shared pain he said dads at rest rachel let him go peeved i shook my head im not trying to talk to dad i need it to talk to pierce robbie huffed as he drained the sink and rinsed the cooking pan under tap water hes at rest too leave the poor guy alone a faint excitement lifted in me at the memory of the night pierce and i had spent in the snow of cincinnati it had been the first time i had really felt alive the first time id ever been able to help anyone pierce is not at rest hes in my church and has been for almost a year changing my phones ring tones and making jenkss cat stare at me robbie turned shocked and i reached to turn the water off for him youre kidding i tried not to look smug but he was my brother and it was my right i want to help him find his rest where is the book i asked as i took the pan and shook the water from it he thought for a moment as he rummaged under the sink for the cleanser dusting a little in the sink and then replacing it where it had sat for almost three decades the attic he said as he started to scrub ive got moms crucible up there too the really expensive redandwhite one and the bottle to hold the potion i dont know where the watch is did you lose it elated i put the roaster away half dried its in my dresser i said trying not to sneeze at the sharp scent of cleanser as i jammed the dish towel over the rod to dry and started for the door i was going to get everything in one go how lucky could i get i was halfway to the kitchen door when robbie caught my elbow ill get it he said glancing past me to the unseen living room i dont want mom to know what youre doing tell her im looking for my bottlecap collection snorting i nodded yeah like hed really take his beerbottlecap collection on the plane with him ten minutes i said if youre not down here by then im coming up after you fair enough he smiled as he pulled the towel from the rack and dried his hands you are such a sweet sister i truly dont know how those rumors get started i tried to come up with something my mind going blank when he flicked the towel at me scoring hey i yelped leave your sister alone robbie my mom said faintly from the living room her voice carrying a familiar firmness and both robbie and i smiled it had been too long smirking at his innocently wide green eyes i grabbed the sponge and hefted it experimentally rachel came my moms voice and grinning robbie tossed the dish towel at me and sauntered confidently out of the kitchen almost immediately i heard the attic door being pulled down and the thunk of the stairway hitting the carpet in the bedroom hallway confident now that id be going home with everything id need i wiped the sink out and hung up the dish towel coffee i whispered sniffing at the coffeemaker and hoping shed lightened up on the grounds in deference to having a guest shoes a soft hush on linoleum my mom came in whats robbie doing in the attic i pulled back from the stilldripping coffee machine looking for his bottlecap collection okay so i lied to my mother but id be willing to bet hed find something up there to take back with him so it wasnt a lie altogether she made a small sound as she pulled four white mugs from the cupboard and set them on the tray it was the set she used for her best company and i wondered if it meant anything its nice to have you both here she said softly and my tension vanished it was nice to have robbie here to pretend for a while that nothing had changed my mom busied herself fussing with the tray as the last of the coffee dripped into the coffeemaker and again i noticed how young her hands were witches lived for almost two centuries and we could almost pass for sistersespecially since she had stopped dressing down cindy is nice she said from out of the blue and i started jerked back to reality by the mention of robbies girlfriend he teases her like he teases you she was smiling and i went to get the cream out of the fridge youd like her she added her eyes on the backyard lit from the neighbors security light shes working at the university while finishing up her degree smart then i thought not surprised this hadnt come out in dinner conversation i wondered why what is she taking my moms lips pressed together in thought criminology really smart too smart she has one year left my mom said as she arranged a set of spoons on the napkins it was nice watching them together she balances robbie out hes so pie in the sky and shes so down to earth she has a quiet beauty their children will be precious beyond belief her smile had gone soft and i smiled realizing that by settling down robbie was setting himself up for an entirely new set of momwants she might have given up on me but now robbie was going to take the full brunt oh so sad tell me she said in a deceptively mild tone how are you and marshal getting along my smile faded okay maybe she hadnt given up on me completely fine were doing great i said with a new nervousness shed been the one to tell me that we werent suited for more than a rebound relationship but after hearing at dinner how marshal had pulled tom out from under my kitchen she might have readjusted her thinking robbie really likes him she continued its nice for me to know that you have someone looking after you able to go under your house and kill snakes for you so to speak mom i felt trapped all of a sudden i can kill my own snakes marshal and i are friends and thats enough why cant i just have a guy friend huh every time i push it i mess it up besides you told me he wasnt a longterm solution but a shortterm diversion i was whining and she set the sugar bowl down and turned to face me sweetheart she said touching my jaw im not telling you to marry the man im telling you to keep the lines of communication open make sure he knows whats going on my stomach full of gravy and beef started to churn good i said surprised because im not dating him and nothing is going on everyone i date ends up dead or going off a bridge her lips twisted into a wry expression as she took the carafe and poured the coffee into the best silver pitcher they do not she chided i really like marshal and hes been good for you but hes toosafe maybe to keep your interest and i want to make sure hes not thinking theres more to this than there is hes too good a person to lead on like that and if youve given him any indication he knows were just friends i interrupted god what was it with her friends is fine she said firmly and its good to know he can come through in a pinch this thing with the bansen character for example ill sleep better knowing you have someone to go to if im not around i worry about you sweetheart my jaw clenched and i could feel my blood pressure start to rise this was not what i wanted to talk about if i find any more snakes under my floorboards ill know who to call then i hesitated if she isnt around uh mom i said as she fussed over the tray youre okay right she laughed the sound of it pulling my shoulders down im fine not quite reassured i set the good silver coffeepot on the tray now knowing what it meant she considered marshal casual company not a future soninlaw and a part of me was disappointed even as i knew it was the best thing a thump from the attic pulled my attention up it was followed by another and i started to fidget i grabbed the tray as the distinctive bump of the attic door folding up into the ceiling filtered in he was downstairs ill take it in my mother said briskly as she plucked the tray from my hands and gave a nod to the hallway poor marshal must be bored sitting there by himself see if robbie needs any help with what he pulled out of the attic bottle caps i thought i threw those out thanks mom anxious to get my hands on that book i followed her smiling sadly at marshals cheerful comment about the beautiful coffeepot as i headed in the other direction almost running into robbie i gasped and he steadied me with both hands my eyes narrowed both hands wheres the book i whispered robbies eyes were pinched in the dim greenness of the hall cold now from the attic it wasnt there what i yelped then lowered my voice and leaned in what do you mean it wasnt there i mean its not where i left it the box is gone not knowing if i should believe him or not i angled around him to look for myself what does the box look like i asked as i reached for the pull cord had mom found it or was robbie simply telling me it was gone to keep it out of my reach robbie grabbed my shoulder and turned me back relax it has to be up there he said ill check again in the morning after she goes to sleep my eyes narrowed and i hesitated from the front room came my moms voice raised in question did you find your rusty caps robbie i want them out of my attic robbies grip on my shoulders tightened then relaxed got em mom he said ill be right there ive got something for you and rachel presents my mother was suddenly in the hall beaming as she linked her arm in mine you know you dont need to bring us presents just having you here is present enough robbie grinned back winking when i gritted my teeth now id never get up there to make sure he didnt miss something crap hed done this on purpose but my mother was happy and i followed her back to the living room for coffee as robbie went to rummage in his luggage marshal looked suitably relieved by my appearance and i plunked myself down on the brown tapestrycovered couch bumping into him and staying where i was our thighs touching you owe me he whispered his lips twisted in both fun and sly annoyance you owe me big i looked at the thick photo album of robbie and me as kids two tickets to the next wrestling event at the coliseum i whispered back front row that might cover it he said laughing at me almost humming my mom sat and bobbed her foot until she saw me notice it and she stilled it i wonder what he got us she asked and the last of my bad mood evaporated i liked seeing her this way oh here he comes she added eyes lighting up at the sound of robbies footsteps robbie sat across from us and put down two envelopes each having our names on them in a clearly feminine script his long face was full of excitement and he slid them to us with two fingers one for me one for my mom cindy and i got these for you he said as we both reached for them but you cant use them until june june i mused june my mom echoed then let out a joyous yelp that made me jump youre getting married she shrieked and threw herself around the coffee table robbie oh robbie she burbled starting to cry cindy is so sweet i know you will be so happy together im so excited for you both have you found a church yet what are the invitations going to be like i scooted away from marshal and stared at the two plane tickets in my envelope my eyes met robbies when i looked up please say youll come he asked me his arms around our mother as she cried joyful tears it would make us both very happy look at me my mom warbled pulling away to wipe her face son of a bitch im crying robbie blinked at her rough words but i smiled same old mom of course ill come i said standing up and moving around the table i wouldnt miss it for the world al could just suck my toes and die so hed have to pick me up in an unfamiliar ley line they had ley lines in portland same as everywhere else the hug turned into a group thing and it felt good secure and bittersweet the lilac and redwood scent from my mom mixed with the aroma of electric amps but even as my thoughts rejoiced another worry took me maybe i should back off from the magic completely i mean id never forgive myself if something happened to robbie or his new brideor their children giving them both a last squeeze i let go and retreated marshal standing forgotten swooped in and shook robbies hand smiling as he offered his condolences my eyes were wet and i smiled through the worry im really happy for you robbie i said meaning it whens the date robbie exhaled as he let go of marshals hand becoming truly relaxed we havent set it yet its going to be determined by the caterer im afraid he grinned embarrassed my mom continued to weep happy tears promising to help in any way she could robbie turned from me back to her and i smiled awkwardly at marshal nothing like your brother announcing he was getting married to make an awkward situation even better someones phone started to ring ignored until i realized it was mine relishing the chance to extricate myself i fled to the front door where id left my bag and searched it thinking break on through to the other side must be pierces idea of a joke not bad considering he had a hundred and fifty years of music to catch up on sorry i said when i read eddens number i should take this its my cop friends dad the one in the hospital my mom made flustered waving motions and i turned my back on them for some privacy a ping of adrenaline pulsed through me i didnt think this was about glenn but i didnt want to tell them i was working on bringing in a banshee robbie thought i was irresponsible enough already my mom and robbies excited conversation retreated to background noise when i flipped the top open and put it to my ear hi edden i said in greeting immediately recognizing that he was in the office by the faint chatter whats up dont have your tv on do you he said and a second flush of adrenaline built on the first what is it i said looking for my boots my first thought was glenn but edden sounded excited not upset mia is at circle mall he said and my eyes darted to my bag glad now id brought the charm i didnt need it but id know for sure if id done it right or not she was in the food court edden was saying her and her baby soaking up the ambient emotions im guessing it wasnt enough because a fight broke out and turned into a riot never would have found her otherwise holy shit i breathed then covered my mouth my eyes went to my moms and she sighed when i leaned against the wall to put on my boots is remus there yeeep edden said dryly weve got most of the bystanders out and the mall locked down its a mess im on my way there now and id like you there to help bring her in she being an inderlander and all i dont have many of them on my payroll he didnt have any on his permanent payroll for legal reasons my hands were shaking as i shrugged into my coat but it was excitement i can be there in ten minutes five if i dont have to park my car ill tell them youre on the way he said and i made a noise so he wouldnt hang up wait im going to be a while i need to go back and get jenks if i was bringing in a banshee i needed him id like to have ivy too but she was out alex is on his way to get jenks already edden said and i zipped my coat closed and dug out my keys smacking the badmojo amulet with my knuckles i called the church first and he wanted in on it thanks edden i said truly pleased that he was sending someone for jenks not only because now i didnt have to but that hed thought of jenks at all youre a peach yeah yeah yeah he said and i could hear his smile i bet you say that to all the captains just the ones who let me kick ass i said then broke the connection excited i turned to the living room i froze seeing mom robbie and marshal sitting on the couch together all staring at me i looked at myself already dressed for the cold and i warmed my keys jingled as i shifted and i gave them a sick smile damn it i was ready to walk out the door and i had forgotten all about them oh crap wed driven marshals car uh i have to go i said as i put my keys away theres a problem at the mall uh marshal marshal stood smiling in a rather fond way that i wasnt sure how to take ill get the car warmed up while you say goodbye robbies expression was dark like i should sit and have coffee with them instead of going to do my job but damn it runs happened when runs happened and i couldnt live up to his ideas of what my life should be rachel he started and my mother put a hand on his knee robbie shut the hell up marshal made a guffaw he quickly shifted into a cough but i felt miserable dont worry about it the tall man muttered from beside me then purposely bumped into me as he put on his shoes its not a problem mom robbie protested my blood pressure spiked maybe we should have brought two cars but then id be leaving marshal alone here and that wasnt any better putting her hand heavily on robbies shoulder my mother stood marshal ill pack your pie up for you it was nice to see you again thank you for coming over marshal looked up from tying his boots and smiled it was a real pleasure mrs morgan thanks for having me i enjoyed the pictures she hesitated a hint of her worry showing then she nodded and hustled into the kitchen im sorry i said to marshal marshal touched my shoulder through my coat its okay just bring the pie out with you okay your mom makes great pie okay i whispered and he turned and left a brief gust of cold air blew in it was snowing again i still felt bad and when i turned from shutting the door behind marshal i almost ran into robbie my head snapped up and immediately my worry turned to anger he was staring at me and i stared right back eye to eye me in my boots and him still in socks rachel you are such an ass sometimes i cant believe youre walking out of here my eyes narrowed this is my job bert i said hitting the nickname hard mom doesnt have a problem with it you arent around enough to have a say so get out of my face he took a breath to protest grimacing and dropping back when mom hustled in from the kitchen two pieces of pie on a plate covered with clear wrap here you go sweetheart she said elbowing robbie out of her way to give me a hug goodbye give us a call when its over so we can sleep this morning relief spilled through me that i didnt have to explain or that she wasnt trying to make me feel guilty for cutting out early thanks mom i breathed in her lilac scent as she gave me a quick squeeze and rocked back im proud of you she said as she handed me the pie go kick some badguy ass i felt the prick of tears glad she accepted that i couldnt be the daughter she wanted and that she was proud of the daughter i was thanks i managed clearing my throat to get the lump out of it but it didnt work giving robbie a sharp look in turn she said you two make up now and with nothing more she took the tray of coffee and returned to the kitchen robbies jaw tightened belligerent to the end and i forced myself to relax i knew better than to walk out of here mad at him it might be another seven years before i saw him again look i said im sorry but this is what i do im not nine to five and moms cool with that he was looking at the badmojo amulet in my open bag and i hid it behind my back youll try to find that book right i said suddenly unsure then i tightened my scarf robbie hesitated and then his shoulders eased yeah i will he said around a sigh but i dont agree with what youre doing like you ever did i said finding a smile somewhere as i opened the door im happy for you and cindy i said really i cant wait to meet her at that he finally smiled too ill give you her phone number he said gesturing to the night and you can call her shes dying to meet you she wants to do her thesis on you i jerked to a stop in the threshold and turned why i asked suspiciously and he lifted one shoulder and let it fall uh i told her about your demon marks he said i mean shes a witch and all she was going to see the smut on your aura and figure it out i came back inside and shut the door you told her what i said loudly glad i had my gloves on to cover the demon mark on my wrist i really needed to push al into taking his name back so i could get rid of at least one of them sorry he said smugly not looking at all apologetic maybe i shouldnt have but i didnt want her to meet you and not have an explanation about the smut i waved a hand between us i mean why does she want to do her thesis on me robbie blinked oh uh shes majoring in criminology i told her youre a white witch with demon smut gained saving someones life that you can still be good and be covered in smut he hesitated thats okay isnt it giving myself a mental shake i nodded yeah sure here he said handing me the envelope with the tickets dont forget these thanks the banshee tear was a hard lump in my pocket when i shoved the tickets away maybe ill trade them in for an earlier flight thatd be great wed love it if you came out early just let us know and well get the guest room cleaned up he smiled at me toothily you know youre welcome anytime i gave him a hug goodbye before i stepped away and opened the door the night had a dry sharpness and i looked at marshal waiting as i went down the shoveled walk the porch light flicked on and i waved at the shadow by the window robbies last words went around and around in my thoughts and i kept repeating them trying to figure out why they bothered me the mall marshal said cheerfully when i got in probably glad that id pulled him out from under my moms often onesided conversation i handed him the pie and he made an appreciative mmmm yes the mall i said before putting on my seat belt the car was warm and the windows defrosted but cold hit me when robbies last words finally penetrated and i blinked fast im welcome anytime i knew he had meant them to be full of acceptance but that he had felt the need to say them said much more he was getting married he was moving on with his life becoming a part of it immersing himself and finding a place on the wheel by getting married he was no longer just my brother he was someone elses husband and though we argued a lot a bond was being broken by the simple fact that he was no longer alone he was a part of something bigger and by inviting me in he had unintentionally told me i was an outsider your mom makes really good pie marshal said and i smiled at him across the long seat mindful of the ice he put the car in gear and slowly headed for the mall yes she does i said depressed maybe i should look at it as if i hadnt lost a brother but had gained a sister riiiiight eleven i hesitated at the edge of the crowd gaze fixed on the placid vamp being led under the yellow tape to the waiting is cruisers at the curb i dont know the cuffed man said sounding bewildered i dont give a fuck what a were thinks of my mom he pissed me off the undead vamps response was mostly unheard and i watched the two meld into the lights and excitement of six is cruisers two news vans eight fib vehicles and all the people who went with them everyones lights were on revolving if they could the cold night air had the feeling of wrapup and i sighed i hated being late to a riot i wasnt going to wait for marshal who was still parking his car they wouldnt let him in id be surprised if i got in without some trouble invited or not the fib didnt trust me anymore stupidass prejudice how many times did i have to prove myself chin high and eyes scanning i edged through the crowd to where the yellow ribbon met the wall deciding i would just slip under the line and hope for the best my motion to dip under the tape was halted however when i almost knocked heads with a familiar face doing the same thing hi tom i said acerbically as i drew back we just keep running into each other the former is agent dropped the tape his shocked expression turning to frustration he took a breath to say something then clenched his jaw silent he shoved his hands into his pockets and walked away surprised i stared after him until the snow and the crowd took him huh i muttered then sort of disappointed he hadnt stuck around to exchange barbs i dipped under the yellow tape and yanked the closest door open eager to get out of the cold the air was still between the twin sets of doors and i could hear voices echoing raised in anger and frustration a cluster of fib uniforms gathered past the second set of doors and i decided that was my best bet sorry maam a low voice said and i jerked my hand from the inner door instinct pulling me back before a thickfingered hand could touch me it was a dead vampire a fairly young one by the looks of him set to be door guard heart pounding i cocked my hip and gave him an upanddown look im with the fib i said and he laughed the rim of his blue eyes thinning as he started to pull an aura witches dont work for the fib he said you look more like a reporter get behind the line maam i work outside the lines and im not a reporter i said looking up at his cleanshaven face any other time i would have stopped to enjoy the view but i was in a hurry and knock off the aura crap i said ticked my roommate could eat you for breakfast the vamps eyes went full black the background noise of angry people abruptly vanished the blood drained from my face and i found my back against the outer doors id rather sip you for breakfast the undead vampire murmured his voice running like cool fog through my soul a pulse from my scar sent a shock of reality through me damn it i hated it when vampires didnt recognize me my gloved hand had covered my neck and i forced it down and my eyes to open go find a rat i said even as his playing on my scar felt really good my thoughts went to ivy and i swallowed this was so not what i needed vamp boy blinked at my unusual resistance and with that slight show of confusion his hold on me broke damn i had to quit teasing the dead ones hey farcus a masculine voice shouted from beyond the glass and he turned even as he kept me in his vision leave the witch alone thats morgan the fibs whore farcus apparently dropped back the rim of his blue eyes growing in surprise youre rachel morgan he said then started to laugh showing his pointed canines somehow that irritated me more than him playing on my scar had i pushed forward and youre farcus rhymes with marcus another lameass vampire get out of my way his laughter cut off as i bumped him and he growled when i leaned on the door and passed into the warmth of the mall as far as malls go it was nice with the food court up front wide aisles and two stories to make a fun place to shop i slowly loosened my coat and scarf as i scanned the open area i was too late to do anything thick in the air was the choking scent of angry were and the spicy tang of angry vampire all mixing with the aroma of burgers fries and asian food ruined by too much grease over it all was the sound of eighties pop done instrumentally surreal the surrounding shops on both levels had their gates down and employees were clustered behind them loud with gossip the lower floor was a mess with several tables sporting broken legs and everything shoved out of place a red smear on the floor and pilings gave me pause until i decided the splatter pattern wasnt right for blood it was ketchup which might be why the humans had gathered by the icecream counter young kids wearing too much black mostly but there were some late shoppers braving the encroaching inderlander shopping hours too they looked scared but there were no paramedics at the other end of the food court were the inderlanders and here was where the lawsuits would come from most had makeshift bandages pressed against their arms or legs one was flat out on the floor weres and vampires no witches who were like humans in that they knew to get out of the way when predators fought it was quiet over there and most looked confused not angry clearly the riot had ended as quickly as it had started so wheres the little instigator i thought not seeing anyone matching mias description among the walking wounded stopping in the middle of the open hall i dug the locator amulet out of my bag with a faint foolish sense of optimism maybe id done it right and didnt know it but as i held the smooth disk of wood in my hands it stayed a slightly damp disk of wood no glow no tingle nothing either id flubbed the charm or she wasnt here damn i whispered brow furrowed it had been a long time since id misspelled a charm doubt in ones abilities wasnt healthy when you worked with high magic selfdoubt led to mistakes double damn what if i really messed up one day and blew myself to bits the familiar cadence of ivys boots pulled me around and i shoved the amulet back in my bag i was really glad she was here bringing in a banshee even a cuffed one was not as easy as it soundedwhich was probably why the is was either ignoring or covering up her activities i thought you were working i called out as she approached and she shrugged i finished early i waited for more disappointed when she shook her head and added nothing i didnt learn jack jenks was with her and he lit on my offered fist looking tired and cold youre late he said you missed all the fun a passing vampire with his hands cuffed snarled at us trying to scratch at the new blisters on his neck pull your damned wings off and then see if you can fly he muttered lunging and making the is cop with him jerk him back shove it up your ass and make a breath mint out of it jenks shouted after him and i wondered just how much fun i had missed and if it would be showing up on our doorstep in about fortyeight hours after it posted bail making friends i see i said gazing at the aftermath ivy took my elbow and began leading me from the inderlander side of things the is officers were watching me and i felt uneasy what took you so long she asked edden said he called you i was at my moms it takes three times as long as it should to leave i exhaled loudly not seeing mia anywhere its over wheres mia was remus with her jenks clattered for my attention and he pointed to the human side of the food court my lips parted and i blinked the fussing child should have clued me in even if the man standing protectively over the slight elegant woman hadnt damn she looks midthirties not three hundred i thought as i took in her slight almost fragileseeming frame next to the averagelooking man as he held a baby bundled up in a pink snowsuit the toddler was probably only hot and i wondered why he just didnt take the snowsuit off her not a scrap of skin was showing apart from her face and her hands gripping a sticky lollipop disappointment that my amulet hadnt worked filled me then i shoved it aside apart from his evermoving eyes remus looked entirely unremarkable in his jeans and cloth coat not ugly not attractive maybe a little tall and bulky but not overly so that he could have beaten up glenn looked doubtful but knowing how to hurt a person and the willingness to use that knowledge coupled with surprise could be deadly to be honest he looked harmlessuntil i saw his eyes follow an fib officer hatred in the way he clenched his jaw an almost eagerness to hurt reflected in his gaze and then he dropped his attention and shuffled his feet becoming a janitor standing over a woman way out of his league why are they just sitting there i asked turning away before they felt my eyes on them did the warrant fall through jenks slowly rose from ivys shoulder to see them better no eddens got it but both of them are quiet right now and he doesnt want to do anything until he gets more people out of here ive been listening and the is doesnt care that mias killing humans a pang of worry made me stiff with tension are they covering it up nah just ignoring her everybody has to kill to eat right he said it with just the right amount of sarcasm and i knew he didnt agree with their policy everyone had to eat but eating people wasnt polite jenkss wings fanned to send the smell of soap to me he was wearing his wraparound robe instead of his usual work clothes making him look exotic and i wondered how bis was doing watching the church by himself i think she and remus think they are going to slip out with the humans he said as he landed on my shoulder ivy laughed softly i call dibs on the big one i dont know i said trying to read mias body language from across the large room they have to guess we know who they are i mean weve been to their house i think theyre waiting because we are ivy smiled showing a slip of teeth potent after farcuss play for my blood i still call dibs on the big one rache jenks said his voice concerned look at mias aura have you ever seen anything like that taking a slow breath i willed my second sight into play all witches could see auras vampires couldnt weres couldnt some humans could gaining the ability from hybridizing with elves pixies saw them all the time whether they wanted to or not if i tapped a ley line and worked at it i could see the everafter layered over reality this far out from the center of cincinnati it would likely only be stunted trees and frozen scrub when id been in my early teens id spent a lot of time overlaying the everafter on reality until a trip to the zoo cured me the tigers had known what id been doing and theyd started for me as if they could walk through the glass to reach me i didnt look at auras much it was illegal to screen employees by their auras though i knew for a fact some food chains did dating services swore by them i was of the opinion that you could tell more about people in a fiveminute conversation than by looking at their auras most psychiatrists agreed with me whether they were human or inderlander exhaling with a long slow sound i turned back to the cluster of humans blues greens and yellows predominated with the accompanying flashes of red and black to give evidence of the human condition there was an unusual amount of orange in a few peoples outer fringes but everyone was upset and it didnt surprise me remuss aura was a nasty ugly red with a sheen of purple and the yellow of love at its core it was a dangerous combination meaning that he lived in a world that confused him and that he was moved by passion if one believed in that kind of thing mias jenks clattered his wings shuddering almost mias was not theresort of i mean it was there but wasnt looking at her predominantly blue aura was like looking at the candles of a protective circle when the candles existed both here and in the everafter it was there but sort of displaced sideways and it was sucking in everyone elses aura with the faint subtlety of the incoming tide filling a tidal pool the babys was exactly the same look at remus jenks said shifting his wings to tickle my neck his aura isnt being touched at all even by the babys and hes holding her that might explain why hes still alive i said wondering how they managed it id been told that banshees didnt have any control over whose aura they sucked up along with ambient emotions but clearly that wasnt the case ivy stood beside us with her hip cocked looking miffed that we were discussing things she couldnt see it was with an unfamiliar enthusiasm that she straightened and smiled saying loudly to someone behind me edden look she finally made it i dropped my second sight and turned finding the squat muscular man almost to us hi edden i said shifting my bag up higher and unintentionally making jenks take flight the captain of cincinnatis fib department shuffled to a stop his khakis and starched shirt saying he was in charge as much as the badge pinned to his belt and the blue fib hat he had dropped on his graying head the gray seemed to be heavier now and the few wrinkles deeper rachel he said as he extended his hand and i shook it what took you so long i was at my moms i said watching the cops behind him start to gossip about us and he raised his eyebrows knowingly say no more he said then went silent when a were walked past limping and with a nasty gash on his forearm you gotta keep em separated ivy murmured then turned to us her expression sharp you really think having those two in with the humans is a good idea edden put a thick hand on my shoulder and turned us away moving slowly to the cluster of fib officers by the kiddie rides ive got three plainclothes with them were getting people out one by one nice and easy i nodded seeing the cops in there now ivy seemed less than convinced and at her sigh he held up a hand were waiting for social services to get here to take custody of the kid he explained i dont want charges dropped because of a sympathy plea if it goes to trial his voice was grim and i remembered that these were the people whod put his son in the hospital thats great ivy said her eyes on the group but i dont think it can wait any longer jenks spilled a yellow sifting of dust and edden and i turned remus watched from under lowered brows as two more bystanders were escorted away for questioning as we watched his voice became loud almost echoing holly started crying in earnest and mia took her holding her close clearly peeved edden do something i said ready to go over there myself missing baby wagon or not remus had put an experienced fib agent in the hospital i didnt like unaware innocents surrounding him and if i could tell who the plainclothes were so could remus he was a child of the system all grown up and made deadly like raising a wolf among people society had turned something already dangerous into twice the threat edden looked at the three officers in with the humans and frowning he bobbed his head in a meaningful way immediately the female cop got between remus and the last few people two heftylooking men in identical coats went for remus one angling to get him away from his wife and child the other pulling his cuffs it was way too soon and remus lost it shouting remus jabbed a fist out almost scoring on the smaller fib agent who stumbled back remus lunged after him smacking an elbow viciously into his head then grabbing the hand of the dazed officer and twisting it to force the man to the floor remus knelt on his shoulder and at a snap of cartilage the downed officer cried out in pain my gut clenched it sounded like remus had just dislocated the mans shoulder jenks vaulted into motion ivy leapt at them and suddenlyi was standing alone jenks no i cried out heart pounding at the thought of remuss hand smacking into the small pixy but he had come to a halt two feet from contact ivy too slid to a stop the sound of fear rose from highpitched voices and every vampire in the place turned their eyes black remus had taken a hostage and with one hand he worked the gun from the downed officers holster and stood up with it still holding the downed officers wrist with one foot on his shoulder shit why had i agreed to this again mia and the baby were in the grip of the second officer being slowly pulled back she could kill them in an instant but she only looked annoyed the third officer had the humans and was hustling them out the click of six safeties going off sounded loudly and then edden shouted dont do it remus let him go and get your face on the floor stay back remus screamed as the remaining humans and inderlanders dove for cover let go of my wife let go or so help me ill kill him i broke his fucking arm and if you dont get back ill shoot him ivy was between me and remus feet wide and hands out in a show of goodwill her body was tense but she was about ten feet backit was too far away for her to grab him easily but also far enough that she could evade all but the most accurate bullet jenks had vanished into the ceiling somewhere id be willing to bet he could dust someones eyes in half a second if he wanted to edden and the rest of the fib officers had frozen not wanting to trip the man into further actionbut it was mia who was the real threat from across the court is officials were watching with concern not wanting to have to take action mia sniping a human in corners and dark alleys could be overlooked to promote a greater peace murdering fib officers in the mall would force them to react and neither party was eager for a war mias lips were open and her pale eyes were narrow in anger hollys voice was high complaining and the banshee looked insulted as she jerked out of the grip of the fib officer holding her upstairs the people behind the gates pressed close trying to see thinking they were safe a cool draft replaced the fleeing inderlanders and humans i said back off remus shouted glancing up at the people whispering from the second floor let my wife go youre hurting my baby let them both go eyes wide and wild he looked to the front of the mall i want a car get me a car edden shook his head remus we cant let you out of here put the gun on the floor and lay down with your hands on your head i promise you no one will hurt your wife or baby remus looked panicked the officer he had pinned under his knee was sweating panting in pain expression tight and probably kicking himself for letting remus get his gun the is personnel inched closer ivy didnt move but i saw her tense so did mia stop she shrilled letting the toddler slip gently to the floor where the little girl stood gripping her mothers leg her eyes wide and silent at last remus stop she said softly her voice elegant and holding an odd accent this isnt going to help me this isnt going to help holly listen to me youre going to hurt holly if you do this she needs a real father remus not a dead memory she needs you the man brought his attention from the upper floors and focused it on his wife grief marked his expression theyll take you from me he begged mia i can get us away i can keep you safe no mia started for remus and ivy intercepted her holding her in a loose but unbreakable grip six feet back holly wobbled unsteadily after her again latching on to her mothers leg for support the is personnel watched tensing one hand on her daughters blond head mia gave ivy a mocking look then focused on remus love she said her wellborn voice full of persuasion its going to be all right she glanced at ivy and in a voice carrying strong conviction she said let me go i can calm him if you dont hes going to kill that officer before you can move and i will lose the only man i can love you know what he means to me let me go ivys grip tightened and mia frowned i can give him peace she insisted its what i do you hurt my friend ivy said softly and a shiver ran through me at her anger it was an accident mia responded coldly leaving him like that was a bad decision we will accept our mistake and do whats necessary to make reparations i have not lived this long by risking my life or letting my instincts rule me i can calm him her voice changed becoming softer but her eyes were almost black with what looked like vampire hunger no one will get hurt she said let me go the law can decide what is just yeah like i believe that remuss breathing was harsh and the man under him was gasping in pain eyes trying to stay open as the agony pulled them shut mia hadnt said trust me but id heard it ivy must have too for she hesitated only briefly before she slowly released the banshee my pulse hammered as the woman stood free shaking her coat as if she were shaking off the memory of ivys touch edden shouted back off and i felt the tension wind tighter even as everyone retreated a faint dusting of gold was sifting down and jenks dropped to my shoulder mia picked up holly and with the toddler on her hip she went to remus as calmly as if they were shopping for peanut butter let the officer go she said laying a light hand on his shoulder they will separate us he pleaded behind him fib officers were creeping closer but edden waved them to a stop when mia caught sight of them i love you mia remus said desperate i love holly i cant live without both of you i cant go back to that place in my head mia made a shushing noise and smiled at him let the man go she said and i wondered if this had played out in their living room before they had fled leaving glenn for dead once they hear what happened we can return to the way we were i doubted that but remus shifted in uncertainty around me the officers tensed let them cuff you she whispered the small woman on tiptoe to almost whisper the words in his ear i will protect you we will not be separated if you love me trust me my eyes narrowed in suspicion trust me jenkss wings clattered and i glanced at him i dont liiiike this he said in a singsong voice yeah me either i was a witch damn it banshees were way out of my league mia put a small hand against his cheek and with holly happily babbling between them remus exhaled his shoulders slumping and his chin dropping to his chest im sorry he said carefully sliding the safety on the gun before tossing it to spin on the floor away from everyone thank you love she said smiling and i wondered if the youngseeming but ageold woman was going to throw him to the mercy of the court letting him take the blame for glenns injuries while she hid behind the excuse of being a bystander she was up to something i could feel it remus let go of the mans wrist and the fib officer cried out in relief edden gestured and the men behind remus moved jerking him off their fellow officer and cuffing him from the other side of the food court the is officers buzzed some of them swearing most laughing ivy pulled herself together trying to find her usual svelte elegance her eyes were black when they met mine a pulse of fear went through me then vanished she looked away and i resolved to keep my distance for a while i should have brought my perfume be careful mia demanded as the officers handled remus roughly a woman cop had closed in on her and holly and seeing it remus stopped his arm muscles straining and a fearful look in his eyes no mia demanded in a high voice before remus could react dont separate us i can keep him calm i never wanted to cause any trouble we were just sitting there jenks snickered from my shoulder didnt want to cause trouble does she really think were buying that crap yeah but look at him i said gesturing at the man under ivys watchful attention mia had rejoined him and he was again docile meek almost creepy definitely it was easier this way and less embarrassing seeing that the is was watching not to mention the news vans out front if it hadnt been for ivy this wouldve been a lot more difficult as long as mia didnt want to cause trouble ivy could keep her in line and with that remus would do the same beside me edden huffed in satisfaction got em both when they were too afraid to even try he said to me gesturing with his chin to the is but i had my doubts that this was over from mias words i guessed she thought all we wanted was remus when she found out we were after her as well things might get ugly i dont like this i murmured to edden thinking this was too easy and he gave me an insulted look okay so we had her walking to the door but she was not going to meekly let us take her baby she lived with a serial killer for crying out loud that she was pushing him around should be a big warning to edden this isnt over i whispered edden snorted what do you want me to do cuff the baby he said then shouted pack it up people started to move remus was led to the front doors his head bowed and looking beaten with his hands cuffed before him ivy and mia were six steps back and jenks and i fell into place after them the baby was still on mias hip and the little girl was watching me from around her mother with eyes so pale they looked albino peeking from under her pink snow hat her hair was a wispy blond that reminded me of trents and it looked nothing like the jetblack severity of her mothers holly had her thumb in her mouth and the childs unblinking stare was getting to me she started to fuss when i looked away and mia jiggled her tension tightened my gut this was too easy youre losing her pixy mia said shooting a glance at us over her shoulder jenks let slip a burst of green dust what he said and i wondered at his panic youve lost her already mia said the banshees voice faint as if she was seeing around corners to the future you see it in her eyes and its killing you slowly ivy gave the woman a soft jerk to turn her back around leave him alone she said then glanced at jenks her eyes crinkled up in disgust shes trying to feed off you she said dont listen shes a liar mia chuckled and jenkss wings fluttered against my neck i dont have to lie and it doesnt matter if he listens to me or not shes going to die and you silly vampire she looked askance at ivy and ivy paled i told you that you were weak what have you done in five years nothing you think youre happy but youre not you could have had everything but now shes gone even though shes right next to you because you were afraid its over you were passive and you lost you may as well be what everyone wants you to be because you arent ever going to find the guts to be who you want i felt the blood leave my face ivys jaw clenched but she kept us moving forward at the same steady pace holly gurgled happily angry that mia was hurting my friends i snarled what about me ms harbor got anything in that bag of hate for me she turned her cold blue eyes to me and the corners of her mouth lifted her eyebrows arched slightly making an expression of pure delighted malice then ivy pushed her through the double set of doors and they were gone it was snowing still and i hesitated in the chill air lock get in my bag jenks i said standing between the doors while fib personnel eddied past us the pixy seemed to be in shock unable to move and i reached up for him im going he snarled wings clattering as he dropped into my waiting bag and i zipped it closed id put a hand heater that deer hunters use in there and i knew hed be all right my knees felt funny as i left the mall and entered the snow and i slowed to try to see if marshal was anywhere no marshal no tomjust faces craning to get a look at something my breath steamed and i was reaching for my gloves when the childprotection van pulled in under the tape the fib had strung up mia remus called out as two men tried to force him in the back of a cruiser his voice was panicked and i watched the banshee stiffen in ivys grip only now did she realize we were after her too remus run she shrieked the baby started to cry and remus exploded into motion his entire face changed gone was the panic replaced by a delicious satisfaction he moved hooking a foot behind one of his captors and giving a yank the man went down slipping on the snow and remus went with him slamming his fists on the mans throat from there he rolled to take the other man down just that fast he was gone spinning under the car and shoving through the crowd get him i cried seeing him up and running awkwardly from the cuffs run remus mia shouted urging him on ivy shoved her at the nearest fib officer then leapt for the cruiser she landed on the hood and the cars shocks squeaked when she jumped off i heard her booted steps in a fast cadence then nothing in a belated rush fib officers started after them on foot or scrambled into their cars it had been only three seconds but edden had lost him the news crews were going nuts and i looked for a place to hide i hated news vans a soft thump pulled my attention from the cold parking lot someone gasped and pointed and i followed a mittened finger to a blue lump on the snowy pavement edden i called unheard over the noise it was the fib officer ivy had shoved mia at the banshee was gone seeing several people trying to help him i scanned the parking lot for mias long blue coat and a pink snowsuit crap on toast id known this was too easy edden i shouted then i saw mia almost thirty feet away head down and walking fast holy cow how had she done that adrenaline pulsed through me and i hesitated for a split second its a banshee i shouldnt be doing this but if i didnt who would hold on jenks i said loudly then looked for eddens gray hair edden i shouted again and when he looked up i threw my bag take care of jenks i exclaimed when he caught it and then i ran after mia why am i doing this they dont even trust me miss oh miss a news reporter said getting in my face and i elbowed her out of my way cries rose up behind me and i couldnt help my smile in three seconds i was through the ring of watchers darkness replaced the glare a muffling silence pushed out the noise action replaced a frustrating inaction i was moving and i had a clear and definite goal mia had a good head start and probably a car but she also had a baby and holly was not happy following the sound of a frustrated toddler i ran through the parked cars the blur of gray and falling snow quickly becoming a background nothing the puddles of overhead light were flashes of interruption i ran chasing a weak prey gaining fast hollys whining grew faint when mias awkwardly running form vanished behind a dumpster next to a delivery entrance in six seconds i was there i skidded to a stop at the mouth of the walled parking lot not wanting to get beaned by anything my eyes scanned the open bay finding mia with her back to a padlocked door and holly clutched to her the small overhead light showed her proud scared determination and i struggled for breath she had no way out ivy would catch remus and i would bring mia back it was done god help me if its not that easy my pulse slowed and i raised a placating hand mia think about it the woman clutched her daughter so tightly the baby started to cry youll kill her the banshee said the anger a stark fury you cant care for her if you take her from me youll kill her as surely as if you drowned her in a well like a cat holly will be fine i took a step forward the tall walls hiding the delivery entrances surrounded me it seemed warmer without the wind and the snow fell peacefully between us the people at social services will take good care of her you cant raise a child on the streets if you run thats all thats left for you ive seen your house mia and you cant live like that you dont want to force holly to live like that give me the baby and well go back everything will be okay there can be a peaceful end to this helpless as she looked i couldnt bring a banshee in alone by force but if i had her baby she wouldnt run off again id been moving forward all this time and now only a few feet separated us what do you know about peace mia said bitterly jiggling holly in a vain attempt to get her to stop fussing youve never lived without running its all you do run run run you know you cant stop if you do it will kill you i halted surprised you dont know anything about me her chin lifted and she shifted holly so they were both facing me finally the little girl stopped crying staring i know everything about you she said i see inside you it pours from you you wont let yourself love anyone like that vamp but unlike ivy whos merely afraid you really cant love anyone youre never going to have the happy ending never no matter how you look for it its out of reach everyone you love you will eventually kill you are alone even now you just dont realize it my jaw was clenched and my hands were fisted it wont work mia i said thinking she was trying to upset me to make herself stronger put the baby down and your hands behind your head ill make sure holly is okay damn it why hadnt i brought my splat gun you want my baby mia mocked fine take her she was holding holly out to me and thinking she was starting to understand i reached out holly gurgled happily i felt the unfamiliar weight of an entirely new person fill my arms mia backed up a step a harsh gleam in her eye as she glanced at the open lot behind me a car was coming and its lights shined into the dead end making it bright thank you mia i said reaching to take hollys hand before she hit my face ill do what i can to keep holly with you hollys cold sticky little fingers met mine and my hand closed reflexively around them pain came from nowhere my heart jumped and i gasped unable to cry out fire blazed across my skin and i found my voice a harsh guttural scream ripped through the icy night and i sank to my knees my skin was on fire and my soul was burning it was burning from my chest outward i couldnt take a new breath it hurt that much people were shouting but they were too far away my pulse was firing madly and every beat pushed the fire through my pores it was being stripped from memy aura was being ripped away and my fear was feeding it holly gurgled happily but i couldnt think to move she was killing me mia was letting holly kill me and i couldnt stop it i managed a harsh gasp and then as suddenly as it had come the pain vanished i felt an icy wash of black flow through me in time with my fading pulse holly cooed and i felt her being lifted from me her lack of weight unbalanced me and i slowly collapsed to the pavement but still the wash of black flowed through me and it was as if i could feel the frightening nothing within me growing larger i couldnt stop it couldnt even think how mia helped me down and grateful for small favors i stared at her exquisite boots god they must have cost more than my last three months of rent combined i could feel the night air raw on my unprotected soul and finally holly stripped the last from me the flood of black slowing to a trickle and stopping to leave only a fading empty warmth i tried to breathe but it wasnt enough the snow hurt where it hit my skin and i whimpered i will not let them take holly mia said as she stood over me youre filthy animals and youd kill her even if only by accident i worked too hard for her shes mine my fingers twitched accidentally rolling a gray pebble between my cold skin and the pavement mia stepped away and vanished her footsteps fading quickly i heard the slamming of a car door and then the cars idling away all that was left was the falling snow each flake making a soft tap as it landed on my eyelashes and cheeks i couldnt close my eyes but it didnt seem to matter as my fingers quit moving and the heavy blackness finally smothered me twelve there was a faint scent of orange antiseptic and the onesided come and go of a distant professional conversation closer the sound of a tv murmured only the low parts audible as if through thick walls i dozed in a pleasant muffled state comfortable and somnolent id been cold and in pain now i was warm and feeling pretty damn good perfectly content to slip further into a dreamless state but the distinctive smell of the sheets tucked up to my chin tickled my memory winding insidiously through my brain looking for a conscious thought then it found one shit i barked adrenaline slamming through me i bolted upright eyes wide and an unreasonable fear jerking me from my drugged haze i was in the hospital rache panicked i turned to the sound of pixy wings sweat beading up on me jenks was inches from my nose his tiny features were pinched and afraid scaring me rache its okay he said as an orange haze drifted from him to color my drawnup knees youre okay look at me youre okay lips parted i focused on him and forced my breathing to slow i was okay and as soon as i realized that i bobbed my head stringy nasty curls shifted to block my eyes and i pushed them back with a shaky hand just that effort seemed to tax me and i let myself fall back into the slightly raised bed sorry i said softly and he landed on my blanketcovered knee i thought i was in the hospital jenkss expression became concerned and his wings stopped ah you are no i said as i found the controls and raised the head of the bed farther i mean i thought i was i hesitated never mind i amended exhaling to get rid of the last of the adrenaline i couldnt tell him i thought i was in the childrens wing where i hadnt been able to cross the room to turn on the tv without going breathless it was that memory that had shocked me awake and i arranged the sheets to cover as much of the ugly whiteandbluediamond gown as possible jeez robbie visits for the first time in eight years and im hospitalized jenks buzzed to the long bed table pushed to the side his wings stilled and the red haze that had been hovering about one wing turned into a bit of red medical tape i sort of remembered the ambulance there was an iv stuck in me and i vaguely recalled the paramedic putting it in he had given me something and after that nothing id had ivs before but they usually went with an amulet if the patient was a witch maybe i was in worse shape than i thought my gaze went to the clock right where they always put it noon it didnt feel like id been unconscious for longer than a single night from cold pavement to hospital i had been there and now i was here there was a stuffed giraffe on the narrow rolling table probably from my mother stuffed animals were her thing beside it was a miniature rose sculpted of stone from bis maybe i took the stuffed animal in my hands feeling the softness against my fingertips in a state of melancholy mia i asked jenks the pixys wings drooped and went a faint blue gone i met his frown with my own remus him too he made the short flight to the bars on the bed slipping slightly he sideswiped ivy with a pipe otherwise wed have him alarmed i stiffened but his lack of reaction told me she was all right shes madder than a jilted troll he said with a wry expression but shes okay nothing broken by the time she got up he was gone she tracked them to a busy street and thenpoof hotwired a car and somehow slipped past the fib roadblocks eddens pissed and baby makes three i thought as i set the giraffe down crap on toast they could be long gone i hoped audrey was right that banshees never left their city or wed never find them jenks reached back to fix the red bit of tape on his wing and i flushed remembering having thrown him at edden hey im sorry about your wing i said and he brought his gaze to mine his eyes green under the yellow shock of hair i did that didnt i i added pointing with my gaze im sorry nahhh im fine he drawled as his hand came forward it gave matalina something to do besides yell at the kids this happened in eddens car chasing remus i wasnt sure i believed him how about you jenks asked sitting crosslegged beside a mug of water bigger than his cat you feel okay your aura isreally thin i held a hand in front of my face and wished i could see my own aura the demon mark on my wrist looked ugly and i let my hand drop holly stripped it from me i said took it along with my lifes energy thats why i passed out i think has anyone looked at glenns aura thats probably what happened to him too jenks nodded right after you came in mumbling about your aura being gone hes awake now i saw him his aura is patchy but it will thicken that freaky little baby cant even talk yet and shes a born killer she shouldve killed you the doctors dont know why she didnt they dont know why you woke up three days earlier than glenn either they were here staring at you and asking each other all sorts of questions looking at your demon scars his lips pressed tight as a feeling of angst slid through me i dont like it rache me neither feeling violated i tugged my blankets up a little had my demon marks saved me made my aura taste bad i remembered a sensation of black coursing through me as holly stripped everything like she was sucking the last milk from a bottle bubbles and all i didnt like that something evil had saved me it was bad enough that i had demon scars but that i had to be grateful for them for saving my life wasperverted jenkss wings hummed fitfully rising up he said with forced cheerfulness youve got company i can hear him in the hall edden i wondered as i was making sure i was covered when a soft knock at the cracked door turned into a soft scuffing marshman jenks exclaimed a sunbeam trailing behind him when he went to the door how you doing rachels happy to see you eyebrows raised i gave jenks a sidelong glance im happy to see him sitting straighter i waved sloppily at the tall man as he entered he had his coat open showing a flannel shirt with a wisp of curling black peeping out at the neckline the casual lumberjack cut of the shirt hung nicely on his broad swimmers shoulders tucked into his jeans to show off his thin waist there was a bouquet of flowers in each hand and he looked awkward as he stopped before me hi rachel he said smiling uncertainly as if not sure he should be here ah you get what you needed in the mall i laughed and shifted more upright i knew how i looked in blue diamonds and it wasnt attractive thanks i said sourly sorry about that she ran i chased her dumb and you got bansheeslapped he said putting the two bouquets down and sitting on the edge of the bed beside me are you okay they wouldnt let me ride with you to the hospital you were delirious he hesitated did you really steal mr rays wishing fish i blinked uh yeah but i thought it belonged to the howlers my gaze dropped from his concerned brown eyes to the flowers one was an arrangement of summer daisies the other a carnation and mum mix thank you i said as i reached to touch them you didnt need to bring me flowers they are beautiful did they have a buy one get one free special downstairs my voice was light and marshal smiled dont think anything because i brought you flowers if i didnt my mom would skin me alive besides only one is from me the daisies were sitting downstairs with your name on them so i brought them up my eyes went to the florists card in an envelope and i nodded robbie maybe as in pushing up daisies thanks i said and he made a little jump as if remembering something i brought you this too he said reaching into a coat pocket to bring out a winterpale tomato it was an inderland tradition and i couldnt help but grin for health he said then glanced at the closed door youre uh on a human floor so watch where you put it the fruit was cold in my fingers and my smile faded why am i on a human floor the sound of jenkss wings rose in pitch and he took flight ah i promised ivy id tell her when you woke up he said as he rose up i gotta go jenks is she okay i asked but he was gone rolling my eyes i leaned to put the tomato on the table and my knees knocked into marshal my eyes went to the flowers and all my warning flags went up he was sitting kind of close um it was awfully nice of you to come and see me i said nervous im not going to be here long i was just about ready to get up and go harass the nurses i knew i was filling the silence with my babbling and in a surge of motion i flung the covers back and pulled my knees up to get my feet past him and to the floor i froze looking down at those stupid pink sock slippers they give out damn it i had a catheter even worse just that little exertion made me dizzy easy rachel marshal said already having stood and put his hands heavily on my shoulders i dont think youre ready to move yet your aura is really torn up the heady aroma of redwood cascaded over me seeming all the more potent for the sterile smells of the hospital im fine marshal im fine i complained as the dizziness passed it was almost as if i was leaving a part of myself behind when i moved and until it caught up with me i was naked exhausted i sat with my feet dangling down and leaned my head against his chest while i tried to keep from blacking out it felt nice when his hands rested on me not sexual nicegod i was in a hospital bed with pillow hair and wearing a blue diamond patternit was as if i were gaining strength from his simple concern i settled back under his insistent nervous hands and he pulled the blanket up and around me i lay there and let him do it probably feeding his whiteknight complex but what choice did i have if my aura was stripped then i probably was gaining something from him genuine caring helped mend tears just as the negative energy from someone who disliked me could do an equal amount of damage really i said as he handed me the oversize mug of iced water as if it would make everything better im okay i just need to move slower but my hands were shaking and i was nauseous the water seemed to help and i took a big gulp feeling it all the way down ivy will break my fingers if i let you hit the floor he grumbled taking the water back as i extended it just be good for the next twenty minutes and dont get me in trouble okay i tried to smile but i was trembling inside fatigue pulled at me and memories of my early years in and out of hospitals came flooding back i dont even know what happened i complained i mean i remember up to blacking out but after that pfft marshal sat on the edge of the bed again as if i might try to get up no doubt a banshee rachel what were you thinking youre lucky to be alive my right shoulder lifted and fell who else had a chance to catch her edden had probably checked me in maybe that was why i was on a human floor i could lie in bed at home for a lot less money david was going to be ticked when my insurance went up remembering marshal i sighed yep a banshee and her kid and her homicidal husband at the mall no less he smiled one almost of pride you made the news knocking over that reporter my eyes flicked to his and i winced they got it on tape leaning forward he tucked a stray curl behind my ear making me shiver when my thoughts went to kistens boat knocked her right on her can he said oblivious it was good seeing you in action like that again his smile faded and i realized this was twice now he had seen me on the news the first time id been cuffed um thanks for coming to see me i said sensing a growing awkwardness as if he had stepped past our agreedon boundaries smile gone he leaned back he looked everywhere but at me tried the pudding yet no but i doubt its changed since i was here last he chuckled and i tried to decide if i was willing to risk taking the catheter out by myself the one time i had id hurt myself more than one would believe possible i didnt want to stay here and if my vitals were normal they wouldnt keep me for simple fatigue the sound of jenks returning drifted into the uncomfortable silence between marshal and me and we exchanged knowing smiles jenks was like a little kid you could hear long before you could see him his voice was high as he talked to someone whose voice was a dull murmur and they were moving slowly ivy maybe my pulse increased and marshal stood when the thick oversize door creaked open he looked nervous and i didnt wonder why ivy didnt like him and she took few pains to hide it hey jenks shouted loudly as he circled the room three times look who i found i found myself smiling not only was it ivy but glenn too moving slowly and supported between ivy and the iv stand the black man looked awful and it wasnt just from the hospital gown still i met him grin for grin when he looked up from the floor clearly pleased to be functioning even on this reduced level his face was an ugly purple in places and his hand gripping ivys arm was swollen the cuts covered with starkwhite bandages hi rachel he breathed then focused on the tile and moving forward marshal nodded his hello to ivy and after nudging the tomato behind the flowers before glenn spotted it he moved to the distant couch built into the wall under the window so the ailing fib agent could have the closer chair oddly enough ivy looked like she knew what she was doing competently shifting him around and making sure his iv didnt get tangled she even knew to hold his gown shut while he angled to sit in the chair he eased into it with his arm muscles straining and he exhaled long and loud when his weight left his feet rachel he said before he got his breath back altogether ivy told me you were here and i had to see it for myself you look as bad as i feel girl yeah i shot back give me a few hours and ill wipe the floor with you in a game of round the nurses desk as far as i was concerned he was in way worse shape than i but he looked a whole lot better than when id seen him last unconscious and surrounded by white sheets that i couldnt stand up yet didnt mean anything id be walking before sunset even if i had to crawl to do it ivy came closer and a pang of emotion went through me the chair glenn was now in had been pulled to the bedside when i woke up id be willing to bet shed been sitting in it all night she looked tired and i wondered if she had slept at all this morning hi ivy i said as i reached outknowing she wouldnt jenks said remus hit you you okay jenks clattered his wings behind the flowers and ivys calm face scrunched up im fine more mad at myself than anything her fingers touched mine and i heard everything she wasnt going to say im glad youre awake she said softly you had us worried my pride took a hit i said ill be fine soon as i can stand jenks looked out around a plastic vase with a questioning expression his hands full of pollen and marshal popped his knuckles realizing the men had become uncomfortable i flushed our fingers parted marshal youve met glenn havent you i said suddenly hes the fibs inderland specialist glenn marshal is the swim coach at the university marshal came forward leaning past the corner of the bed he carefully shook glenns bandaged hand nice to meet you he said and i couldnt help but notice there hadnt been a flicker of concern or reluctance in meeting an fib officer not like with nick and i smiled its a pleasure glenn responded have you and rachel known each other long no he said quickly but i felt he deserved more than that sort of i spoke up before jenks who had risen up above the flowers could marshal helped jenks and me on that run up in michigan hes been in cincinnati since halloween pulling snakes from under my kitchen floor and teaching me how to rock climb ivy snickered at the reference to tom and glenns head went up and down in slow consideration his gaze becoming more accepting i knew he believed nick was still alive which he was the son of a bastardand seeing that my exboyfriend and master thief had a record thicker than the phone book i wouldnt be surprised if the fib detective grilled marshal later over what he knew about nick ivy made a small sound of interest when she opened the card from the second batch of flowers i wanted to ask her about her leg but she wasnt favoring it and i knew she wouldnt appreciate me bringing it up in front of other people slacker i said to glenn and when he gave me a tired lopsided smile i added hows your aura thin i dont know how its supposed to feel but i feelweird three witches looked at me after you came in every one of them said i was lucky to be alive jenks snorted they came in and poked rachel too he said left grumbling i exhaled slowly bringing up my second sight without tapping a line so i didnt run the risk of seeing the everafter not in a hospital six floors up sure enough glenns aura was raggedy leaking red around the broken edges and looking like a fluctuating aurora borealis instead of a continuous sheet the gaps were not healthy and until they healed hed be vulnerable to all sorts of metaphysical things that i was in the same condition made my stomach turn and i have a date with al in the everafter at sunrise tomorrow i had to get out of it surely al would give me a sick day for this i should ask for a work excuse are you okay i asked glenn truly concerned he looked so far out of character the exmilitary man in him peeked through when he forced himself to sit straighter his face freshly shaved the scent of shampoo coming faintly to me i will be he said around a heavy breath you went after them you know it you touched the baby he asked and i snorted dont touch the baby he intoned and the corners of my mouth lifted dont touch the baby i echoed realizing that that was probably what had downed him its the baby whos got the witch doctors so messed up glenn said almost crossing his knees before remembering he was in a peekaboo gown they tell me that a banshee child has no control until shes about five but that man was holding her when i talked to him jenkss wings clattered for attention we saw him holding holly too his aura was fine i saw it so did rachel i nodded not making any sense out of it maybe she just wasnt hungry maybe glenn said but she drained me fast enough you too ivy went to sit on the long bench under the window so what did happen in that house she said as she looked out and i swear she was trying to change the subject her lips were parted and her breathing was a shade too fast her eyes too held a hint ofguilt glenn made an ugly face i went to talk to the suspect about the death of my friend suspect i thought hearing the ugliness of the word she wasnt ms harbor or the lady or even the woman but the suspect then again mia had probably killed his friend put glenn in the hospital and allowed her daughter to almost kill me im sorry i said and he grimaced not wanting the sympathy her husband didnt like some of my questions remus is it glenn asked and when ivy nodded he continued remus tried to bully me out the door took a swing at me and we knocked about the house i actually had him handcuffed and then you touched the baby jenks said from somewhere in the flowers glenn looked at his knees covered with that blue diamond print i touched the baby dont touch the baby i said trying to ease the tension no wonder mia didnt let anyone touch holly not to mention her not wanting any more kids until holly had grown and had some control right now she was like the walking plague but remus could hold her what made him special glenn shifted his feet in those slipper socks they give you his were blue the baby put me out not remus he said once i fell down i kept falling i think he beat me slowly so they could suck it all up if it hadnt been for the badge i think they would have killed me and tried to hide the body seeing the horror in my eyes he attempted to smile but you look great he said gesturing maybe witches have thicker auras maybe i said unable to look at anyone of course i looked better i hadnt had a psychopath maul me for the feeding pleasure of his family standing awkwardly at the foot of the bed marshal seemed to gather himself rachel i have to go he said not unexpectedly ive got some stuff to do this afternoon and i just stopped by to make sure you were okay his feet shuffled and he added ill um see you later glenn leaned back cutting short his motion to cross his legs when he remembered the hospital gown dont leave because of me he said his body language not matching his words i have to get back to my room before im missed they dont like it when us rough men go past the nurses desk and into the womens area marshal shifted back and forth then as if making a decision he leaned close and gave me an awkward hug uneasy i returned it hoping he wasnt trying to shift our relationship simply because i was vulnerable and he had helped me with tom tom was small potatoes to what could come crashing into my kitchen but the scent of redwood was comforting plucking a need to go back to my roots and i breathed it in deep ill see you later he said earnestly im still checking into your classes but if theres anything i can do shopping errands just call me i smiled touched by his concern my moms warning that he was a good diversion not a good decision echoed through me but so did the entire comfortable evening spent with her my brother and marshal marshal was a nice guy and i didnt often have the chance to do stuff with nice guys i didnt want to endanger him by close association but what came out of my mouth was i will bye marshal thanks for the flowers he nodded waving before going with his head lowered leaving the door open a crack glenn took in ivy and jenks eyeing me as if in disapproval clearing his throat he said youre taking classes thats great crime scene etiquette perhaps i rubbed my eyebrow feeling a headache coming on ley lines i said there was a mixup at the registrars office marshal is trying to work it out thats not all hes trying to work out jenks muttered and i scowled at him when he shifted to the mums the scent of a summer meadow grew heavy and pollen streaked his green shirt hes going to want to change things the pixy said and glenn leaned back mouth shut to listen you being in the hospital is going to jerk him into rescue mode just like on that boat of his i saw it in him right after he yanked tom out from under our kitchen im a pixy rachel i may look all tough and stuff but i got wings and i know infatuation when i see it i sighed not surprised he was warning me off marshal and what do wings have to do with it well hes not helpless i said defensively tagging a ley line witch is hard jenks crossed his arms and frowned ivy put the giraffe down and eyed me too yeah yeah yeah i muttered but my thoughts went zinging to mia standing in the dark with her wailing child clutched to her telling me that id never love anyone without killing them he deserves someone better than me i know the drill ivy moved uneasily and shoving my unhappy feeling away i turned to glenn the detective was very adept at reading people and this was embarrassing so hows the pudding i asked reaching out and tossing the tomato to him humans normally abhor tomatoes seeing as it was a tomato that killed a good slice of their population a mere forty years ago glenn however had been shown the joys of the red fruit at fang point and was now hooked after his first panicked juggling to keep the tomato from hitting the ground he cradled the fruit like a baby in the crook of his arm the pudding is nasty he said glad for the shift in conversation its sugar free and thank you i dont get many of these inderland tradition i said wondering if id missed breakfast and would have to wait another six hours i had yet to see a menu but theyd still feed me ivy sat on the foot of the bed more comfortable now that there was one less person in here flowers from trent she said her eyebrows high as she handed me the card surprised i looked at the daisies as i took it ceri sent them i said when i saw her absolutely tiny handwriting trent probably doesnt even know she put his name on the card jenks landed on my knee i bet he does he said with a guffaw and then we all looked up at the smart knock on the door and the woman in street clothes walking in she had a stethoscope and i knew she was my doctor before she opened her mouth she stopped short as if surprised by the number of people then recovered ms morgan she said as she came forward briskly im dr mape how are you feeling today it was always the same question and i smiled neutrally i could tell by the lack of a redwood smell that even the most stringent antiseptics couldnt cover that she wasnt a witch it was unusual that theyd let a human treat a witch with human medicine but if id been hit with the same thing as glenn i probably had his doctor the thought seemed about right when glenn shrank back in his chair with a guilty expression the tomato too was in hiding somewhere i didnt want to know where i truly didnt im feeling much better i said blandly what did they use to knock me out dr mape pulled the blood pressure cuff off the wall and i obediently stuck my arm out i dont know off the top of my head she said in a preoccupied voice as she squished my arm with air pressure i can look at your chart i stared at the clock and tried to keep my pulse slow dont bother i knew amulets not drugs hey can i get a work excuse she didnt answer and glenn jumped when she ripped the cuff from me mr glenn she said pointedly and i swear he held his breath you shouldnt be walking this far yet yes maam he said grumpily and i hid a grin do i need to put a restriction on you she asked and he shook his head no maam wait for me outside the woman said severely ill walk you back ivy stirred from her corner cripes i hadnt even seen her move there ill help him to his room she offered and the womans quick refusal died when she saw who it was youre ivy tamwood she asked then wrote my blood pressure on my chart thank you id appreciate that his aura isnt thick enough to be mingling jenks rose up from the flowers this time covered in pollen aw were all his friends the pixy said shaking in midair to create a dust cloud dr mape started what are you doing out of hibernation she asked shocked i cleared my throat dryly he uh lives in my desk i offered then shut my mouth when dr mapes stuck a thermometer in it i bet thats fun the woman murmured as the instrument worked i shifted the probe to the other side of my mouth its his kids who drive me nuts i mumbled and the thermometer beeped again dr mape made a note in my chart then bent to look under the bed your kidneys look fine she said im going to leave the iv in but ill take the catheter out now glenn stiffened uh rachel the man said uncomfortably ill see you around okay give me a day before we go racing down the halls ivy got behind him holding his gown shut as he reached for his iv and used it to haul himself up jenks she said as they shuffled into motion get your pixy ass in the hall he gave me a lopsided grin then buzzed out making circles around ivy and glenn the door eased shut and his voice faded i started to scrunch down to make this as easy as possible then stopped when dr mape pulled glenns chair back and sat silently eyeing me suddenly i felt like a bug on a pin she wasnt saying anything and finally i offered a hesitant youre going to take it out right the woman sighed and eased into a more comfortable position i wanted to talk to you and this was the easiest way to get them to leave i didnt like the sound of that and a ribbon of fear pulled through me leaving prickles of unease i spent the first fifteen years of my life in hospitals dr mape i said boldly as i sat up ive been told im going to die more often than i have pairs of boots and i have a lot of boots theres nothing you can say thats going to throw me it was a lie but it sounded good you survived the rosewood syndrome she said flipping back in my chart i stiffened when she reached for my wrist turning it over and looking at the demon mark maybe thats why the banshee child didnt kill you is she talking about my blood disease or my demon mark uneasy i pulled my arm out of her grip either way i was different and not in a good way you think my aura tastes bad dr mape was looking at my hands and i wanted to hide them i wouldnt know she said from what ive been told auras dont have a taste i do know a banshee child will take long past when shes sated and thats more than enough to kill a person you and mr glenn are very lucky to be alive ms harbor keeps her child well fed well fed my ass she almost killed me leaning back dr mape looked out my window and to the other wing she should be commended for raising a child to the age of reason not hunted down like an animal when an accident occurs did you know that until a banshee reaches about the age of five anyone who touches her aside from her mother is considered a food source even her own human father is that so i said thinking remus had held her without a slip of his aura being taken when everyone around was being slowly siphoned forgive me if im not all flowers and hearts over her predicament that woman handed holly to me knowing she would kill me that child very nearly killed glenn mia herself has killed people they just havent tied them to her yet im all for staying alive but i dont kill people to do it dr mape looked at me impassively of course i sympathize with you and mr glenn but in most situations banshees take only the dregs of society ive seen much worse humanonhuman predation and what mia did was for her survival in whose judgment i said snottily then forced myself to relax this was the woman who was going to give me my work excuse again dr mape was untouched and she leaned over to put an elbow on her knee so she could study me my question is why you suffered significantly less damage than mr glenn humans and witches have the same aura strength know all about us huh i said then bit my tongue shes not the enemy shes not the enemy actually i do thats why i took you as a patient she hesitated then added im sorry ms morgan they wont allow you on the witches floor anymore because of your demon scars im all youve got i stared at her excuse me they wouldnt treat me because of my demon scars what did my scars have to do with it it wasnt like i was a black witch but youll treat me i said bitterly i took a vow to protect life the same belief that causes me to look upon that banshee mother with compassion is why i agreed to treat you id rather judge a person on why they make the choices they do rather than the cold facts of what they choose i settled back wondering if it was wisdom or a copout dr mape stood and my gaze followed her up i know captain edden from when his wife was attacked she said he told me how you got your demon marks ive see whats left of your aura and now ive seen your friends pixies dont give their loyalty lightly i frowned as she turned to leave turning back she asked why do you think you came in semiconscious and mr glenn remained unconscious for three days i dont know i really didnt think it was from the demon marks if it had been then black witches couldnt be harmed by banshees and i knew that wasnt true it had to be because i was aa protodemon but i wasnt going to tell her that your survival of the rosewood syndrome she questioned thats what my colleagues support it was too close to what i suspected and i forced myself to look at her and shrug she hesitated to be sure i wasnt going to say any more then turned to leave hey what about my catheter i shot after her wanting some small part of myself back ill have a nurse come in she said youll be staying with us for a few days ms morgan i hope you feel comfortable enough to talk to me soon my jaw dropped as she closed the door with a firm thump so that was her game she wouldnt release me until i satisfied her curiosity well to hell with that i had stuff to do the faint familiar clatter of dragonfly wings drew my attention to the top of the tall wardrobe jenks i said warming i thought you were gone he flitted down darting back and forth before landing on my knee ive never seen a catheter taken out he said smugly and you never will god get out before the nurse gets here but he only moved to the flowers and started to take the dead bits off youre stuck here until you talk eh he said mind if matalina and i borrow your jewelry box we have got to get away from the kids for a while euwie jenks i didnt want to know im out of here as soon as i can stand up i said as i tried to get the thought of matalina with her feet among my earrings out of my head six oclock at the latest i stretched experimentally wincing one way or another i was leaving al expected me for my lesson and if i didnt show up in the ley line hed track me down a demon in a hospital would do wonders for my reputation course that was one way to get out of here jenks turned his clever hands folding a daisy petal up to hold a handful of pollen yeah you think theyre going to just let you walk out of here dr frankenstein wants you for her science experiment i smiled feeling my pulse begin to quicken and anticipation warm my blood all the way to my toes walk out of here is exactly what im going to do i didnt spend my formative years in the hospital and learn nothing about how to sneak out jenks just smiled thirteen my curls were nearly dry and moving irritatingly slowly i used the comb in the hospital care kit to try to smooth out the tangles the shampoo and cream rinse had been from the kit as well and i wasnt eager to find out how much cracking the thumbsize bottles was going to cost me i was betting five bucks a bottle it was worse than the amenities fridge in a fivestar hotel but asking ivy to run home and get my stuff wasnt going to happen the less i was carting out of here the less likely someone would realize i was a fleeing patient before the turn you could ask for an ama or against medical advice discharge and be done with it but after the quickly spreading pandemic had ravaged the population legislation gleefully took away a lot of patients rights unless you did the paperwork ahead of time it took forever and a day to get an ama if i wanted to leave i had to sneak out id likely have cops after me as the hospital tried to protect themselves from a lawsuit but theyd go away once the ama came in my shower this evening had tragically turned from the expected fortyminute indulgence in someone elses hot water into a fiveminute rush the force of the water beating into me had made me dizzy giving me the sensation that i was washing my aura off with the soap but i now sat reasonably comfortably on the hard couch by the nightdark window dressed in the clothes ivy had brought over jeans and a black sweater she had complimented me on the first time id worn it id thought a hot shower would be just the thing but the activity turned into an exercise in learning how fast i could move or couldnt move rather my aura was uncomfortably thin and every time i shifted quickly i seemed to lose my equilibrium i got cold too oddly so almost an ache weird glenn had said that was the word for it giving up i flicked the comb into the trash and wondered if anyone had bothered to tell pierce what had happened and that i was all right probably not it was drafty by the window and when i peeked past the curtain the gleam of the red and white car lights against the snow made it seem all the colder i reached to put on my coat and found a new scrape on the right sleeve crap frowning i shrugged into it carefully levered my boots onto the couch and sat with my arms wrapped around my knees my smiling giraffe was sitting across from me and memories came creeping back memories of me sitting like this waiting for my dad to get better or die older memories of me waiting for my mom to come pick me up and take me home sighing i dropped my chin onto my knees my mom and robbie had visited earlier mom had been shocked when i told her it was a banshee attack and robbie predictably went off the deep end his exact words involved hell and an ice storm but hed never approved of my career choice so what he cared didnt matter i loved him but he was a prick when it came to trying to make me fit into his ideas of what i should be hed left when i was thirteen and i would always be thirteen in his mind at least when marshal found out id be sneaking out tonight hed asked if he could help after seeing him take down tom i was of a mind to accept his offer but i was holding him in reserve in case i had to flee my safe house for a new one once the ama police came after me the almost unheard squeak of the oversize door drew my attention across the dimly lit room and i lifted my head it was ivy and jenks and i smiled and put my feet on the floor jenks reached me first the slight dust from him leaving a faint trail in the dark room you ready he said buzzing around my damp hair before shunning my shoulder he was wearing matalinas latest attempt at pixy winter wear and the poor guy had so much blue fabric wrapped around him he could hardly put his arms down just have to tie my boots i said as i shoved the giraffe into my bag next to biss carved rose id take it after all are we set with keasley ivy nodded as i sent my fingers among my laces the cops would check the church my moms house was out too even if i wanted to put up with robbies pointed barbs but keasley could put us up for a few days ceri was spending much of her time in the kalamack compound and i knew hed enjoy the company as well as the full pantry wed leave him with ivy was wearing her long leather coat over a pair of jeans and a brown sweater i knew it was her attempt to try to blend in but she could wear a discount special and still turn heads she had put on some makeup and her hair was pulled back apparently she was growing it out again and the gold highlights had been colored over concern flickered in her dark eyes as she approached her pupils dilated from the low light not hunger id be worried that she was vamping out from stress but vampires treated the ill and wounded with an eerie gentleness i think it was an instinct that evolved to help keep them from killing their chosen lovers by accident the last place a vampire would sate themselves was a hospital she stood before me evaluating my fatigue with her hand on her hip as i puffed over my boots are you sure you dont want any brimstone she asked and i shook my head brimstone would up my metabolism but id probably hurt myself when i felt better than i really was my metabolism wasnt the problem it was my damaged aura and nothing could replace that but time no i emphasized when she frowned you didnt slip me any did you no god rachel i do respect you she was glaring so i figured she was telling me the truth ivys subtle motions had a layer of hurt to them and when jenks clacked his wings at me i added maybe later once i get out of here thanks that seemed to satisfy her and i stood up jamming my hands into my coat pockets and unexpectedly finding robbies plane tickets feeling sour after his scorn this afternoon concerning my chosen profession i pulled the envelope out to stuff it in my bag the banshee tear that had been in there as well came flying out arcing through the air got it jenks called then realizing what it was he yelped and jerked back so the tear hit the floor and skittered under the bed is that the banshee tear edden gave you he squeaked unusually shaken and i nodded ivy beat me to the floor giving jenks a dry look before she peered under the bed and retrieved it its clear again she said eyes wide as she rose and dropped it into my palm oh that is just freaky uncomfortable i held it in a shaft of incoming streetlight the small pixy hovered over my fingers his wings a harsh blur thats it rache he said floating up to look me eye to eye the tear is why you survived not your demon marks the baby found the tear and took her bottle instead of me i said my relief absolute that it hadnt been my demon marks that had saved me it felt like something black was being pulled through me i though it was the smut on my aura shuddering i dropped the tear in my bag vowing to take it out when we got home maybe thats how remus is staying alive i muttered ivys face went almost terrifyingly blank i looked at her in question and feeling cold i said jenks see if glenn is ready you got it the oblivious pixy said and he darted under the oneinch gap between the door and the floor i sank back to sit on the bed arms crossed as i looked at ivy a shadow against the dark window you ah want to share something with me i asked ivy took a slow breath exhaling she sat in the corner of the long couch and looked at the ceiling at nothing this is my fault she said her eyes black as they came back to me mia going on a killing rampage to engender a child i mean you i said how her hair swung forward to hide her face i gave her my wish the one you gave me i uncrossed my arms and recrossed them the other way you mean from the leprechaun i let go to get out of the is she nodded head down and i squinted not understanding you gave your wish to a banshee why you could have wished for anything ivy shifted her shoulders it was a nervous reaction i didnt see often it was sort of a thankyou i owed her a lot i met mia before i met you my boss art he was jerking me around i was on the fast track but he wasnt going to promote me out from under him until she hesitated and in her silence i heard her unsaid words her boss wanted a taste of her before letting her rise above him i felt myself warm and i was glad the room was dark office politics ivy said her shoulders rounding i didnt want to play them thought i was too good to have to and when i caught art trying to cover up a banshee murder to help boost his bank account i called mia in to find out what was going on at that point she worked with the is policing her species long story short i put art in jail to get out from under him and i thought i had it bad in the is at least i didnt have to frame my supervisor to move ahead and got busted down to babysitting me i said embarrassed and ivy shook her head leaning forward into a shaft of light there were no tears but she looked unhappy no i mean yes but rachel the woman told me some things about myself i was too afraid to admit you know how banshees are they tell you hard truths just to get you angry so they can eat your emotions and she pissed me off by telling me i was afraid to be the person i wanted to be someone capable of loving someone else she shamed me into going off blood god ivy i said still not believing she had given her wish to abanshee you thought going off blood was a good thing it nearly drove you insane her eyes were black in the reduced light of midnight and i stifled a shiver it wasnt the lack of blood that was driving me insane she said and it was a good thing the strength and confidence i gained from it was all i had to fight piscary with it gave me the will i use every day mia said ivy hesitated then softer she said with an old anger mia called me a coward saying that she couldnt love anyone without killing them and that i was a whining child for having the chance to love someone but not the courage to do so and when i met you ivy shrugged when i realized you might love me backmaybe make my life clean somehow embarrassed she rubbed her temples i gave her my wish so she could have the chance to love someone too its my fault shes out there killing people ivy i said softly frozen where i sat im sorry i do love you stop she said holding out a slim hand as if to halt my words i know you do she looked at me jaw clenched and enough anger in her gaze to keep me from moving piscary was right she laughed bitterly and i felt cold the bastard was right all along but i was right too if mia hadnt shamed me into it i wouldnt have found the courage to screw art over and let myself love you ivy oh god ivy never opened up like this voluntarily she must have been really scared about me last night youre like a master vampire you know that ivy pushed herself to the corner of the couch and stared at me almost angry you scare the everloving crap out of me even as i want to wrap myself up in your soul and be safe im sick wanting what scares me i dont want to hurt you i offered not knowing where this conversation was going you have hurt me she said arms around her drawnup knees and her chin high you will again i dont care thats the sick part thats why i dont touch you anymore im addicted to your little white lies i want love but i cant live with myself if i make you hurt me again i dont want pain to feel like love its not supposed to the memory of farcus playing on my scar lifted through me too close hed been too close used me like a match to light his own libido pain turned to pleasurewas it truly perverted if it really felt good im sorry ivy i cant give any more i whispered ivy turned to the window shifting the curtain to look outside im not asking you to scaredycat she said mildly and i saw the signs as she closed her emotions down again dont worry i like things the way they are i didnt tell you this to guilt you into anything i just thought you ought to know why mia harbor has a husband who is immune to a banshees attack i gave her the wish because i owed her she gave me the courage to fight for what i wanted whether i get it or not is immaterial the only way i could thank her was to give her the chance to love and i think she loves him as much as a banshee can my hands were clenched on my arms with enough strength to cramp them and i let go she loves a freaking serial killer i said glad the conversation had swung away from us ivy smiled wanly in the streetlight her hand dropped from the curtain and the shadow hid her face again that doesnt make it any less holly isnt special remus is im sorry i shouldnt have given it to her i had no idea shed use it to kill people for all her strength shes a monster i owe her but im still going to bring her in standing i reached out to draw her to her feet wanting to hug her so shed lose that awful stiffness dont worry about it you didnt know what she was going to do no good deed and all its still my fault my hand touched her shoulder and i drew back when jenks shot under the door in a glittering of silver sparkles that left a steady stream behind as he rose up to our height glenns in the hall he said unusually brighteyed in the dim room good i said faintly turning to get my bag my face was warm and i put a hand to it uh the pixy said hovering uncertainly in the dark did i miss something ivy took my bag from me having to jerk it free no she said then turned to me stay here and ill get you a chair no you wont she had confused me and i didnt know how to stop her from pushing me around right now a chair wasnt in the plan i added i can walk it youre wobbling on your feet ivy said and i shook my head this was a decision i was going to stick with i cant sneak out in a wheelchair i said eyes on the ground until i was sure it wasnt tilting i have to walk really really slowly jenks hovered before us looking like lawrence of arabia with wings no way rache he started his eyes crinkled in worry youre as strong as a fairys hardon i can make it i breathed hesitated then shook my head nice one jenks my head was down as i started for the door and my thoughts were on my laundry list bargain with al for the time off reconstruct the charm to give pierce temporary substance remind marshal that we werent going to move our relationship along simply because one id gotten hurt two hed beaten tom and three wed had a nice dinner with my family i also had to try making that locator charm again not to mention to get a lead on kistens killer look through the records to track down everyone piscary had bled or bedded during his jail time i could do it i could do it all how am i going to do this jenks was flying backward in front of me as i moved from couch to bed to wardrobe gauging my aura no doubt it was irritating to say the least tell glenn were on our way i asked slapping at ivy when she threatened to help me inch along already did jenks landed on my shoulder puffing from the constant weight of his clothes you owe him big rachel he was scheduled to be released tomorrow i clutched my bag and looked at ivy squashing my guilt then lets go ivy nodded touching my shoulder once she headed out see you in the elevator rache jenks said then darted out before the oversize door swung shut behind her alone i let myself lean against the wall exhausted i was breathing heavy and moving slow that wasnt a problem i could do this i had done this lots of times actually with my mom when i wanted to go home and the ama hadnt come in yet sneaking out of the hospital is like riding a bike i thought as i listened to ivy talking to the nurse at the desk then i remembered that id never learned to ride a bike either elevator i whispered cementing it as my goal i could rest there ride up and down until i felt like walking out i waited by the almostclosed door eavesdropping it was about midnight and since i was on a human floor it was quiet perfect get a nurse someone shouted and i heard a clang as something hit a wall jenks started shrieking and i edged forward to peek through the crack in the door there was a distant masculine groan and a heavy orderly rushed past his dreadlocks swinging i eased the door open with my weight shivering when it felt like the varnished wood was stealing the heat from me right through my coat i looked to the right following the sound of the commotion smiling at glenn on the floor at the end of the hall ivy was there with jenks two orderlies and a nurse the guy who delivered the food was there too as i watched glenn groaned convincingly cracking an eye to see me i gave him a bunnyeared kisskiss and he flipped me off turning his smile into a pained moan jenks was right i owed him big pulse racing i hobbled to the elevator around the corner i didnt even have to go by the nurses desk my pace slowly became more sure and my posture upright while fighting the fatigue and mild sensation of walking in deep snow and trying to look as if i was sedate not sedated i turned the corner and the noise behind me grew faint the hallway was empty but i didnt dare use the waisthigh handrail besides the elevator was just ahead i pushed the button then pushed it again until the light went on almost immediately the doors opened and my heart jumped when a couple stepped out they gave me a cursory glance then perked up at the noise glenn was making curiosity was winning when i staggered to the back of the lift and propped myself up in the corner my bag clutched to me the more quickly i moved the worse i felt which really stunk seeing as i was in a turtles footrace for the door i took shallow breaths and stared at the couples backs as the doors slid shut jenks where are you you said youd be here the pixy darted in at the last moment nearly crashing into the back of the elevator rache he said in excitement and vertigo hit me when i flung my hands over my ears not so loud i exclaimed and he dropped to hover at eye level sorry he said looking anything but he followed my weary gaze to the dark panel then flew at it hitting the button for the next level down feet first i heard the whine of electronics click over and we started to descend glenn is good he said as he returned to land on my shoulder i dont think theyll know youre gone until they get someone to take him back to his room excellent i closed my eyes against the vertigo id been afraid the elevator might move too fast to stomach but i couldnt take the stairs even if my aura was dragging behind me as we descended you doin okay he asked worry thick in his tone yep i said propped in the corner its just fatigue i squinted to get him into focus and then the world snapped back when the elevator dinged and the rest of my aura caught up i took a breath letting it slip slowly from me ive got things to do today and i cant do them lazing around in a bed that moves up and down he laughed and i pushed from the wall when the doors opened if all was going well it would be ivy and i didnt want her to think i was a wimp ivy was standing right before the doors and giving me a glance she darted in and clicked the button to close the doors everything okay she asked peachy ivy exchanged a look with jenks and hit the lobby button with a series of taps so rapid that they were almost indistinguishable from each other a little nervous are we the descent was worse this time and i closed my eyes and leaned back in the corner as the elevator picked up speed going almost the full height of the building rache you all right jenks asked and i wiggled my fingers too afraid of what might happen if i nodded my stomach hurt too fast i breathed worried about the ride home i was going to be blowing chunks if we had to drive faster than twenty miles an hour i started to shiver and i clutched my bag to me feeling every muscle i had clench when the lift lurched to a stop the elevator dinged and the doors slid open relieved i opened my eyes to find jenks hovering at the sensor to keep the doors from shutting the soft sounds of a nearly empty lobby filtered in and ivy took my arm i would have protested except i really needed it together we started out of the elevator god i felt a hundred and sixty years old my heart pounding and my knees weak but the slow movement started to feel good and the farther we went the more sure i was that this was the right thing to do i glanced aroundtrying not to look like i wasscopin casual as jenks would say the lobby had a few people passing through it even at midnight and the lights shining down on the entryway illuminated the snowcovered vegetation to make it into indistinguishable blobs it was kind of pretty with the flashing amber lights of the tow truck tow truck hey thats my car i exclaimed upon seeing it parked at the curb in the pickup and dropoff spot but it wouldnt be there long from the looks of it at the sound of my voice two people turned from the big plateglass windows theyd been watching the guy work and my eyes narrowed when i realized it was dr mape and the cop on duty a big vamp from the is great just freaking great plan b ivy jenks said then dove into the elevator thats my car i shouted again then gasped when ivy spun me around and yanked me back into the elevator my back hit the wall and i put a hand to my stomach who saidi panted through the sudden vertigoyou could drive my car the doors snicked shut and cut off the doctors protest i clutched at the walls when the elevator started to go up then forced myself to let go damn it i am not going to get sick who said you could drive my car i said again louder as if i could hold off the dizziness with my voice jenkss wings hummed nervously and ivy flushed what was i supposed to pick you up with my cycle she muttered im in a legal spot i had thirty minutes left theyre towing my car i shouted again pointing and she shrugged ill get it out of impound how are we going to get home now i yelled not liking the feeling of helplessness and ivy pulled out her cell phone from a slim case at her belt god the thing was the size of a credit card ill call kist her voice broke and i stared at her suddenly riven features i mean erica she amended softly shell come get us she works near here turn it to hell ill and heartsick i pressed into the corner of the elevator and tried to find my equilibrium jenks landed on my shoulder relax rache he said his eyes darting to ivy as she hunched in pain her fingers tapping out a text message as fast as if she were at a conventional keyboard you saw the hag of a doctor its not ivys fault they knew you were making a run for it hands splayed i propped myself against the two walls surrounding me it felt as if we were rising through thousands of pinpricks of ice as the world hit me raw unprotected without my full aura it wasnt as if i was in a position to do anything and dr mape would have been a fool for not expecting this multiple escapes were in my record my mom used to sneak me out all the time where are we going i breathed forcing myself to keep my eyes open even though they kept shifting on their own like i had been on a merrygoround for too long the roof i eyed ivy then carefully leaned to push the button for the third floor theres a walkway to the childrens wing on the third floor we can go out that way i muttered and my eyes slid shut just for a moment ivy and jenkss silence pulled them back open what i said why should i go through the laundry chute to the basement floor when i can roll out in a wheelchair ivy shifted her feet youll sit down she asked before i fall down not likely yes i said then accepted ivys arm when the elevator stopped and the world magically returned to normal the elevator doors slid open with a ding and jenks flew out darting back before we had gone three steps theres a chair over here he said and i leaned against the wall beside the fake potted plant as ivy used one hand to keep me upright and the other to almost throw the chair open the locks snapping in place from the sudden shock of being jerked to a stop sit she said and i gratefully sat i had to get home everything would be better if i could just get home ivy pushed me into motion taking advantage of the empty hall to race for the walkway dizziness roared from everywhere slipping out of the corners where the walls and floor met chasing after me as ivy raced slow down i whispered but i think it was my lolling head that got her to stop either that or jenks screaming at her what the hell are you doing jenks was shouting and i gritted my teeth struggling to keep from throwing up getting her out of here she snarled from somewhere far away and distant behind me you cant move her that fast he yelled dusting me as if he could give me a false aura shes not moving slowly because shes hurt shes moving slowly to keep her aura with her you just freaking left it back at the elevator ivys voice was a mere whisper of oh my god i felt a warm hand on me rachel im sorry are you okay it was getting better surprisingly fast and the world stopped spinning looking up i squinted until she came into focus yeah i took a cautiously deep breath just dont go that fast crap how was i going to handle the car ivys face was scared and i reached up to touch her hand still on my shoulder im okay i said risking another deep breath where are we she pushed us back into motion almost crawling jenks flying a close flank nodded the childrens wing she whispered fourteen anxious i pressed my knees together as ivy wheeled me down the hall wed passed the long walkway over the service drive and we were indeed in the childrens wing an awful feeling of dread and familiarity settled in me and my gut clenched the smell was different holding the scent of baby powder and crayons the walls were a warmer yellow now and the railingsi eyed them as we rolled past there was a second lower set which just about killed me pictures of puppies and kittens were on the walls at seated height and rainbows kids shouldnt be ill but they were they died here and it wasnt fair i felt the prick of tears and jenks landed on my shoulder you okay it isnt fair damn it no i said forcing myself to smile so he wouldnt ask ivy to stop i could hear kids talking loudly with the intensity that children used when they knew they had only a short time to make their voices heard we were going by the playroom the tall windows with the blinds open to show the snow and the ceiling lights turned up to make it almost as bright as noon it was just after midnight and only the inderlander kids would be up most of them in their rooms with a parent or two having their dinner if they could swing it most parents visited during meals to try to make their childs hospital room into a piece of the familiar by eating with them and the kidswithout exceptionwere too kind to tell them it only made home look that much farther away we slowly rolled by the bright room with its nightblack windows i wasnt surprised to see it empty but for the pack of kids whose parents were too far away to stop in for meals or had other responsibilities they were an independent bunch and they talked a lot i smiled when they caught sight of us but shock filled me when one of them shouted ivy immediately the table in the far corner emptied out and i sat in amazement as we were suddenly surrounded by kids in brightly colored pjs one was enthusiastically dragging her iv stand behind her and three had lost their hair from chemotherapy still legal after the turn when more effective biomedicines were not the oldest of the three a skinny girl with her jaw clenched lagged behind with a tired determination she wore a bright red bandanna that matched her pajamas and it gave her an endearing badgirl look ivy ivy ivy a redcheeked boy about six shouted again shocking the hell out of me when he flung himself at ivys knees in an enthusiastic hug ivy flamed red and jenks laughed spilling dust in a sheet of gold did you come to eat with us and throw peas at the parrot the girl with the iv asked and i turned in my chair to see ivy all the better pixy pixy pixy the boy on her legs shouted and jenks flew up out of his reach uh im going to do a nurse check he said nervously then zipped off at ceiling height there was a chorus of disappointment and ivy disentangled herself kneeling to put us all on the same level no daryl she said im sneaking my friend out for some ice cream so lower your voices before they check up on you immediately the shouts diminished to giggling whispers one of the bald kids a boy by the cowboys on his pajamas ran to the end of the hall and peeked around the corner he gave us a distant thumbsup and everyone sighed there were only five of them but they all apparently knew ivy and they clustered around us likekids shes a witch the redcheeked boy still attached to ivys leg said pitching his tone imperialistically his hand was on his hip and he was clearly the floors selfproclaimed king she cant be your friend vampires and witches dont make friends she has a black aura the girl with the iv said backing up her eyes were wide but i could tell by her plump healthy body that she was going to survive she was one of the kids who come in stay then leave never to return she must be special to have been accepted into what was clearly the clique of children whowerent going to have an easy go of it are you a black witch the girl who had lagged behind asked her brown eyes were huge in her medicineravaged face there was no fear in her not because she was ignorant but because she knew she was dying and she knew i wasnt going to be the cause of her death my heart went out to her she was seeing around corners but not yet ready to go one more thing possibly to see and do ivy shifted uncomfortably at her question rachel is my friend she said simply would i be a friend to a black witch you might daryl said haughtily and someone stepped on his foot to make him yelp but her aura is black the king protested and she has a demon mark see everyone drew back with fear except the tall girl in the red pajamas she simply stood before me and looked at my wrist and unlike most times when someone pointed it out and i tried to hide it i turned my hand up for all of them to see i got it when a demon tried to kill me i said knowing most of them had to gain a lifetime of wisdom in just a few years and had no time for pretend yet pretend was all they had i had to accept a very bad thing to survive small heads bobbed and eyes grew wide but the king lifted his chin and took a stance that was utterly charminga round chubby jenks with his hands on his hips thats evil he said certain of his belief you should never do anything evil if you do you are evil and go to hell my mom says so i felt ill when the smallest girl with the iv shrank back farther yet tugging at her friend to leave with her im sorry ivy whispered as she stood up and took the handles of the wheelchair i didnt think they would come over they dont understand but the thing was they did understand they had the wisdom of the world in their eyes they understood too well and seeing their fear i felt my heart gray ivy made shooing motions with her hand and they broke their circle all except the skinny girl in the bright red pajamas seeing my misery she reached out with her small smooth child hands and delicately took my wrist with her pinkie extended turning my hand palm up she used a finger to slowly trace the circle and line ivys friend isnt evil for doing something to survive what hurt her she said her voice soft but certain you take poison to kill the bad cells in you daryl just like me it hurts you makes you tired makes you sick but if you didnt you would die ivys friend took a demon mark to save her life its the same thing ivys motion to push the chair stopped the kids went silent each thinking assessing what they had been told with the harsh reality of what they lived with daryls sure look faltered and he pushed forward not wanting to look like a coward or worse cruel he peered over the arm of the wheelchair at my scar then up to my face his small round face broke into a smile of acceptance i was one of them and he knew it my jaw unclenched and i smiled back im sorry daryl said then scrambled up to sit in my lap youre okay my breath came fast in surprise but my hands naturally folded around him to keep him in place so he wouldnt fall daryl gave a hop and settled in snuggling his head under my chin and tracing the demon scar as if to memorize its lines he smelled like soap and under that of a green meadow faraway and distant i blinked fast to keep the tears from brimming over and ivy laid a hand on my shoulder the girl with the red pajamas smiled like ceri wise and fragile youre not bad inside she said petting my wrist just hurt she put her hand on daryls shoulder and her gaze going distant she murmured it will be okay theres always a chance it was so close to what i was feeling what id felt when i was growing up that i leaned forward and with daryl between us i gave her a hug thank you i whispered my eyes closed as i held her to me i needed to remember that youre very wise daryl slid down and away squirming to get out from between us darting to stand nearby looking uncomfortable yet pleased to have been included thats what my mom says the girl said her eyes wide and serious she says the angels want me back so i can teach them about love i closed my eyes but it didnt do any good and a hot tear slipped down im sorry i said as i wiped it away id just broken one of the secret rules ive been away too long its okay she said youre allowed if there arent any parents around my throat closed up and i held her hand it was all i could do jenkss wings clattered a warning and all the kids sighed and drew back when he landed on my upraised hand they know where you are he said ivy almost forgotten shifted the chair rolling it back as she turned to look behind us we have to go she said to the kids instead of the expected complaints they dutifully dropped away all looking toward a distant clacking of heels the king straightened and said you want us to slow them down i looked up at ivy whose grin transformed her face if we get away ill tell you two stories next time she said and delight showed on every young face go the girl in red pajamas said pulling the king out of the way with the gentle hands of the mother she would never be lets save the witch princess the boy cried and he ran down the hall the others fell into place the best they could some moving fast others slow the bright colors of childhood scarred with bald heads and gaits too slow for their enthusiasm im going to cry jenks said sniffing as he flew up to ivy im going to freaking cry ivys face as she watched them showed a depth of emotion id never seen then she turned away divorcing herself from it lips tight together she started into motion i turned to face where we were going and her brisk steps seemed to carry the desperation that there was nothing she could do to save them jenks flew ahead to get the elevator holding it by hovering at the sensor ivy wheeled me in and around the doors shut and the tragic wisdom of the childrens wing was gone i took a breath and my throat tightened i didnt think you would understand them ivy said softly they really like you understand them i said raggedly my throat still holding that lump i am them i hesitated then asked you come here a lot the elevator opened to show a smaller friendlier lobby with a christmas tree and solstice decorations and beyond a big black hummer burning gas at the snowy curb about once a week she said pushing me forward jenks was humming happily about a horse with no name the lady at the desk was on the phone eyeing us but my worry vanished when she waved telling whoever she was talking to that the lobby was empty just her and dan dan was a young man in an orderlys smock and he opened the door for us with a grin hurry he said as jenks dived into my jacket and i zipped it up theyre right behind you ivy smiled thanks dan ill bring you some ice cream dan grinned you do that ill just tell them you hit me she laughed and with that pleasant sound in my ears we left the hospital it was bitterly cold but the doors to the hummer swung open and two living vamps jumped out uh ivy thats not erica i said when they made a beeline for us they were in black jeans and matching black tshirts that all but screamed security and i tensed ericas got people ivy said when erica slid down and out from the backseat ivys sister looked like a younger version of ivy without all the emotional baggage bright happy and active piscary had never looked her way due to ivy intentionally distracting him and the young living vamp was innocence where ivy was jaded loud where ivy was reserved and ivy would do anything to keep it that way even sacrificing herself oh my god the young woman squealed youre really breaking out of the hospital ivy called and i was like oh my god of course ill pick you up then rynn offered to drive and it was a nobrainer i mean who wants to be picked up in their moms station wagon rynn cormel is here i murmured suddenly on edge then started when the two burly living vamps in black jeans and matching tshirts made a chair of their arms around me and i was airborne the cold didnt seem to affect them which seemed unfair old scars made an ugly mass on the neck of one man but the other had only one and it was relatively old what happened to your moms sedan i asked ivy and erica fidgeted with the collar of her coat her narrowtipped boots marking the snow a tree hit it erica said totally totaled it not my fault it was squirrel karma squirrel karma ill tell you later ivy said as she leaned close the intoxicating mix of vampire incense and male warmth was thick around me and it was almost a disappointment when the two guys eased me into the back and let go i didnt recognize them they werent piscarys old crew are you okay i asked erica as she slid in beside me with the scent of citrus oh sure but mom almost died twice ivy had gotten into the front seat and looking remarkably relaxed she leaned over the back the only person who almost died twice was you she said to her sister and erica played with the thin strips of black leather dangling from her ears she was still going goth complete with peekaboo lace at the neck and little tomatoes dangling among the skull and crossbones on her necklace i wondered what she was doing with rynn cormel as he was very much the sophisticate but ivy didnt seem worried and erica was as bright as ever there was a folded newspaper on the seat but my sigh at the picture of the mall turned into a frown when i read witch flees circle mall cause of riot isnt that nice are we all in came a rusty new york accent from my left and i jumped not having noticed rynn cormel in the corner holy crap the attractively aged former political leader was right next to me and god he smelled good his powercolored tie was loosened and his hair was tousled as if erica had been in it smiling his worldfamous worldchanging smile which showed the barest hint of fang he folded the newspaper and tucked it away shifting his eyes to the driver through the rearview mirror he silently told her to go the door to my right slammed shut and i was shoved closer to the undead vampire making my pulse race ivy pushed to the middle in the front seat and the other vamp got in beside her with the thump of the closing door alarm hit me i was in a car with one dead vamp and five living ones it was starting to smell really good in here and if i liked what it smelled like then they were liking what they were smelling and ahthat would be me uh i stammered when we crept into motion and rynn cormel laughed with the practiced art of diplomacy you are the last person who needs to fear anything from me ms morgan he said his eyes a safe brown in the streetlights i have other plans for you it might have sounded like a threat but i knew what his plans were and it didnt involve his teeth in my neck just the opposite actually yeah but still i protested when erica shoved me over even more thinking it was great fun by the amount of giggling and jumping she was doing she was in black tights and a miniskirt and not showing even a hint of being cold drive slowly ivy demanded she gets dizzy if you go too fast my focus became distant and i suddenly realized there was only the barest hint of vertigo running through me and we were going a lot faster than an elevator im fine i said softly and ivy turned to look at me in surprise when we drove sedately under a streetlamp i nodded and she turned back around thanks ivy thank you jenks i said as we slowed then pulled onto the road thats what were here for came jenkss muffled response now how about a little air and i unzipped my coat until he yelled that it was enough remembering the kids i leaned over to look up at the tall building behind us knowing exactly where to look clustered at the wide plateglass windows three stories up were five faces pressed against the glass i waved and one waved back happy i settled into the seat of rynn cormels car promising myself i would come back and bring them my old tea set or maybe my stuffed animals and ice cream thanks for picking us up mr cormel i said and the vampire breathed deep the almost inaudible sound seemed to dive to my middle and pluck a longsilent chord warmth flooded me and i found myself gazing at nothing completely relaxed just existing in the hint of promise he was giving off it wasnt anything like the lame groping of the young undead vampire at the mall and ivys neck stiffened rynn cormel leaned over to touch her shoulder it was my pleasure he said to me but his fingers were on ivy i was on my way to visit you actually i have some information ivys eyes were pupil black when she turned to see us you know who killed kisten i held my breath but the man shook his head i know who didnt fifteen the atmosphere in the hummer shifted dramatically after erica was dropped off at work relieved i watched the happy vampire wave goodbye then flounce into the computersecurity firm the armed doorman holding the door for her and giving us a short nod she acted like an airhead she talked like an airhead she dressed like a wealthy airhead but there was a brain attached to the elaborate goth costume and bright outlook and unlike ivy ericas outward demeanor wasnt a mask for a deeper depression good god one of cormels security guys muttered as we started off again that girl doesnt shut up i normally would have come back with something about women having to make up for mens inabilities in that area but he was right if erica was awake she was flapping her lip shoulders relaxing i eased into the leather to enjoy the space erica had left it was warm and the vampire pheromones were building itd been a while since id been exposed to this much my association with vamps had fallen drastically after kisten died a faint alarm took root and my eyes opened i didnt want to get caught up with vampires again as pleasant as that had beenas this was it was a slow decline into passivity it would kill me slowly or force me to react explosively i knew it ivy knew it perhaps kistens death had been a blessing as hard it had been i couldnt say he was bad for mehe had strengthened me where i hadnt known i was weak taught me a culture one had to learn by experience his death broke my heart my ignorance and saved me from myselfand i didnt want it to be made meaningless by ignoring what hed taught me bittersweet memories swirled and i sat up to put my bag firmly on my lap beside me the elegant rynn cormel touched his mouth with the back of his hand i think he was smiling i warmed guessing that he had seen me go on guard rynn cormel was not the stereotypical master vampire he hadnt been dead long enough yet to pass the tricky fortyyear barrier and he didnt try to disguise the age at which he had died maintaining an athletic fortysomething appearance his jetblack hair silvering slightly and his face having the first faint wrinkles that help men get higherpaying jobs and that women try to hide he knew i had become suspicious but he didnt pretend he hadnt noticed he didnt make any cryptic statements that it would do no good making it part threat part promise he was just so damnednormal political i gave him the onceover from his freshly arranged hair down his black cashmere coat to his shiny black shoes the shoes were inappropriate for the weather but it wasnt as if he was going to get cold it was all for show seeing my attention cormel smiled the man was tall well dressed and had a good body his laugh was pleasant and his manner comfortable but he wasnt beautiful or otherwise remarkable being too pale and wan to be attractiveuntil he smiled and then he was breathtaking his was the smile that had saved the world literally holding it together as everything exploded and coalesced in a brandnew way after the turn it was the promise of gentle honesty security protection freedom and prosperity seeing it directed at me i forced my eyes away and tucked a strand of hair behind my ear ivy had stiffened reading what was going on in the backseat by the signals i was unconsciously giving off hell the entire car could her brow was pinched in concern when she turned to see us the hospital is going to have the cops looking for her until we can get the paperwork for an ama she said they dont want a lawsuit if she collapses from my coat jenks laughed and i jumped having forgotten he was there what are the chances that wont happen he quipped then levered himself out to sit on my shoulder in the warmth of my scarf now that erica was gone weve made arrangements to stay with a friend not too far from the church so jenks can man the phones ivy said her gaze flicking nervously from cormel to me there was a helpless fear there not the raw fear piscary had evoked in her when hed looked at me but the fear that cormel might become interested in me it wasnt jealousyit was fear of abandonment if you head to the church i can direct you when we get closer she finished jenks snickered how many times have you passed out this year rache miffed i tried to see him but he was too close you wanna pass out right now jenks id enjoy it if you would stay with me cormel said his gloved hands folded quietly in his lap i have lots of room now that ive put the upper floors back into an apartment theres only one bed up there but one of you can sleep on the couch couch i thought dryly hed just as soon see ivy and me sharing more than rent but i couldnt find a hint of suggestion in his tone besides i couldnt spend the night there i had to get hold of my scrying mirror to call al and get tomorrow off and all before sunrise this time of year put it at about eight and i was starting to get anxious the chickering was delivered last week rynn cormel said shifting so his entire attention landed on me have you heard ivy play the piano rachel she has such a sensitive touch she should have been encouraged to go professional then he smiled though she will have centuries to follow that path if she ever desires yes i said remembering the few times id walked in on ivy lost at the keys she quit every time the piano left her more open and raw than she wanted me to see her wonderful cormel leaned to touch the driver in direction call ahead to get the heat turned up if you would my eyes closed briefly at the misunderstanding and i shook my head no i mean ive heard her play but we cant stay thank you anyway rynn ivy said softly as if shed been waiting for me to say no first jenks needs to get home to mind the firm no one will arrest a pixy but its likely there will be trouble and i dont want to be halfway across the hollows when it hits our door cormel arched his dark eyebrows his pale complexion making them appear stark in the dim light youll have dinner with me at least i dont have the chance since leaving office to entertain as often as im accustomed to i find i miss it surprisingly he smiled faintly settling himself with the sound of sliding cashmere its impressive how many political understandings one can reach over a glass of good wine tasha is out and i dont think i can stand another evening listening to our security procedures and how to improve them the driver chuckled but when i took a breath to gracefully decline cormel inclined his head stopping me i need a few hours to get your ama pushed through you can be sleeping in your own church this morning let me do this for you i need to speak to ivy as well about what i learned ivys eyes flicked to mine asking me to say yes she obviously liked the man and knowing how piscary had treated her i found it hard to say no besides i wanted to know whod killed kisten too thinking i was vacillating jenks whispered why the hell not dinner was a small price to pay for my ama and information about kisten and i nodded anticipation replacing my faint caution ivy smiled and the driver made a slow ubangy to head to the hollows waterfront capital cormel said as he gave us all a closedlipped but sincere smile jeff would you call ahead to make sure theres a bite to eat while dinner is being finished and make sure we have two extra places please and something for jenks the living vamp beside ivy took out his cell phone and hit a single number jeff was the one with only a single visible scar but i was willing to bet there were more hidden under his tshirt his low voice was pleasant and hardly audible over the blowing of the heater turned high for jenks or possibly me cormel and ivy talked about nothing as my gut wound tighter until cormel cracked a window to get rid of the tension i was giving off i thought my anticipation was from finding out what cormel had learned about kistens death but when we turned onto the waterfront i realized where the adrenaline was really coming from the instant the wheels turned onto the lessused street an old fear dripped through me igniting memory we were going to piscarys i looked down to find that my hands were clenched and i forced them apart as we slowed to a crawl the place looked about the same the twostory tavern peaceful under six inches of undisturbed snow the lights were on upstairs and someone was closing the drapes a section of the parking lot had been torn up and young trees now stood where rusty twodoors had once parked the beginnings of a wall had been started to fence in a garden perhaps not done and so left until the spring and warmer temperatures there was no boat at the quay you okay rache jenks asked and i exhaled forcing my hands to unclasp again yeah i said softly i havent been here since kisten died me neither he said but he hadnt ever been here to begin with except when i was here getting into trouble that is i flicked a glance at ivy as we crept to the side entrance where trucks had once delivered produce from all over the world she looked fine but shed been here often enough that the pain had dulled everyone was silent as we stopped before the closed door to the loading dock a vamp got out to open it and jenkss wings brushed my neck as he snuggled in against the cold rachel cormel asked solicitously as the rollup door noisily raised would you prefer a restaurant i hadnt considered that my home had bad memories for you ive made changes he coaxed its not the same ivy was looking at me like i was a wimp and i glanced at his eyes almost black in the dim light just memories i said good ones mixed with the bad i hope he said as we drove into the cold dry and dark loading dock i felt a faint tingle at my scar as the darkness took us affronted i stared at him until the tingle vanished was he making a play for me if he bound me id do anything he wanted thinking it was my idea and when the vampire pulled the rollup door shut to make the darkness absolute but for the headlamps i realized how vulnerable i was shit lets get inside and you can see what ive done with the place cormel said pleasantly and as my pulse quickened the doors to the hummer started opening i slid across the long seat to the door with my bag in my hand and as everyone milled around to make their slow way up the cement steps to the back door i pretended to adjust my coat before i got out this might be the last time i could have a private word with jenks until we got home whats my aura look like jenks i asked and got a pixysize sigh in return its thin but no holes i think the emotion the kids stirred up in you helped boost it it comes from emotion i murmured deciding at the last moment to leave my bag in the hummer as i took the hand of the vamp holding the door and made the careful slide to the cement pad where did you think it came from he said laughing from my scarf fairy farts i sighed shaking my head at ivys inquiring look i didnt like being out with my aura so thin but he said it was better and i trusted that no one was going to bite me i was clearly ill and that was a turnoff in the vamp world instilling an almost overboard lavishing sense of caring in the undead and still living alike maybe that was what i was seeing one by one the security vamps jostled for position until they were both ahead and behind us i obediently headed for the stairway seeing the tires of ivys cycle peeking out from under a tarp shed parked it here for the winter after id nearly hit it trying to get into our carport the snowplows had blocked me out and i had to gun it to get through the chunky manmade drift my pulse raced from the exertion and i followed cormel into the kitchen at least i was telling myself it was from the exertion and not anticipation i wasnt looking forward to seeing kisten everywhere the warmth of the kitchen surprised me and i looked up from the white tiles as we entered most of the ovens had been taken out and a great deal of the counter space a large comfortable table now took up the corner beside the stairway that led to the underground apartments the new amber light hanging over it and the cotton throw rug beneath it made the spot a pleasant place to relax and eat among company warm from the heat of the ovens and the possibility of conversation i breathed deep to find that it didnt smell like a restaurant anymore with its many spices and the lingering scents of unfamiliar vampires there was just rynn cormels increasingly familiar scent and the lingering aroma of half a dozen or so living vamps ivys among them i realized my boots were the only ones making any noise and i nervously adjusted my collar until jenks took to the air we could eat here but i think we will be more comfortable at the fireplace cormel said watching the pixy with a polite but wary expression jeff find out why mai hasnt started the appetizers would you please my concern eased when ivy took off her coat and leaving it at the table strode directly through the old double doors jenks went with her and curious i followed all my hesitancy vanished at the sight of the large room that had once entertained cincys finest partiers with gourmet pizza and mixed drinks the shiny bar remained taking up one wall the low ceiling making the dark oak look even darker all the illuminating lights over the bar were off and the lit fireplace pulled the eye the little high tables had been replaced with comfortable furniture coffee tables and the occasional sideboard for appetizers flower arrangements or possible discarded wineglasses cormel tossed his coat to a chair reminding me of my dad coming home and settling in he all but collapsed into one of the selfindulgent chairs by the fire and gestured for us to join him his pale skin and dark silvering hair gave him the look of a comfortable businessman home from work yeah right i took off my scarf and unzipped my coat but the winters chill still hung in me and i kept it on my eyes went everywhere as i followed ivy to the hearth to the right of the fireplace one of the doors to what had once been a private dining room was open and i could see a throw rug and part of a bed where a huge table once sat one of the security vampires casually shut the door as he went by and i guessed it was a guest room now the floor was scratched in the old hightraffic areas and the light fixtures were still a table length apart but it looked like a living rooma very large lowceilinged living room done up to look like a piece of up north with its round wooden timbers and dark paneling cormel had chosen a chair and ivy had taken the couch before the fire thinking they were going to make judgments on where i sat i carefully lowered myself onto the couch with ivy between us not too near her but not looking as if i was scrunched in the corner either the undead vampire smiled with half his mouth leaning forward he rubbed his hands together and held them to the fire as if he was cold damn he was good i felt silly in my coat so i took it off to find it pleasantly warm rynn had beckoned one of his staff closer and ivy was giving the man my personal information so he could file for the ama i was just starting to get warm enough to pay attention when jenks flew down the staircase a content trail of gold dust spilling from him you should be fine from ama police for a while he said as he unwound his winter wear to show the skintight black outfit he had on underneath hes got five vamps on security the three who came with us plus two who were here it wouldnt surprise me if the woman in the kitchen is security too by the way shes throwing the knives around thanks jenks i said knowing he was telling me this not because i was worried about the fib or the is but to tell our host we were not dumb about being here cormel has great security he continued as more blue fabric joined the pile on the arm of the couch professional all new stuff and dont mistake the smiles youre seeing for leniency in a stress situation gotcha i said then looked up when cormels aide nodded and left i adore red tape cormel said settling back with a pleased expression tied in a gordian knot i stared at him and he added any knot can be cut with a big enough sword youll have what you need in ten minutes jenks rose an inch then dropped when the guy with the savaged neck who had driven us here came in with an open bottle of white wine i took my glass vowing not to drink it but when cormel stood gazing at the wines hue i knew he was going to make a toast to immortality he said sounding almost forlorn for some a burden for others a joy heres to long lives and long loves we went to drink and jenks muttered and longer ladykillers i choked and jenks rose up on a glittering column of laughter ivy had heard him and she leaned back with a sour look on her face but cormel had stood and i jumped when one of his hands touched my shoulder and the other took my glass as i hacked and coughed would you like a milder wine he said solicitously as he set it down forgive me youre still recovering jeff bring out a sweeter white he said and i waved my protest s okay i managed went down the wrong pipe is all ivy uncrossed her knees and took another sip do you need to wait in the car jenks the pixy grinned i could see it through my watering eyes i was probably as red as the throw pillow i wanted to smack him with tracking his motion to the warm mantel and out of my reach i took another sip to clear my throat the wine was superb and my vow to avoid it was tempered by the knowledge that id probably never be able to afford a bottle like this ah one glass sipped slowly wouldnt hurt ivy unfolded herself and went to arrange the fire leaving me and rynn cormel with a wide space between us are you sure you wont stay the morning he said across the empty couch ive plenty of everything but company dinner rynn ivy said her shape was a sharp silhouette against the fire and when her hand came down very close to jenks he took to the air muttering curses you said you know who killed kisten is he someone who will be missed she said what she was asking was if she could claim a life in return and i stifled a shiver at the depth of her pain a sigh slipped from cormel though he didnt need to breathe but to speak its not that i know who killed him but i do know who didnt ivy went to protest and the man put up a hand for her to wait there was no one piscary owed a favor to cormel said he hadnt had contact with any vampire out of the city so it was a cincy native and likely still here seeing his fatherly concern something in me snapped theres you i said bluntly and ivy stiffened maybe you did it jenkss wings clattered a nervous warning but the undead vampire smiled with only the barest hint of an eye twitch giving away his annoyance i understand youre starting to remember certain things he said flatly and my bravado vanished do i smell familiar to you you wouldnt forget me if id pinned you to the wall his eyes tightened i know it i started to breathe again when he turned to ivy the shell of his humanity back in place youve been to the boat ivy he said in a soft voice was i ever there ivy was tense but she shook her head i wouldve pointed out that he could have had someone else do it but that wasnt how vampires worked if kisten had been a gift to cormel cormel would have taken him without a second thought and would admit it freely i was dining with a freaking animal and i bowed my head with a false contriteness and muttered sorry i had to ask of course you did no insult taken i felt sick we were all pretending well at least cormel and i were ivy might still be living the lie i smiled at him and cormel smiled back the picture of grace and understanding as he leaned to top off my wine and i leaned forward to accept it besides myself he said as he retreated and ivy relaxed there have been no new major political powers entering the city and none looking for upward mobility other than what one would expect when a master vampire dies his final death no one has more power than he or she should which wouldnt be the case if piscary showed favor to someone he took a sip considering the flavor or his next words many owed piscary but he owed no one her back to the fire ivy was silent wed learned nothing and i was starting to wonder if kistens death was another one of ivys freaking life lessons seeing her fidgeting in motions so subtle only jenks or i would recognize i hoped not if it was i might just dig the bastard piscary back up and stake him again for the hell of it make a necklace out of his teeth and bathtub duckies out of his driedup balls ive met him ivy said looking for a shred of hope to follow i just cant place him do you have a name cormel asked i could hear faint activity in the kitchen and jenks flew to investigate no the scent is too old and its not quite the same its like he was alive when i knew him and now hes dead or maybe a large shift of status changed his diet and therefore his scent her head came up showing that her eyes were red maybe he tried to disguise his smell so i couldnt recognize it cormel waved a hand in dismissal his expression irate then you really have nothing he said holding out his hand to lure her into sitting back down im sure the answer is here but i have exhausted my leads im not asking the right person you could though ivy exhaled to try to find her composure and who is the right person she asked as she took his grip and sat skimmer cormel said and my head came up sharply she knows all piscarys political secrets lawyers the vampire sighed expressively skimmer is in jail jenks said as he darted back to the fire she wont see ivy ivy lowered her head her brow pinched skimmers refusal was tearing her up she might see you if rachel goes with you rynn cormel suggested and the hope of a possibility smoothed ivys expression my mouth though went dry you think it will make a difference i asked he shrugged as he sipped his wine she doesnt want ivy to see her in her failure but i expect she has a few words to say to you jenkss breath hissed in but rynn was right ivys face held the hope that skimmer would talk to her and i set my dislike for the petite dangerous vampire aside for ivy i would talk to her for ivy and to find out who killed kisten its worth trying i said thinking that going in there with a thin aura wasnt the best idea in the world cormel shifted his feet uneasily it was subtle and he probably didnt even know he had done it but i saw it and so did jenks good he said as if everything had been decided i do believe there is some sushi headed our way his words were clearly a signal since the doors to the kitchen promptly swung open and jeff and another vamp in an apron came out with trays jenkss wings were a shimmer of motion though he hadnt moved from the arm of the couch i didnt know you liked sushi i said i dont but theres honey in one of the dipping sauces jenks i warned as cormel and ivy made a spot on the coffee table before the fire whaaaaat he complained his wings slowing until i could almost see the red bit of tape i wasnt going to eat any i was going to take it home for matalina it helps her sleep better and seeing the flicker of concern in his eyes i believed him the trays looked fabulous and glad now id said yes to dinner i took up my chopsticks pleased i didnt have to break them apart to use them they looked expensive all we had at home were the ones we saved from takeout i watched ivy handle her sticks with the fluency of a native language the extensions of her fingers taking three different sashimi and several rolls with cream cheese and what looked like tuna remembering our first disastrous dinner as roommates i kept my eyes down and put a few bites on my plate followed by lots of ginger jenks hovered over an amber sauce and i put some on my plate making sure he knew it was for him by pointing at him with the sticksthough how he was going to get it home was beyond me cormel was still fussing with the sauces by the time ivy and i had retreated with full plates im so pleased you stayed he said as he moved with that eerie vampire speed and put all of three bites on his plate sushi alone is not the same you never get the variety ivy was smiling but the display of vampiric speed had me on edge i didnt need the reminder that he was stronger than me and he didnt need to eat why he was sort of bothered me i love sushi i said not wanting him to guess he had unnerved me since i was a kid really cormel put a bite into his mouth and chewed im surprised i was eight i said taking a slice of ginger and enjoying the sweet zing i thought i was dying well i was but i didnt know i was going to get better my brother went on this big push for me to do everything made it his goal one summer my fumbling for a roll slowed as i thought about the girl in the hospital and the look in her eyes i should go back and tell her the chance was real if i survived then she had a chance i didnt even know her name you still are you know cormel said startling me dying i blurted and he laughed ivy smiled thinly not appreciating the joke i suppose he said eyes on his second roll im the only one here not performing that particular trick anymore but what i meant was youre still pushing to try new things my eyes flicked to ivy no im not ivy shifted uncomfortably between us determined to not back down i took one of the more mundane crunchy pieces of fried shrimp and ate it with a great deal of noise cormel smiled and set his plate aside having eaten only one roll youre in a tight spot rachel and im curious as to what your plan is for getting out jenks clattered his wings in warning and the tension went up ill get the ama whether you help me or not i started and he cut me off i promised you your form and you will have it he said sounding insulted thats shortterm survival and im talking progress moving forward establishing yourself in a safe longterm situation he took his glass and sipped from it you have been seen consorting with demons you were refused traditional treatment on the witch floors because of your demon scars what do you think that means it means theyre idiots my chin rose and i set the plate of sushi down human medicine worked fine humans dont like demons any more than anyone else he said less if you continue dealing with them openly you will be silenced probably by witches i laughed at that whoa whoa whoa i said waving my sticks about i dont know where youre getting your info but witches dont do that to each other they never have and you know that how he asked even so youre acting out of character and that will force them to do the same i made a scoffing sound and returned to eating why do they make these rolls so darn big i look like a freaking squirrel be cautious rachel cormel said and i ignored him continuing to try to chew a wad of rice and seaweed too big for my mouth humans are vicious when cornered thats why they survive and we dont they came first and they will probably persist long after were gone rats cockroaches and humans ivy rolled her eyes and ate a glob of the green stuff seeing her disbelief cormel smiled ivy disagrees he said but ive had to speak favorably for you more than once my motion to dip my last cucumber roll hesitated i never asked you to do that it wasnt your place to give me permission he said im not telling you this so you feel you owe me a debt but to let you know your situation if the witches dont react to you openly trafficking with demons then the vampires will be pressed into it for another reason i set my sticks down feeling sick i had no choice but to traffic with demons having bought trents freedom from them with a promise to be als student if youre not upset about the demons then whats bothering you i asked feeling trapped and angry what youre doing to help the elves of course ivy exhaled and i suddenly got it oh i took a steadying breath and pushed my plate away i wasnt hungry anymore piscary had killed my dad and trents father for simply trying to help the elves i had gone past trying and had actually saved them well id gotten the sample that trent used to do it there have been three elf conceptions in the last three months cormel said and my thoughts flew to ceri all healthy from what i understand their population is going to slowly rise the weres too are poised to explode under the right circumstances you can understand why the vampires are slightly concerned david doesnt want a pack i said my jaw starting to clench cormel crossed his knees and a grimace colored his expression humans breed like flaming rabbits from hell but weve been dealing with that for centuries you however are responsible for the elves and weres population wise he amended before i could protest from what i understand the elves would just as soon see you dead for some reason i havent fathomed yet which leaves the weres to back you and if they do it will be with the power of the focus he paused which will increase their numbers he finished i slumped back into the couch and sighed no good deed and all rynn cormel mimicked my position doing so with slow grace instead of dejected suddenness what can you do for us rachel he said glancing at a very quiet ivy we need something so that we may think more kindly of you i knew what he was asking he wanted me to find a way for vampires to keep their souls after death and he thought id do it to save ivy im working on it i muttered arms crossed over my chest and staring at the fire i dont see any progress my brow furrowed and i gave him a look ivy ivy likes things the way they are he interrupted as if she wasnt sitting between us you need to be more aggressive hey i exclaimed that is none of your business jenks took flight hovering a careful three feet from him you need to keep your stick in your own flowers he said hands on his hips rynn ivy pleaded please but the man proved who he waswhat he waswhen his eyes flashed black and his aura slammed into me tell me you dont like this he whispered i gasped shoving away from him when his eyes touched my demon scar i was against the back and arm of the couch and i could go no farther my exhalation turned into a moan as feeling shivered over my skin delving deep where my clothes touched me i couldnt thinkthere had never been anything so shockingly intimateand my blood pounded telling me to submit to give in to take what he offered and revel in it stop jenks shrilled stop now or ill jam this stick so far up your nose youll be able to do calculus with it please i panted my knees at my chin as i nearly writhed on the couch the leather feeling like skin against me the sensation had come from nowhereand god it felt so good how could i ignore this he had flung it in my face showing me what ivy and i had shunned rynn please ivy whispered and the sensation cut off with the suddenness of a slap my gasp was harsh and i felt the dampness of tears i realized my face was against the couch and i was curled up hiding from the passion from the ecstasy panting i slowly unkinked my arms and legs i couldnt focus well but i found him easily enough sitting comfortably on his chair jenks hovered between us with a chopstick god the vampire looked as unruffled as stone and about as compassionate he wore a superb mask but he was an animal if you touch my scar again i threatened but what could i do he protected ivy protected me slowly my pulse eased but the shaking of my legs didnt he knew my threats were nothing and he ignored me i followed his gaze to ivy and i felt the blood drain from my face ivy i whispered in heartache her eyes were black and desperate she was fighting every instinct she had her master had gone for me in front of her then had drawn back practically saying you finish we struggled with this and for him to callously break everything we had worked for pissed me off you have no right i said my voice shaking i like you rachel he said surprising me i have since i first heard ivys impassioned description of you and then found it accurate youre inventive intelligent and dangerous i cant keep you alive if you continue to ignore the fact that your actions reach farther than next week dont do this to me and ivy again i seethed do you hear me why he said and his confusion was too real to be faked i did nothing you didnt enjoy ivys good for you youre good for ivy i dont understand why both of you are ignoring thisperfect match i couldnt edge away from ivy she was balanced ignoring her was the only armor i could give her ivy knows there cant be blood shared without dominance given i wont and she cant he seemed to think about that then one of you needs to learn to bend as if that was all there was to it to become second i thought of his scion sent away because it was easier to do this without her here neither of us will i said thats why we can live together leave ivy alone a small noise came from him i was talking about ivy bending not you i shook my head disgusted thats what i love about her i said if she bends i walk away if i bend she gets nothing but a shell his brow furrowed and the fire snapped as he thought are you sure he asked and i nodded not sure if it would save or damn us then maybe this wont work he said distantly jenks silent until now dropped the chopstick it will he protested as it clattered i mean rachel has found out so much already shes working with a wise demon shell find a way for ivy to keep her soul jenks dont i said but cormel was thinking even as i could see his unease that the wisdom to further his species would come from demons al might know a way for souls to be retained after death jenks pleaded his angular features scrunched up in fear for me shut up i shouted ivy was breathing easier and i risked a look at her her hands were unfisted but she was still looking at the floor and breathing shallowly ask your demon cormel said as jeff cautiously came in with a fax the man glanced at ivy in alarm then handed it to cormel without even looking at it the undead vampire coolly handed it past ivy to me your ama i shoved it in my pocket thank you what good timing cormel said lightly but i could see everything now all the pretty talk and clever smiles wouldnt snare me again now we can eat with relaxed stomachs yeah right i turned to ivy and when she met my eyes with a growing band of brown around her pupils i stood thank you rynn but were leaving jenks dropped to the arm of the chair and hurriedly wound fabric around himself his wings drooping and rising as he worked ivy rynn cormel said as if confused and she backed away from him closer to me im happy she said softly as she handed me my coat please leave me alone we started for the kitchen jenks flying heavily behind us as a vanguard trailing the last of his wrap along instead of sparkles theres more here to think about than two peoples happiness cormel said loudly and ivy stopped her hand on the swinging doors rachel wont be pushed she said then pull her before someone else does as one we turned and left behind us was the sharp clatter of chopsticks and little ceramic dishes hitting the stone fireplace the kitchen was empty and i imagined everyone had gone somewhere else and out of cormels angry path jenks dove for my scarf as i wrapped it about my neck and i sighed as i recalled how erotic a covered neck was to a vampire god i was stupid ivy hesitated at the door to the loading dock ill be right back she said a dangerous slant to her eyes are you sure i asked and she strode away uncomfortable i hustled into the cold garage we werent going to get home in the hummer so i got my bag out from the backseat and with a grunt shoved the door up panting as the silent night met me wed be taking ivys bike and it was going to be a very slow very cold ride but i had to get home we had to we both needed to get back to the church and the patterns of behavior that kept us apart and togethersane i had to call al before the sun came up and beg for the time off and now i had to ask him if he knew of a way to save a vampires soul because if i didnt i might find myself dead the sound of ivys boots brought my attention up and she strode down the stairs with her arms crossed you okay i asked as i pulled the tarp from ivys bike and she nodded from my scarf came jenkss snotty im okay youre okay ivys freaking okay were all okay can we get the hell out of here ivy stashed my bag got on the bike and turned to look at me waiting are you going to pull me i asked heart pounding as i stood on the hard cement with my feet going cold in my boots her eyes were like liquid brown in the dim light and i could see her misery no i had to trust her swinging my leg over i got on the bike behind her and held on tight as ivy idled the bike out of the sheltered warmth and into the cold snow of the last of the year sixteen the kitchen was warm smelling of brown sugar chocolate chips and butter i was making cookies with the excuse that they would soften al up but the reality was i wanted jenks to have the chance to get excessively warm the ride home had been bitterly cold and though hed never admit it jenks was almost blue by the time ivy parked her cycle in the garden shed and i hustled into the church with him his kids had long since tired of playing in the ovens updrafts but he was still in here his wings slowly moving back and forth as expected a stonefaced is agent had been waiting for us when we cycled in silently taking his copy of the ama and driving off if not for that stupid piece of paper id be back in the hospital under guard but as it was i was pulling the last tray of cookies out and feeling better tired but better take that dr mape it was almost four in the morning just about the time i usually crawled into bed ivy was at her computer each key getting a harder tap than the one before it as she not so patiently waited for me to call al and ask for the night off but talking to demons was tricky i wanted jenks warm and mobile before i did it and a little comfort food never did anyone any harm its getting late ivy muttered the rim of brown around her pupils narrowing as she tracked something on her monitor you going to do this anytime soon ive got hours i said as i slid the last cookie onto the cooling rack propping the tray in the sink to sizzle i leaned to look at the clock above me relax youve got four hours sixteen minutes her eyes flicked to me and she arranged her colored pens in the mug she used for a pencil cup i just pulled up the almanac putting five cookies on a plate i set them next to her keyboard and took the topmost for myself i wanted to make cookies everyone likes cookies i said and she smirked delicately taking a cookie with her long slim fingers jenks rose up from the oven warm at last oh yeah cookies ought to do it he laughed and a slip of dust fell from him al had a fit the last time you asked for a night off he said no too thats why the cookies duh i wasnt recovering from a banshee attack either tonight will be different i hope hands on his hips jenks got an unusually bitter look on his face as he landed by my scrying mirror on the center island counter maybe you should offer him a bite out of something else bet hed give you the freaking year off jenks ivy snapped and the pixy turned his back on us to look out the dark window whats the matter jenks i said tightly you dont want me talking to the wise demon didnt i hear you tell rynn cormel he was a wise demon okay maybe that had been a little nasty but he had been picking on me all night and i wanted to know why he stayed where he was his wings moving fitfully and tired of it i sat in my spot at the table and leaned toward ivy whats with him i said loud enough for him to hear ivy shrugged and i wiped the cookie crumbs from my fingers rex was staring at me from the threshold and on the off chance i dropped my hand in invitation oh my god i whispered when the cat stood and her tail crooked happily came to me look i said as the orange beast bumped her head under my palm as if we were great friends ivy leaned over to see and feeling brave i sent my hand under the cats middle not breathing i lifted and without even a squirm the cat was on my lap oh my god i whispered again she was purring the freaking feline was purring its the bloody apocalypse jenks muttered and i fondled the young cats ears my wonder turned to contentment when rex settled in with her paws tucked under herself ivy shook her head and went back to work no way was i ruining this with calling al al could wait i was guessing that pierce was in the kitchen and he was happy rex still on my lap i ate another cookie as thoughts of pierce sifted through me it had been eight years and though id changedmoved out gone to school been hired fired run for my life saved a life put my boyfriend to rest and learned to live againhe probably hadnt changed at all the last time id seen him he had been an attractive mix of power and helplessness not any older than i was now i felt a smile grow as i recalled him busting the doors to the is building with a flung spell knocking out their security and then sealing them inside with a ward all with an odd awkwardness that hit my littleboylost button hed taken down an undead vampire with power he had drawn through me so subtly that i hadnt felt it even when id known he was doing it rex purred and i kept my fingers moving to keep her with me i was not stupid i knew that pierce even as a ghost had a mix of power and vulnerability that was a veritable rachel magnet and i wasnt so blind that i wouldnt admit i felt a twinge of attraction but an unexpected sense of peace outweighed that i wasnt going to run willynilly into a relationship even if one was possible kisten had taught me the dangers of letting my heart rule me call it gun shy call it growing up but i was happy as i was i was in no hurry and that felt good ivy looked up at me her typing stilling as she recognized that something had shifted in the air face placid she glanced at jenks the pixys wings went red in agitation and he flew to land on the cookie plate and demand my attention marshal called he said as if it was the most important thing in the world you were in the can he says hes bringing doughnuts over tomorrow for breakfast if you get out of your thing with big al okay i said as i scratched rexs jawline remembering that pierce hadnt been my first kiss hed been my first doneright kiss though and i smiled trents coming with him jenks said hands on his hips and jonathan thats nice i stroked rex then brought her to my nose so i could smell her sweet kitty fur such a good kitty i crooned such a clever kitty to know there is a ghost in the church jenks set his wings to blurring not moving an inch see he said to ivy appalled she likes him rachel hes been spying on us start thinking with your head huh a flicker of annoyance went through me but it was ivy who said jenks get off it in an almost bored tone hes not spying on us but she likes him jenks yelped wings so fast that the bit of red tape finally flew off ivy sighed looking up first at jenks then at me this is rachel were talking about she said with a smile id give it three months tops yeah but she cant kill this one jenks grumped that was in extremely bad taste but i ignored him just delighted to have the cat finally like me dont you listen to them rexy i cooed and the cat sniffed my nose rachel is a smart girl shes not going to go out with a ghost no matter how sexy he is she knows better jenkskie wenskie can just get bent i beamed at jenks and he made an ugly face rache put my cat down before you mess with her kitty brain smiling i let rex puddle out of my arms and onto the floor she rubbed against me then sedately walked out there was a cheering from the pixies up in the sanctuary and her shadow slunk past the door to hide under the couch in the back living room the more agitated jenks got the more content i became smiling i washed my hands and dropped a dozen cookies in a bag for al tying it with a little blue twist tie before setting them beside the scrying mirror seeing me getting ready ivy shut down her computer ill get our coats she said and jenks clattered his wings angry he was going to be left behind im doing this by myself i said suddenly thanks though your aura is thin put us in a circle and do it here ivy said as she stood putting them in a circle really didnt make them any safer all al had to do was shove me into it and it would fall same thing with standing in a circle with him and putting al in a circle alone wasnt going to happennot since hed started treating me like a person after i told him i wouldnt circle him anymore secondclass person but a person nevertheless why chance it i said thinking of jenkss kids the demon might turn them into popcorn for all i knew you can watch from the windows coatin the foyer its not a big deal i shouted over my shoulder as i headed for the front door my boots were there too it was four in the freaking morning the coldest part of the day and i was going to go sit in a graveyard and talk to al ahhh i love my life ivy caught up with me as i shrugged into my coat grabbing my boots i took a step jerking back when i almost ran into her im coming with you she said eyes going dark i listened for jenkss wings and hearing nothing i whispered dont you dare make jenks sit in here alone she clenched her jaw the brown rim of her eyes shrinking even more i brushed past her and headed to the kitchen im just asking for a night off its not a big deal then why dont you do it in here she yelled back and i stopped at the head of the hall ivy was standing by her piano the soft glow lights on my desk made a spot of living green with pixies peeking from every nook because i lost it the last time i thought you two were dead and im not going to risk you if i dont have to ivy took a deep breath and i turned away ill be right back i added as i paced into the kitchen jenks was still atop ivys monitor his wings a blur and his increased circulation making them a bright red jenks dont look at me like that i muttered when i dropped my boots to put them on and as my heels thumped into them he turned his back on me jenks i pleaded stopping when his wings buzzed ill be okay i said and he shifted his head at the harsh sound of my zipper going up this is fairy crap he exclaimed rising up and spinning around green fairy crap with sprinkles on top i finished for him as i fumbled for my gloves jammed in the pockets we go through this every week either i show up at sunrise or he comes and gets me hiding on hallowed ground will only tick him off and then he visits my mom if im lucky i get the night off if im not ill send bis back in for my things okay jenks hovered before me with his hands on his hips ignoring him i picked up the scrying mirror and my cookies i knew he hated being trapped by the cold but i wasnt going to risk his family he was so good at everything else why this bothered him was beyond me bis will be with me i offered and when he crossed his arms and turned his back on me i shouted ill be freaking fine and stormed to the back door what is his problem i flicked on the porch light giving the door a tight pull to get it to latch behind me hesitating on the landing i took a moment to calm myself taking in how quiet it was out here while i put on my gloves the moon was riding high above the horizon with an edge so sharp it looked like it could cut paper my breath steamed and by the second lungful i felt the cold all the way to my bones even cincinnati across the river and distant seemed frozen if death had a feeling this was it still peeved i crunched down the salted back steps and into the garden following the same path id taken out here last week there was a good chance that al wouldnt go for this and id find myself sending bis back in for my overnight bag giving al a laugh and me ten additional charms to spell before sunrise tomorrow i looked behind me to see the kitchen window plastered with pixies but jenks wasnt among them guilt slithered out from me for having gone where he couldnt follow but it wasnt like i was going into a dangerous situation it was like asking your recruiter if you could skip the run today and rest up i might get smacked for it but i wasnt going to die this is so not going to work i muttered then stepped over the low wall that separated the witchs garden from the graveyard the cold seemed to turn to knives in my chest and i slowed before i froze my nose from breathing too fast fatigue was nothing new and i had all the tricks to stave it off i could feel the ley line shimmering in my thoughts but i angled to pierces statue instead i didnt need to be in a line to talk to al and the patch of unsanctified ground surrounded by gods grace would keep al from wandering if he decided to come over pierces monolith of a kneeling battleweary angel was creepy looking not quite human with its arms too long and its features starting to run from pollution and the poor grade of stone id used this redcolored patch of cement to summon demons three times now and that i was treating this as almost routine was worrisome hey bis i called then jumped when bis landed suddenly on the angels shoulder in a wash of air that smelled like rock dust holy crap i yelped looking back at the church to see if anyone had noticed my surprise how about some warning dude sorry the lateadolescent foothigh gargoyle said his red eyes whirling so fast in amusement that i knew he wasnt sorry at all his pebbly skin was black to absorb what heat he could from the night but he could change it even when he fell into a torporlike state as the sun came up hed have more control over his sleep when he got older but right now like most teenagers he was like a rock when the sun came up he paid rent to jenks by watching the grounds for the four hours around midnight when pixies traditionally slept hed been doing more than that since the temperatures dropped below pixy tolerance he and jenks got along great seeing as bis had been kicked off the basilica for spitting on people and jenks thought that was just fine why is jenks mad at you he asked as he pulled his wings close and i winced because he thinks he has to protect me and im going places he cant i said you can hear us from out here the gargoyle shrugged and looked at the church only when you yell only when we yell brushing the snow off the base of the angel statue i set the cookies down and brought out the mirror oh thats ultimate bis said as the wineandcrystalcolored scrying mirror threw back the moonlight i looked down at it feeling the cold right through my gloves i agreed with him even though i thought something that called demons should be ugly this was my second mirror made with a stick of yew some salt wine a bit of magic and a lot of help from ceri the first one id broken over miniass head when the demon had startled me ceri had helped me make that one too it was a contact glyph not a summoning spell and the doublecircled pentagram with its symbols could open a path to the everafter and any demon i wished to talk to i didnt need to know their summoning name just their common one that and the word that tapped into the demons communal magic some days i really wished i didnt know the magic word nervous i hunched down to sit on the edge of the monolith beside the cookies and balanced the mirror on my knees i took my right glove off and set my palm in the cave of the large pentagram the redtinted glass was icy cold to my naked fingers as the spelled glass transferred the cold of the night into me glancing up at bis lurking above me i said if al shows up get to hallowed ground okay the catsize gargoyle nervously rustled his wings kay satisfied i pressed more firmly and reached to touch the nearby ley line power that seemed to have picked up the chill of the night coursed in finding a balance within me with an unusual flush of vertigo surprised i leaned back until my shoulders hit the statue for balance what in hell the flow of energy was irregular making me feel almost seasick the odd sensation must be from my thin aura maybe auras functioned like filters evening the highs and lows into a steady stream the longer i held the line the worse it got bis dropped to stand uncertainly by my knee in concern his clawed feet seeming to grow bigger when they hit the snow you okay ms morgan he asked and i nodded slowly dizzy mirror balanced on my knees i tucked a strand of floating hair behind my ear your aura is still thin bis said you sure you should be doing this i blinked at him to get rid of the last of the vertigo you can see auras i asked then rolled my eyes bis could see every ley line in cincinnati in his mind like i could see contrails in the daytime sky when he touched me i could see them too of course he could see auras it was frigid out here and since i was already connected to a line all that was left was calling al hands trembling faintly from lightheadedness i pressed my hand firmly and thought mater tintinnabulum to open a connection the power of the ley line swelled in me and my lips parted as i panted god this thin aura suckedit felt like i was sick againand i wondered how long until i was back to normal shutting my eyes was worse and i forced them open it was as if i was in a huge space but unlike before when it seemed there were hundreds of whispering voices there were only a few al i thought again making my goal specific and i felt a part of me wing off in an unknown direction a faint vibration seeming to echo through my mind i was contacting the demon which was different from summoning if i summoned al into a circle hed be subject to my whims and a prisoner until the sun rose or he was able to make his escape through trickery or a lack of interaction with his summoner hed also be ticked seeing as he would be taking on the payment for crossing the lines no i was calling him which was cheaper smut wise he could ignore me though he never refused a chance to flap his lip and show off he could also use the connection to make the jump to our reality which was why i was doing it out here us having an understanding or no algaliarept was a demon and he would happily hurt ivy or jenks for the satisfaction of seeing me angry and impotent as expected the demon picked up immediately and the unusual vertigo from my thin aura vanished as my expanded experience narrowed to a single tunnelvisionlike expression itchy witch his sharp thought echoed in mine it was surprised and confused and it was as if i could almost hear the elegant and precise british tv accent he used i had no idea why its early he thought giving me the impression he was scrambling to organize his thoughts it is early isnt it there was a hesitation then its bloody hell four in the morning if this is about exchanging my summoning name for that old mark of newts the answer is no i like you owing me two marks and im enjoying not being yanked across the lines to answer stupid questions from stupid people you included worry that he might never make good on our agreement flitted through me but he needed his name to make a living and would eventually want it back he was in debt up to his eyebrows and had the further indignity of not having a familiar to stir his spells and curses even better he now lived in a dump of a twohollow hellhole instead of the tenroom mansion deep underground that he kept bitching about everything but his kitchen and front room had been sold to bribe the demon mucketymucks to let him out on parole despite his numerous and loud complaints he wasnt too unhappy because i was the only witch alive whose kids would technically be demonsand i belonged to him sort of i was his student not his familiar and he had me only one night a week just my luck it was saturday not that i was dating or anything but a girl liked to keep her weekends free just in case that i still had his summoning name meant he couldnt pursue his freelance job of luring stupid people into demon servitude and then selling them to the highest bidder that i might get summoned out under his name didnt bother me as much as id thought it would id scare the crap out of them so good that they wouldnt dare think to summon al again and theyd be safe soon as al figured that out hed switch back i hoped curiosity got the better of him when i remained silent and he finally added what do you want im not letting you go early tomorrow for starting early today my eyes met biss the gargoyle looked concerned shifting his clawed feet and using a wing tip to scratch the middle of his back uh i said aloud so the kid could hear at least half of the conversation can i have the night off i dont feel very well there was a slight background confusion in him but al was alone or id be able to pick up his thinking about whoever was with him you dont feel well he thought then hesitated as i got the impression he was unhappy with the way he looked there was a surge of minor power through his mind followed by a flush of satisfaction and then he added you want time off because you dont feel well no i could feel him ready to snap the connection and i blurted but i made you cookies i moaned knowing if i played ignorant he might give in he knew i wasnt ignorant but he liked it when i pretended as if i could manipulate him which i could so who was smarter after all the tingles of thought coming from him touched on crushed green velvet coattails and lace and i guessed he was primping and what the hell do i care about that he thought but there had been a flash of hidden interest and i smiled at biss worried expression i exhaled not caring that al could read my relief because he hadnt hung up on me look i was attacked by a banshee yesterday and she sucked most of my aura off i dont feel good and tapping a line makes me dizzy so i dont think i can be of any use anyway i can think of a lot of things to do he thought and none of them involve standing up very funny im serious i said wondering what i had interrupted his thoughts were focused ontidying up good grief is he tidying up for me i would have gotten a work excuse but i had to break out of the hospital just to get here to talk to you i felt a surge of annoyance and then quite unexpectedly it vanished my gaze slid to bis crap was al coming over bis take off i said in alarm then gasped as a wave of vertigo slammed into me like a cresting wave ms morgan bis shouted i pushed the mirror off my lap as i struggled not to spew pain followed the nausea my skin felt like it was on fire the pulsating energy hitting me hard without my aura to even out the surges my legs wouldnt work and when i tried to stand i fell over i hit the snowcovered pavement on my side managing to get my arms out so i didnt crack my nose open ms morgan bis tried again and i clenched in agony when he touched me and i felt like i was going to explode damn it id been okay until al tapped into me to make his crossing cheaper the cement slab under me was hard and my cheek burned against the snow i smelled burnt amber and suddenly there was a pair of shiny buckled shoes before my painclenched eyes run bis i panted then sucked in air when the pain cut off with a blessed suddenness the power of the line was gone and it was just me lying in the snow what by my blood dames shadow am i doing in the snow came als refined british accent morgan get up you look like a scullery girl down there ow i said as his whitegloved hand grabbed my shoulder and hauled me up i stumbled my feet not quite finding the ground for the first second or two let go of ms morgan came a deep gravelly voice from behind me and still in als grip i worked to look around me bis i stammered and al dropped me wobbling i found my balance with a hand on als chest shocked bis had released his bodys warmth to melt a patch of snow taking the water into him to increase his size he was as tall as me now a grainy black and his wings spread to make himself look bigger waterfilled muscles bunched and flexed from his craggy feet to his gnarly hands he was probably too heavy to fly and when al dropped back a step the gargoyle hissed to show a long forked tongue damn there was steam coming off him i felt al touch the small line running through the graveyard and i jumped al no i shouted feeling helpless as i stood between a redeyed demon and a redeyed horned gargoyle my hands outstretched to them both when did bis get horns hes just a kid i shouted at al al dont hurt him hes just a kid al hesitated and i flicked a look behind me at bis surprised by the change bridge trolls were able to change their size with water too bis its okay he wont hurt me ivy wouldnt let me come out here alone if it wasnt okay justrelax the tension lessened as bis stopped hissing he slowly lost his crouch shrinking only slightly as he closed his wings als hands stopped glowing and there was a curious sensation in me as the demon pushed a wad of force back into the line al sniffed loudly tugging his coat about him and adjusting his lace when did you get your gargoyle he said sarcastically youve been holding out on me itchy witch bring him with you tonight and he can have mortar cakes and tea with mine poor little treble hasnt had anyone to play with in ages you have a gargoyle i said as bis shifted awkwardly unused to this much mass how else would i be able to tap a line so far underground the demon said with forced pleasantness and how clever of you to have one already this last was said sourly and i wondered what other nasty surprises he hadnt told me about bis isnt my familiar i said working to stay upright as my fatigue hit me anew when the adrenaline crashed al i really need the night off at that the demon seemed to bring his wandering attention back from the cold night stand up he said jerking me upright get the snow off you he added smacking my coat to make the crusty stuff fall away what the devil is wrong with you calling me out in the snow when you have that adorable little kitchen i dont trust you with my friends i said can we skip this week his gloved hand lashed out and gripped my chin before i could think to move i stifled a gasp and bis rumbled your aura is nearly thin enough to tear the demon said softly turning my face back and forth as his goatslitted eyes peered three inches outside my outline it is far too thin to work the lines much less travel on them he said in disgust and dropped my chin no wonder you were belly down on the pavement hurt huh i backed up rubbing where it felt as if i could feel him still so i have the night off he laughed gods little green apples no ill just pop on home and bring back a little something to make my itchy witch alllll better that didnt sound good i had looked in my books already finding that there was no white charm to help replace a persons aura i didnt know any black ones either if there were any vampires would know about them seeing as thats what the undead ones siphoned off their victims along with the blood a curse i asked backing up until i felt bis behind me it wouldnt work if it wasnt al eyed me over his smoked glasses and smiled to show me his blocky teeth i may not have much but i do have auras all lined up in pretty jars like some people collect wine i specialize in the eighteenth century it was a good century for souls i stifled a shiver telling myself it was from the cold id rather wait until mine replenishes itself thanks like i care what youd rather turning to make his coattails furl al looked across the graveyard to the nearby line ill be back in five minutes he said as he started to go misty soon as i remember where ceri hid the little things wait for me there he said pointing at the nearby ley line like i was a dog i dont want you passing out when i come back and have your bag with you youre going to pay for this by starting early today chopchop al i complained irritated that he would try to disguise his cheapness with a supposed interest in my welfare he didnt care if i passed out or not but it wouldnt cost as much to cross into the everafter if he were in a line and though he wouldnt admit it al was so far up credit creek that even this minuscule difference was important there al said pointing at the ground a shimmer cascaded over him and he was gone only his footprints in the snow and the lingering scent of burnt amber remained i exhaled in annoyance and looked at the tall wall surrounding the property it was going to be another full twentyfour hours before ivy and i could go talk to skimmer not to mention that the is might find mia during that time and get someone killed concerned at the sound of running water i turned to bis surprised to find him spitting across the graveyard to coat individual grave markers in ice he was getting smaller by the second turning white as he warmed up by absorbing the warmth from the water before he let it go talk about weird there is no way im taking anyones aura i muttered imagining al sitting on me and holding my nose to make me open my mouth the truth was id been over to his apartments enough times now that he probably had a strand of hair to target a spell to me all he had to do was twist the curse and id be wearing someone elses aura nice bis spit tiny little ice cubes to get his balance perfect then flew up to land on the angels shoulder he looked a little ill you want me to come with you to the everafter the kid looked scared to death and my heart went out to him no absolutely not i said firmly looking for my discarded mirror and my forgotten bag of cookies al was just jerking you around i wouldnt take you even if you asked its nasty over there his wings drooped in relief and i added look i dont want to go into the church it would be just like al to show up and cause trouble will you tell ivy it didnt work and bring my bag out here its in my closet already packed oh and make sure she calls the correctional facility to set up something for monday safety was a good reason for not going back in the church but the truth of it was i didnt want to have to deal with jenks crap i didnt have time to waste a day in the everafter keeping al at arms length and going to parties it seemed thats all we ever did al called it networking no wonder the demon was broke sure ms morgan the gargoyle said his eyes downcast as if he knew why i was sending him instead of going myself bis stretched his wings going black as he drew all his warmth into his core to maintain his body heat while making the short flight to the church his leathery wings beat once and he was airborne looking scary as he flew to the church alone i snatched up the scrying mirror and my bag of cookies i wasnt looking forward to wearing someone elses aura id rather just suffer the pain head down i trudged through the snow wincing when i felt the icy warmth of the line take me usually it was hard to feel them like this but my aura was thin and this was my line unused by anyone else as it was rather small and surrounded by the dead people were superstitious finding my footprints from last week i went a few steps beyond and set the cookies and mirror on a nearby tombstone thanks beatrice i whispered reading the stone marker wrapping my arms around myself i stared at the night and tried to stay warm it was sort of like waiting at the bus stop and i found myself falling into blankstare mode with a wry smile i carefully unfocused my attentionslowly until i knew it wouldnt hurtto bring up my second sight hoping to spot al before he popped in to scare the crap out of me the red ribbon of power was suddenly around me looking like an aurora borealis as it swelled and ebbed always there always fluctuating running off to who knew where surrounding it was a broken landscape of stunted scrub and cold rock everything had a red sheen to it now except for the moon and the grave markers and though the moon looked its normal silver now when i crossed over to the everafter it would be an ugly shade of red not that wed stay on the surface long i shivered not liking it when my hair started to move in the wind from the everafter there was no snow but id be willing to bet it was colder there any time al i called then leaned against beatrices tombstone he was going to make me wait son of a bastard ah mistress witch a faintly familiar voice sighed youre as smart as a steel trap but i opine you wont keep body and soul together much longer nohow can i fix it if you maintain your course i spun around going warm when i saw al behind me casually leaning against a tombstone with one booted foot cocked on a toe he had made himself look like pierce and face hot i gritted my teeth but then i realized that al didnt know about pierce wouldnt know to look for him in my thoughts and wouldnt know what the man called me or the curious accent he hada mix of rough street talk and preturn english shocked i stared at the ghost dressed in an oldstyle threepiece suit and the memory of the long coat that had once belonged to my brother he was clean shaven this time and had a funnylooking hat on his head realizing i was looking at him he jerked himself upright his eyes wide in the moonlight pierce i said unsure is that you the small mans jaw dropped and he took his hat off as he stepped from the stone there were no footprints behind him it must be the line he whispered in wonder were both in the line and youre communing with itusing your second sight arent you his entire face brightened in the light from the back porch you dont do that very often stand in a line i couldnt move not believing it my dad told me not to because you never know what youll see i said lightly i felt unreal dizzy he shrugged and delight filled me on a quick intake of breath i crossed the space between us only to jerk to a stop smile fading it had to be a joke it had to be one of als perverted jokes whats the word to open my dads locket i asked cautiously pierce leaned forward and when his breath was cold not warm as als would be i felt a surge of hope lily white he whispered touching his nose and elated i reached out a gloved finger and jabbed his shoulder it hit him and he rocked back pierce i exclaimed giving him a fierce hug that made him grunt in surprise my god i can touch you then i let him go to give his shoulder a smack why didnt you do this before stand in a line i mean im here every week i was going to try to stir that spell again but now i dont have to damn its good to see you the small man searched my face grinning as the scent of coal dust shoe polish and redwood seeped into me ive been in a line when you were he said i abide here most times you leave to fulfill your bargain with the demon and i abide here when you return youve been spying on me i asked blushing when i remembered id called pierce sexy not five minutes ago in the kitchen jenkss claim that he was going to sell our secrets was ridiculous but there had been plenty going on in the church that i wouldnt want my mom to know much less an almost stranger from the nineteenth century spying pierce said looking affronted as he put his hat back on no ive been in the belfry most times apart from when the tv was spelled thats a powerful fine magic there his expression shifted to one of a satisfied appreciation as he took me in running his eyes from my hair to my feet youve grown into a damned fine young woman mistress witch well its good to see you too my eyebrows rose as i pulled my hand from his sure now that he had been in the kitchen before id come out here i went over in my mind what id said deciding thered been nothing i wouldnt want him to hear and a lot he probably ought to knowapart from me telling jenks to get bent perhaps smiling deviously i rocked back on my heels to intentionally catch my balance a few inches back a subtle reminder that i wasnt that eighteenyearoldgirl anymore trouble was i think he was glad of it sure enough his own smile deepened as he recognized me distancing myself gaze intent he inclined his head the porch light caught his eyes and they glinted lingering on my face making me wonder if i had chocolate chip cookie dough on my chin land sakes how could you have gotten so deep so fast he said his brow furrowing as he shook his head in dismay and changed the subject beholden to a demon you were so innocent when i left you his cool fingers tucked a strand of hair behind my ear and a shiver struck me when i took his hand out of my curls and he gripped my fingers um i murmured then remembered what i was going to say i had to save trent i promised him id get him home safely i still have my soul al doesnt own me the slamming of the back door jerked me around but it was only bis his frightening batlike silhouette lurched closer moving heavily from the bag he was carrying i took a breath to ask him to get ivy and pierce touched my chin turning me to him al will be back to fetch you soon he said his expression taking on a sudden urgency i beg you to be of a mind to find me when your lesson is done ill allow we can talk now and thats enough drawing upon a coven for power to give me a body for a night isnt worth the agony until i find a way to be whole again just promise me you wont tell your demon about me dont ask for his help i can fix this on my own hook bis landed heavily atop my canvas bag his skin black and cold and his eyes widening as he saw pierce he doesnt want me to ask al about him i thought when there might be a charm or spell that could bring him back to life jenks saying he was spying for secrets rose in my mind and my smile faded people dont ask you to do things unless they have a reason seeing me hesitate pierce frowned looking between me and the startled gargoyle its but a small thing rachel im of a mind to tell you why just not directly you can be of a mind to tell me now i said starting to warm my ears popped and i gasped as al was suddenly behind pierce eyes glowing and whitegloved hand reaching out pierce dove for the far edge of the line but it was too late rachel look out bis shouted and i stumbled backward falling over my bag my elbow hitting the cookies there was a whoosh of air as bis became airborne and i looked up at the hiss of the gargoyle hovering between me and al als elegantly coated arm was wrapped around pierces neck tightening until his feet dangled his face went red as he struggled bis landed between al and me his wings spread to look bigger since he was too cold to melt snow al i shouted moving forward until bis hissed at me what are you doing al peered over his smoked glasses at us his red goatslitted eyes delighted getting a better apartment he drawled sniffing at bis in warning oh shit al youve got to stop doing this i said pulse hammering as i shot a glance at the church but no one was at the windows snatching people talking to me is not fair al smiled to show his thick blocky teeth so pierce struggled his hat falling from him to vanish before it hit the snow give this no mind mistress witch he gasped face red and feet trying to find the ground this sevenbynine demon is of no circumstance ill be al jerked his arm cutting off pierces words and i winced busy the demon said youre going to be busy eyes on mine al ran his hand suggestively under pierces coat and the small man jerked hey i shouted but bis wouldnt let me get closer pacing a line in the snow his wings spread and placing his feet with an odd stiffness let him go this isnt fair we need to set up some rules about you popping in and snagging people i mean it you mean it al laughed shifting his grip until pierce grunted and went still looks like i dont need my name to find familiars after all he crooned the thought of pierce on the demon auction block was like ice down my back but that al might start popping in whenever he felt like it and snag whoever was with me was absolutely terrifying no way i said starting to get angry i am not going to be your bait let him go if you want him you catch him the oldfashioned way but i wont be used like this got it goat eyes i was so pissed i could have screamd pierce looked pained at my words but al simply laughed again use you as bait capital idea the demon cooed then grimaced at bis still stalking back and forth between us the thought never occurred to me i simply saw something i wanted and took it his eyes narrowed its what i do hes worthless i exclaimed almost stomping my foot and not believing him pierce is a ghost he cant tap a line youre doing this to irritate me let him go a slow smile grew on als face and he fondled the hair about pierces ear making him stiffen you dont know who this is do you al said sending a chill of doubt through me he was far too satisfied there are curses that can cure that tiny little problem of all spirit and no body and this piece of witchcrap al gave pierce a shake this one here he is worth a little extra time in the kitchen its just a matter of finding the right curse hes the golden boy the one who got away and hes going to pay my bills for the next thirty years i clenched my hands cold in their gloves pierce had a history with demons damn it you know him i said my words a white mist it would explain why pierce was so good with ley lines but he was so nice he was sonormal i do not practice demonology pierce exclaimed let me go directly you maggotridden piece of sheep liver or you will suffer a powerful defeat youre of no circumstance a secondrate al flexed his arm and pierce choked i never managed to actually find this one before al said regaining his usual supercilious air though pierce dug at his fingers around his throat but ive heard of him itchy witch everyone has heard of gordian nathaniel pierce he almost killed newt which is why im going to make enough money off him that you can keep my summoning name for the next decade someone will pay big for him his voice lowered even if they do nothing but poke at him not a demon practitioner but a demon killer i thought with a weird sense of tense relief even bis looked relieved i looked at the church but still no movement al you cant take people talking to me i said and when al laughed i blurted then ill buy him bis turned to me with wide eyes and even pierce opened his mouth to protest grunting when al jerked him not on your soul the demon crooned pulling pierce close until the mans lips pressed together defiantly and his eyes gleamed in hate well maybe al mused then shook his head no not even on your soul he affirmed i wont sell him to you despite that witchclass ceiling he has hes more dangerous than you right now hes at his peak besides how many nasty little men do you need for your familiars he said lightly looking at bis hes a bad man who likes to try to kill demons im not a demon i said my voice trembling and als eyes narrowed i am he intoned consider your night off as a thankyou for luring him to me itchy witch your lessons are canceled until further notice im going to be busy for a while al i shouted as they started to go misty dont you walk away from me smiling at me from over his glasses al shook his head youre not in control rachel i am of everything furious i shouted youre abusing your right to check on me and you know it give him back and stop abducting people im with or so help me im going toto al hesitated and i started to shake do what he asked and pierce closed his eyes in misery you cant draw on a line until your aura heals and im not fixing it for you glancing at bis he edged forward until the gargoyle hissed youre helpless rachel mariana morgan i dropped back stymied damn it using all three of my names was a warning probably the only one id ever get if i summoned him i might get my way but id lose what little respect hed given me and be back to being treated like a demon summoner and i liked the respect hed been granting me little as it was i enjoyed not having to fear every time the air pressure shifted though the parties in the everafter were a pain in the ass als kitchen was peaceful i didnt want that to end but his abducting of people was going to stop this is not over i vowed trembling from frustration we are going to settle this and youre going to let him go how itchy witch he scoffed my expression twisted as i searched for an answer that wasnt there seeing me without words al jerked pierce up almost off his feet dont call me ill call you he said and he and pierce vanished heart pounding i stared where he had been damn it back to the turn i shouted frustrated i spun to the church but there was nothing to help me there the lights were bright spilling out over the silent snow snatching up my bag and scrying mirror i stomped to the back door grabbing the cookies at the last moment al was going to be busy with pierce for a while but until i settled this everyone with me was a potential target this was so not what i needed seventeen i gnore me huh i muttered trying for anger not fear as i dropped my scrying mirror and cookies on the counter then kicked my overnight bag under the table out of the way the canvas sack scraped across a thin layer of salt leaving a smear of muddy snow and i turned to the cupboards salt i didnt know how to jump a line but i was going to use my scrying mirror to connect to al and i wanted to be in a circle in case he jumped to me first either way we were going to get together from atop the fridge bis shifted his wings nervously i hadnt even seen him come in with me the sensitive kid knew i was scared but if al wouldnt come to me id go to him he had thrown down the gauntlet taunting me with my inexperience telling me i was helpless id been relying on him for three months grown complacent i had a good idea now of how to travel the lines i couldnt let him get away with this or hed be walking all over me for the rest of my life hed crossed the line and it was up to me to make him back up a whisper of presence touched my awareness and i jerked turning to see ivy in the hall hand on the archway and wonder in her eyes i thought you were leaving youre still here he took pierce i said bitterly and her lips parted snatched him right out of the line damn it i didnt know that was possible her eyes flicked to the crushed cookies and back pierce was in the ley line she asked going to the fridge and coming out with the orange juice you saw him as a ghost i nodded scanning the kitchen for my chalk he was solid al took him i am so pissed the clatter of dragonfly wings grew obvious and jenks darted in following three of his kids in a merry chase he saw me and jerked to a stop as the youngsters hid behind bis on top of the fridge giggling rache he cried clearly surprised what are you doing back i never left i said sourly wheres my magnetic chalk i pulled open a drawer and shuffled around a salt circle was out i had melted snow all over the floor salt good saltwater bad i have to go talk to al i finished the pixys gaze dropped to the scrying mirror go go where i slammed the drawer shut and bis jumped the everafter eyes wide ivy turned from pouring her juice jenkss wings clattered and he flew close enough to send the scent of ozone over me whoa whoa whoa he exclaimed what by tinks little red shoes are you talking about you dont know how to jump the lines peeved i took off my coat and threw it onto my chair al took pierce i was talking to him and he took him al wont listen to me so im going to go talk to him end of story end of story is right have you been sniffing fairy farts jenks yelled as matalina flew in gathering the wideeyed kids and bis and ushering them out in a swirl of silk and leathery wings youre going to risk your life for this guy let him go rache you cant rescue everyone ivy tell her shes going to get herself killed i slammed another drawer shut and pulled open the next im not doing this to rescue pierce i said as i shifted through my silverware and blessed candles im doing this because al is a jerk he used the excuse of picking me up to snatch someone if i dont make him toe the line then he will walk all over me and where in hell is my magnetic chalk shocked jenks flew backward a few feet ivy pushed herself into motion and after pulling open the junk drawer she placed a stick of magnetic chalk in my hand and retreated her fingers gripping her orange juice were white from pressure my anger abruptly fizzled as i watched her return to her corner of the kitchen her pace was slow and sultry and her eyes were almost all black i knew my being upset was hard on her instincts and i exhaled trying to calm myself i wanted her here i could talk to al alone in the garden safely but this had the potential to be dangerousand id do it with them around why dont you just call dali and complain jenks asked a flash of worry flared and was gone i could i said as i bent double to trace a thick layer of shiny chalk just inside the etched line on the kitchen floor but then id be whining to someone else to fix my problem al still wouldnt take me seriously and id owe dali a favor if i dont force al to treat me with respect then ill never get it hes been carting my ass back and forth for weeks i can figure this out my hands were shaking as i set the chalk on the counter beside the scrying mirror how am i going to do this jenkss wings blurred to nothing but he didnt move from the counter worried i leaned against the sink and took my boots off no one said a word as i kicked one then the other boot under the table to slide to a stop beside my packed bag the gritty salt was obvious through my socks and i shivered at the feel of the linoleum if i could figure this out i would be free and when i showed up in als kitchen hed have to deal with me i should be thanking him for making me do this if i could do this taking a breath i stepped inside the circle jenks rose up red sparkles shifting from him ivy tell her this is a bad idea untouched orange juice beside her ivy shook her head if she could do this shed be safer she wouldnt have to rely on us as much jenks i say let her try the pixy made a burst of noise and his kids clustered at the door vanished a quiver went through me and i nervously pulled my scrying mirror close and set my hand in the cave of the pentagram instantly my fingers went cold the icy chill rising from the redtinted glass to nearly cramp them i can do this i said making myself believe you said the lines are displaced time ive seen al do it a hundred times qed think happy thoughts als kitchen the smell of ozone the peace mr fish jenks shifted to sift a red dust onto my calling circle if he stayed where he was hed be in the circle with me jenks go sit with ivy he shook his head crossing his arms over his chest no your aura isnt thick enough you might kill yourself wait until your aura is better i blew his dust from the glass and pressed my hand more firmly to it i dont have the time i have to settle this now or he will be walking all over me for the rest of my life get back my knees were shaking and i was glad the counter was between ivy and myself no im not letting you do this ivy tell her this is a bad idea get out of the circle jenks i said tightly what if al decides he wants a pixy huh or someone he knows develops a taste for vampires whats to stop him from popping over during dinner and just taking you or one of your kids i thought he had some scruples about this but i was wrong and by god im going to make him treat me with some respect the only reason al hasnt done this before is because he hasnt seen anyone with me worth his while but now hes broke hes going to start snatching get out of my circle jenks made a noise of frustration and in a burst of dust that lit up the kitchen he left from the sanctuary came a brief uproar of pixy shouting then nothing my blood pressure dropped and ivy opened her eyes as i looked at her they were black with fear how long do you want me to wait before i have keasley summon you back i looked at the window then the clock right before sunrise my head hurt and i forced my jaw to unclench this was going to be the most difficult thing id ever done and i didnt even know if i could do it i looked at the clock above the sink and with a slow exhale of breath i tapped the line out back i shuddered as it spilled into me with that new raw coldness of jagged metal scraping back and forth along my nerves the sensation seemed worse than before the nauseating irregularity making me sick jenkss wings hummed as he came back in hovering beside ivy with black sparkles drifting from him my circle wasnt set yet but he stayed with ivy i blinked and shuddered waiting for my equilibrium to return dizzy i said remembering the sensation but im okay i can do this how hard can it be tom can do it its your thin aura the pixy said rache please jaw clenched and vertigo rising i shook my head becoming even dizzier i made myself stand straighter and when ivy nodded at me i awkwardly pulled the sock off my right foot and put my big toe on the smooth tang of the magnetic chalk rhombus i thought firmly the trigger word would spell the circle in an eyeblink pain sliced through me i jerked my hand from the mirror doubling over as the energy from the line roared in unfiltered and without the cushion of my aura oh god i moaned then fell to the cold linoleum when a new wave hit me it hurt holding the circle hurt and hurt bad the entire dizzying sharp pulses smacking into me with the force of a mack truck you could survive being hit by a mack truck in fact i had but not without the cushion of an air bag and an inertia charm my aura had been that cushion now it was so thin as to be useless ivy jenks was shouting as my cheek ground into the saltgritty linoleum when another spasm hit me do something i cant get to her i didnt let go of the linei shoved it out of me a silent wave of force exploded from my chi and i gasped in relief as the pain vanished the electricity went out and an unexpected snap of power echoed through the church down jenks shouted and a sharp pop hurt my ears shit ivy hissed and my cheek scraped the salty floor when i blearily looked up at her quick steps into the pantry behind me my attention though never left the fridge it was on fire the ghastly goldandblack glow of my magic lighting the powerless kitchen as the door swung open hanging from one bolt i broke our fridge jenks i whispered remembering the force of the line id shoved out of me i think i just blew every fuse in the church i heard the hum of pixy wings over me as ivy put the magically induced fire out with the fire extinguisher behind me i could hear the pixies but i closed my eyes content to lie on the floor in a fetal position as the lights flickered back on the choking hiss of the extinguisher ceased and all that was left was my ragged breathing no one moved damn it ivy do something jenks said the draft from his wings hurting my skin pick her up i cant help her im too damned small at the edge of my awareness ivys boots ground the salt in agitation i cant she whispered look at me jenks i cant touch her i took another breath grateful the pain was gone sitting up i wrapped my arms around my shins and dropped my head to my knees shaking from the lingering memory of the pain and shock damn it i broke our fridge no wonder al had been so confident he had said i was helpless and he was right and as i sat there beaten i felt the first tear of frustration trickle down my face if i couldnt get al to treat me with more respect i would be alone i couldnt have a deeper relationship with marshal because id make him a target pierce wasnt even alive and he was now going to live out eternity in the everafter plucked from my backyard eventually al would turn to ivy and jenks unless i forced him to conform to common decency everyone around me was living on a demons whim i couldnt seem to catch a break depressed i sat on my kitchen floor and tried to keep from shaking i needed someone to hold me someone who would wrap me up in a blanket and take care of me while i figured it all out and having no one i held myself holding my breath so another tear wouldnt leak out i was hurt and in pain both in my body and heart i could cry if i wanted to damn it ivy jenks said panic in his small voice pick her up im too small i cant help her she needs to be touched or shes going to think shes alone i am alone i cant ivy shouted making me jump look at me if i touch her eyes wet i looked up a shiver ran through me as i saw her before the broken fridge spent co dripping from the shelves her eyes were full vampire black her hands were clenched with repressed need instinct triggered by rynn cormel earlier tonight warred with her desire to comfort me the instincts were winning if she made one move to help me shed end up at my throat i cant touch you she said tears slipping from her making her look beautiful im so sorry rachel i cant jenks darted to the ceiling when she shifted into motion she was fleeing and in an eyeblink the kitchen was empty wobbling i got to my feet she had fled but i knew she wasnt leaving the church she just needed the time and space to find herself again its okay i whispered not looking at jenks as i lurched to my feet its not her fault jenks im going to take a shower ill be better after a hot shower dont let your kids near me until the sun comes up okay i couldnt live with myself if al snatched them jenks hovered where he was as i used the counter and then the wall for balance to stagger to the bathroom my head down and my eyes unseeing behind me i left the wreckage of the kitchen a shower wouldnt help but i had to get out of the room i needed someone to hold me and tell me it was going to be okay but i was alone jenks couldnt help me ivy couldnt touch me hell even bis couldnt touch me everyone else i had come close to was dead or not strong enough to survive the crap my life dished out i was alone just like mia had said and i always would be eighteen it had been hard staying asleep with ivys crashing around this morning coming in about ten showering by the sound of it and leaving an hour later jenkss kids hadnt helped either flying up and down the hall playing tag with rex nevertheless i buried my head in my pillow and stayed in bed as seven pounds of kitty fur slammed into walls and knocked over an end table i was tired aura sick and depressedand i was going to sleep in so several hours later when jenks locked rex in my room to get his kids to shut up for their noon nap i barely heard the front door open and the soft steps pass my door ivy i assumed and i sighed snuggling deeper under my coverlet glad that shed found a shred of kindness and was going to let me sleep but no i was never that lucky rachel came a highpitched whisper and the sound of dragonfly wings susurrated into my dream of ambertinted fields of grain pierce was stretched out in them a stalk of wheat between his teeth gazing up at red clouds you cant kill me mistress witch he said smiling before he vanished with my conscious thought and i fully awoke go away jenks i mumbled and pulled the blanket over my head rache wake up there was the scrape of my drapes being opened and the harsh clatter of jenkss wings marshal is here why lifting my head i squinted through my hair at the sudden light the memory of steps in the hall resurfaced and i rolled to see my clock ten after one not much of a sleepin the sun was bright through my stainedglass window and it was cold rex was a warm puddle at my feet and as i watched she stretched ending it with an inquiring trill to jenks now standing beside the stuffed giraffe on my dresser marshal is here he repeated his angular face looking concerned he brought breakfast you know doughnuts i propped myself up on an elbow and tried to figure out what was going on oh yeah wheres ivy out pricing new refrigerators his wings blurred into motion and he rose his reflection in the mirror making twice the glow she spent the morning at cormels but she came back to shower before she went out she told me to tell you that since youre not in the everafter today she got an appointment to see skimmer at six six after sunset nice i had wanted to have lunch with my mom and robbie today but i could postpone it a little i heard her come in i sat up and blearily looked at the clock again i didnt like that ivy had been with rynn cormel the pretty monster but what could i say and why does my mouth taste like apples leaning over i pulled rex across the mounds of covers to me for a cuddle hello i liked her a lot more now that she would let me touch her are you going to get up jenks added his wings hitting a pitch akin to nails on a chalkboard marshal is in the kitchen doughnuts i could smell coffee too im not even dressed i complained as i let go of rex and swung my feet to the cold floor im a mess thank god its daylight or al might come over and decide to take him too the pixy crossed his arms over his chest giving me a superior look as he stood beside my giraffe hes seen you look worse like the time you rolled your snowmobile into those fir trees or when he took you ice fishing and you got minnow guts in your hair shut up i exclaimed as i stood rex jumped to the floor and went to stand under the doorknob waiting and stop trying to fix me up with him i said fully awake and irritated i know you asked him to come over he shrugged with one shoulder looking embarrassed i want you to be happy you arent you and marshal have a good time when you do stuff together and pierce is dangerous im not interested in pierce i said glaring at jenks as i shoved my arms into the sleeves of my blue terrycloth robe and tied it closed then why are you hellbent for pixy dust on trying to rescue him he asked but the severe attitude he was trying for was ruined by the smiling stuffed animal beside him if it wasnt for him you wouldnt have hurt yourself last night last night was me trying to keep al from abusing his right to check on me to abduct other people i said in a huff that it might get pierce back is no small thing but do you really think im only going to rescue people i want to jump in the sack with not that im looking to jump in the sack with pierce i amended as jenks raised a pointed finger i rescued trent didnt i yeah you did jenks dropped his hand i never understood that either rex stretched on her hind feet to pat the doorknob and i went to my dresser for a set of undies hold on rex i crooned i knew how she felt i had to go too rache even if you do help him i dont trust the guy i mean hes a ghost my eyebrows rose this is why hes suddenly gung ho on marshal i thought jenks thought he was the safer of the two irritated i slammed the drawer shut and he rose up in a burst of light will you get off it i exclaimed i am not attracted to pierce at least not enough to do anything about it if i dont make al treat me with respect everyone around me is in jeopardy okay thats why im doing this not because i need a date jenkss wings hummed i know you he said in a hard voice you cant get to a happy ending from here youre selfsabotaging by chasing something you cant have selfsabotaging is he not even listening to me black socks in hand i looked up at him finding we were eye to eye you watch too many daytime talk shows i said then shut the drawer hard jenks said nothing but his words kept pricking me as i yanked a pair of jeans off a hanger mia had said i was running afraid to believe someone could survive being with me that id be alone out of fear she said that even though i lived with ivy and jenks i was still alone upset i looked at my sweaters stacked up in the organizer ivy had gotten me not really seeing them i dont want to be alone i breathed and jenks was suddenly at my shoulder you arent he said his voice heavy with concern but you need someone besides me and ivy give marshal a chance this isnt between marshal and pierce i said as i pulled out a black sweater but my thoughts kept returning to jenks yelling at ivy to pick me up because he was too small to do it ivy couldnt touch me or show me she loved me without that damned blood lust kicking in i had good friends who would risk their lives for me but i was still alone id been alone since kisten died even when marshal and i did stuff together always alone always separate i was tired of it i liked being with someone the closeness two people could share and i shouldnt feel i was weak for wanting it i wouldnt let what mia said become the truth tucking my clothes under my arm i smiled thinly at jenks i hear what youre saying jenks rose up and followed me so youll give marshal a chance i knew his being too small to help me had torn him up jenks i said and his wings went still i appreciate what youre trying to do but im okay ive been picking myself up off the floor for twentysix years im good at it if marshal and i were to change things id want it to be for a real reason not because we were both lonely jenkss wings drooped i just want you to be happy rache i glanced at rex twining about herself under the knob i am i said then added your cat needs to go out ill get her he muttered and when i opened the door both he and the cat darted out marshal i peeked around the door frame to find that jenks and rex had already reached the back living room and that the hall was empty ill be right there from the kitchen came the sound of a sliding chair followed by marshals familiar resonant voice saying take your time rachel ive got coffee so im happy there was a hesitation and as i waited to see if he was going to look into the hall he added in a preoccupied voice whats in the potions it smells like carbonic wax uh i stammered not wanting to tell him they didnt work locator charms for the fib i have to invoke them and put them in disks i added so hed leave them alone cool he said softly the squeak of jenks opening the pixykitty door was obvious and confident that marshal wasnt going to peek into the hall i made the dash to my bathroom easing the door closed when i heard jenks and marshal start to talk oh thats nice i whispered when i saw my reflection black rings made an obvious showing under my eyes and i was as pale as jenkss ass id showered before bed to try and warm up and sleeping with damp hair had left it looking like snakes had been in it thank god marshal hadnt come out of the kitchen my complexion amulet would take care of the circles and i got the water going and slowly undressed while i waited for it to warm carefully until i knew how dizzy it would make me i sent my awareness to my ley line out back vertigo eased in and i let go of the line immediately i wasnt going to be setting a circle any time today but it was better than last night and i hoped i wasnt putting myself in danger by walking around not able to set one nothing different from the first twentysix years of your life i whispered but then again i hadnt had vampires demons and freakedout elves gunning for me then either because i was mindful of marshal waiting my usual twentyminute indulgence became a hasty fiveminute splashanddash my thoughts kept cycling between marshal in my kitchen and pierce in the everafter complaining to dali wasnt a good option neither was trying to jump the lines until i could hold one without pain al wasnt playing fair and it was up to me to make him there had to be a way to get him to respect me other than resorting to dali but my mind stayed blissfully empty all the way through the shampoo rinse and repeat it was finally the low rumble of marshals voice as i was toweling my hair that reminded me i had a more immediate problem sitting in my kitchen drinking coffee i swung my hair around and wiped the mirror clear wondering what i was going to do about this jenks had probably filled his head with nonsense i couldnt be marshals girlfriend he was too good a guy and though he was able to react in a crisis marshal probably never had people trying to kill him i dressed quickly then yanked a brush through my damp hair and left it to dry jenkss voice was clear as i opened the door and padded stockingfooted to the kitchen i entered the sundrenched kitchen to see that the fridge was ducttaped shut but otherwise normal looking jenks was at the table with marshal and the tall man looked like he belonged sitting with the pixy and one of jenkss kids fighting his noon nap marshal met my eyes and my smile faded hi marshal i said remembering how he had helped jenks and me in mackinaw when we really needed it id always be grateful for that morning rachel the witch said as he stood new diet plan i followed his eyes to the fridge reluctant to tell him id blown it up yup i hesitated then recalling him visiting me in the hospital i gave him a quick hug hardly touching him jenks rose with his kid and moved to the sink and the slice of sun any news on my classes marshals broad shoulders lifted and fell i havent checked my email today but im going in later im sure its just a glitch i hoped he was right id never heard of a university refusing money thanks for breakfast i said as i looked at the open box of doughnuts on the counter thats really nice marshal ran a hand over his short black hair just checking on you ive never known anyone to sneak out of the hospital before jenks said you had a runin with al last night you made coffee i said not wanting to talk about al thanks smells good i headed for the carafe beside the sink marshal clasped his hands in front of himself and then let go as if realizing how vulnerable it made him look ivy made the coffee before she left jenks offered sitting on the spigot with a kid sleeping on his lap i leaned against the sink and sipped my coffee eyeing the two men at opposite ends of the kitchen i didnt like my mom playing matchmaker i liked it even less when jenks tried it marshal sat back down he looked uncomfortable so your aura looks better a sigh slipped from me and i relented it had been nice of him to visit me in the hospital its getting there i said sourly thats why i was asking al for today off actually apparently my aura is too thin to travel the lines safely i cant even make a circle dizzy and it puts me in so much pain i cant breathe but why bring that up im sorry marshal took a doughnut and held the box out to me it will be okay so they tell me coming forward i leaned over the center counter to take a glazed im thinking next week it will be back to normal marshal glanced at jenks before he said softly i meant about pierce jenks told me you saw him in the line and then al took him god rachel im sorry you must be really upset i felt the blood drain from my head jenks had the decency to look discomfitted and i set the doughnut on a napkin thats an understatement i didnt know i had that particular hole to plug just one more thing for ms rachel to fix along with finding kistens murderer i am a freaking albatross the witch rubbed a hand over his short hair only two months long i understand when someone you care about is in danger youll move the world for them my blood pressure spiked and frowning at jenks i put a hand on my hip jenks your cat is at the door the pixy opened his mouth looked at my grimace then took the hint he exchanged some male look with marshal that i couldnt interpret and with the sleeping child on his hip he flew out he looked kinda nice with a sleeping child and i wondered how matalina was doing jenks had been very closedlipped about her lately i waited until even the humming of his wings was gone then sat across from marshal i only knew pierce one day i said feeling like i owed him an explanation i was eighteen jenks thinks im looking for men i cant have a real relationship with so i dont have to feel guilty about not having one in my life but really theres nothing between pierce and me hes just a nice guy who needs some help because he has the misfortune to know me im not trying to be your boyfriend marshal said to the floor im just trying to be your friend that hit every single guilt button i had and i closed my eyes to try to figure out what i could say to that marshal as a friend nice thought but id never managed to have a male friend i didnt end up in the sack with hell id had thoughts about ivy for that matter marshal was the longest id ever seriously known a guy without letting it spill into the physical but we werent really dating were we confused i exhaled slowly wondering how i was going to handle this i looked at his hand it was a nice hand strong and tanned marshal i started the phone rang in the living room and the extension in the kitchen blinked on mute from last night jenks shouted hed get it and i dropped back in my chair marshal i repeated when rex padded in since her master wasnt eavesdropping on us in the hall anymore i love what youre trying to do and its not that i dont find you attractive i said flushing and starting to babble but i study with demons ive got their smut all over me and my aura is so thin i cant tap a line and do anything you deserve better than my crap you really do im not worth it nothing is my gaze jerked up when marshal leaned over and took my hand i never said you werent hard to be with he said softly his brown eyes gazing earnestly at me i knew that the moment you walked into my shop with a sixfoot pixy and bought a dive with a vampiric charms credit card but youre worth it youre a good person and i like you i want to help you when i can and im getting better at staying out of the way and not feeling guilty when i cant his hand on mine was warm and i gazed at it i needed to hear that i whispered so my voice wouldnt break thank you but im not worth dying for and its a distinct probability the clatter of pixy wings intruded and when jenks flew in marshal drew back warming i hid my hands under the table ah rache jenks said glancing between us its edden i hesitated my first impulse to have him call me back maybe he had something on mia its about a banshee jenks continued he says if you dont pick up the phone hes going to send a car i stood and marshal smiled and took a doughnut is it about mia i asked as i reached for the extension my eyes flicked to the useless locator potions lined up on the counter and i blinked they were gone wheres my i started and marshal waved a hand for my attention hanging in your cupboard i invoked them for you his eyes widened at my suddenly worried expression sorry i shouldve asked but you said they were done i thought i could help you know no its okay i said distantly hearing edden on the line talking to me um thanks i said flushing great now he knew i had messed up on them he made his own charms and would know by the lack of redwood scent that they were duds embarrassed i turned to the phone edden i said mortified did you find her no but i want your help this afternoon with one of these banshee women edden said without preamble his gravelly voice a mix of preoccupied gratefulness sounding odd with the original line still open in the living room this ones name is ms walker shes the iciest woman ive talked to since my motherinlaw and that was just from our phone conversation i glanced at marshal then turned my back on him jenks was sitting on his shoulder his kid probably in the desk where he belonged she called the department this morning edden was saying drawing my attention back and shes flying in this afternoon from san diego to help me find ms harbor can you be here when i talk to her banshees police themselves same as vampires and she wants to helpseeing as the is wont do anything the last was said rather sourly and i nodded though he couldnt see it this was making sense but i wasnt sure i wanted to meet this woman if a freaking baby of her species had almost killed me uh i hedged uneasy id really like to help and all but my aura is still thin i dont think talking to another banshee is a good idea besides ive got to come up with a way to make al behave today jenks buzzed his wings in approval but edden wasnt happy she wants to meet you he said asked for you rachel she made you being there a stipulation for talking to me i need you i sighed wondering if edden was above stretching the truth to reach an ending he wanted putting a hand to my head i thought for a moment jenks i asked not sure about this can you tell if she starts sucking on me the pixys wings brightened you bet rache he said clearly glad he could help i bit my bottom lip and listened to the echo of the open line as i weighed the risks id like to see mia get her own for letting her kid try to kill me and ms walker could help okay i said slowly and edden made a pleased rumble where and when her plane comes in at three but shes on west coast time so how about a late lunch edden said confidently on the fib you mean my lunch or your lunch i asked rolling my eyes uh say four at carew tower carew tower this has to be some woman ill send someone to pick you up edden was saying oh and good job on the ama how did you get one so fast i glanced at jenks sitting on marshals shoulder rynn cormel i said hoping marshal was starting to understand how risky it was to be around me damn edden exclaimed you do have pull see you this afternoon hey hows glenn i asked but the phone had clicked off four at carew tower i thought mentally going through my closet for something to wear as i hung up the phone i can do that how am i going to do that i was exhausted and id just gotten up my gaze darted to the island counter where id once kept my spell books ivy had moved them all back into the belfry when id been in the hospital and the thought of bringing them all down again made me sigh al had said there wasnt a spell to supplement a persons aura but maybe there was something to protect a person from a banshee i stood to go check and from the living room came the beeping of the open line jenks buzzed out to take care of it and i froze remembering i had company uh im sorry i said staring at marshals amused expression as he sat comfortably in his chair and ate a doughnut i have to go up to the attic and get some books to look for a uh spell want some help bringing them down he asked already stretching into a stand its just a couple of books i hedged thinking about the demon texts in with the others not a problem he headed to the sanctuary pace casual and confident and i scrambled to follow crap how am i going to explain why i have demon texts the sanctuary was silent warm from the space heater cranked up for the pixies jenks had hung up the phone and he was sitting with his two eldest kids in the rafters on sentry duty i can do this by myself i said when i caught up with marshal and he gave me a sideways look its just a couple of books he said then took a bite of the doughnut he had brought with him ill bring them down and then if you want me to leave i will he added around his full mouth i know youve got work to do i just wanted to check on you was all his tone had held a measure of hurt in it and i felt bad as i followed him through the cold foyer and into the unheated circular stairway that led into the belfry i had spelled up there once before when id been hiding from demons last halloween marshal had just come into town and was looking for an apartment cripes had it been two months that wed been doing stuff it seemed longer marshal i said as we found the top and i clenched my arms around me in the chill of the unheated belfry dang it was cold up here and my breath steamed i searched the open rafters above the huge bell that made a false roof over the space but bis was elsewhere hed probably put himself on the eaves last night where the sun would hit him all day the adolescent gargoyle didnt come in apart from inclement weather and when he got older he probably wouldnt come in even then hey this is nice marshal said and i dropped back pleased as he looked the hexagonal room over the rough floor was the color of dust and the walls had never been finished still showing the twobyfours and the back of the siding it was the same temperature as the outside about fifty something refreshing after the steamy warmth downstairs the slatted windows let in slices of light and sound making it a nice hideyhole where one could sit and watch the day happen i wasnt surprised when marshal bent one of the slats to look out next to him was the folding chair id left up here for when i had to get away the middle of the tenbyten space held an antique dresser with a green marble top and an agespotted mirror my library was on the mahogany shelf propped up in one of the spaces between the windows beside it next to the door was a faded fainting couch other than that the space was empty of everything except the almost subliminal hum of the bell resonating faintly tired i sat on the couch and pulled one of the books onto my lap content to sit while marshal satisfied his curiosity my thoughts sifted back downstairs to the useless charms in my cupboard um marshal about those locator charms i said softly marshal turned smiling my lips are sealed he said crossing the room i know the stuff you do for the fib is confidential dont worry about it okay thats weird i thought when marshal sat beside me taking the book out of my hand and opening it how could he not know the charms were bad what are we looking for he asked cheerfully then looked at his hand when it probably started to tingle demon books were like that a spell to protect my aura i offered um thats a demon text youve got there marshal blinked stiffening as he realized what hed opened thats why you keep them up here he said looking at it and i nodded much to my surprise he didnt give the book back but turned the page curiosity getting the better of him you dont need a charm to help your aura he said what you need to do is get a massage my shoulders eased and glad he wasnt running screaming into the afternoon i murmured a massage full body head to toe he said starting when he turned the page and found a curse to destroy an army with a single note of music you really think this works if you do it right sure reaching i picked up a university textbook and turned to the index my fingers were cold and i blew on them a massage will make it all better huh marshal chuckled and turned a yellowed page if you do it right sure he said mimicking me and i looked up to find him smiling scouts honor massage triggers the digestive and sleep rhythms thats when your aura replenishes itself you get a massage and your aura will be better i eyed him trying to figure out if he was joking or not really yup his confident assurance faltered when he saw the next curse to blow up a wind strong enough to topple buildings he looked at me then the curse uh rachel he stammered what i said as my warning flags started going up i wasnt a black witch damn it this is some creepyass shit he said brow furrowed and i laughed sliding the demon book back onto my lap and the university text onto the floor thats why i dont do it i said grateful that he didnt think i was bad just because i had a book that told me how to twist a curse to cause the black plague he made a small sound and scooted down to read over my shoulder so running the risk of opening a wound what did robbie think about you being in the hospital i turned a page and blanched how to create wolf pregnancy in humans damn i didnt know i had that one in my library uh i stammered quickly turning the page robbie said it was par for the course and told me to stop doing dangerous things because it might upset mom hes the one upset though not her thats about what i thought hed say marshal leaned into my space and turned the page for me i breathed deep enjoying both the extra body heat in the cold belfry and the rich scent of redwood hed been spelling recently and i wondered if he had a modified warmth amulet keeping him from shivering i like your brother he said unaware that i was breathing him in it irks me though seeing him treat you like youre the same kid you were when he left my older brother does that to me makes me want to pound him mmmm i let the weight of our bodies slide us together a little bit more thinking it suspicious that he was saying all the right things robbie moved out when i was thirteen he hasnt had the chance to see me as a grownup our arms touched as i turned the page but he didnt seem to notice and then i go and put myself in the hospital the week he comes for a visit really good huh marshal laughed then peered more closely at the text describing how to make bubbles last till sunrise and i felt better as he saw that not all curses were bad i suppose you could make them appear in someones lungs and suffocate them but you could also entertain children thanks for coming with me to my moms i said softly watching him not the curses he was flipping through i dont think i could have taken sitting there all night and listening to cindy this cindy that followed by the inevitable and when are you going to get a steady boyfriend rachel moms are like that he said in a preoccupied tone she just wants you to be happy i am happy i said sourly and marshal chuckled probably trying to memorize the curse to turn water into wine good for parties but he wouldnt be able to invoke it lacking the right enzymes in his blood i could though sighing i pushed the book entirely onto his lap and dragged a new one onto mine it was cold up here but i didnt want to go downstairs and risk waking up four dozen pixies am i jealous that robbie seems to have everything has it so easy you know marshal said not looking up from the book he was searching for me we dont have to keep things the way they arewith us i mean i stiffened marshal must have felt it seeing as our shoulders were touching i didnt say anything and emboldened by my lack of a negative response he added i mean last october i wasnt ready for anyone new in my life but now my breath caught and marshal cut his thought short okay he said sliding to put space between us sorry forget i said anything im lousy at body language my bad my bad when did anyone ever say my bad anymore but letting this go without saying anything was easier said than done especially when id been thinking the same thing off and on in stupidrachel moments for weeks so licking my lips i said carefully to the book on my lap ive had fun with you these last couple of months its okay rachel he interrupted edging farther down the long fainting couch forget i said anything hey ill just go okay my pulse quickened im not asking you to leave im saying ive had fun with you i was hurting then i still am but ive laughed a lot and i like you he looked up slightly redfaced and with his brown eyes holding a new vulnerability my mind went back to me sitting on the kitchen floor with no one to pick me up i took a deep breath scared ive been thinking too marshal exhaled as if a knot had untwisted in him when you were in the hospital he said quickly god help me but i suddenly saw what wed been doing the last couple of months and something hurt me it didnt feel that good to be there i quipped and then jenks told me you collapsed in your kitchen he added with a worried sincerity i know you can take care of yourself and that youve got ivy and jenks the line ripped through my aura i explained it hurt my mind jerked back to my jealousy when i sat all night beside marshal and listened to robbie go on about cindy almost glowing why couldnt i have some stability like that marshal shifted to take my hand the space between us looking larger for it i like you rachel i mean i really like you he said almost scaring me not because youve got sexy legs and know how to laugh or because you get excited in chase scenes and take the time to help get a puppy out of a tree that was really weird wasnt it his fingers tightened on mine drawing my gaze down jenks said you thought you were alone and you might do something stupid trying to rescue that ghost at that i gave up on all pretense of levity im not alone maybe mia was right but i didnt want her to be even if i was i could still stand alone id done it all my life and i could do it well but i didnt want to i shivered from the cold or the conversation and marshal frowned i dont want to ruin what we have marshal said his voice soft in the absolute stillness of a winters afternoon he slowly slid closer and i set the book on my lap on the floor to lean up against his side testing the feeling though i was stiff and uncertain trying it on it felt like it fit which worried me maybe friends is enough he added as if really considering it ive never had as good a relationship with a woman as ive got with you and im just smart enough and old enough and tired enough to let it ride as it is me too i said almost disappointed i shouldnt be resting against him leading him on i was a danger to everyone i liked but the weres had backed off and the vamps id get al to see reason i didnt want jenks to be right about me chasing the unattainable as an excuse to be alone i had a great relationship with marshal right now just because it wasnt physical didnt make it any less real or did it i wanted to care about someone i wanted to love someone and i didnt want to be afraid to i didnt want to let mia win marshal i still dont know if im ready for a boyfriend reaching out i touched the short hair behind his ear heart pounding id spent so much effort trying to convince myself that he was off limits that just that small motion seemed erotic he didnt move and my hand drifted down until my fingers brushed his collar a whisper from touching his skin a small spot of feeling grew and i drew my gaze back to his but id like to see if i am if you do his hand came up to pin mine against his shoulder not binding but promising more his free hand dropped lower suggestively crossing the invisible boundary of my defenses and retreating to give me his answer that wed spent the last two months keeping our distance made that simple move surprisingly intense marshal reached to tilt my head up to his and i let my head move easily in his grip turning to face him his fingers were warm on my jawline as he searched my gaze weighing my words against his own worries i shivered in the chill you sure he said i mean we cant go back he had already seen the crap of my life and he hadnt left did it matter if this didnt last forever if it gave me peace right now no im not sure i whispered but if we wait until we are neither of us will find anyone that seemed to give him a measure of assurance and i closed my eyes as he gently turned my face to his and tentatively kissed me tasting of sugar and doughnuts feeling raced through me heat from wanting something i said i never would pursue his hand pulled me closer and the slip of a tongue sent a dart of desire to my middle oh god it felt good and my mind raced as fast as my heart i didnt want this to be a mistake id been with him for two months and proved neither of us was here for the physical stuff so why not see if it worked tension plinked through me sharpening my thoughts and arraying an almostforgotten possibility before me despiteor maybe because ofour platonic relationship i wasnt ready to sleep with him that would be just too weird and jenks would tell me i was overcompensating for something but he was a ley line witchi wasnt a slouch eitherand though the ageold technique of drawing energy from one witch to another probably had its origins in our ancestral past to assure that strong witches procreated with strong witches to promote species strength nowadays all that remained was insanely good foreplay there was only one problem wait i said breathless as our kiss broke and reason filtered back into me marshals fingers slowed and dropped youre right i should go dumb idea ill uh call you if you want in about a year maybe he sounded embarrassed and i put a hand on his arm marshal looking up i shifted closer until our thighs touched dont go i swallowed hard i uh i havent been with a witch in ages i said in a small voice unable to look up one who could pull on a line i mean id kind of like toyou know but i dont know if i remember how his eyes widened as he understood and his chagrin at my supposed rebuff was pushed out by something deeper older the question our dna had written that begged to be answered who was the more proficient witch and how much fun could we have finding that out rachel he said his soft laugh turning me warm you dont forget stuff like that my mortification grew but his gaze was one of understanding and it gave me strength i didnt practice ley lines much then now i shrugged embarrassed i dont know my limits and with my aura being damaged i let my words trail off to nothing marshal put his forehead against mine his hands on my shoulders ill be careful he whispered would you rather pull than push he said softly hesitantly i flushed hot but i nodded still not looking at him pulling was more intimate more soul stealing more tender more dangerous in terms of confusing it with love but it was safer when the two people didnt know each others ley line limits he leaned in slowly for an inquisitive kiss my eyes closed as his lips met mine and i exhaled into it my grip on his shoulders tightening i shifted to face him marshal responded his hand going to the back of my head possessive yet hesitant his redwood scent sparked in me a rise of emotion pure and untainted by the fear that had always lurked with kisten the kiss lacked the adrenaline push of fear but it struck just as deep hitting emotion born in our beginnings there was danger in this notsoinnocent kiss there was the potential for ecstasy or an equal amount of pain and the dance would be very careful as trust was only a promise between us my pulse leapt at the chance to see this through a power pull didnt have to include sex but it was probably the reason female witches always came back after playing with invariably more wellendowed human males even if humans could work the lines they couldnt do a power pull my only worry besides embarrassment was my compromised aurait might hurt instead it was basically the same thing al used for punishment forcing a line into me to cause pain but it was like comparing a loving kiss to rape a trill of anticipation lit through me and was gone oh god i hope i remember how to do this cause i really want to i drew him to me even as i broke our kiss my breath came fast and eyes still shut i leaned my head against his shoulder lips open as i breathed in his scent one of his hands held my waist the other was lost in my hair i tensed at the feel of his fingers he knew i wasnt going to hit him with a blast of ley line force to repel him and his advances but several millennia of instinct were hard to best with only a lifetime of experience and wed go slow i shifted straddling his legs pinning him to the back of the couch a spike of anticipation dove deep it was followed by worry what if i couldnt loosen up enough to do this my breath was fast and with my hands laced behind his head i opened my eyes to find his their deep brown was heady with a desire to match my own i shifted feeling him under me you ever done this with a friend before i asked nope but theres a first time for everything he said and i could hear the smile in his voice as well as see it you need to be quiet i i managed to get out before his hands edged under my shirt and he kissed me again my pulse hammered and as the roughsmoothness of his hands explored my midriff and rose higher his mouth on mine grew intense i met his aggression with my own sending my hands to his waist dipping a finger beneath his jeans to prove i might do more someday i pressed into his warmth deciding not to think anymore but just to be my chi was utterly empty so with the soft hesitancy of a virginal kiss i reached out my awareness and found the simmering energy his chi held marshal felt it his hands on me tightened and relaxed telling me to draw it from him to set his entire body alight with the rush of adrenaline and the ecstasy of endorphins when i forcibly took it i exhaled willing it to come the warmth of his hands on me flashed into tingles in a sudden rush that shocked us the balances equalized adrenaline spiked out of control marshal groaned and frightened i tightened my awareness barriers clamped down and i warmed in embarrassment but the energy had come in smooth and pure lacking the sickening nausea that a ley line left me in coming from a person it had lost its jagged edges marshal i gushed totally miserable im sorry im not good at this marshal shuddered opening one eye to focus on me he had gone utterly pliant under me frighteningly so who says he whispered sitting up to pull me farther onto his lap i was ready to throw myself out the window i could feel the energy from him in my chi scintillating and tasting of masculinity in my thoughts it wanted to go back to him but i was afraid id closed myself to him and it was going to be harder now rachel marshal soothed his hand running up and down my arm relax youve been carrying around chunks of everafter with the intent of hurting people if they attack you and because of that youve built one hell of a wall yeah but just shut up he said giving me little kisses that distracted and sent tingles of desire building in me its okay marshal this is so weird kissing him and i walled the thought off use your lips for something other than talking will you if it doesnt work it doesnt work no big deal mmmmph i mumbled surprised when he wrapped his arms around me and hiked me farther onto him silencing my protests with his mouth giving up i kissed him feeling myself relax and tense up all at the same time my breath came faster as marshals hands started exploring running across my jeans to drag me up where i could feel him pressing into me i took his mouth with my own finding a kiss slowly tasting him as his redwood scent filled me his tongue slipped into my mouth and i pushed back it was my undoing i gasped hands flying to his shoulders to shove away when he pulled on my chi with an exquisite ping of adrenaline i fought him even as he gripped me harder forcing me to stay the shock was heady and with a sound of desperation i broke our kiss panting i stared at him breathless in the chill winter afternoon damn that had felt good sorry sorry i panted sexual excitement pounding in me for what marshal asked heat in his gaze i pulled away i said and he smiled take it back he whispered teasing me his fingers touched everything running smoothly over me to make me shiver in the dusky light coming through the slats here there never long anywhere to drive me almost mad oh god ill make him beg for it shivering from anticipation and desire i leaned in marshals scent was everywhere i breathed him in shutting off my thoughts his hands were on my waist and as i grew comfortable with our new closeness i exhaled in a soft sound of pleasure as he found my breasts nuzzling one of them through my shirt then the other bringing me stiff with anticipation until i couldnt take it anymore i wanted to wait to make him ask for it with his body if not his words but instead i exhaled pulling from him every last erg of power in his chi marshal groaned as the exquisite fulfillment of it rolled into me mixed with the wicked feeling of domination and possession he opened his eyes the hot need showing in them set my heart pounding i had taken from him and now he was going to take from me he didnt wait one hand behind my neck he drew me down to kiss him i knew it was coming but i couldnt help my whispered cry as he touched my chi with his awareness and pulled everything from me running it through my body and into his to leave glittering trails of loss and heat to spiral through me like smoke from an extinguished candle i didnt fight him i was able to share this and with our kiss holding i steadied myself to wrestle it back my knees pressed into his thighs demanding it taking it making it mine power pulled fast through him with the crack of a whip and he gasped his arms jumping up to imprison me i breathed him in feeling him inside me everywhere i could taste him in my mind in my soul it was glorious i could hardly stand it take it i whispered wanting to feel him do the same but he grunted no my moan turned into a pant of want and spurred on he gripped me more intensely until he touched my chi again taking all of it in a wash of scintillation to leave only a trail of sparkles in my mind and an aching emptiness it was my turn to steal it back but he took control of everything in a mindnumbing pulse of force he pushed the energy into me i sucked in my air in shocked surprise clutching him oh god dont stop i gasped it was as if i could feel him inside me outside me all around me and then he drew it back again leaving me almost weeping for it marshal i panted marshal please not yet he groaned i gripped his shoulders wanting everything wanting it all wanting it now now i demanded out of my mind with the selfenforced deprivation he had my line energy he had my fulfillment his mouth found mine and i begged not with my words but with my body i writhed for it i pressed into him for it i did everything but take it finding the exquisite ache of unfulfilled need chiming through me driving me to a fevered pitch and then he groaned unable to deny it anymore i moaned in release as the energy from his chi filled mine as we both climaxed a rush of endorphins cascaded through us bringing me to a backarched gasping halt marshals grip on me shook and i trembled as wave after wave smothered me pulling me into a hyperalert state where nothing was real i heard a panting moan then realized embarrassed that it was me slumping into him i felt my senses return marshal was breathing hard his chest rising and falling under me as his hand lay on my back still at last i exhaled feeling the flow of energy between us sift back and forth without hindrance leaving little tingles that faded to nothing as the forces balanced perfectly i lay against him with my head on his shoulder listening to his heartbeat and deciding there were probably not too many more enjoyable ways to mess up your life than this and fully clothed too feeling the icy cold of the afternoon against me i stirred you okay i asked smiling as i felt him nod how about you he asked his voice more of a rumble than a real sound i listened for a moment hearing nothing no pixy wings no roommate stomping around downstairs never better i said feeling more at peace than i had in a long time marshals chest began to bounce and i pushed myself up when i realized he was laughing what i said feeling like i was the butt of the joke marshal i dont know if i remember how he said in a falsetto its been so long relieved i sat up and mockpunched his shoulder shut up i said not minding that he was laughing at me i didnt marshal eased me off his lap and i snuggled up to him both of us slouched with our heads on the back of the couch and our feet intertwined on the floor you sure your aura is okay marshal asked almost too soft to hear he turned to look in my eyes and i smiled yeah that wasyeah marshals arms wrapped around me as i made a move to get up and giggling i fell back into him good he whispered in my ear holding me all the closer i wasnt going to worry about what happened next it truly wasnt worth it nineteen t he sun was arching toward the horizon painting the buildings at cincinnatis waterfront in red and gold as i headed for carew tower for a quick bite and that interview with edden if it had been a normal sunday id be just about ready to head home from the everafter and als and my weekly pushandshove contest and though i was glad to have gotten out of it i was worried about pierce pierce al ivy skimmer kistens killer and mia they all swirled in the back of my head problems demanding to be solved most days the overload would have had me tense and snappish but right now smiling i gazed at the sun reflecting on the buildings and fiddled with the radio as i followed the guy ahead of me over the bridge all in due course i thought wondering if my calm was from marshal or marshals massage therapist eddens meeting was in about half an hour then the is lockup was at six followed by an early dinner with robbie and my mom at tenid heard robbie complaining in the background when id called to say id have to miss lunch and he could just suck dishwater eventually mia would surface and then id nail her ass but until then i could enjoy a snack at carew tower the massage id indulged in earlier had been fantastic and i felt twinges of guilt all afternoon that id been enjoying myself under the excuse that it might help my aura the feeling of relaxation was still with me making it easy to tell marshal that hed been right yada yada yadahe was going to call later it felt good and i wasnt going to think any more about it than that i was feeling dressy in the silklined pants and shiny top i had put on for ms walker i hadnt gotten a chance before to wear the long felt coat my mom had given me last winter and i felt elegant driving over the bridge into cincinnati aiming for carew tower and a business meeting at the top of the city jenks too had dressed up wearing a black top and pants that flowed hiding the insulating layers of fabric under it matalina was improving at making winter wear he could fly in and the pixy was perched comfortably on the rearview mirror fussing with the black fisherman cap shed concocted out of a scrap of felt from the inside lining of my coat his blond hair was peeking out rather charmingly and i wondered why he didnt wear a hat all the time rache he said looking suddenly nervous what i fiddled again with the radio as we came off the bridge cutting in front of a semi to get onto the exit ramp at a fast fortyfive miles an hour there was a guy on my tail in a black firebird and he followed riding my bumper really safe in the snow buddy rache he repeated wings fanning i see him we were both headed for the exit ramp and giving me the onefingered salute the guy accelerated trying to get ahead of me before the lane disappeared rachel just let him in but he ticked me off so i maintained my speed the semi behind us blew his horn as the offramp approached the guy wasnt going to make it and the weenie shoved me into the curb gravel and rock salt hit the undercarriage of my car the wall slid close and i caught my breath hands clenching as the lane narrowed to one i thunked the brakes jerking the wheel at the last moment to slip in behind him the guy roared ahead and ran the yellow light at the end of the exit ramp face flaming i waved to the irate semi driver behind me who had seen the whole thing from a sortofsafe distance jenks was shedding a sickly yellow dust as he stood on the rearview mirror and held the stem as if it were his life i slowed to a halt at the red light and glared at the firebird a block ahead of me stopped at the next light ass you okay rache jenks asked and i turned down the heater fine why cause you dont usually careen into other cars unless youre going more than sixty he said dropping to land on my arm and walk up it to sniff me you on some human medicine did that massage therapist slip you an aspirin or something not as upset as i thought id be i glanced at him and then back to the street no marshal was right i should get a massage more often it was really relaxing jenks made a face and sat down in the crook of my elbow wings fanning to keep his balance the massage had been wonderful and i hadnt realized how tense id been until the stress was gone god i felt good green light rache i pushed the accelerator noticing that the firebird was still at the red light a smile curved over my face i checked my speed the sign and the street i was legal its red jenks said as i barreled down the street to the next light i see it glancing behind me i shifted lanes so mr ass was parked in the lane next to me no one was in front of me and i maintained my speed its red jenks exclaimed as i didnt slow down my fingers gripped the wheel casually and i watched the crossing light start to blink itll be green when i get there rachel jenks shouted and as smooth as white icing i blew past mr firebird two seconds after the light changed going a nice forty miles per hour i made the next light while he raced his engine and tried to catch up making a sedate left on an early yellow i turned to go downtown mr firebird had to stop and i couldnt help my feeling of satisfaction dumb ass holy crap rachel jenks muttered whats gotten into you nothing i said as i turned up the radio i felt really good everything was aok maybe ivy could pick us up at the restaurant jenks muttered and i took my eyes from the road mystified why jenks looked at me like i was crazy never mind i zipped around a bus changing lanes halfway down the block hey how does my aura look i asked slowing as i tapped the nearby university line it flowed in with an uncomfortable pinch but at least i wasnt dizzy from the ebb and flow of energy there was a car ahead of me and i checked both ways before i shifted lanes and took a yellow light plenty of time stop playing with the line and drive jenks exclaimed your auras a lot more even than before and thicker but only because its been compacted down to a bare inch off your skin huh its good though he nodded his tiny features looking irate good enough if no one takes any more you just missed the turn for the parking garage did i i mused seeing a black firebird roaring up a block behind me look theres a space right out front i said eyeing an open spot on the other side of the street yeah but by the time you circle around it will be gone i looked behind me then smiled if i circle around i said then cut a sharp ubangy the road was slick and the car spun just as i thought it would turning to face the opposite direction as it drifted into the spot with a soft jiggle when the wheels met the curb perfect good god rachel jenks shouted what the hell is wrong with you i cant believe you did that who do you think you are lucas black grabbing my bag i turned off the engine and adjusted my scarf i didnt know where the confidence for that had come from but it had felt damn good coming i said sweetly he stared at me then pried his fingers off the rearview mirror sure jenkss wings were cold as he snuggled in between my neck and scarf and after a last look i got out chill air smelling of wet pavement and exhaust hit the bottom of my lungs as i took a deep breath scenting the coming night and calling it good it was freezing out here and feeling confident in my best coat and boots i waved at mr firebird before i headed for carew tower my boots squishing in the melting slush i squinted at the light as i adjusted my sunglasses the bright storefront of an independent charm shop caught my eye and i wondered how early we were jenks i questioned as my steps slowed what time is it three thirty he said muffled from the yarn he was hiding in youre early jenks was better than a watch and my thoughts shifted to the coming meeting with the banshee marshal and i hadnt found anything in my books to supplement my aura after we got ourselves together and actually looked at them but maybe the owner of a spell shop had something to increase digestive and sleep rhythms there was that failed locator amulet i wanted to check on too maybe id just used the wrong kind of carbonic wax you want to stop at a spell shop i asked jenks see if they have any fern seed oh hell yes jenks said so enthusiastically that i felt a twinge of guilt he was so damned independent that it probably never occurred to him to ask us to take him shopping if they dont have fern seed ill get some tansy he added as his wings brushed my neck matalina likes tansy tea it keeps her wings moving well i angled to the small front door the memory of his ailing wife rising in me the man was hurting and there was nothing i could do about it not even hold his hand taking him to a charm shop was the best i could do it wasnt enough not by a long shot almost there i said and when he swore at me for my concern i pulled open the single glass door and entered immediately i relaxed at the tinkling of the bell and the scent of cinnamon coffee the soft buzz of the charmdetection spell was a mild alarm reacting to my badmojo amulet i took my hat off and jenks flew from my scarf to land on a nearby rack and stretch his wings its nice in here he said and i smiled as he ruined his toughguy image by standing on top of dried rose petals and using the word nice i undid my scarf and took off my shades scanning the shelves i liked earthcharm shops and this was one of the better ones right downtown in the middle of cincy id been here a few times and had found the clerk to be helpful and the selection more than adequate with a few surprises and the odd pricey item i didnt have in my garden id rather buy local than use mail order if i was lucky they might have that redandwhite stone crucible worry pinched my brow at the thought of pierce with al but it wasnt as if i could do the spell if he was trapped in the everafter or could i i thought suddenly my fingers running over a stand of planting seeds going still id be willing to bet al hadnt given pierce a body yet in effect preventing him from tapping a line and becoming more dangerous than he already was if he was still a ghost maybe the charm could pull him back from the everafter the same way it did from the hereafter everafter hereafter whats the difference and if i did thatal would come to me a smile overcame me and excitement zinged down to my toes that was how i was going to get al to grant me some respect if i snatched pierce from him al would come to me id be in a position of power whether real or pretend new years eve was tomorrow night all i needed was the recipe to make sure i did it right i didnt even need to tap a freaking line excited i turned to the door i needed that book robbie suddenly wanting to be somewhere else i jiggled on my feet settling back into an anxious bother id see robbie tonight and i wouldnt leave until i had that book and everything that went with it jenks zipped around a display almost running into me he was spilling a bright copper glow and i figured he had found something behind him the woman next to the register looked up from her newspaper tucking her straight purpledyed hair back behind an ear as she eyed jenkss sparkles let me know if you need any help she said and i wondered if her hair was really that enviably straight or if it was a charm thanks i will i said then held out my hand for jenks to land on he was darting back and forth like an excited kid he must have found something he thought would help matalina over here he said zipping off the way he had come smiling at the woman behind the counter i followed jenkss trail of slowly sifting gold sparkles my boots clunked on the dark hardwood as i passed the racks of herbs to find him at a nastylooking weed hanging in the corner beside the gnarly lengths of witch hazel this one he said hovering over the sparsely leafed mangylooking sprig of gray i eyed him then the tansy right next to it was a much nicer sheaf why dont you want this one i asked touching it jenks buzzed harshly its hothouse grown the wild one is more potent gotcha being careful not to break anything off i set it gently into one of the woven baskets stacked at an end cap satisfied jenks finally parked on my shoulder i slowly headed to the front lingering over a pouch of dandelion seed and smiling we had a little time yet i should ask her about the carbonic wax the hushed sound of the clerk on the phone drew my attention she was arguing with someone and jenks buzzed his wings nervously whats going on i asked softly as i pretended to look at a display of rareearth muds holy crap they were expensive but they were certified and everything im not sure he said something doesnt feel right all of a sudden much as i hated to admit it i agreed but the question of what id done wrong with the locator amulet still remained and i headed to the register hi i said brightly ive been having some trouble getting a locator potion to work do you know how fresh the carbonic wax has to be ive got some but its like three years old you dont think a salt dip would ruin it do you she stared at me like a deer caught in the headlights and i added im working a run do you need to see my runners license youre rachel morgan arent you she said no one else has a pixy with them a faint feeling of apprehension slid under my skin at how shed said it but i smiled yup this is jenks jenks buzzed a wary greeting and she said nothing uncomfortable i added you really have a great store i set the tansy on the counter and she backed away looking almost embarrassed iim sorry she stammered will you please leave my eyebrows rose and i went hot excuse me what the hell jenks whispered the young woman eighteen at the most fumbled for the phone holding it like a threat im asking you to leave she said voice firm im calling the is if you dont sparkles dripping jenks got between us what for we didnt do nothing look i said not wanting an incident can we pay for this first i nudged the basket and she took it my blood pressure eased it lasted all of three secondsuntil she set the basket out of my reach behind her im not selling you anything she said eyes darting to tell me she was uncomfortable i have the right to refuse anyone service and you need to leave i stared at her not understanding jenks was at a loss but then my eyes fell on the newspaper with yesterdays story of the riot at the mall there was a new headline black magic at circle mallthree in hospital and suddenly i got it i reeled putting a hand to the counter for balance the university returning my check the hospital refusing to treat me on the witch floor cormel telling me he had to speak on my behalf tom saying hed be around if i wanted to talk they were blaming me for the riot they were publicly blaming me and calling it black magic youre shunning me i exclaimed and the woman went red my eyes flicked to the paper then back to her who why but the why was kind of obvious her chin lifted the embarrassment gone now that id figured it out everyone everyone i yelped everyone she echoed you cant buy anything here you might as well leave i retreated from the counter my arms slack at my side ive been shunned someone must have seen me with al in the garden seen him abduct pierce had it been tom the freaking bastard had he gotten me shunned so hed have a better shot at mia rache jenks said close to my ear but sounding faraway and distant what does she mean leave why do we have to leave shocked i licked my lips and tried to figure it out ive been shunned i said then looked at the tansy it might as well have been on the moon i wasnt going to get it or anything else in the store or the next or the next i felt sick i shook my head in disbelief this isnt right i said to the clerk ive never hurt anyone ive only helped people the only one who gets hurt is me oh my god what am i going to tell marshal if he talks to me again he might be shunned too lose his job my demon mark seemed heavy on my foot and wrist and i tugged my sleeves down redfaced the clerk dropped the tansy in the trash because id touched it get out she said i couldnt seem to find enough air jenks wasnt much better but he at least found his voice look you lunker he said pointing at her and dripping red sparkles that puddled on the counter rachel isnt a black witch the paper is printing trash it was the banshee that started the riot and rachel needs this stuff to help the fib catch her the woman said nothing i put a hand to my stomach oh god i didnt want to spew in here id been shunned it wasnt a death sentence like it had been two hundred years ago but it was a statement that what i was doing was not approved of that no one would help me if i needed it that i was a bad person numb my grip tightened on the counter lets go i whispered turning to the door jenkss wings were a harsh clatter you need this stuff rache i shook my head she wont let us buy it i swallowed no one will what about matalina he said panic icing his voice my air slipped from me and i turned back to the counter please i said jenkss wings making my hair tickle my neck his wife is ill the tansy will help just let us buy this one thing and ill never come back its not for me her head shook no all her fear was gone washed away by the confidence she found when she realized i wasnt going to give her trouble there are places for witches like you she said tartly i suggest you find them she meant the black market it wasnt to be trusted and i wouldnt seek it out damn it i had been shunned no witch would sell to me no witch would trade with me i was alone absolutely alone shunning was a tradition that stretched back before the days of the pilgrims and it was percent effective one witch couldnt grow find or make everything and once shunned it was seldom revoked her chin lifted get out or ill call the is for harassment i stared at her believing shed do it denon would love that slowly i pulled my hand off the counter come on rachel jenks said i probably have some tansy under the snow somewhere if you dont mind getting it for me its wet i said bewildered it might be moldy it will be better than the crap they sell here he shot back flipping the woman off as he flew backward to the door feeling unreal i followed him i wouldnt be able to check anything out of the library either this was so not fair i didnt feel jenks snuggle in between my scarf and my neck i didnt remember opening the door or the cheerful tingling of the bells i didnt remember walking to my car i didnt remember waiting for traffic before i edged into the street suddenly though i was standing at the door to my car with my keys in my hand the bright sun gleaming on the red paint making me squint i blinked going still my motions slow and deliberate i stuck the key in the lock and opened it i stood there a moment with my arm on the fabric roof trying to figure it out the sun was just as bright the wind just as crisp but everything was different inside something was broken trust in my fellow witches maybe the belief that i was a good person even if there was black on my soul i had an appointment in twenty minutes but i had to sit for a while and i didnt know if the coffee shop on the towers first floor would serve me word of a shunning traveled fast slowly i got in and shut the door outside a truck rumbled past where id been moments before i was shunned i wasnt a black witch but i might as well have been twenty it was with a new feeling of vulnerability that i stood before the double glass doors of the carew tower and adjusted my hat in the murky reflection and i jumped when the doorman leaned forward and opened it for me a warm gust of air blew my hair back and he smiled tipping his hat in salute when i came in with small steps and whispered thank you he answered me cheerfully and i forced myself to straighten up so i had been shunned edden wouldnt know neither would ms walker unless i told her if i walked up there looking like prey she would chew me up and spit me out my jaw clenched stupid department of moral and ethical standards has their head up their ass i muttered determined to fight this all the way to the supreme courtbut the reality was no one would care the restaurant at the top of the tower had its own dedicated elevator and i could feel the doormans eyes on me as i clicked and clacked my way to it forcing myself to find a confident posture the elevator too had a doorman of sorts and i told him who i was and gave eddens name as he checked his computer for reservations i hiked my bag up higher on my shoulder and read the restaurants events sign as i waited apparently someone had reserved the entire restaurant for a party tomorrow my flagging confidence took another hit as i remembered pierce i was shunned my exboyfriends killer was roaming free i was doubting my ability to stir something as complex as a locator amulet al was abusing our relationshipi had to start fixing things jenks moved startling me as he wiggled out and sat on my shoulder your pulse just dropped he said warily is your blood sugar low i shook my head smiling thinly at the doorman when he got off the phone and pushed the button to open the elevator ive got a lot to do today i said as i got in the small opulent lift and were late jenks grumbled as he took off his cap and tried to arrange his hair in the reflection of the shiny walls he had flitted to the wide banister circling the inside of the elevator and twin pixies made an impressive display of winged physique i forced myself to straighten as i checked that my complexion charm was in place shun me would you its called arriving fashionably late jenks i murmured as i took my own hat off and tucked a curl behind an ear i hate being late he complained making faces to pop his ears as the pressure shifted its a fivestar restaurant i came back with they wont have a problem waiting the lift chimed and the doors slid open jenks moved to my shoulder with a huff and together we looked out onto the revolving restaurant my posture relaxed in pleasure and i stepped out smiling as my worries seemed to pale below me the river wound a slush gray ribbon through the white hills of cincinnati the hollows lay beyond peaceful in the coming dusk the sun was nearing the horizon painting everything with a redandgold sheen and clouds reflected it all beautiful maam a masculine voice prompted and i brought my gaze inside he looked like the twin of the guy downstairs right down to the black suit and blue eyes if youll follow me id been up here only once before with kisten for breakfast and i silently walked behind the host taking in again the rich fabrics the tiffany lights and the mahogany preturn tables with carved feet rosemary and pink rosebuds were on every table the sight of the booth where kisten and i had shared morning conversation over french toast made a surprisingly soft ache in me more fond remembrance than hurt and i found i could smile glad that i could think of him without heartache the place was empty but for the staff setting up for tonight and after passing a small stage and dance floor i spotted edden at a window table with an attractive older woman she was ceris size dark where the elf was light with very thick black hair falling straight on her back her nose was small and she had thick lips and luscious eyelashes it wasnt a young face but her few wrinkles made her look wise and venerable graceful aged hands moved when she talked and she wore no rings she sat across from edden slim and upright in her stark white fulllength dress not resting against the back of her chair ms walker had the viewas well as the poised presence that said she was in charge jenkss wings brushed my neck and he said she looks like piscary you think shes egyptian i whispered confused jenks snorted how the turn should i know i meant she is in control look at her i nodded disliking the banshee already edden hadnt noticed us fixated on what she was saying he looked good in his suit having worked hard to keep his shape through the latethirties meltdown and into his midfifties actuallyhe seemed captivated by the woman and a warning flag went up anyone as selfpossessed and beautiful as she was was dangerous as if hearing my unspoken thoughts the woman turned her heavy lips closed and she stared evaluating me are you i thought sending my eyebrows high in challenge edden followed her gaze and his demeanor brightened getting to his feet i heard him say here she is and he came to greet me sorry im late i said as he took my elbow to hustle me to the table marshal made me get a massage to help with my aura yes blame it on marshal not me needing to recoup after finding out im shunned really the squat man said does it help how do you feel i knew he was thinking about his son and i set my hand atop his wonderful jenks said my aura looks tons better and i feel great dont let me leave without giving you the womans phone number she makes hospital calls i asked no extra charge for the fib jenks made a scoffing sound she says she feels great he said more like stinking drunk the damned woman nearly smashed her car drifting it into a parking spot hows glenn i asked ignoring jenks as edden helped me out of my coat ready to go home edden gave me a look up and down you look good rachel i never would have guessed that you had to get an ama i beamed as jenks rolled his eyes thanks the waiter holding out his hand for my coat was eyeing jenks edden saw his gaze and moved his chin to make his mustache bunch up can we get a honey pot he asked trying to put jenks at ease i appreciate the offer edden jenks said but im working peanut butter would be good though his gaze went to the table in its whiteandgold perfection and his expression became panicked as if hed asked for grits and pigs feet instead of the source high in protein he needed because of the cold the waiter of course picked right up on his unease peeeeanut butterrrrr he said in a patronizing tone and jenks let a wisp of red dust slip my eyes narrowed as the man implied with those two words that jenks was a bumpkin or worse not even a person you haaave peanut butter dont you i drawled in my best al impression freshly ground absolutely nothing out of a jar will do low salt ill have a raspberry water i had sampled kistens raspberry water after finding my french toast not to my taste it had some fancy glaze on it okay maybe i was a bumpkin but making jenks feel like one was rude the mans face went blank yes maam gesturing for a second waiter to get my water and jenkss peanut butter he helped me with my chair and then a menuwhich i ignored since hed given it to me i had a view too jenks hovered by my place setting as if reluctant to set down on something so fine his flowing black outfit looked great among the china and crystal and after i turned an empty water glass over for him he gratefully sat on the elevated foot edden was to my right the banshee to my left and my back was presently to the door but that would change as the hour advanced and the restaurant turned ms walker this is rachel morgan edden said as he settled back in his chair rachel ms walker has been adamant about meeting you shes the administrative coordinator of banshee internal affairs west of the mississippi edden seemed unusually flustered and another flag went up jenks too didnt seem to like that the usually levelheaded man looked almost twitterpated but she was a banshee beautiful and alluring in her sophistication and exotic beauty shoving my increasing dislike away i extended my hand across the corner of the table its a pleasure ms walker im sure you know we can use all the help we can get mia harbor turning rogue has us in a tight spot jenks smirked and i flushed i was trying to be nice so sue me i hadnt said anything that wasnt true it was obvious i couldnt bring mia in if she resisted the older woman took my hand and i tensed searching for any sensation of her siphoning off my aura or emotions her eyes were a rich brown and with the bone structure of a supermodel and her wrinkled but clear complexion she was classically alluring you can call me cleo she said and i drew my hand away before i shuddered her voice was as exotic as the rest of her a low slurry of warmth insinuating a promise of naughty but nice god the woman was like a vampire maybe that was what was putting me on edge that i had pulled away was not missed by edden or ms walker and a faint knowing smile curved the edges of her mouth up its good to meet you she said shifting to lean forward ill help find little mia but im here for you your reputation is worth investigating my fake smile faded and edden hunched over and guilty started to play with his drinking glass slowly i turned to him calming my anger before the banshee noticed it but she did anyway the cool woman put her elbows charmingly on the table and eyed him almost coyly you lied to get her here edden glanced at me then back down to the river not at all he grumped his neck going red i stressed certain things is all stressed certain things my ass but i smiled at the woman keeping my hands below the table as if shed soiled them with her touch is this because i survived hollys attack i asked in large part yes she said lacing her fingers together and propping her chin on them would you mind if i felt your aura i stiffened no i mean yes i would mind i amended i dont trust you edden winced but ms walker laughed the comfortable sound of it made the waiters just out of earshot look up and my stomach clenched she was too perfect too assured and her eyes were dilating like a vampires is that why you brought your pixy she said the first hint of distaste wrinkling her nose as she grimaced at jenks i wont be sampling your aura ms morgan i simply want to run my fingers through it find out why you survived an attack from a child banshee most dont most dont have a black banshee tear in their pocket i said stiffly and the woman made a small sound of interest thats why she said and it was as if an untilnow hidden tension slipped out of her the emotion went sour as she killed you and finding a sweet source one familiar holly took that instead i finished for her jenkss heels were tapping out a distress signal and i twitched my fingers to acknowledge it he had seen the woman lose her tension too shed been afraid of me and now she wasnt good it would make taking her down easier if it came to that stop it rachel you cant tag a banshee the woman sat upright in her chair and sipped her tea with a thousand years of grace she and ceri would get along famously even so your aura is extremely tight she said as she set it down if i hadnt known you were recovering from an attack id say you were insane that was just rude and when jenks shifted uncomfortably ms walkers eyes went from him to me squinting softly in the bright light your pixy didnt tell you a tight aura is a sign of instability knowing she was goading me i let my anger dissipate before i smiled back hes my business partner not my pixy i said and edden miserably shrank into his chair while we had our polite sophisticated catfight jenks though couldnt help himself and he rose with his hands on his hips why should i tell rachel what a tight aura means shes not insane she had a massage today and it condensed it down lighten upyou hag of a washerwoman jenks i exclaimed but ms walker took it in stride what is up with him ignoring jenks but for a warning twitch of her fingers she focused on me her brown eyes going black i clamped down on my sudden fear this woman could probably kill me as we sat and she would get away with it though edden sat two feet away i dont care what they say you are she said her low voice entirely devoid of anything but scorn we are more powerful than you that you survived was a fluke she stood amid eddens protests but i sat frozen in fear who i am she knew she knew i was a protodemon standing above me ms walker closed her eyes and breathed deep sucking in my fear like a drug jenks rose up in a clattering of wings stop he intoned as he hovered between us and the womans eyes flashed open leave rachels aura alone or i will kill you ms walkers eyes went even blacker and my fear slid deeper and twisted she had ivys eyes full of an unsated hunger she was a predator chained by her own will and she didnt mind letting herself off the leash once in a while but not me she wouldnt have me i wasnt prey i was a hunter while edden winced the woman gathered up her small handbag todays paper was folded up next to it and my gut clenched great she knew id been shunned too as she looked at jenks her disgust poured forth bug she said simply hiding her eyes behind a pair of dark glasses shouldnt you be sleeping in a hole in the ground shouldnt you be extinct like the rest of the dinosaurs he snarled back want some help getting there he added and i cleared my throat even as i bristled at her racial slur ms walker edden was saying having stood up and moved to her side of the table please the fib could really use your help and we would be most grateful ms morgan and her associates opinions aside one of your own is accused of murder the elegant woman stopped two steps from the edge of the revolving ring her eyes hidden ive seen what ive come to see but ill look for little mia tonight its unlikely shes left her city and ill inform you when ive dealt with her dealt with her i didnt like the sound of that by his expression neither did jenks in return any assistance you can give me in streamlining the adoption process will be appreciated she finished turning away and accepting the hand of a nearby waiter to make the step to the unmoving core of the building adoption alarmed i stood up whoa wait up i said caustically and the woman turned back with cheeks flushed in anger adoption you mean holly holly has a mother eddens hands went loose at his sides his posture becoming threatening without his making one overt move ms walker we never discussed you taking the child the woman sighed before she stepped back down to our level moving with crisp precise motions the child cant be held by anyone other than another banshee until she gains control she said with a wave of her hand as if we were simpletons almost five years what are you going to do put her in a bubble you are underestimating the childs control edden said her father holds her interest arched her eyebrows and she took her sunglasses off does he really great now she really wanted holly it was almost impossible to engender a child under the laws of humanity and now ms walker thought holly was special mia wasnt going to live out the week and remus would probably die defending them if we didnt find them first its not holly i said quickly its her dad theres a wish involved edden turned to me with accusation in his expression and i shrugged i found out yesterday i was going to tell you ms walkers eyes squinted in the glare making wrinkles at the corners and jenks smiled wickedly as a flash of worry crossed the banshees face before she hid it away your own son hospitalized captain edden she said as if it might make us want to give the child to her you yourself ms morgan attacked and nearly killed how many lives will you sacrifice before you accept it i can control her you cant in return i will give the child a home temporarily i said and ms walkers smile twitched if mia is cooperative like i believe that would happen ms walker edden said his earlier fluster washed away leaving his usual hardassed self we all want whats best for holly but neither mia nor remus has had due process yet the woman made a huff clearly thinking that due process wasnt going to enter into it if she found mia alone of course she said her voice and posture regaining their earlier grace and selfassurance good afternoon ms morgan captain edden ill send word when i have mia contained giving us an icy smile she turned and walked sedately to the elevator two waiters trailing behind her jenkss wings clattered as he exhaled and flew back to the table red sparkles sifted from him as he stomped from where hed landed to a small dish of peanut butter that had magically appeared while we argued sitting crosslegged on the rim of the plate he reached over and helped himself with the pair of pixysize chopsticks he had somewhere on his person damned banshees he muttered worse than fairies in your outhouse edden put a hand to the small of my back and directed me back to my chair why do i have the feeling we need to find mia before ms walker does he said worriedly someone had set a glass of rosetinted water by my plate and i sat down slouching i took a sip almost getting a lap of water when the ice shifted because banshee babies are rare and precious i said then wondered if theyd laugh at me if i asked for a straw giving holly to that woman would be a mistake banshee or not i dont trust her edden snorted i think the feeling was mutual yeah but according to her i dont matter maybe it was better to not matter to a banshee we have to find mia before that woman does shes going to kill her to get holly edden looked at me sharply thats a strong accusation i reached for the bread basket hoping we still got to eat even if our most important guest had left you can wait until mia is dead or you can believe me now but ask yourself who youd rather have holly grow up with i pointed at him with my pinkie and he frowned you think so tearing a bit of bread from the loaf i ate it thinking it was too dry i know so eddens eyes shifted to the elevator then back to me it would be easier if we had a locator amulet any progress on them i nearly choked and as i scrambled for words jenks chimed up with a cheerful yeah my knee smacked the underside of the table and his wings burst into motion i just have to finish them up i said edden looked from my hot cheeks to the pixy now silently staring at me grunting the man pushed away from the table his thick fingers looking out of place on the white linen ill send a car to pick them up as soon as you have them done he said as he stood i know you dont have the license to sell them but let me know how much it cost you and ill add it to your check were having a devil of a time finding her they keep slipping past us he rocked back looking at the elevator again ill be right back okay i said helping the dry bread down with a sip of raspberry water but my thoughts were elsewhere as the squat man tried to catch up with ms walker jenks snickered settling in and looking more relaxed want me to tell you what he says to her he asked and i shook my head then you want to tell me why you dont want him to find mia he added i brought my gaze back from the elevator excuse me the amulets jenks licked his fingers free of the peanut butter duh marshal invoked them grimacing i started brushing the crumbs i had made into a pile theyre duds i screwed up they dont work jenkss eyes went wide and his heels swung back and forth uh yes they do i didnt look up from brushing the crumbs off in my napkin uh no they dont i mimicked him i tried one at the mall and it was just a hunk of wood but jenks was shaking his head dipping for another clump of peanut butter with his chopsticks i was there when marshal invoked them they smelled okay to me exhaling i leaned back in my chair and shook my napkin out under the table either the tear edden had given me was from another banshee or the amulet i put the potion into was bad it smelled like redwood absolutely the amulets even turned green for a second the elevator dinged and i pulled myself closer to the table maybe the one i invoked was a bad amulet i said softly as edden said goodbye to ms walker and jenks nodded satisfied but a faint sense of unease wouldnt let go as we waited for edden to rejoin us there was a third possibility i didnt even want to think about my blood wasnt entirely witch blood but protodemon it was possible that there were some earth charms i couldnt invoke and if that was true then that was one more mark that said i wasnt a witch but a demon better and better twentyone i pulled my car into one of the open back spots at the correctional facility right under a light and making a best guess as to where the lines were since they hadnt plowed the last few inches of snow the heater was going full blast since ivy had the window cracked for air and turning it and the car lights off i killed the engine and dropped the keys into my bag ready to face skimmer i sighed hands in my lap and not moving as i looked at the low building before us ivy sat rigidly still staring at nothing thank you for doing this she said her eyes black in the dim light i shrugged and opened my car door i want to know who killed kisten too i said not wanting to talk about it i havent been much help but i can do this she got out as i did and the thump of our doors was muffled by the mounds of snow that turned the world black and white under the puddles of security lights in the thickly populated lotemployees probably though i supposed they could be visitors it was a lowsecurity facility sure skimmer had killed someone but it had been a crime of passion that and being a lawyer had gotten her here instead of the highsecurity prison outside cincinnati about a quarter mile back the hospital was hazy with dusk and falling snow seeing the peaceful buildings i had the sudden idea to take my old stuffed animals to the kids theyd know how precious they were and would take good care of them i could pick the toys up tonight when i was looking for that spell book it would be a good excuse for me to get up there too ivy was still standing beside her closed door gazing at the building as if it held her salvation or her damnation she looked sleek and lanky in her working leathers all in black with a biker cap to add some spice feeling my questioning gaze on her she pushed into motion and we met at the front of my convertible together we angled through the parked cars toward the shoveled sidewalk im sorry to make you do this she said hunched from more than the cold skimmershes going to be ugly i choked back my laughter ugly she was going to be positively poisonous you want to talk to her i said stiffly shoving my fear down where i hoped it wouldnt show i had way too much to do tonight to be visiting skimmer if not for the information we might get from her but at least i wouldnt have to restir the locator charms the relief that the problem was likely with my bloodnot my skillswas starting to outweigh the worry of why the problem was with my blood jenks was the only one who knew that the charm i invoked had failed and he thought it was a bum amulet by now the locator charms marshal had invoked were in the hands of six fib guys cruising the city i doubted theyd come within the needed hundred feet to engage the amulet but it had improved my standing with them immeasurably dinner with my mom and robbie later tonight would hopefully give me the book and equipment and i could move forward on stamping out that fire id been concerned that al might show up and snag whoever was with me now that it was again dark but he hadnt done so before finding pierce and it was unlikely he would now i so wanted to be at my moms looking for that book not here talking to an angry vampire but i resolutely walked beside ivy to the lowsecurity inderland correctional facility all the safeguards must be on the inside because the outside looked like a research building its stucco walls and accent lights shining on low snowcovered evergreens it probably made for better neighbor relations but not being able to see the fences gave me the creeps we walked in silence but for our boots on the crushed ice and salt the pavement gave way to gray sidewalk and then the glass double doors with visiting hours and rules about what could be brought into the building my lethalamulet detector was going to be a problem the woman behind the desk looked up from her phone conversation as we entered mild alarms were already going off reacting to my amulets and i smiled to try to defuse the situation redwood and a faint smell of unhappy vampire drifted to me ivy grimaced and i swung my bag around to drop it on the desk while we signed in there was a tv on in the corner set to the weather map and talking to itself more snow tonight rachel morgan and ivy tamwood to visit dorothy claymor i said handing her my id as i noticed the sign asking for it behind her no wonder the blond vampire wanted everyone to call her skimmer we have an appointment ivy handed me the pen and i signed in under her my thoughts went back to the last time id put my name in a register book and i added a solid period after my signature to symbolically end any psychic connection it might have to me crossing it off would be better but i wouldnt be able to get away with that here right through there the woman said as she ran our ids through a scanner and handed them back keep your id out she added gesturing to a pair of thick plastic doors clearly anxious to get back to her phone conversation id rather have gone to the right where the floor was covered in carpet and there were fake potted plants but ivy who clearly knew the drill was already headed for the sterile ugly hallway to the left with its white tile and milkyplastic doors they were magnetically sealed and when i caught up to ivy the woman buzzed us through my jaw clenched when the doors opened and the scent of unhappy vampire and angry were worsened i shuddered as i passed the threshold and the prisons safeguards started to take hold the magnetic door snicked shut behind us and the air pressure shifted we were probably in prison air now swell there could be anything in it up to and including airborne potions at the end of the room was another set of those doors and a guy behind a desk the old woman with him started our way clearly in charge of the standardlooking spell checker before uswhich was probably anything but standard i couldnt help but notice that the woman really stank of redwood and that if the gun on her hip wasnt enough would keep me minding my ps and qs she might look like an old woman but i bet she could give al a run for his money anything to declare the woman asked as she looked over our ids then gave them back no ivys mood was tight as she handed her coat and purse to her ignoring the little claim check and walking unhesitatingly through the spell checker and to the desk at the end of the room more paperwork i thought as i saw her take a clipboard and start filling in a form anything to declare the guard asked me and i brought my attention back god the woman looked a hundred and sixty with nasty black hair that matched the color of her tootight uniform her complexion was a pasty white and i wouldve wondered why she didnt invest in a cheap complexion spell except i didnt think they allowed them anything while on the job just a lethalamulet detector i said handing her my bag and taking the little slip of paper and jamming it in a jeans pocket ill bet she said under her breath and i hesitated eyeing her i didnt like my stuff in her care shed probably go through it as soon as i was out of sight i sighed trying not to get upset if this was the crap you had to go through to see a lowsecurity inmate i didnt want to know what was needed to see someone in the highsecurity prison smiling making herself look almost ugly she nodded to the spell checker and i reluctantly approached it i couldnt see the cameras but i knew they were hereand i didnt like the casual carelessness she used to bag my stuff up and drop it in a bin the wave of synthetic aura cascading over me from the spell checker gave me a start and i jumped maybe it was because i didnt have much of an aura right now but i hadnt been able to stifle my shudder and the guy at the desk smirked ivy was waiting impatiently and i took the form the guy shoved across the desk at me and who are we visiting today he snarkily asked me as he handed ivy her visitors pass my attention jerked up from the release form i was not the one in jail here then i saw where he was looking and went cold my visible scars were less than a year old clear enough and i stiffened when i decided he thought i was a vampire junkie on my way to get a fix dorothy claymor same as her i said as if he didnt know signing the paper with stiff fingers the young mans smirk grew nasty not at the same time you arent ivy took a stance and i set the clipboard down with a tap peeved i looked at him why is this becoming so difficult look i said using one finger to slide the form back to him im just trying to help a friend and this is the only way dorothy will see her okay she likes threesomes eh the guy said and seeing me drumming my fingers on my crossed arm he added in a more businesslike voice we cant let two people visit an inmate at once accidents happen much to my surprise it was the woman who came to my rescue clearing her throat like she was trying to get a cat out of it they can go in miltast officer miltast apparently turned im not losing my job over her the woman grinned and tapped her paperwork we got a call she can go in what in hell is going on concern wound tighter in my gut when the man looked from me to my scrawl and back again face scrunching up he turned to ivy then handed me the visitors badge the tabletop machine spit out ill escort you to the visiting rooms he said as he rose and patted his shirt front for his key card you got this okay he asked the woman and she laughed thank you i muttered as i peeled the backing off my badge and stuck it to my upper shoulder maybe me being an independent runner just got me in but i doubted it my man miltast opened the door and hoisting his belt up waited for us to pass through god he was only thirtysomething but he was swaggering around like he was fifty with a gut again the vampire incense hit me with a hint of unhappy were and decayed redwood it was not a good mix there was anger and desperation and hunger everyone was under mental stress so thick i could almost taste it ivy and i going in together suddenly didnt seem like a good idea the vamp pheromones were probably hitting her hard the door shut behind me and i stifled a shudder ivy was silent and stoic as we paced down the corridor jittery under her facade of confidence her black jeans looked out of place in the white corridor and her dark hair caught the light looking almost silver i wondered what she was hearing that i wasnt we passed through another plexiglas door and the corridor got twice as wide blue lines blocked the floor into sections and i realized that the clear doors we were passing led to cells i couldnt see anyone but it all looked clean and sterile like a hospital and somewhere down here was skimmer the solid doors cut down on the pheromones ivy said noticing me eyeing them oh i missed jenks and i wished he was here watching my back there were cameras in the corners and i bet they werent fake so how come theyve got witches working as guards i said realizing that the only vamp id seen outside a cell so far had been ivy a vampire might be tempted to do something stupid for blood ivy said her gaze distant and not paying me much attention a were can be overpowered so can a witch i said watching our escort take an interest in our conversation ivy looked sideways at me not if they tap a line yeah i protested not liking that i couldnt right now but even the is doesnt send a witch after an undead theres no way i could even come near besting piscary the man walking behind us made a small noise this is an aboveground lowsecurity facility we dont house dead vampires here just witches weres and living vampires and the guards are more experienced than you rachel ivy said her gaze lighting on the cell numbers counting them down probably officer milktoast here probably has clearance to use charms that arent street legal she smiled at him chilling me isnt that right its miltast he said sharply and if you ever get bitten he added looking at my neck you lose your job i wanted to jerk my scarf up but knew that to a hungry vampire dead or alive that was like wearing a negligee that is so unfair i said i get labeled a black witch for getting a smutty aura saving peoples lives but you can use a black charm with impunity at that miltast smiled yep and i get paid for it i didnt like what he was saying but at least he was talking to me maybe he had a smutty aura too and my own greasy coating didnt scare him that he was even talking to me was odd he had to know i was shunned thats probably why theyd let me in with ivy they simply didnt care what happened to me god help me what am i going to tell my mom we passed through another set of doors and my claustrophobic feeling doubled ivy too was starting to show the strain and was beginning to sweat you okay i asked thinking she smelled great evolution youve gotta love it fine she said but her nervous smile said different thank you for doing this wait to thank me until we both get back in the car in one piece okay our escort slowed to check the numbers painted on the outside of the doors and leaning to the side he used a twoway radio to check something satisfied he looked through the glass pointed his finger at someone in warning then ran his card to open the door there was a soft hiss of equalizing pressure and ivy immediately went in i moved to follow ivy and miltast stopped me excuse me i said snottily letting him grip my arm like that because he was the only one armed with magic im watching you he threatened and i started me he was watching me why good i said confirming that he knew id been shunned maybe they let us in together hoping we would all kill each other tell them that im a white witch and to get off my case miltast didnt seem to know what to say and with a final squeeze of pressure he let me go in knees shaking i passed over the threshold the door hissed shut and i swear i heard it seal with a vacuum the better to contain the pheromones i guess the white chamber was a mix of interviewing room and conjugalvisit trailer not that i knew what the latter looked like but i could guess there was a second solid door in the back with a peephole a white couch took up one side wall two chairs and a table between them filled the opposite lots of room to touch lots of room for mistakes to be made i especially didnt like the transparent door we had come through or the camera on the ceiling it smelled like burnt paper and i wondered if it was to help mask the pheromones skimmer sat coyly in a corner white chair her white jumpsuit looked good on her making her seem both small and devilish standing in the middle of the room ivy was her polar opposite skimmer was confident where ivy was unsure the blond vamp was coy where ivy was pleading for understanding skimmer wanted to rip my face off and ivy wanted to save it no one said anything and i realized i could hear the circulation fans skimmer stayed silent knowing from her courtroom past that he who spoke first was probably the neediest thank you for seeing me ivy said and i sighed here we go skimmer shifted to cross her legs the other way her blond hair hung about her face and her complexion was blotchy they didnt allow them much in here i didnt want to see you she said smiling wickedly she stood to show shed lost some weight never heavy the woman was now skinny i wanted to see her she finished i licked my lips and edged away from the closed door hi skimmer my pulse was quickening and i forced my breathing to slow knowing tension was a trigger hi rachel the smaller vampire mocked as she sashayed closer ivy jerked her arm up and i fell back in shock when she blocked skimmers blurring arm lashing out at me thin fingers with long nails swung inches from where my face had been and i pressed against the wall crap i didnt want to walk out of here with a scratch or a bite i was having dinner with my mom and robbie and hed never let me live it down dont ivy said and i forced myself from the wall this was going to be bad skimmers eyes had flashed black and a thread of warning drifted through me tightening my muscles when i realized ivys eyes had dilated to match hers damn ivy let go of skimmers arm and the whiteclad vampire backed up smelling ivys scent on her wrist and smiling double damn so ivy skimmer said shifting her body in its tight jumpsuit to look sultry shes still stringing you along like a pull toy baby ivy jerked when i moved a step closer can you be decent for once my roommate said who visited piscary but wasnt on the official list he got blood from someone other than you skimmer mocked and my pulse jerked again hurts doesnt it she said as she settled herself in her chair making it a throne of power seeing what you want and knowing they dont care a shit about you i took a deep breath unable to let that stand i care dont argue with her ivy said its what she wants skimmer smiled to show her fangs and that combined with her dark eyes caused a shiver to slide through me she wasnt dead yet so she couldnt pull a full vampiric aura but it was close but here you are the small woman almost purred asking what i know how bad do you want it ivy girl dont call me that ivy had gone pale that was piscarys pet name for her and she hated it my scar started to tingle and i clenched my jaw refusing to let the tendrils of feeling slip any deeper in me skimmer must have noticed my panicked expression feels good doesnt it she said coquettishly like a lovers longabsent touch if you knew how it was hitting ivy in this little tiny locked room youd be scared shitless in a surge of pique the vampire rose i took an involuntary step back before i could stop myself this was so not good i think theyd bent the rules and let me in here hoping id get killed thus ending the problem of what to do with rachel morgan ivys stance stiffened you said youd tell me who visited piscary but i didnt promise ivys face became closed lets go she said her tone crisp as she spun to the door wait skimmer said petulantly and ivy halted thered been panic in skimmers voice but instead of making me feel better my tension ratcheted higher this was so not safe skimmer came forward to take the middle of the room and ivy stood almost in front of me with her hands on her hips i cant give you anything skimmer my roommate said you killed piscary that was a mistake he treated you like shit skimmer exclaimed ivy was calm and sedate he was still important to me i loved him you hated him i loved him too ivy shook her head making the tips of her hair shift if youre not going to tell me who visited him off the lists then were done again ivy turned her back on skimmer she took my arm and started me to the door were leaving ivy likes her new toy skimmer said bitterly she doesnt want to play with her old dolls anymore i didnt think we were going to get anything out of skimmer but ivy stopped her head was down as she gathered her thoughts and slowly she spun around to the angry frustrated vampire you were never a toy she whispered pleading for understanding no but you were skimmers confidence flowed back and she stood before us tall and proud once when we first met i turned you back into a person her eyes were black again and my scars both visible and hidden beneath my perfect skin were tingling backing up i found the wall i felt safer a false security skimmer moved forward as i moved back and the woman stopped right before ivy i want you to hurt ivy she breathed i want restitution for what you did to me i didnt do anything to you thats the point love skimmer said hitting kistens accent perfectly ivy took a breath and held it frozen as skimmer started circling her you arent going to have one good thing in your life the smaller vampire said and i knew she was talking about me not one and im going to take her from you know how if you touch her ivy threatened and skimmer laughed no silly ivy girl im better than that youre going to do it for me i didnt get it skimmer had already tried to warn me off ivy and it hadnt worked there wasnt anything she could do but as the slinky woman wound herself more tightly around ivy i wondered what the intelligent vamp was thinking the satisfied noise coming from deep within her set my scars warming in memory her motions sultry and slow skimmer stopped facing me with ivy between us draping her arms around ivys neck ivy didnt move frozen and my gut tightened you want to know who visited piscary skimmer asked her eyes flicking over ivys shoulder to me bite me my face went cold i didnt think she meant it in the negative sense right now the small woman said in front of your new girlfriend show her the blood the savagery the monster you really are i took a breath and held it i knew how ugly ivy could be i didnt want to see it again i told you ivy whispered im not practicing anymore a surge of panic rose through me and i jerked from the wall since when i exclaimed pretty much ignored i want you to practice god ivy its who you are skimmer just smiled showing a slip of fang but its not who she wants to be watching me she played with the hair behind ivys ears until my blood pounded in anger she was toying with ivy and i could do nothing ivy couldnt move couldnt bring herself to pull away skimmer was in complete control i want you to bite me skimmer said or you getnothing ivys hands fisted at her sides trembled why are you doing this to me her eyes fixing on me skimmer wound even more tightly against ivy kissing her neck please she whispered soft and petulant its been ages ivy and youre the best id kill for you i pressed into the wall wanting to escape skimmer put her mouth on an old scar under ivys ear and a rush of remembered ecstasy rose through me at ivys tormented intake of breath dont do this ivy whispered her hands rising to take skimmers elbows but she couldnt push her away it was too much i knew it felt too good and i leaned against the wall unable to look away as the pheromones lit through my own scars and dove to my groin im not making you do anything skimmer said you want to do this how bad do you want to know who killed that bastard kisten how much did you love him was it real or was he just another one of your toys i clenched my jaw harder my neck was flaming sending tendrils of promised ecstasy down my long muscles making them tremble thats not fair i managed stop it skimmer moved to ivys earlobe life seldom is she said and i watched fixated as she bit down gently on ivys lobe her white teeth on ivys skin push me away skimmer whispered into her ear you cant do it youre a monster my sweet and only i will love you little bo peep will lose her sheep if the sheep can see inside her youll be all alone ivy and im the only one who loves you i exhaled but the vampire scent i pulled in after it only made things worse my eyes closed and i held myself almost rocking with the pain of not wanting to be here too late i saw skimmers plan she was going to drive ivy into biting her thinking if i saw ivy rip open skimmers throat in a release of blood lust that id abandon her or if it turned into sex the same result this was ugly it wasnt love it was manipulation using ivys instincts against her will and ivy couldnt stop it the soft sounds of skimmer coaxing ivy made my stomach clench as private moments from their past were laid out before me my focus went blurry as i tried to divorce myself from it but the combination of my fear and the vampire pheromones ripped through the barriers my mind had made and with the suddenness of a slap a memory of kisten surfaced i gasped holding my breath as i felt my face go blank slowly i slid down the wall until i found a corner it was a memory not of kisten but of his killer one so close to what skimmer was doing to ivy that it had triggered a memory of my own struggle oh god i thought as i clenched my eyes trying to keep the memory from growing on itself but i couldntstop it and as i sat my knees to my chin i remembered kistens killer tried to bloodrape me exactly like skimmer is trying to do to ivy breath held i put a hand to my neck as the memory of him playing on my scar slithered into my conscious mind i remembered him holding me against the wall bespelling me i remembered the waves of passion he sent through me with only the lightest of touches passion mixed with loathing disgust and desire his fingers had been rough and aggressive and i had been confused the sound of ivys ragged panting as she struggled to say no ignited a memory of me doing the same they were so familiar so godawful familiar no ivy whispered and i felt my own lips form the word i had said no too and then i had begged him to bite me hating myself as i writhed for it i could almost feel the boat rocking as i recalled standing with my back to the wall my hands clenched upon him as they were clenched about my knees right now tears started i had begged for it just as ivy was about to and kisten i remembered hadnt let me in my thoughts i had a vision of kisten confused and not himself knocking us apart so i could regain my will he had done it knowing the other vampire would end his life a second time but he had loved me so deeply that just the shadow memory of it had broken past his first death and he had made the sacrifice anger burned through my misery driving the skimmerandivyinduced pulsepounding ecstasy deep where i could see beyond it head up i wiped the tears away wishing i could do the same for my fragmented memory but it was there now and id never forget i focused on skimmer and ivy heart breaking at what ivy had to suffer simply because of who she was her vulnerabilities tied closely to her strengths kisten had saved me i could do no less for ivy ivy was trembling her lips parted and her eyes closed as she forgot how to say no tasting the sweetness she couldnt refuse victory was in skimmers face as she nuzzled ivys neck and her eyes were black with the power she had over ivy taking herself higher by dragging ivy down to her swill my teeth clenched and the remembered scent of damp cement spilled through my memory i staggered to my feet and it was as if i could taste cold dry iron on my tongue i strode forward making my hands into fists as the memory of running my hands through kistens killers short black hair filled me skimmer gasped and arched into ivy encouraging her blind to me coming at her it was almost too late ivys fangs were wet glistening and a flash of remembered heat sparked through me at the memory of them sliding cleanly into me mixing pleasure and pain in an unreal surge of adrenaline and endorphins shaking i took a breath im sorry ivy i whispered then punched her in the gut ivys breath whooshed out hands on her middle she stumbled struggling to breathe you bitch skimmer screamed too shocked to move as the expected rush of a bite had been ripped from her if i had hit her she would have instinctively reacted and id probably be dead even dying kisten had taught me one more lesson he had gone after his murderer and it had cost him his undead existence he had died for me he had died for me ivy took in an ugly gasp of breath i spared her a glance then fell into a defensive stance between them leave ivy alone skimmer screamed in frustration her eyes black and her hands cramped into claws but i had knocked her on her butt once before and she knew i could take her ivy i called risking a glance back to see that she was still lost in the throes of blood lust even as she struggled for air crap on toast i hadnt expected to have to handle both of them at once ivy i shouted angling to get her out from behind me yet keeping an eye on skimmer too look at me look at me who do you want to be tomorrow her hands still on her middle ivy peered at me from around the curtain of her hair she got one clean breath then another to my right skimmer started shaking in frustration ivy looked at her her face horrified who do you want to be tomorrow i asked again seeing her awareness return you havent lost anything ivy its okay you didnt lose youre still the same she blinked and a rim of brown showed about her pupils oh my god ivy whispered then straightened you sorry littlevampire she shouted how could you do that to me ivy took three steps and i got between them behind me skimmer was pressed into a corner in fear ivy dont i demanded her eyes were still black the fear heavy that shed almost lost herself to be ruled by her instincts and a shiver lifted through me let it go i said and her jaw unclenched my breath slipped from me in relief and i inhaled she smelled delicious when she was pissed skimmer saw ivy regain her will and knowing that id given it to her something in her broke shes mine the vampire shouted and she leapt fangs bared and snarling i ducked and i heard a soft ooff skimmer fell to the floor beside me in a crumpled heap i looked up at ivy from my crouch pain and betrayal had replaced her hunger and deeper than that gratitude you cant have her skimmer was crying pushing into a folded ball of misery shes mine shes mine ill kill you ill kill you just like i killed piscary ivy extended a shaking hand to help me rise are you okay i looked up at her standing between me and a jealous death her eyes were mostly brown the pain at what was happening mirrored in her gaze familiar i turned to skimmer sobbing and scared taking a shallow breath i put my hand into ivys and let her help me up yes i whispered as i stumbled until i found my balance i didnt feel so good ivy wouldnt look at skimmer i think we should go she moved to the door and i glanced at skimmer we didnt get what we came for i dont care ivy tapped on the door and when that brought miltast though the screams hadnt skimmer rallied bitch she shouted lunging at me again ivy was ready and skimmer ran right into ivys stiffarmed palm my pulse hammered at how fast it had been gasping skimmer fell back her hands covered her face but blood leaked from her nose crying now in earnest the small vampire collapsed onto the couch her back was to us and as i almost ran through the open door ivy hesitated i watched from the hall as she put a loving hand on skimmers shoulder im sorry i heard her whisper i loved you but i cant do this anymore skimmer hunched deeper ill kill her she sobbed if you stay with her ill kill her a chill ran through me not at her words but at the love in ivys arms as she curved them around skimmer no you wont rachel isnt the one who showed me i deserved to be loved you did tell me who came to visit piscary get out skimmer sobbed pushing weakly at ivy blood stained her white jumpsuit and miltast stiffened upon seeing it who visited piscary off the lists ivy insisted skimmers shaking stopped as she gave up no one but kisten came she said her high voice bland once a week three days after you no one else i exhaled and a sorryassed depression took hold nothing we had gotten nothing i loved you ivy skimmer whispered in a dead voice get out dont come back ivy stood her head bowed steadying herself she turned and strode to the door passing me in a wash of sour unhappyvampire incense boots clacking on the hard floor she continued down the hallway alone i jumped to follow i heard miltast lock the door and then his booted steps i caught up to ivy at the locked door where we waited for miltast are you all right i questioned not knowing what she was feeling shell be okay ivy said jaw tight and not looking at me miltast fumbled for the door lock swiping his card and falling back when ivy pushed through it ahead of him i cant believe you didnt get bitten he said in apparent awe my eyes narrowed and i decided that theyd let me in there expecting me to come out hurt or dead he was a white witch who had the governments blessing to do black magic and if i made one wrong move hed react disgusted i turned on my heel and followed ivy i could hear his steps slow behind me and my skin prickled i finally caught up with her at the first door the old woman at the spell checker standing up and getting the checkout forms ready seemed surprised to see us ivy i said as we waited for miltast to catch up her head down and silent im sorry finally her stoic expression cracked and she looked at me unshed tears glinting i didnt know she was going to do that she said thank you for hitting me icouldnt say no damn it i couldnt i thought she cut her thought short when miltast slid the glass door aside the air wasnt much fresher but i pulled it in deep as i crossed into the middle ground trying to rid myself of the accumulated vampire pheromones sighing i put a hand to my neck and let it drop youre not serious about going on a blood fast i asked as i handed miltast my badge ivys fingers shook as she peeled off her name tag and handed it to the officer i was thinking about it she said evenly even miltast knew it was a bad idea and he eyed me as we signed our forms again and headed to the final door if she was on a blood fast living with her was going to be a lot harder what a waste of time ivy said softly as we passed back through the spell checker and the woman gave us our stuff but it hadnt been and my pulse quickened i remembered i had remembered a lot ignoring my shaky knees i wound my scarf around my neck and with my bag under my arm i headed for the double glass doors and the brutal but honest chill of the night milktoast and his friend had been privy to too much of our drama already actually i said as i wrangled my gloves on while ivy held the door open for me it wasnt a waste seeing you and skimmeri remembered something ivy stopped dead in her tracks pulling me to a halt in a puddle of light just outside it seemed to have gotten colder in the hour wed been inside and the night air cut into my lungs like a knife making my thoughts crystal clear after the heated confusion behind the glass walls i pulled the dry air smelling of snow and exhaust in deep relishing it and seeing the past moments with a clearer eye kisten i said warming then flushed god this was hard and i closed my eyes to keep them from filling maybe i could say it if i couldnt see her kistens killer had dry hands i said rough he smelled like damp cement and his fingertips tasted of cold iron i knew this because id had them in my mouth god help me i had begged him to bite me my jaw clenched and i forced it to relax as i opened my eyes kisten was dead i said as the snow started to show on ivys blackclad shoulder i think it was an accident his killer hadnt touched his blood yet and he was really mad about that so he was going to make me his shadow instead hehe was making me beg for it i took a shaky breath if i didnt tell her now i might not ever he was playing on my scar to make me beg him to bite me kisten stopped him he knew it might end with him dead twice but he did it anyway ivys head dropped and she rubbed her forehead im sorry i said not knowing why he let himself be killed again because he loved me the light glistened on ivys tearwet eyes when she looked up but he couldnt remember why he loved you could he i shook my head when a remembered feeling of mental pain drifted up no he couldnt ivy silently took that in deep in her shadowed eyes i could see her wish that i might find a way to save her from that fate i dont want to live not remembering why i love she finally said her face pallid as she looked ahead to her own soul death im sorry ivy i whispered as i fell into step beside her while we headed for my vehicle its what we are she said stoically but it wasnt who she wanted to be twentytwo ivys head was down as we walked into the parking lot aiming for my red convertible under a distant security light snow had covered all but the warm cars and the world was white and black im sorry she said not looking at me i could have gotten you killed in there i breathed in another lungful of cold air to try to clear my head im fine you didnt i could have she slowed to let me go first between two cars looking at me with her face deceptively placid your aura was compromised and you cant make a circle im sorry asking you to do that when youre not well was a mistake they were expecting you to die in there or worse linking my arm in hers i pulled her after me angling for the shortest path to my car i could see it its bright red paint looking gray in the streetlight and the snow sticking only to the cooler roof i guess we fooled them huh ivy stiffened but i wouldnt let her pull out of my grip in the narrow passage if i didnt touch her she wouldnt believe that she was worth the emotional baggage she brought to both our lives im fine i said becoming serious i wanted to know who killed kisten too now we know more not exactly how i would have chosen it but okay dont worry about it ivy predictably pulled out of my grip the moment we came out from between the two cars glancing over her shoulder through the snow to the quiet building im not going to be that person anymore she said and my eyes widened when she wiped her eyes with the back of a gloved hand to show a glint of moisture in the security light i cant do this she whispered clearly shaken to her core rachel im sorry i understand that i cant bite you again im sorry i ever tried youre better than that and im bringing you down you are the strongest person i know i protested but she shook her head wiping her eyes again she was down to the bare bones of herself skimmer had shaken her to her core anyone i once called a friend wouldnt have been able to do what you did in there she said chin trembling or if they did break us apart it would have been to take skimmers place i dont want to be that person and i wont be im off blood completely my eyes widened and i felt a slip of fear sensing it ivys jaw clenched and she strode away wait ivy thats not necessarily a good idea i called after her piscary is dead i can be who i want she said over her shoulder but youre a vampire i protested as i followed worried its what you are she stopped turning to stare at me and i came to a halt a car between us look im not saying i want you to bite me i said gesturing but ive lived with you while youre on a blood fast and the more you try to be what you arent the more confused you get and the harder it is to live with you ivys mouth opened betrayal shone in her eyes abstinence is all ive got rachel turning she paced to the car a shadow of black among the gray and white of falling snow nice one rache i muttered thinking there had to be a better way to have said that hands jammed into my pockets i slowly pushed myself into motion the ride home ought to be swell there was only so much a little green cardboard tree could do ivy on a blood fast was not fun but she was right to be pissed at me how could i not support her desire to be who she wanted to be i did support her but going on a blood fast wasnt the answer she needed to break the cycle she had to end the addiction completely there had to be something in als books for this or maybe trent my bag smacked the taillight of the car i was passing and i followed ivys footprints into the frozen slush of the aisle the sliding sound of a vans door opening brought my head up ten feet from my car a man lurched out of a white minivan beside ivy she wasnt paying attention her head down and looking vulnerable shit ivy i exclaimed terrified by the glint of a pistol in his hand but it was too late the man shoved her and she was pushed into the side of a nearby suv parked half a car away hey i shouted but then i spun at the soft sound of snow compacting beside me my instinctive crouch put me eye to eye with mia witch she said lips blue with cold and then she reached out adrenaline pounded and i flung myself backward my right foot slipping out from under me when i hit the bumper of the car id just passed i went down arms flailing and purse falling from me the banshee grabbed my wrist where my glove and coat parted and i froze kneeling before her her baby had almost killed me shit shit shit mias hood had fallen back and her eyes were wisps of blue under the spotlights cold fingers encircling my wrist she leaned closer who did you talk to today she asked her voice precise and angry heart pounding i looked past her ivy had her face against the window of the suv her arm twisted and a gun to her head there was a baby car seat in the open van and the happy babble of a baby drifted out why in hell hadnt i brought my splat gun youre wanted for questioning i said thinking one swift kick and shed be off me if you come in it will look good the words sounded stupid the moment they left my mouth and mia squinted making the skin around her eyes tighten you think i care she said imperially who did you talk to i tensed to smack her and mias eyes almost white in the dim light dilated to pupil black my breath hissed in and i almost collapsed a scintillating flood tingled through me rising up my arm cold followed close behind it and the feeling of being pulled inside out turned my stomach like a puppet with cut strings i sagged my arm stretched out with my wrist in mias grip sstop i stammered head bowed as i struggled to just breathe damn it what was i doing i never should have taken this case she was a freaking predator a topoftheline ancient predator like an alligator as i knelt there going cold and thick i could feel myself dying in stages watching and unable to stop it i gasped as the pulling sensation quit warmth eased back but it was less settling like a sloshing tub over my soul haggard i brought my head up to find mias blue eyes waiting they were cold and uncaring reptile eyes behind her ivy watched her cheek was against the tall vehicle and her jaw was clenched making her look helpless frustrated and really mad we were in front of a freaking jailthe woman had enough guts to rule the world maybe she thought she already did someone is following me mia asked coldly who did you talk to my knee had gone wet and my arm hurt an ache was spreading from it to my back mia withdrew a step drawing me into the slushrutted aisle and i rose to my feet like a pull toy her other hand went around my throat her wedding band catching the light wait i blurted in panic when the first threat of my aura leaving lifted through me again seeing my understanding mia smiled she was beautiful in the falling snow smaller than me but coldso cold and uncaring thats me taking your life witch she said snow melting on her upturned face the more you struggle the stronger i am who did you talk to someone is following me tell me or you die right here a cold sweat broke out on me the woman was like a slipknot i was a rabbit in a raptors talons rachel just tell her ivy shouted then grunted when remus encouraged her to keep her mouth shut dont hurt her i called out eyes fixed on ivy helpless against the suv my fear grew worse when i remembered what remus had done to glenn son of a bitch why shouldnt i tell mia i licked my lips and mia tightened her grip a soft ache pulled through me and i said a banshee named ms walker it was another banshee from the west mias eyes widened and her grip almost fell away in my city thatthing is in my city she said her high voice carrying a shocking amount of hatred her eyes had gone vampire blackclear in the lights from the parking lotand i wondered if the two species were related i think shes going to kill you for holly i said wondering if a quick palm thrust to her chin while she was distracted might break me free but i was too scared to try she didnt have to touch me to take my aura you and remus both your only chance to keep her is to come in now the fib will take her temporarily but youll get her back let me go please let me go her focus returned to me hatred making her look like a wronged queen you brought the walker here the slight woman accused and i felt myself go weak sparkles showing at the edges of my sight youre working with her i didnt bring her here i cried and i heard ivy grunt in pain you did i panted damn it how do i get into these situations and dont they monitor their parking lot she heard i survived a banshee attack and thought it was because holly had gained control i told ms walker it wasnt holly but the dark banshee tear in my pocket but she still wants holly mia i can help you if you let me go though only god knows why im doing this survival mias breath steamed as she gauged my words in a quick burst of motion she let go of my throat and took two steps away i gasped and fell back against the trunk weight supported on an elbow i held a hand to my throat and looked at the small woman trying to decide how much aura i had left it didnt feel like a lot but i was able to stand up and move without becoming dizzy she didnt need to touch me to kill me but at least i had some room now behind her remus took the gun from ivys head and backed up out of her reach his weapon was still pointed at her though i watched ivy visually measure the distance between them and knowing the gun would beat her she fell into a tense pose behind remus holly gurgled excited by the emotions reaching her mia stood in the falling snow disgust clear in her expression i would have stayed to make sure you were dead if id known the walker would find out about holly we all make mistakes i said knees weak you mean ms walker the walker she corrected me i could almost hear the capital letters and mias disgust grew shes an assassin who kills with the grace of a falling log if shes east of the mississippi in my city your assessment that she wants holly is correct her delicate jaw clenched she wont have her holly is special shes going to give us back our power and im not going to let that bitch take the credit the whining complaint of a tired chevy trying to start in the snow broke the stillness at the far end of the lot a pair of headlights lit up and a big engine roared to life suddenly nervous remus called out mia i shook my head trembling the cold was eddying about my feet telling me mia was still sucking in my aura but at least she wasnt actively taking it im sorry mia i whispered as holly started fussing in the open van we know its remus whos special not holly we know its a wish that lets him hold her ms walker doesnt care she wants your daughter and shes going to kill you to get her ivy shifted from foot to foot probably blaming herself no one moved as the car drove past two aisles over headed for the exit an idle thought drifted through me why hadnt i seen anyone come out of the building remus too wasnt liking it mia he prompted the security light showing his worried features mia watched the cars taillights as they hesitated at the street then slowly drove away the banshee brought her attention back to me her expression shifting to show an inner excitement holly is special she insisted and youre going to make sure i keep my daughter rachel morgan why would i help you i said dryly youre a freaking parasite predator not parasite and you need me she said reaching out no i cried out backpedaling until i found the car behind me again panic grew at the soft pop of a gun muffled in the snow ivy i shouted then jerked when mia found my throat again what have you done i whispered seeing her inches away dont move she demanded eyes wild or remus will kill her shes alive i squirmed and my energy left me i didnt care ivy i panted i cant see her let me see her you cold bitch mias face grew ugly but from behind her i heard ivy say im okay followed by a soft ow and then an aggressive hurt her and youll find yourself worse than dead human mias cold fingers never leaving my throat she sent her gaze to the van where holly was now crying my heart pounded when her attention returned to me hand still around my neck she reached out her palm coming for my forehead dont i pleaded thinking she was going to kill me please dont smiling wickedly mia put her cold hand to my cheek in an almost loving gesture this is why youre going to help me witch this is what i can give you tiny pinpricks exploded in my cheek and i gasped stiffening as i reached for the car behind me warmth was spilling into me familiar and soothing it was my aura returning filling the cracks and making me whole it spilled in with the pain of a healing scab and my eyes flashed wide as i looked into mias clear blue ones i exhaled thinking it sounded like a sob and i held my next breath so i could taste the incoming energy better she was giving it back the energy wasnt coming from a ley lineit was coming right from her soul she was giving me back my lifes energy why the tingles quit with a surprising suddenness and i realized that i was pressed up against a car in a cold parking lot a small woman holding me hostage with the power of my soul mia made a fist of her hand and backed up hunched over and looking tired thats what holly taught me she said proudly because her father cannot be harmed by a banshee holly was born knowing how to push energy into a person not just take it i learned by example so i said still not understanding god it felt good and i suddenly realized i could tap a line relief spilled into me as i did taking in a huge amount of ley line force spindling it in my head at the end of the lot a car pulled in its lights dim in the falling snow moving slowly it crept down the aisles looking for a space mia remus called clearly nervous be still the woman said im impressing upon the witch the reason shes going to convince the fib to back off she wore a smile when she turned back to me but it was the smile of someone who thinks they control you and my mood hardened ive fed extremely well these last few months mia said with an unremorseful satisfaction humans are stupid trusting animals and if you give a little they think you love them and then its a simple matter of taking what they give you natural causes she said coyly heart attack brain aneurysm simple fatigue we have fasted for forty years since the turn but holly will give us back our strength the cunning to take what we want with impunity instead of this thin tracing the law allows us those who protest will be silenced the is knows it im charging you to impress upon the fib the error of their thinking behind her ivy shook with anger remuss hold tight on her you monster she seethed youre making them think you love them then killing them thats not why i gave you the wish shut up remus said and ivy grunted in pain my face paled and the cold night seemed darker thats how she had been feeding herself and her child damn it how were we supposed to tell the bansheeinduced deaths from the natural ones you think im going to help you i said appalled are you nuts the car drove slowly past following the path of the one that had just left tracks upon tracks and my skin started to tingle it was going too slowly and it looked no sounded familiar early model dripping rust it turned at the end of the lot and the lights shown on ivy and remus in the van holly cried her hands reaching up for someone mia remus shouted we have to go help me is exactly what youre going to do mia said and a second wave of warmth filled me as she moved closer tell the fib im gone tell them aliens came down and abducted me i dont care but if they dont leave me alone ill kill you right here if need be then start on that mans son and move on from there touch glenn and youll find yourself dead ivy snarled and mia eyed her in disgust dont presume to threaten me she said condescendingly i watched your piscary set foot in my city and i watched him buried in it keep that in mind i shook my head i wont help you mia if you dont come in you and your daughter will be forever living outside society and on the run mias pale eyebrows rose witch i made this society if they touch me i wont live outside it ill bring it down i felt the strength of the line in me and it made me bold then you can go to hell a sigh lifted through mia she turned to remus who was fidgeting wanting to leave you can lead a pig to water she said then turned back to me ill ask the vampire to pass on my words then my breath caught as i realized she was going to kill me wait panicked i scrambled back among the cars but she followed still not touching me she reached out a hand and eyes glistening in rapture she ripped my aura away everything she had given me she took back mouth open i fell to my knees as the ley line in me became a ribbon of fire and screaming i shoved it at her unable to hold it anymore mia swore delicately and i had a moment of respite but then cold avalanched in behind it and my arms and legs went numb the force of the line hadnt slowed her at all she was taking my aura slowly painstakingly making me suffer so there would be more to feast on ivy was shouting a savage sound against hollys piercing cries behind it was the roar of a car i couldnt think kneeling on the snow as mia stripped me bare i looked up as a brilliant white light grew im dying i thought and the light shifted and the car that was making it smashed into the front corner of the van metal groaned and plastic shattered mias attention was diverted and the pain of my aura being ripped from me vanished i looked up on my hands and knees sucking in air as if it might coat my soul look out i called in warning as the van slid on the ice toward ivy crap it was going to pin her between it and the suv ivy jumped straight up landing on the hood of the suv remus dropped to roll under it holly howled as the van jolted to a halt in the aisle an ugly green rusty chevy steamed radiator fluid poured out but the engine still ran the thing probably weighed more than the van and the suv put together and would take an atomic bomb to kill holly mia screamed running to her daughter pulling myself up to lean against the car i stared as tom emerged from the chevy son of a bitch it hadnt been ms walker mia had felt following her it had been tom with an ugly snarl ivy launched herself from the top of the suv landing on mia god no i whispered i was shaky hardly able to walk and i staggered forward mia had a grip on ivys throat her face savage as she started to kill her the light from one headlamp threw everything into a stark light ivy was fighting back teeth shining as she struggled the harsh sound of holly screaming continued and my eyes jerked to remus and tom the ley line witchs fist was smothered in a purple haze but the incensed man had grabbed it and squeezed until tom screamed in pain giving him a solid kick in parting remus left tom kneeling over his broken hand i moved and remuss head swung up to me black eyes fixed me where i was warning me to not move they were the eyes of a wolf and i froze he turned away from the jail a loud claxon started hooting and the lot was suddenly bathed in a harsh glow of blue krypton bulbs where in hell have they been calm and soothing the mass murderer coolly got his screaming child from the ruined van singing a lullaby he looked to his wife ivy i breathed seeing her down and unmoving mia was kneeling beside her with her back to me her blue coat spread looking like the wings of a bird covering her prey staggering i started for them yelling get away from her remus got there first and with one hand he yanked mia up let me go the woman yelled fighting him but he dragged her to toms running car opening the passengerside door and nearly throwing her in hollys crying competed with the jails alarm system but her cries became faint when remus handed her to mia and slammed the door giving me a sour look he paced to the other side and got in the engine roared tom rolled out of the way as remus gunned it headed for the road frozen slush pelted us and they were gone feeling as if my heart was going to explode i got to ivy and fell to kneel in the pressed snow oh my god ivy ivy i exclaimed turning her over and pulling her upright against me her head lolled and her eyes were shut her skin was pale and her hair was in her face dont you leave me ivy i cant live with you being dead i shouted ivy you hear me oh god please no why do i have to live like this tears were falling from me and i choked back a sob when her eyes opened they were brown and i rejoiced she wasnt dead or undead or whatever white and pale she looked up at me eyes glassy and not seeing in her grip was a faded purple ribbon with a coin laced on it her fingers gripped it as if it was life itself holding on with a whiteknuckled strength i got it back she rasped victory in her vacant gaze she doesnt deserve love the building behind us was still making that awful noise and i could hear men coming this way ivy took a breath then another i needrachel she whispered and then her focus on me cleared shit she breathed and i held her closer rocking her and knowing she was still alive she hadnt died and i wasnt holding an undead youre going to be all right i said not knowing if it was the truth she looked so pale im not i have to have it ivy said and i looked at her seeing the tears making tracks down her face and her fangs wet with saliva it was obvious what she was talking about blood she needed blood vampires were the banshees closest relative and they had a way to replenish auras they took them in when they fed ivy needed blood unafraid i pulled her farther up off the pavement and she started to cry in earnest knowing she couldnt be the person she wanted and mourning the loss of a dream i wanted to be clean but i cant she said as i rocked her every time i try to be someone else i fail i need it she said eyes glowing black but not you not you she begged even as her eyes started to dilate and her hunger took hold id rather die than have you give me your blood i love you rachel dont give me your blood promise meyou wont give me your blood youre going to be all right i said frantic i could smell antifreeze from the busted chevy and the faint smell of hot engine was fading promise me she said trying to touch my face i dont want you to give me your blood promise me damn it shit i looked up only now seeing the flashlights and the men behind them my bag with my keys was across the aisle i promise there was a crunching of boots on ice and from behind me came an authoritative maam get away from the woman lie down and put your face on the pavement keep your fingers spread and where i can see them face wet with tears i looked up and behind me into the bright security lights seeing a big shadow behind it go ahead and shoot me i screamed im not letting go of her maam the voice said and the light dropped to ivy then back to me shes been hurt i exclaimed i was just in your offices you idiots check your security tapes you know who i am you watched the entire thing you think i ran that jackshit car into myself maam he tried again i started to get up dragging ivy with me if you call me that one more time i huffed straining until i got her upright leaning against the suv down get down someone shouted a boom shifted the air and i jerked ivy closer managing to keep both of us on our feet the man with the light turned it toward the sound of the explosion men and women were shouting and the guy with the light looked ticked off that he wasnt involved a purplish green haze of toms aura covered a nearby decorated tree and my stomach turned as the tree started to steam and dissolve the holiday lights flickered and went out holy crap what had al taught him my keys were in my bag three cars away stay here i told ivy and after seeing her leaning upright under her own power i started for my keys thats tom bansen i said as i walked between the man and the sight of the melting tree he did this you want answers go talk to him im in a city parking lot you have no jurisdiction and im leaving i scooped up my bag and got out my keys the lethalamulet detector was a bright shiny red no kidding you want my id i said as i headed back to ivy its in your file have a freaking nice day and a happy new year shifting my shoulder under ivys arm we started for my car her feet dragged through the puddle of antifreeze and she was starting to pant leaving her leaning against the hood of my car i opened it she mumbled for her purse and after helping her inside i went back for it i looked up at the click of a safety going off but they couldnt shoot me if i was just walking away maam the man tried again and my blood pressure spiked but a second voice intruded let her go shes been shunned a bitter sensation filled me but no one stopped me hold on ivy i whispered as i got in my car and reached across to shut her door the hospital is right next door rynn cormel she said eyes closed as tears coursed down her face take me to rynn i dont care about him hes just a vampire just a vampire i hesitated then fumbled with the key twice before i got it in the ignition and the car came to life around us the security people were having fits apparently tom had gotten away and they didnt have the authority to detain me rynn ivy said staring at me her head propped up against the door her eyes were glassy and hunger sent a shiver through me it was starting to take hold if not for her weakened state shed be having a much harder time okay i said sniffing back my tears i knew how she felt she didnt want to be this person but to survive she had to be i wont let him hurt you please hurry she said shutting her eyes as they turned a full hungry vampire black her long pianists hand clenched on the door handle and she pressed herself as far away from me as she could lights on i pulled out and headed for the exit the speedometer crept upward and i waited for a dizzy feeling but it never came apparently mia hadnt taken enough from me to affect my balance but a quick tap on a ley line told me i was still compromised and i dropped it before i threw up from the pain call him ivys voice sent a chill through me it was low and sultry in wide contrast to her weakened state use my phone i was starting to see some traffic and at a red light i pulled her purse to me finding her slim phone and opening it up five bars how come my phone never has five bars eyeing the bright screen and the traffic light both i scrolled through the numbers then hit rc my heart pounded and as the phone rang the light changed and i pulled out into a snowrimmed street i didnt get more than fifteen feet before the line clicked open and a cultured interested voice said yes ivy shit i jiggled the phone closer gunning the engine to make the next yellow light ivys been hurt i said tersely she needs blood rynn cormel made an odd sound then give it to her rachel son of a bastard she doesnt want my blood i said looking at her and seeing her in pain she wants you im bringing her to you but i dont know if she can make it i wiped my eyes when the streetlights went blurry that damn banshee got her youre going to keep her alive or so help me im going to kill you rynn mathew cormel dont mess with me on this i mean it i cant save her soul yet i need more time i didnt care if i sounded like a demon using all three of his names like that managing the icy roads i heard the undead vampire take a slow breath he didnt need take the i bridge well find you the phone clicked off and i tossed it in the direction of ivys purse blinking furiously i clamped my hands on the wheel and pushed down on the accelerator horns blew as i tore through town but the fib guys wouldnt stop me and the is didnt care anymore hold on i said through gritted teeth as i took a turn too fast having to push on her shoulder to keep her from falling into me ivys eyes opened as my hand touched her and fear plinked through me hurry she panted rachel id rather die than bite you now please hurry i dont know how long i can stop myself it hurts oh godshe took everything its going to be okay i said as i saw a sign for bridge traffic hes coming were almost there she was silent and then a ragged are you okay came out of her astonished i looked across the car she was worried about me im fine i said beeping my horn to keep some guy from pulling out in front of me he rocked to a halt and after i swerved around him i looked at her brow furrowed ivy why did you do it you should have let her go shes a freaking banshee this was my fault she panted her eyes dropping to the coin still clenched in her fist mia remus everything it was my fault that mia learned how to kill people with impunity and she hurt you ill take care of this you cant risk yourself anymore youre going to take care of her alone i said feeling distant and unreal inside this is as much my fault as yours i gave you the wish in the first place were going to get her ivy but not apart we have to do it together who am i kidding it would take a demon to take down a banshee but then again she didnt say anything but her expression behind the hunger was determined i flicked the heater on and a blast of warm air billowed out in the distance i saw the lights of an oncoming car flashing relief so strong it hurt washed through me i could tell it was a hummer by the spacing of the lights it was them it had to be i see them i exclaimed and ivy tried to smile her teeth were clenched and her eyes were wild and it twisted my heart to see her redrimmed painfilled eyes as she struggled fumbling i put on my own flashers and pulled into a fastfood place two cars pulled in behind me black in the streetlight i came to a halt not slamming on the brakes but close before i could put the car in park two men were at ivys door there was a crack of breaking metal and the door swung open the lock broken vampire incense rolled into the car and with a savage sound ivy lunged for the man stooping to pick her up i turned away tears falling i heard a groan and when i looked back the second man with them was supporting the first as he carried ivy back to the black hummer she was on his neck blood slipping past her lips the second man opened the door for them and ivy and the man she was clutching to her vanished inside he turned to look at me his expression unreadable before he followed them in and closed the door the snow fell between us and i sat there my passengerside door open staring out my front window hands on the wheel and crying ivy had to be all right she had to be this is so messed up a soft tap on my window jerked my attention away and i looked to see rynn cormel standing outside my closed door his cashmere coat had the collar turned up against the snow and the hat on his head was just showing the first few flakes he looked good standing there but the memory of his callous treatment of meme and ivy actuallywas too new for me to be taken in he was an animal and now i understood what ivy had meant when shed said hes just a vampire though wealthy powerful and attractive he was nothing not worth anyones love or affection i wouldnt allow ivy to become like that wiping my nose i rolled down my window i was numb inside rynn cormel bent over so our faces were closer seeing me in a state he pulled a handkerchief from an inside pocket and handed it to me why didnt you let her bite you instead of all this drama he said his gaze flicking to the unmoving hummer all she needs is blood animal or no i still needed to treat him with respect she doesnt want that i said as i used his hanky and shoved it away he might get it back after i washed it maybe she doesnt want to lose her soul and biting me brings her closer to that he frowned and stood dropping back a few steps so he could see me its what she is i know i took my hands from the wheel placing them quietly in my lap she knows it too eyebrows high rynn cormel made a soft sound rocking on his feet he made motions to leave rynn i said and he stopped she accepts what she is and by god im going to find a way to help her be who she wants to be my heart was pounding but his worried expression melted into one of his famous smiles and i wondered if i had just saved my own life with my promise to find a way for her to keep her soul if he thought i meant to find a way to keep it after she died then that was his prerogative i was thinking something a little more immediate something we could both benefit from good he said hands in his pockets looking harmless enjoy your evening with your family rachel ivy will be fine i sat straighter hope making my eyes wide are you sure his gaze never moved from the hummer her aura will be replaced as she satiates herself and her strength will return in time its my people with her im worried about i couldnt help my smile at that but it faded fast she was out of control in that car and she was going to hate herself when she came home what she was pinning her sanity on now was that she hadnt allowed her hunger to rule her and satisfy it by savaging me her vow to abstain from blood had lasted thirty seconds rynn dont push her i said please just make her better and send her back to me ill find a way for her to die with her soul if its possible ill find a way i promise damn it im going to have to talk to trent he had a way to make the vampire virus dormant but from there he might find a way to remove it i wasnt sure if ivy would agree to becoming human to lose her blood lust but after tonightshe might the tall man inclined his head to acknowledge my words smiling he jauntily returned to his second car the driver emerged to open his door for him and in a moment both vehicles were gone i glanced at the clock then noticed that ivys purse was still with me i picked it up off the floor and put it on the seat where shed been then reached across and closed my broken door ivys scent lingered and i breathed it in wondering how she was my hands started to shake with the remaining adrenaline i was late for my already postponed lunch robbie was going to have a field day clearly i wasnt ready to risk the road yet i was deathly worried about ivy but that was probably fair play ivy had been worried about me when i was in the hospital rynn cormel said she was going to be all right and i had to believe it a vampire was a banshees closest rival in terms of strength having a fast way to rebound after an attackblood to renew her aura and brimstone to revitalize her strength i slowly thunked the car into gear and crept up to the exit turning my blinker on and sitting there waiting for a break in traffic as i sat there it hit me that this was probably the turning point in our relationship ivy was a vampire who wanted to be more or maybe less but she could never be who she wanted unless i could find a way to get the virus out of her by magic or medicine i was going to have to do that i might not be able to be the person i wanted to be but if i had to be a demon i was by god going to make sure ivy could be who she wanted to be having to deal with stuff like this was just crappy twentythree the scent of beef stew was heavy in my moms kitchen but even that combined with the homemade biscuits mom had pulled out of the oven when i walked in the door hadnt blunted my worry for ivy dinner might have been pleasant i didnt remember id been there for over an hour and still no one had called about ivy just how long did it take to replenish an aura adding to my state was the fact that somewhere in this house was an eighthundredlevel arcane textbook that my brother was hiding from me my life was falling apart and i wasnt leaving without it i should just tell my mom and have her make robbie give it to me but the last time id used it id gotten into a lot of trouble i didnt need any more trouble tonight id maxed out on it i was wound so tight a hangnail might have sent me over the edge i handed robbie the last of the glasses and fumbled in the dishwater for the bowls the shiftingeyed witch above the sink ticked and from the back of the house i heard my mom thumping around trying to find something it was odd standing here like i had while i was growing up i washed robbie dried course i didnt need to stand on a footstool anymore and robbie wasnt wearing grunge some changes were good heels clicking on the tile my mom came in looking happy and satisfied i couldnt help but wonder what she was up toshe looked far too pleased with herselfthough just having me and robbie here at the sink like old times might account for it thanks for lunch mom i said as i slipped a plate into the rinse water before robbie could take it im sorry for dragging it out this late i really thought id get over here sooner robbie made a rude noise but my mom beamed as she sat with her cold cup of coffee i know how busy you are she said i just threw everything into the slow cooker figuring we could eat whenever you got here i glanced at the ancient brown pot plugged into the wall trying to remember the last time i had seen it and if it had held food or a spell god i hoped it was food stuff kept getting in the way trust me i really wanted to be here earlier boy did i want to be here earlier i hadnt told them why i was late not with robbie looking for a reason to needle me about my job his mood tonight was bordering on smug worrying me even more robbie shut the door to the cupboard too hard stuff always seems to happen to you little sister you need to make some changes in your life excuse me my eyes narrowed like what it wasnt a problem robbie my mom interrupted i knew she was probably going to be late thats why i made what i did robbie made that noise again and i felt my blood pressure rise my mom got up and gave me a sideways squeeze if i knew you werent trying to do ten things before the turn id be miffed want some coffee yes thanks my mom was pretty cool it wasnt often that she took sides between robbie and me but hed been on my case all night i handed him a plate not letting go until he looked at me and i gave him a glare to get him to shut up i really thought hed been lying when he told me the book wasnt where hed left it trying to make me do things his way by force instead of persuasionbecause persuasion wasnt going to work i had to get up in that attic without my mom knowing i didnt want to worry her snatching a ghost to get a demon to talk to you didnt sound safe even to me so when i handed the last dish to my brother i used my perfect excuse smiling as the sink drained mom i said as i dried my hands are my stuffed animals still in the attic i have someone i want to give them to robbie jerked and my mom beamed i expect so she said who ceris little girl i allowed myself one superior look at robbie then went to sit across from my mom wed known ceri was having a girl since last week and my mom was as delighted as if it were one of her own no i said as i fiddled with my mug i want to give them to some of the kids in the childrens wing of the hospital i met the brat pack yesterday the ones who spend more time there than at home it just seems right you dont think dad would mind do you my mothers smile turned beautiful i think hed say that was the right thing to do i stood restless and invigorated finally i was doing something mind if i get them now go right ahead and if you find anything else up there you want bring it on down bingo with her carte blanche to rummage i was in the hall before she could call after me im putting the house on the market and a clean attic sells better than a full one huh the string to pull down the attic stairs slipped through my fist and the ceiling door slammed shut not believing id heard her right i went back to the kitchen robbie was smirking his ankles crossed as he leaned against the sink with a cup of coffee suddenly i saw my moms stilted conversation tonight in an entirely new way i wasnt the only one hiding bad news shit youre selling the house i stammered seeing the truth in her downcast gaze why taking a resolute breath she looked up im moving out to the west coast for a while its not a big deal she said as i started to protest its time for a change is all eyes squinting i turned to robbie god he looked too satisfied to live leaning against the counter like that youselfish brat i said furious hed been trying to get her to move out there for years and now hed finally gotten his way my mom shifted uncomfortably and i reined in my anger shoving it down to bring out when he and i were alone this was where wed grown up this was where my memories with dad were the tree i had planted with his ashes and now a stranger was going to have it excuse me i said stiffly ill get my things out of the attic ticked i strode into the hall ill talk to her i heard robbie say and i made a sarcastic puff i was going to do the talking and he was going to listen this time i jerked the stairs all the way down and flipped on the light a memory of pierce came from out of nowhere he had opened the attic for me when id been looking for my dads ley line stuff to help him save a girl and his soul both at least he had saved the girl cold spilled down and as robbie came into the hallway i stomped up the ladder and out of his reach chill silence enveloped me doing nothing to cool my temper the space was lit by a single bulb making shadows on the stacked boxes and dark corners with angled support beams my brow furrowed as i decided someone had been up here recently there were fewer boxes than i remembered dads stuff was missing and i wondered if robbie had thrown it all away in his efforts to keep me from using it selfish brat i muttered then reached for the topmost box of my stuffed animals id gathered the toys one by one during my stints in the hospital or home sick in bed many bore the names and pretend personalities of my friends who hadnt made it out one last time to feel the wind push on their face i hadnt taken them when id moved out which was just as well they wouldnt have survived the great salt dip of my pulse was fast as i took the box to the hole in the floor catch i said dropping it when robbie looked up he fumbled it and the box smacked noisily into the wall i didnt wait to see him glare up at me spinning away i went for the next one robbie had gained the attic by the time i turned back around get out of my way i said frowning at his tall height hunched in the low ceiling rachel he wasnt moving and unless i wanted to take the direct route to the hallway by way of crashing through the ceiling i was stuck here i always knew you were a prick i said drawing on years of frustration but this is pathetic you come back here and get her all stirred up and convince her to move out there with you and your new wife im the one who held her together when dad died not you you ran off and left me to cope with her i was thirteen robbie i hissed trying to keep my voice down but failing how dare you come out here and take her from me now just when shes gotten herself together robbies face was red and he shifted his thin shoulders shut up no you shut up i snapped shes happy here shes got her friends and this is where all her memories are cant you just leave us alone like you used to robbie took the box from me and set it beside him i said shut up she needs to get out of here for every reason you just mentioned and dont you be so selfish keeping her here when she finally finds the courage to do it do you like seeing her like that he said pointing to the unseen kitchen dressing like an old lady talking like her life is over thats not who she is i remember her before dad died and that old lady isnt her shes ready to let dad go let her arms crossed over my chest i exhaled im not taking her from you he said softer now you held her together when dad died i was a coward i was stupid but if you dont let her go now then youre the coward i didnt like what i was hearing but figuring he was right i looked up at him my face was twisted and ugly but thats how i felt she wants to be closer to takata he said and i puffed in disgust sure bring him into it she wants to be closer to takata and takata cant live in cincinnati he said persuasively she doesnt have any friends here not really and thanks to you she cant sell her charmsnow that youve been shunned shock washed cold through me and my expression blanked yyou know about that his eyes dropped from mine then returned i was with her when we found out they wont sell to her anymore wont buy she may as well be shunned herself thats not fair my stomach was hurting and i held it turning sideways robbie put one hand on his hip the other on his forehead for christs sake rachel youve been shunned embarrassed i dropped back ii didnt know they would i stammered then realizing he had turned the tables on me i lifted my chin yes because i talk to demons robbie sucked his teeth and looked at my demonscarred wrist okay i admitted and maybe make deals with them when im forced into it and ive spent some time in the everafter more than most uhhuh and a demon prison i added feeling a twinge of guilt but it was a run for trent kalamack he was there too no one got mad at him anything else he mocked wincing i said you saw the news huh the agony of my defeat or in my case being dragged down the street on my ass by a demon had been worked into their opening credits robbies anger vanished in an amused snort that must have hurt i smiled but it faded fast not as bad as what youre doing to me does he sighed and nudged the box closer to the hole in the floor there isnt anything here for her rachel my pique came back theres me yeah but thanks to your messups she cant make a living anymore damn it robbie i swore i didnt want this to happen if she leaves i dont have anyone he edged to the stairway youve got your friends he said head down and shoving the box with his foot across the plywood floor to the door friends youve made abundantly clear you dont approve of so make new ones so make new ones i mocked in my thoughts bothered i went to get the last box of stuffed animals id named after dead or dying friends there were so many of them my thoughts went to marshal then pierce how was i going to tell marshal id been shunned so much for that friendship i never should have done a power pull with him robbie lifted the second box you need to change something the scent of dust was thick as i took a breath to protest like what i try i try damn hard but there isnt anyone decent who can survive the crap my life can turn into again robbies long face went hard and he started down the stairs that is an excuse youve been shunned and youre hurting mom this goes deeper than who your friends are on second thought maybe thats all there is to it you leave ivy and jenks out of this i snapped my worry for ivy coming out as a hot anger they have more courage in one day then you will have in your entire life robbies attention came up and he scowled at me his head just above the floor grow up he said burn your demon books and get a real job if you dont start thinking inside the box youre going to end up in one angry i shifted the toys to my hip you are a piece of work you know that you dont know anything you have no idea what ive done or what im capable of and that comes at a cost nothing is free ill tell you what you just take mom and fly on back to your safe girlfriend in your safe house in your safe trendy neighborhood and live your safe predictable life and have safe predictable kids and die a safe worthless death after doing absolutely nothing with your safe life im going to stay here and do some good because thats what people do when they are alive and not just going through the motions i am not going to find myself on my deathbed wondering what would have happened if i hadnt played it safe my brothers face darkened he took a breath to say something then changed his mind sliding the waiting box into his arms he descended the stairway thanks a hell of a lot robbie i muttered look at me im shaking i come over here for lunch and now im shaking i headed for the stairway with my last box of dead friends i could hear robbie and my mother talking but not their words halfway down the ladder i stopped my head even with the floor i took one last look the book i wanted wasnt up here robbie had it and damn it he wasnt going to give it to me maybe i could find something online it wasnt the safest thing to do but seeing it might trigger my memory enough that i could reconstruct it knees watery i descended into the green hallway backward off the ladder almost backing up into my mom oh crap i stammered knowing by her miserable expression she had heard everything im sorry mom dont listen to me im just mad at him i didnt mean it you should go to portland be with takata ah donald my moms misery shifted to tearyeyed surprise at the pop stars real name he told you his name i smiled back though i was really upset yeah after i punched him the thump of the back door closing made me jump it was robbie going out to cool off whatever im sorry i muttered as i edged by her and headed for the kitchen ill apologize its no wonder he lives on the other side of the continent my mom closed the attic door with a bang we need to talk rachel she said over her shoulder as she went in the opposite direction to my old room sighing i came to a halt on the green carpet depressed as she disappeared into my room my head was starting to hurt but i shifted the box on my hip and resolutely followed her ready for the coming lecture i hadnt meant to get into a fight with robbie but hed ticked me off and things needed to be said things like where in hell is my book but when i entered my old room to find my dads stuff piled up on my bed i froze this is for you she said gesturing to the dusty boxes if you want it robbie she took a slow breath and put a hand to her forehead briefly robbie thinks i should throw it away but i cant theres too much of your dad in them i set the box of stuffed animals down feeling guilty thank you yes id like it i swallowed hard and seeing her distress i blurted mom im sorry i was shunned its not fair theyre being stupid but maybe i should just drop it all and walk away she sat on the bed not looking at me no you shouldnt but you do need to find a way to get your shunning removed for all your rebel tendencies youre not cut out for living outside society you like people too much i heard what you told robbie hes scared that hes a coward when he sees you live by your own convictions so he yells at you to be safer i came close and shoved a box over so i could sit beside her i shouldnt have said that i admitted and i really think you should go out toportland my mouth felt nasty saying it and i got depressed maybe i swallowed a lump in my throat maybe i should just scrap the whole thing they might take the shunning off if i walked away from everything but id have to leave ivy and jenks and i cant do that my moms eyes were bright when she took my hand im going and youre staying but im not leaving you here alone i stifled a wince as i thought of her matchmaking attempts and as i took a breath to protest she handed me a smooth shiny textbook is this the one youre looking for she said softly my mouth dropped open and i stared arcane divination and crosstangential science volume nine that was it this was the one i needed thats the book robbie gave you on the solstice when you were eighteen right she was saying i made robbie give it to me but i didnt know if it was the right one i think youll need this too eyes wide i took the redandwhite rock with the small dip in it with shaking hands she wanted me to rescue pierce why i managed and my mom patted my knee pierce was good for you she said instead of explaining i watched you find more strength and personal resolve in that one night together than the entire eighteen years before or maybe it was always there and he simply brought it out im proud of you sweetheart i want you to do wonderful things but unless you have someone to share them with they dont mean a dogs ass trust me on this i couldnt say anything and i just stared at the book and the crucible she thinks pierce would make a good boyfriend mom i only want this to prove to al that he cant just jerk people into the everafter i said and she smiled thats a good start she said as she stood up drawing me to a stand in her wake save him and if it works then it does if it doesnt then no harm done the important thing is that you try my mom leaned forward and gave me a hug smothering me in a heady redwood scent i was pretty sure she was talking about trying pierce on as a boyfriend not trying to summon him out and i absently hugged her back you need someone a little dirty honey with a heart of gold she whispered in my ear as she patted my back i dont think youre going to find it in this century we dont make honest men who are that strong in their convictions anymore society seems to justtwist them bad she let go and stepped back mom i managed but she waved me off go go on you still have the watch dont you i nodded not surprised she knew it was part of the spell it was my dads watch but it had been pierces before that do it exactly like before exactly if you added something by accident do it again if you stirred it with your finger do it again if you got your hair into it add a strand it has to be exact again i nodded there were tears in both our eyes and she walked me to the hall with her arm over my shoulders dont worry about the rest of this ill bring everything over tomorrow in the buick your little car would need three trips blinking i smiled at my mom and pulled the book and stone tight to me thanks mom i whispered and with the knowledge that my mom believed in me even if the rest of the world didnt i headed for the door twentyfour i winced at the clatter of the three black potion storage bottles in the sink looking up at the nightdarkened window i listened for the whine of adolescent pixy wings it was just after midnight jenkss kids were asleep and i wanted to keep it that way hearing nothing i shoved my sleeves up higher and dipped my hands into the warm suds i wouldnt be able to invoke pierces charm until tomorrow night but i had to do something to distract myself from my worry over ivy and prepping the charms would help i still hadnt heard from cormel and if no one called me soon i was calling them a box of cold pizza with one piece gone lay open atop ivys papers and a twoliter bottle of pop sat barely touched the fridge was gone leaving an empty space our food was outside on the picnic table behind me on the center counter were the partially prepared bits and pieces of my spell making a wide semicircle around the open university textbook there was enough stuff to make three substance charms and i was going to use it all new years eve was my best chance to find enough ambient energy to work the spell and i wasnt going to bet everything on one go not after the locator charms had failed to work yes it had probably been my blood that had been the problem seeing that marshals worked and mine hadnt but the mere thought that i might do a spell wrong was enough for me to spend the time to stir a little insurance oh god marshal i thought almost dropping the slippery storage bottle as i remembered my shunning what was i going to tell him or better yet how was i going to tell him hey hi i know we just had sex with our clothes on but guess what i found out shunning was contagious i didnt want him to lose his job because of me actually i didnt want him to lose his job again because of me i was the freaking black plague mentally tired i rinsed the bottles in salt water and reached for the dishcloth and things had been going so well tooapart from my latest mess that is id finally gotten the weres off my case by returning the focus to them thanks to my saving trent the elves werent bothering me despite my potential demon ah liabilities the vampires were edgy but i think i had just taken care of that ivy was going to be okay and our relationship was going to get a lot less chaotic just when everything was under control and i might be able to have something normal with a normal guy doing normal things my own people had come down on me must have been tom i muttered shoving my sleeves back up and pulling out the drain plug young attractive guys who have a good job and dont mind a girl who spends a night in the everafter once a week were hard to find it wasnt as if marshal and i had been planning a life together but damn it thered been the chance that it might have gone that way eventually not anymore what was wrong with me standing at the black window i closed my eyes and sighed that power pull had been fantastic though what am i going to tell him grimacing i turned back to the center counter and the spells waiting to be put together bottled and stoppered for tomorrow id take them out to fountain square find an alley and when the crowd started singing auld lang syne id invoke them all if i had to and then al and i would talk get a few things settled but even as i was looking forward to it the thought of arguing with al in the snow with a naked ghost and a square full of witnesses made me cringe maybe i could rent a van and do it in the parking garage it wasnt as if al was giving me any choice id tried to call him earlier but all id gotten for my trouble was a lingering headache and a go away message fine we could do it the hard way i had agreed not to summon him but he hadnt said anything about stealing his latest chunk of meat out from under him the soft hum of pixy wings got my attention and i gave jenks a closedlipped smile as he flew in hi jenks i said as i shook the black bottle to get the water out and dried the exterior impatient to get to the fun stuff on my counter i didnt wake up your kids did i jenks glanced over my spelling supplies and a slip of silver dust sifted from him as he hovered over the table no have you heard from cormel yet no the word was flat carrying all my worry but shell be fine and if she isnt im taking up the new profession of mastervampire killer he landed on the open pizza box making a face at the unused garlic dipping sauce fine yeah going after a banshee is fine youre both lucky to be alive i set the bottle upside down in the cold oven and turned it on low letting the door shut with a hard thump there was a clatter as the bottle fell over dont you think we know that i said irritated mia came after us we did not go after her what would you like us to have done roll over and play dead ivy might be okay if you had he muttered just within my hearing and i shook the last drops of water out of the next bottle before giving it a cursory swipe with the towel it went in beside the first this time propped up against the wall and i reached for the last black bottle ivy thinks its her fault that mia learned how to kill without a trace i said she tried to bring her in she tried failed and learned from it next time well do it together i looked at his drooping wings and added all of us its going to take all of us thats one wicked bitch his wings blurred into nothing and feeling better i set the last bottle in the oven with the others and carefully shut the door theyd be dry by the time i was ready for them whether from the pixies being asleep or ivy being goneor maybe because pierce was in the everafterthe church felt empty turning to the center counter i wiped my hands on my jeans and looked at the clock spelling on the back side of the night wasnt the best of times but it would be okay wine i said as i reached for the cheap bottle and unscrewed the top not one of the finest wines to have graced our kitchen but it was local the grapes grown in the soil where pierce had lived and died squinting i crouched to put my eyes level with the graduated cylinder and filled it until the meniscus settled right where it should and as jenks watched i dribbled in a little extra you overfilled it he said dryly wings clattering as he looked from it to the recipe i know not bothering to explain i picked up the cylinder and made the big nono of putting it to my lips and doing my impression of the drunken chef the hint of warmth slipped down my throat as i sipped the level back to where it should be my mom had said to do the spell exactly the same and being stupid at eighteen thats how i had leveled it who knew it might be why it had worked arcane earth spells were notoriously difficult to reproduce it might be something that nebulous that had made it possible the first time three separate batches of the yew and lemon mix were already waiting and leaving them where they sat i dumped the wine into the mortar already holding the snipped bits of holly leaf id taken from ivys christmas centerpiece earlier dont get your dust in that i said waving jenks off from the top of the open bottle and the pixy shifted to alight on the overhead rack of spelling utensils instead ivy had replaced the tackedtogether rack with a solid redwood mesh and my spelling supplies were again where they should be instead of shoved in cupboards soooorry he muttered and i nodded more concerned with the spell than his pique ivy roots i murmured reaching for the little measuring cup full of the tiny little rhizomes from one of jenkss plants in the sanctuary it had to be airborne roots not underground and jenkss kids had been delighted to harvest them for me the knobby roots went in and with a few twists the scent of chlorophyll mixed with the cheap wine it was a lot easier to crush everything this time not being sick now like id been at eighteen my thoughts went back to pierce as the soft sounds of rock against rock filled the kitchen and a whisper of worry lifted through me that tomorrow might be too late i didnt think al would give pierce a body until he had a buyer enabling him to work the cost of the expensive curse into the deal not to mention that pierce couldnt tap a line given the state he was in why would al make him stronger if he didnt have to i knew al wouldnt sell to the first buyer wanting to up the going price as far as he could it would take a few days at least a curl drifted between me and the mix and remembering something i carefully drew a single hair into the mortar and gave the pestle two twists grinding it before i pulled the hair out my hair had been to my waist the first time i had done this charm and it had gotten caught it might be important i was betting it was with this and my spit i might be investing part of myself in the spell it was going to be hard enough getting this to work i straightened to crack my back holy dust i murmured looking for it among the clutter jenkss wings hummed and he dropped to hover over the envelope that id gathered from the slats under my bed the only place the pixies didnt clean it was on sanctified ground so i figured it was holy enough and god knew my bed hadnt seen any action lately thanks i said absently as i pulled the flap to open it i wiped the pans of my scales with a tissue then frowned a thin smear of lotion showed in the bright overhead lights not only would it add aloe but the dust would stick to it and i wouldnt get enough in the mix sighing i took the pans to the sink to give them a quick wash jenks moved back to the overhead rack and in the black mirror the window had become i could see a sifting of dust falling from him he was worried ivy is going to be fine i said over the chatter of running water ill call before i go to bed to find out how she is okay im not worried about ivy im worried about you metal pans swathed in a dish towel i turned me why he made an exasperated gesture that encompassed my spelling and i huffed you want al popping over anytime with the excuse of checking on me and then snagging whoever he wants can you imagine the trouble id be in if al showed up and took say trent when im telling the little shoemaker to get lost jenkss small angular features pulled into a tight grimace al is going to be more pissed than a fairy who finds acorns in his spider sack that was a new one and i frowned as i replaced the pans and weighed out the dust carefully tapping the envelope until the delicate balance started to shift he left a loophole and im going to use it i said as the instrument leveled als not taking my calls and this is the only way i can think of to get his attention not to mention this will save pierce too two birds with one stone hell probably treat me to dinner for outsmarting him after he smacks me around i looked up seeing an unsure look on his tiny features whats the worst hes going to do to me ground me cancel our weekly sessions a private smile curved across my face and i tapped the dust from the pan into the wine medium bully for him rachel hes a demon he might just pull you into the everafter and not let you back the fear in jenkss voice broke through my nonchalance and i turned to him which is why i told you and ivy my summoning name i said surprised that this was bothering him so much he cant hold me even with charmed silver and he knows it jenks whats the matter youre acting like there is more to this than there is nothing but he was lying and i knew it the dust turned black when it hit the wine and sank jenks flew to the sill and looked out into the snowy garden only a small patch lit by the backporch light all that was left besides invoking the charm was adding the identifying agentin this case metal shavings from the back of my dads watch i drew the old pocket watch from my back jeans pocket hefting the weight and feeling the warmth of my body in the metal it had belonged to my dad but it had been pierces before that hence his being pulled from purgatory the night i had tried to make contact with my dad i turned the watch over to find that the scratches id made eight years ago were now tarnished i tried to remember what i had used to scrape the tiny bits into the spell pot the last time guessing it had been my moms scissors its the thought that counts i said as i reached for ivys pair jammed into her pencil cup and scraped a new three marks into the old silver the almostunseen shavings made dimples on the wine half of the brew and i stirred it until they settled almost done and i pulled a warm and now dry bottle from the oven and dumped in both the lemonyew mix and the wine dust roots and holly jenks hovered over it his expression blank it didnt work he said and i waved him off before his dust could get in it its not done yet i have to add my blood to invoke it and i cant do that until tomorrow night i said as i wedged a glass stopper into it and set it aside fortunately it was an earth charm and i could do it without tapping a line he was frowning and tired of his mood i asked whats your problem jenks his face tightened and he flew to land on the book standing sideways to me he crossed his arms and fumed wings drooping silently i waited this isnt going to work jenks finally said my breath slipped from me and i turned away brow furrowed gee thanks jenks i meant with pierce understanding him now i straightened after carefully pouring a second portion of wine into the graduated cylinder you think im cooking up a boyfriend in my kitchen grow up you grow up jenks said lets just say hes a nice ghost who needs a little help and is not spying on us for some demon i know you rache he is a ghost youre a witch he needs help and id be willing to bet the first time you met him he did something strong and powerful and now he needs help which turns him into freaking rachel candy i couldnt help a flush from creeping up my face okay maybe once but i was smarter now but seeing it jenks rose an inch hes rachel candy and i dont want to see you hurt when you realize you cant have him you think im doing this because i like him i said mentally backpedaling its not always about sex then its a good thing you didnt sleep with marshal isnt it silently i reddened eyes fixed on the wine level damn it tinks titties rache he exclaimed you slept with the guy when i didnt sleep with him i protested but i couldnt look at him as i sipped the wine to the right amount it was just a really involved kiss in a broad sort of way crap ford had said pierce spent a lot of time in the belfry i sure hoped he hadnt been up there when marshal and i hadno al had abducted him before that jenks landed on the bottle id just capped and with his hands on his hips he stared disapprovingly at me i thought you were going to leave it at friends he said then he slumped crap rache cant you just have a guy friend i did have a guy friend i snapped my hair swinging as i dropped the ivy roots and a holly leaf into the mortar and started grinding i spent two months doing friend stuff because i thought my life was too dangerous and i found out that yeah i can keep it friendly but i also found out he was a really nice person maybe someone i might want to spend my life with maybe not i didnt know i was going to get shunned excuse me if i thought i might finally have my freaking life together enough that i could share it with someone other than just you and ivy jenkss wings buzzed then went guiltily silent feeling bad for yelling at him i set the pestle down and crouched to put us on the same level i thought i had my life together i whispered i really liked him jenks me too in a soft hum he landed by my hand dont put him in the past tense my focus sharpened on him and i stood he is i whispered ever since i became shunned depressed i straightened and looked to the holy dust ashes and dust it sort of fit jenks watched as i shook the envelope over the weighing pan then rose up on a column of ambertinted sparkles the phone is going to ring you want to get it before it wakes up my kids i looked up not sure i believed him the trill of the phone broke the silence and i reached for the receiver adrenaline jumping through me cormel god i hate it when you do that i said as i hit the button to open the line hello yes i blurted as jenks darted from the kitchen to check on his kids then remembering we were a business i cleared my throat vampiric charms i said politely this is rachel we can help dead or alive alive would be better came eddens voice and disappointment that it wasnt cormel slumped my shoulders tucking the phone between my shoulder and my ear i went back to my set of scales hi edden how is glenn doing i asked trying not to breathe on the scales as i tapped a little more dust out great they released him this afternoon the massage worked though it raised a few eyebrows its going into the sop for aura trauma thats fantastic i said as i stood and dumped the dust in with the wine mix wine to give life dust to give substance ivy to bind and holly to be sure nothing bad came in on the souls of the dead thanks for calling me i looked at the clock wanting to keep the line open but clearly edden didnt get the hint it was only right seeing as you helped get him out he hesitated and when i didnt say anything he added im sorry about ivy is she okay my motions to scrape the metal shavings into the mix were harsher than i had intended and i warmed gaze flicking to jenks as he flew in oh yeah he would have heard about that ah shes okay i winced adjusting the phone and remembering to grind a strand of my hair in with everything um how much trouble am i in over that he laughed just come in tomorrow and fill out a statement i told them you were working for me and they cut you a lot of slack i sighed in relief thanks edden i owe you yeah you do he said and my tension ratcheted up again at his sly tone what i said flatly my eyes flicked to jenks listening to the entire conversation from across the room and the pixy shrugged id like your help on the next step in bringing mia in he said we can go over it tomorrow see you at my office at eight whoa whoa whoa edden i said holding the phone tight to my ear there is no next step until my entire team is functioning none of us is going after her our three best profilers say ms harbor will be at a party tomorrow edden said as if not having heard me i want you there jiggling the phone i pulled a bottle from the oven and turned it off jenkss wings had hit a high pitch and i tried to tell him with my eyes that this was not going to happen on new years eve i quipped how much are you paying these guys half of cincinnati is going to be at a party i want you to come with me to one in particular he continued his voice tired golly edden i dont date people i work with i could hear him puff his breath out in annoyance morgan stop messing with me theres an eightythree percent chance mia will show up at this one the bottle was warm in my hands as i filled it and i gave the mix a good shake before setting it beside the first with a sharp tap ive got spelling to do tomorrow personal spelling ill give you time and a half he coaxed i crossed one arm over my middle he wasnt getting it that womans baby almost killed me i said trying the direct approach she tried to finish the job last night in front of a freaking jail damaging my new aura and pretty much stripping ivys down to nothing do you know how hard it would be to live with ivy if she were dead im not going to risk us on some lame attempt to tag her and her psychotic boyfriend did you know i cant tap a line without convulsing if i dont have a good aura im helpless edden not going to happen make some charms ill double your rate he said and i heard a burst of muffled noise when someone came into his office make some charms stupid human no i said eyeing my potions maybe when it gets warmer and all three of us can work rachelpeople are dying dont you want to get even with this piece of work for what she did to your roommate i got mad at that dont you guilt me edden i said hearing jenkss wings clatter theres a reason the is is ignoring her shes a freaking apex predator and we are zebras at the watering hole to her trying to goad me into it by waving the flag of revenge is low you can just take your guilt and your manipulation and shove it jenks looked pained and i lowered my voice so i wouldnt wake up his kids from the phone came eddens cajoling voice saying okay okay that was unfair im sorry can i come over and talk to you about it bring you flowers candy does bribery work with you no and you cant come over im in my pajamas i lied god i couldnt believe he had tried to use revenge to get me to do what he wanted thing was last year it might have worked you are not its only midnight i leaned to look at the clock by golly hes right i took a bath i lied again tired i turned to look at my reflection in the black window remus is a psychotic murderer but mia is a powerhungry psychotic murderer who is also an inderlander she thinks she owns this city built it even and shes been alive longer than most undead vampires edden she said if you dont back off shes going to start picking targets according to her political agenda instead of thinning the herd you need to slow down and think i know people are dying but bringing her in is going to take a lot of finesse and luck and im fresh out of both apart from a slow breath there was silence on the other end her threatening the fib doesnt surprise me it goes along with the profilers report i rolled my eyes damned profilers report upset i put my back to the window and leaned against the sink i am not going to do this it is too risky mia is not your average psychotic killer she doesnt need to go to a party i said tired if she goes out at all it will be to a private party where she already knows the victim and the poor guy will probably die of a heart attack or choke on an olive he said nothing and i blurted look i agree we have to get her but staking out parties isnt going to do it you cant catch her the is cant catch her she keeps slipping your lines because she knows the city better than you and shes like a poisonous snake you cant get within ten feet of youve got to get her to come in voluntarily frustrated i looked at my demon books beside ivys maps and charts ive done the research and theres nothing i can do to protect your auras from her so short of gunning her down you dont have a chance then well dart the bitch with an animal sedative he said grimly dont you guys do that with weres no we dont i said tightly thinking it was barbaric to even suggest it listen to me you cannot risk alienating this woman even if i do hit her with a sleepytime potion and down her for you in about eighteen years youre going to have another one of these women on the street and you wont be able to distinguish her kills from natural causes you saw remus hes alive because of some stupid wish and from watching holly interact with him mia learned how to push energy into people not just take it so the fib officer prompted that sounds good to me so like every good thing we can think up to make our lives better it can be turned into a weapon mia goes in makes some poor sap think shes in love with him and because shes feeding him emotion he believes it his guard goes down and he dies without a whimper or an emotional stain of natural causes like glenns friend he said and i picked up the bottle of wine looking at it no rachel youll have a migraine in the morning exactly i said filling the graduated cylinder right to the top not looking at jenks i drank half of it then topped it off to get to the right mark who would have thought that so much trouble could come from one lousy wish no wonder ivy felt responsible edden was silent and i let him stew while i dropped another leaf of holly and some ivy roots into the mortar and started working them over i have to get this woman he finally said will you just come with me to the party frustrated i shifted the phone to the other ear he wasnt getting it mia is not afraid of you i said the only thing you have to bargain with is holly and thats pretty thin the woman doesnt want the walker to have her if you can promise me that there will be no wards of the court no temporary custody and that you can keep holly with mia all the time she might come in just so she can impress you with how low and scummy you are i will not promise that woman anything edden said his anger so deep that jenks clattered his wings in concern she left my son to die her child is social services problem not mine angry i huffed thats right youll be retired by the time holly is out on her own me ill probably be just coming into my ownif i am still alive come on i coaxed when he was silent look at the bigger picture you tell me mias daughter can stay with her and maybe i can get mia to come in as a gesture of goodwill everyone wins and you look like a benevolent human being allowing a helpless woman in jail to keep her baby shell do her time for beating up glenn and then peacefully reenter society promising to be good youll have a handle on her and better yet one on holly what about the tilsons he asked and i made a face he couldnt see oh yeah i forgot about them i continued to grind away shoulder starting to hurt shell probably blame it on remus and god knows he deserves whatever comes to him once you have her behind bars you have control one step at a time again there was a long silence ill see what i can do it had been a soursounding admission and the circuit clicked closed edden i exclaimed but it was too late i couldnt go to mia with ill see what i can do and upset i set the phone in its cradle and made a frustrated noise at the ceiling cya bull crap i muttered jenks flew to the island counter stilling his wings when i finished weighing out the last bit of dust why are you helping her rachel eyes on the scale i blew some of the dust off then held my breath until it gave me a reading im not i said satisfied with the amount im trying to not get blamed for the resurgence of a deadly inderlander species if we can keep her in jail long enough remus will be dead when she gets out and she cant easily have another child i dumped the dust into the wine mix watching it turn black and the clumps settle to the bottom jenks rose high again bringing me a strand of my hair i carefully put it in the mix and gave a couple of twists with the pestle the shavings from the watch were next and finished i opened the oven for the last bottle jenks came close to ride the updraft from the heat and as i dumped everything into it and stoppered it up i felt a twinge on my awareness it wasnt someone tapping my ley line out back but rather a sensation that i could sense it almost without trying my eyes went to the ceiling and i wasnt surprised to see bis crawling in his usually dark skin a pale white to match the color of what he was clinging too my welcoming smile faded when his red eyes met mine and i noticed that his huge whitetufted ears were at a worried slant almost parallel to his head seeing me notice him the young gargoyle dropped to the counter holy sweet mother of tink jenks yelped shooting halfway across the kitchen and leaving a spot of dust like an octopus inking bis what the hell is wrong with you i set the bottle beside the first two lined up beside my dissolution vat and wiped my hands on my jeans hi bis i said come in to get warmed up bis shook his wings straight and wound his lionlike tail around a back haunch as if nervous theres two cars out front i think its rynn cormel my breath hissed in and a spike of adrenaline jumped making my head hurt is ivy with them i asked already moving i dont know jenks was way ahead of me and i almost jogged to the front of the church hitting lights as i went the gong of the farm bell we used as a doorbell clinked once not very loud and i brushed bits of the spell off my shirt though the sanctuary was blazing with light the foyer was dark relief that bis had gotten the graffiti off the sign flitted through me it was followed by the thought that i really needed to invest in a peephole or some lighting pulse racing i reached for the handle ducking when bis landed beside the door to cling to the wall like a huge bat his ears were pinned to his head and he shifted upward to hang at head height jenks was at my shoulder and hoping the pixies stayed asleep i opened the door rynn cormel was on my front porch standing somewhat sideways in the yellowish light shining on the sign above the door he looked about the same as he had a few hours ago long coat round hat snow dusting his shiny shoes hands in his pockets behind him were two long cars in the dark street not limos but close giving us a welcoming smile he inclined his head at jenks and me his eyes flicking briefly to where bis was lurking inside almost as if he could see through the paint and shingles is she okay i said breathlessly more than he said in his rough voice his new york accent obvious shes a masterpiece bringing a gloved hand from a pocket he gestured to the second car jenkss wings clattered as he dropped beside my neck to find some warmth and my eyes narrowed people were getting out of the second car but there was no sign of ivy and i hadnt appreciated his comment rynn cormel smiled at my obvious anger ticking me off all the more i did not take advantage of her rachel he said dryly piscary is an artist and i can appreciate a work of art without having to get my fingers on it spoiling it she is a person i snapped arms crossed over me against the cold and not going out on the stoop and a magnificent one at that you have a discerning eye god this was just sick jenkss wings moved against me and i looked past rynn to the street seeing in the dim light ivy slumped in a husky guys arms he was in a black tshirt arms bulging while he carried ivy as if she were nothing behind him was a second man with her boots and coat you said she was okay i accused realizing she was unconscious the master vampire moved aside as they mounted the steps and i got out of their way as they walked in nice as you please the heavy scent of vampire trailing behind them she is he said as they passed me shes asleep she will likely stay that way until well after sunrise her last words made it quite clear that she wanted to come home he smiled ducking his head to look perfectly normal perfectly alive perfectly deadly she used words that left no doubt i didnt see the harm in it i could imagine her room is on the left i called after them not wanting to follow and leave a past us president standing on my porch jenks took off from my shoulder and dusting heavily from indecision he finally took off after them ill show you he said this way i turned back to cormel arms still over my chest i didnt care if i looked defensive thank you i said stiffly thinking id give him something more sincere once i found out how messed up she was again the tall man inclined his head thank you he said nothing else and the silence became uncomfortable bis twitched his ear and cormels eyes shifted there was a soft thump from inside the church then nothing i am going to try to find a way for her to keep her soul after death i said i know you are he smiled the smile that saved the world but i saw beyond it to the monster underneath i had to keep ivy from becoming this it was foul i didnt look away from cormel as the sound of footsteps and pixy wings grew behind me standing in the middle of my threshold with my feet spread and my arms crossed i refused to move as the men brushed past me and went down the cement steps and into the dark with a last inclination of his head rynn cormel slowly spun on a heel and followed getting in the first car when one of his men opened the door two more doors thumped shut and they slowly accelerated down the street jenks landed on my shoulder as i exhaled long and loud in or out bis i asked and the gargoyle launched himself deeper into the church there was a delighted laugh from the open support beams and i shut the door sealing out the night jenkss wings were cold and i decided id bake cookies or something to warm up the church feet slow i went into the sanctuary bis was on one of the support beams three of jenkss older kids with him his ears were flat as he tried to decide what to make of them and it looked sweet as he tried to appear harmless shifting to a bright white and holding his wings close bis didnt come in often but the entire church had the feeling of closing in circling the wounded bracing for a fight is she okay i asked jenks as i tiptoed into the hall she stinks like vampire was his opinion but her aura looks really thick really thick thicker than usual i mused not knowing if that was good or bad sighing as i touched ivys closed door in passing i was glad to have her home the church feltalmost right just a few more days i thought as i reached the kitchen and turned the oven on to preheat just a few more days and everything will be back to normal but as i looked at the stoppered bottles all lined up and ready to go i wondered twentyfive oh god i think im going to be sick i whispered head bowed over my lap making my hair drape onto the scrying mirror the morning chill made me feel ill as it mixed with my nausea and my hand shook as i pressed it into the cave of the pentagram engraved on the scrying mirror the ley line spilling into me was still ragged lurches and jumps obviously my aura wasnt yet back to normal rachel calling al come in al i thought sarcastically in a lastditch effort to reach the demon but as before he refused to answer leaving me in this dizzy uncomfortable morass of existence i hunched suddenly as it felt like the world suddenly dropped out from under me my stomach gave a heave and i broke the connection before i vomited on the kitchen floor damn it all to the turn and back i exclaimed barely above a whisper shaking i curbed my desire to fling the mirror across the kitchen and instead leaned to shove it roughly away on the open shelves under the island counter slumping back in my chair i stared at the silent room it was about three in the afternoon ivy wasnt up yet but the pixies were at it trying to be quiet so as not to wake her i eyed the open box of cold pizza from last night and feeling my nausea leave as fast as it had come i yanked a piece and ate the point crap this is awful i muttered tossing it back in the box i was too old for this it was really quiet and cold course being in my robe didnt help rex appeared in the doorway sitting on the threshold and curling her tail around her feet pulling a pepperoni off my abandoned slice i offered it to her and the cat padded in taking it with a finicky precision good kitty i whispered giving her ears a little rub after she ate the morsel i had way too much to do today to be sitting around in my robe feeding the cat cold pizza and taking my cup i refilled it standing at the sink to look out at the glittering snow our perishables stacked on the picnic table looked funny and i sighed tonight was new years and i was shunned what a nice way to start the year no wonder really if i was considering doing a spell to force a demon to come to mein a public place maybe i should break into a vacant office that overlooked the square maybe i am a black witch mood souring i took a sip of coffee eyes closing as it slipped down and eased the last of my nausea turning i started almost spilling my coffee when i found ivy standing in the doorway in her black silk robe her arms crossed watching me holy crap i exclaimed flustered how long have you been there ivy smiled with her lips closed her eyes dilating slightly at the pulse of adrenaline id probably given off not long she said picking up rex and giving her a cuddle you freaking scared the crap out of me i complained and why were you just standing there watching me sorry dropping rex she eased into the kitchen going to the sink and warming up her coffee mug in a steady stream of hot tap water i casually moved back to my chair and sat trying not to look like i was avoiding her she didnt look sorry she lookedgorgeous her alabaster white skin having a hint of rose casual in her black robe her motions had an unusual edginess to them sharp obviously her night at cormels had done more than save her life how are you feeling i asked hesitantly eyeing the pizza and deciding i couldnt stomach it cormel brought you home about midnight you ah look great the gurgle of the coffee as it filled her cup was loud and she said without turning im feeling really really good every last itch scratched every last bubble burst her voice was tight and depressed and she carefully replaced the carafe i hate myself but tomorrow will be better i took blood from someone to keep from dying my only consolation was that it wasnt you now she turned and holding her cup high in salute she added small victories i didnt know what to do seeing her standing at the sink with the island counter between us im sorry i said softly i dont care what you did im just glad youre okay but i couldnt bring myself to cross the room and give her a hug not yet her eyes dropped to the mug in her hand thank you we both know the monster is there no need to have to look at it right she sounded resigned and i protested ivy youre not a monster her gaze flicked to mine and she looked away then why do i feel so damn good right now after what i did last night i didnt know the answer my thoughts went to the brat pack comparing black magic to chemo treatments all i know is that it saved your life and im glad youre okay she took her coffee to her computer lips pressed in a tight line she moved two books off her chair and sat before a blank screen more needed to be said but i didnt know how to bring it up i listened for the sound of wings but jenks was either in the sanctuary with his kids or being especially quiet in his eavesdropping um ivy i have something to ask you tossing the hair from her eyes she shook the mouse and woke up her computer yes yes it sounded innocent enough but my pulse was racing and i knew she knew it and was feigning disinterest hands around my warm mug i took a slow breath if you could would you leave everything to become human mouse unmoving she stared at me with empty eyes i dont know a dry clattering of pixy wings interrupted and jenks darted in spilling silver sparkles what he exclaimed hovering in midair between us in his peter pan pose rachel says she can take away the blood lust and you say you dont know whats wrong with you jenks i exclaimed not surprised hed been listening i didnt say i could make her human i asked if she could would she do it and quit eavesdropping on us okay ivy shook her head so im human and the blood lust is gone what does that leave me with its not the blood lust that warped me it was piscary id still be mixing savagery with feelings of love only now if i hurt someone in passion it would hurt at least the way things are it would feel good jenkss wings dropped in pitch and a slip of dust turned green for a moment oh not to mention id be frail and lower on the food chain she added a soft blush coloring her skin attention going to the screen avoiding us anyone could take advantage of me and probably would seeing as ive got a past the way things are now no one dares cold i tugged my robe closed you can feel strong without the vampire virus yeah right she said and my expression froze at her flash of anger i like being a vampire its losing my soul that scares me if i knew i wouldnt lose it when i die i might try harder toconform her eyes met mine my magic books stacked between us all brought down this morning from the belfry you really think you can make me human jenkss kids came rushing in with a burst of noise and silk and i shrugged as he corralled them pushing them out ahead of him as he went to see what had them in a tizzy i dont know i said in the abruptly quiet kitchen trent has a treatment it only has an eleven percent success rate and it only makes the virus and neurotoxins dormant if you survived taking it youd still become an undead and lose your soul when you died rynn cormel would say it was a failure i smiled thinly thinking it sucked to be a vampire even one as respected as ivy it might make your life easier or it might kill you i wasnt going to risk an percent chance of success not with ivy actually i said hesitant to bring it up i was thinking along the lines of a curse that can turn you human or witch ivy said surprising me there was a soft vulnerability in her and i blinked you dont want to be a witch i said quickly why not you are jenks came back in with one of his kids her wings tangled up in what was probably spiderweb i think you should be a pixy he said fingers sifting dust as they gently ran over jrixibells wing to clean it youd look so cute with your little wings and your sword id let you fight in my garden anytime a smile quirked her lips then died a witch cant be turned she said shortly neither can a were said jenks smiling as he boosted his child into the air and the little girl zipped out hurting my ears with her shout to wait for her ivy was lost in thought and i couldnt help my smile as i thought of david i think she was too when she turned to her computer blushing cormel would freaking kill me if i turned ivy into anything other than a vampire with an eternal soul but seeing as i couldnt be what i wanted why not use my liability to give ivy the chance to be what she wanted feeling like something had been settled even though it hadnt i pushed myself up and went to the pantry everything that had been in our fridge was outside you want pancakes i feel like cooking sure her fingers were clicking on the keys but her eyes were on the three bottles of potion against the wall by the disillusion pot of salt water you got the book she asked i came out of the pantry with the box of mix last night im going out to try it tonight at fountain square you want to come will there be news vans and screaming probably i said sourly count me in she said and jenks snorted from the sill where he was feeding his sea monkeys the tiny tank of brine had taken the place of honor at the window ever since id moved mr fish to the everafter as my canary to know if the everafter was poisoning me leaning against the counter i read the back of the box if we had eggs they were frozen actually im going to rent a van and park it in the garage could you help keep people away if the vans a rockin dont come a knockin jenks said gyrating beside me god jenks i said we do have kids in the church how do you think they got here baby he said laughing i set the box down hard and the mix puffed up into him hey he shouted dusting heavily as he shivered his wings and the mix made a cloud ivy was smiling with closed lips this was nice wed come a long way in a yearall of us after you whip that demons ass ill take you and pierce out for pizza she offered deal bending i got the frying pan out from under the counter and put it on the stove my thoughts went to what spells i could make today to help ensure that al wouldnt get so pissed he took his mistake out on me theyd be earth charms so i wouldnt have to tap a line but that was where i excelled sleepytime charms for sure ivy stood in a fast motion and jenks and i jumped either she wasnt hiding her vampire speed or she was having trouble controlling it seeing jenkss and my alarm her face scrunched in amusement glenns car is at the end of the street she said and jenks rose higher his expression one of disbelief im getting dressed coffee in hand she walked out tinks little red thong jenks blurted following her you can hear that from here today i can she said her words fading as she went into her room i tightened the tie on my robe would i give up being that special in order to love someone or would i just find someone new to love the creaking of the front door and the ensuing pixy uproar told me jenks had let the fib detective in and i was smiling when the tall man entered a paper grocery bag in his grip pixies wreathed him noisy as they darted in and out of the bag while he set it on the counter his eyes went to the empty space where the fridge had been a question in his expression wheres your fridge i blew it up i said taking in his fading bruises and bare scalp newly shaved to even out the mess the hospital had left i didnt think id ever seen him in jeans before and a dark sweater showed from underneath a leather coat you look better i said as he eyed my robe uh its three in the afternoon he said suddenly unsure it sure is i gave him a hug truly glad to see him how are those locator amulets i gave your dad working you want some coffee pancakes i owe you for helping me get out of the hospital thanks for that i couldnt stop smiling id thought he was going to die or be hospitalized for months and now he was standing in my kitchen with a bag of groceries and only the faintest hint of stress showing in his face glenns gaze slid to the coffeepot then back to the empty spot uh amulets are working i guess youre welcome for the help breaking out and no thanks on the coffee i cant stay the department heard what happened last night with you and ivy and the guys wanted me to bring you both something youre not invincible you know theres no big s on your chest he hesitated brow furrowing as he leaned close enough that i could smell his aftershave hows ivy i heard she was hit hard she bounced right back i said dryly peeking into the bag with the pixies to findtomatoes he bought tomatoes with the fibs gift fund ah shes getting dressed i added surprised where did glenn get tomatoes damn vampires heal fast he said his dark eyes interested as he leaned to see into the bag while i poked around it took me five days no wonder denon wants to be one yeah well we all make mistakes three of jenkss kids rose up with a cherry tomato arguing over who got the seeds glenn did you get all this by yourself he grinned rubbing a hand behind his neck yeah too much not if youre going to have a family reunion i said smiling so hed know i was messing with him damn mr man im proud of you you actually went in a store and everything he came close to the bag leaning to look in his eagerness charming on a big black man you should have seen the looks i got he said as he reached in and the bag crackled did you know there is more than one kind of tomato this one is a beefsteak a huge tomato the size of my two fists hit the counter its good for slicing up on sandwiches and the lady at the store said you can quarter them and grill them no kidding i said hiding a grin as his dark fingers pulled out a bag of plum tomatoes these long ones are romas he said as he set them down you cut these up and put them in salads on pizza and in sauces and the little ones here are cherry tomatoes you can put them in salads or eat them like candy i had never eaten a tomato like candy but i ate one now the acidic fruit not mixing at all well with the coffee mmmm good i said and jenks laughed hovering at the lintel with the tomato his kids had swiped behind him one of his daughters waited wringing her hands ive got three that were vine ripened glenn said showing me the top of his bruised and cut head as he looked for them those babies were expensive but theyre really red dont you want some of these for yourself i asked and he looked up grinning the smile went all the way to his eyes and it felt good to see it on him ive got another bag in the car youre going to have to find someone else to blackmail into giving you law enforcement tools so you dont mind if i tell your dad then i teased and his smile vanished jenks came in easily handling the weight of the cherry tomato here glenn my kids are sorry they wont do it again i caught the fruit as he dropped it they can keep it i said and five pixy bucks and jenkss daughter swooped in arguing in highpitched voices as they snatched it from my palm hey jenks shouted following them out are you sure you dont want some coffee i said as i heard ivys door creak open i think the rani of recycling has a foam cup around here you can take it with you glenn took his fingers out of the bag of tomatoes his hands going behind him in sort of a parade rest his back to the door no i have to go but i want your opinion on last night he was starting to look like a cop frowning i thought about ivy and my frantic drive to the bridge it sucked why not your personal night glenn said dryly dont you ever look at a paper interested i pushed off from the counter and found this mornings paper still in its little plastic bag on the table under it was the picture of jenks and me standing before the mackinaw bridge rescued from yesterdays burning fridge carefully moving the photo i opened up the paper where am i looking i asked standing hunched over it the front page he said wryly oh goodie wincing i read three in hospital early morning black magic to blame there was a picture of ambulances in the dark the scene lit by a car on fire people were milling around in front of a business from my shoulder jenks whistled back from his kids uh i was home all night i said thinking i was going to get blamed for this somehow whatever it was i talked to your dad about midnight he can vouch for me i leaned forward recognizing the roofs outline astons roller rink youre not working this are you i asked worried now glenn you might feel better but your aura is still thin i appreciate your concern he said his attention moving from the paper to the open box of cold pizza hey uh can i have a slice of that im starving sure i squinted at the blackandwhite shot as glenn crossed the kitchen and wrangled a slice from the pizza jenks did you know about this jenks shook his head and landed on the paper hands on his hips and his attention directed downward as he read from what weve gotten from the is glenn said around a bite of pizza it seems ms walker ran into ms harbor three people in intensive care with damaged auras thats terrible i said glad i wasnt being blamed for it do you need me to come down and look at the crime scene i asked brightening its astons roller rink isnt it glenn laughed turning it into a choke and i kept my eyes on himnot on ivy suddenly standing in the doorway she was dressed in jeans and a black sweater looking nice her hair brushed and wearing a little bit of makeup no but thanks he said oblivious to ivy affronted i sat in my chair and said you didnt have to laugh jenks was in the air with the paper struggling to turn it over and get to the rest of the article yes he did you need to take a class on crime scene etiquette rache ivy ghosted up behind glenn as he started to take another bite her feet soundless thanks for the tomatoes glenn she whispered in his ear and the man jumped sweet mother of jesus he exclaimed spinning his hand smacking his hip where his pistol would have been the slice of pizza went airborne and he scrambled to catch it damn woman he complained as it hit the floor where did you come from ivy smiled with her lips closed but i was laughing my mother always said i came from heaven she said then delicately stepped over the pizza to reach the coffeemaker motions sultry she refilled her cup and turned standing in front of the cupboard door to the trash glenn was holding the slice of pizza cradled in his big hand like it was a favorite petdead but still beloved ivy slid sideways and opened the cupboard door and the man sighed as he threw it away amused i extended the pizza box and he brightened taking another slice so whats up ivy asked as she sipped her coffee eyeing him over the rim as if she wanted to eat him up like pie yeah why are you here glenn if you dont want me to check out that crime scene i asked putting my feet up on the adjacent chair and adjusting my robe to cover my legs cant a guy bring over a getwell tomato without getting the third degree he said with a false innocence six freaking pounds of getwell tomatoes jenks muttered and ivy set her cup down turning to the sink to fill a small pan to wash the red fruit she wanted to stay and needed something to do it better not be about working tonight i said looking askance at the paper i already told your dad i was not working his lameass party no way jenks darted from the paper to hover an inch before glenns nose there is no way im letting rachel work with her aura that crappy you want her facedown again she may look all tough and shit but her aura peels off like a banana skin i hadnt known that and i wondered if it was a species thing or just me which is exactly why im not doing what my dad sent me to do asking you to work that party glenn said as he stood unperturbed in our kitchen and mowed down his pizza crust wings clattering jenks backed down and glenn glanced at me if he calls swear a lot and tell him i gave you a hard time will you he has no idea what its like to have a compromised aura im glad youre both staying in tonight i didnt shift my eyes from him but it was hard not to look at ivy who had turned with that beefsteak swathed in a towel a smile quirking her lips yeah a nice and quiet night i said hoping he didnt see my spell books fingers slow i folded the paper up and set it deliberately on top of them ivy turned her back on us but i think she was still smiling as she continued washing the tomatoes setting them to dry one by one well i gotta go glenn said dusting his hands and looking at the leftover pizza thanks ladies dont let my dad get to you he really wants to nail this woman and doesnt realize what hes asking of you no problem now i felt guilty and i stood up handing him the pizza box his eyes lit up as he took it but i wished hed get out of here i had to prep for tonight sure i had agreed not to circle al but there were other ways to catch a demon and i wondered if turning him into a mouse would work i knew i could do that one have a great new years glenn the fib detective smiled you too he picked up one of the clean tomatoes and tucked it in his pocket winking he said dont tell my dad about the tomatoes okay ill take it to my grave which might be as soon as tonight ivy turned from folding up the grocery bag and sliding it under the sink glenn are you headed in to work she asked and he hesitated yeees he hedged you want a ride i have a few words of wisdom for edden about that little bitch of a banshee she said grimacing then added looking at me unless you need me to stick around jenkss wings clattered in agitation and mystified i glanced at my spell books im just going to play with my junior cook books i said and then worried that guilt might make her try to face mia alone i added youll be back before the ball drops right the rim of brown around her eyes shrank slightly you know it ill get my coat she said and turning she strode out of the kitchen moving with that eerie grace from the paper jenks muttered need her to stick around who does she think she is i heard that ivy shouted from the sanctuary and there was a squeal of pixies glenn was moving to the door take care of yourself rachel he said and i angled for a hug my bad mood squeezed out by the big man who now smelled like pizza you too i said my smile fading as i became serious and rocked back glenn i want to get this woman but it needs some solid planning you dont need to tell me twice he turned to follow ivy and i touched his sleeve stopping him hey if you see ford today will you tell him im ready to make an appointment a smile holding what looked like pride came over him i will good for you rachel glenn came from the sanctuary and he rolled his eyes coming mother he called and headed out pizza box in hand i heard his feet in the hall a chorus of tiny goodbyes and the door closing content i slid the pancake mix away jenks sat on the rim of the coffeemaker his wings fanning in the rising warmth you might want to get dressed if youre going to fight demons today he said and i looked at him from around my sleepstringy hair will you watch the door while i shower i asked and he buzzed his wings duh the pixies were loud playing with the cherry tomatoes as i shuffled into my bathroom to get the water going i was looking forward to a long soak and i blissfully lost myself in lather rinse and repeat eyes closed i stood under the hot water and breathed in the steam reluctant to get out and get back to my life id spent four years using a crappy lowvolume shower thanks to mrs talbu and the highoutput energyinefficient head that ivy had installed even before id moved in was better than therapy not that i needed therapy naaaah not me the spray suddenly went cold and gasping i pushed from the wall making my back smack the one behind me jenks i shouted in a burst of adrenaline knock it off the water hitting my feet grew warm but my mood had soured and i got out and reached for my towel my motions were rough as i dried my hair and worked my way down apparently jenks thought i was clean enough wrapped in a towel i swiped at the mirror to take stock not too bad i decided apart from lingering circles under my eyes not too bad at all for having been bitchslapped by a banshee twice in as many days from outside the door came the clatter of pixy wings and a hesitant rachel my towel slipped as i rummaged for a complexion spell very funny jenks i could have slipped and cracked my head open the humming of wings grew louder and i snatched my towel higher jenks i exclaimed as he darted under the door i didnt say to come in his wings a bright red jenks turned his back on me sorry uh i thought you ought to know marshal is here he said apologetically panic iced through me and i tightened my grip on my towel get him out of here jenks i just about hissed ive been shunned the pixy glanced over his shoulder then revolved in the air to face me i think he knows already he wants to talk to you rache im sorry he looks mad shit id been shunned marshal hadnt come over to hold my hand and tell me he could make it all better id told him i was a white witch and i was but now tell him to go away i said chickening out tell him to leave before someone knows hes here and they shun him too but the pixy only shook his head no he has a right to tell you to your face i took a breath my head started to hurt this is going to be way fun turning to the mirror i started brushing my hair arms crossed jenks waited for the right answer the brush got tangled in my hair and frustrated i smacked it on the tiny counter ill be out in three minutes i said to get him to leave nodding he dropped to the floor a faint glimmer of light and he was gone i had underwear in the dryer and a camisole hanging over the industrialsize tub my bathroom was really a glorified laundry room but it was easier than sharing the more traditional bathroom across the hall with ivy besides i had jeans fresh from the dryer most days no socks though i thought as i gave my hair a last brush and let it hang damp worried i quietly opened the door and looked hesitantly down the hall it was cool out here compared to the moist warmth of the bathroom and i could smell fresh coffee padding down the hall on silent bare feet i peeked into the kitchen to find marshal sitting with his back to me i was out of his peripheral eyesight and i hesitated he looked empty or maybe just deep in thought as he stared at the grimy floor where the fridge had been probably wondering what happened his long legs were bent comfortably under the table and the reflected sun glinted on his short curly hair this was going to be hard i didnt blame him for being mad at me id told him i was a white witch and he had trusted me society said different resolute i pushed myself off the archway and into the kitchen hi marshal pulled his feet under him and spun hey you gave me a start he said his eyes wide and color flashing into his face i didnt expect you out for another ten minutes giving him a tiny smile i looked for something to hide behind but all that was between us was space lots of new space you want some coffee the cups scraped as i got two new ones out and he said nothing as i filled them he remained silent as i slid one in front of him im sorry i said as i retreated putting the island counter between us scared almost i took a sip hot bitterness slipped down gathering my courage i set the mug by the sink marshal his eyes met mine cutting me off they werent angry they werent sad they wereempty let me say something and then ill go he said i think im allowed that much depressed i crossed my arms over my middle my stomach hurt ill get the shunning removed i said you know this is a mistake im not a black witch when i went to the registrars office about your classes this morning my supervisor came in he told me not to see you anymore he said abruptly i think thats funny funny thats what hed said but his face was grim marshal i dont like people telling me what i cant do he added sounding angry this time marshal please his broad chest expanded and contracted and he looked past me toward the snowy garden dont worry about it bringing his focus back into the kitchen he shifted forward to reach into a back pocket of his jeans heres your check it will be a rainy day in the everafter before they will cash it swallowing i stared at the envelope feeling unreal as i took it it was heavier than it should be and i looked inside my eyes widened two tickets to the party at the top of the carew tower i said shocked he even had them much less was giving them to me why marshal grimaced eyes on the floor i was going to ask you if you wanted to come with me to a new years eve party tonight he said but why dont you just take both tickets youre going to need a lot of ambient energy to make that charm work the top of the tower ought to be close enough my lips parted and i stared at the formal invitations in my hand i didnt know what was going on anymore jenks had said he was mad why was he helping me i cant take these he cracked his neck and backed up a step sure you can put them in your pocket and say thank you my supervisor is going to be there marshal sniffed you should meet him an uncertain smile came over my face he wanted me to meet his supervisor maybe get a picture of us together and i thought i was wicked i said eyes warming damn it hes leaving me well what did i expect marshal didnt smile back hes got red hair cant miss him gaze distant he took up his coffee its a fundraiser for the university kalamack will be there hes a major benefactor so hes always invited hes not a witch so he probably wont care if youre shunned youll have someone to talk to until someone tells him my face lost expression at the utter blankness he had given the word shunned like it meant nothing thank you i said meekly marshal im sorry i said as he reached for his coat on the back of his chair and i just about died when he put up a hand to stop me before i could get close i froze where i was feeling the hurt it was fun marshal said eyes down but then you got shunned and rachel his gaze rose to mine anger in it i like you i like your family i have fun when we get together but what pisses me off is that i let myself start to think about spending my life with you and then you go do something so stupid that it gets you shunned i dont even want to know what it was marshal i never had a choice i never had a damned choice i dont want to do this he said not letting me interrupt and trust me he said gesturing i thought hard about it really weighed what i wanted and what i was willing to give for a possible life with you i came over here ready to curse the world to try to find out who did this to you and find a way to get the shunning rescinded but then marshal gritted his teeth making his jaw muscles bunch im only going to get myself shunned i cant live outside society youre a fun beautiful fabulous woman he said as if trying to convince himself even if you do get the shunning rescinded what are you going to do next i like my life he looked at me and i blinked fast now im just angry that you cant be a part of it he finished i couldnt seem to breathe and i held the edge of the center counter to hide my vertigo no hard feelings okay he said as he turned i nodded no hard feelings i breathed marshal wasnt a bad man for wanting out he wanted to be part of something and i clearly wasnt able to put my needs aside and put ours first maybe if my life wasnt so crappy it wouldnt show as much and we could have tried but not now it wasnt his fault id screwed up and asking him to pay the price with me wasnt fair thanks marshal i whispered for everything and if you ever need help from the dark side i gestured helplessly as my throat closed call me a faint smile turned the edges of his mouth up no one else and then he was gone his steps fading as he walked away from me i heard a soft murmur as he said goodbye to the pixies and then the closing of a door numb i sank into my chair at the table eyes unseeing i pulled my spell book closer covering up the letter from the university wiping my eyes i opened it and started searching twentysix the wind funneling between the tall buildings down by the river picked up tiny bits of ice and grit and they hit my legs like pinpricks i hated nylons even black ones with glitter hunching into my dressy long felt coat i hustled after ivy head down and pace fast trying to do this charm in the parking garage would have been miserable and i was glad for the invitations if only for that but now that wed be inside jenks could come he was currently in my bag sitting on one of those hand warmers hunters use with him at my back and ivy guarding the ladies bathroom door this would be a snap that is if we got up there in time if we didnt hurry wed be in the elevator at midnight a gust of wind brought me the scent of fried vendor food and i squinted ahead to one of carew towers street entrances carew tower was right over fountain square and people were everywhere milling through the closedoff streets as both fib and is cruisers blocked the way it wasnt as bad as the solstice when they closed the circle by lottery but the uproar at midnight ought to be a big enough collective emotion to do the spell actually it was a lot like the night i had first summoned pierce trying to bring my dad back for some parental advice weather and all reminded i held my bulging bag tighter trying not to squish jenks i had everything in it id need to do the charm including a set of clothes for pierce and my splat gun beside me ivys steps were short and fast because of her heels sure are a lot of witches she said as we made our way across the street any excuse to party right i said then took a longer look she was pale in her long coat with her hair whipping in the wind and worried we make you nervous dont we she met my eyes as we stepped up onto the curb you dont i smiled thanks i understood most vampires made me nervous especially when they gathered the doorman opened the glass doors for us so we didnt have to use the revolving entryway and we entered together the cessation of the wind was a blessed relief and i immediately opened my bag you okay jenks i said peering down to find him sitting awkwardly beside the warmer freaking fantabulous he muttered tinks tampons i think my wing snapped off what are you doing out there jumping jacks stay put until we get up there i said so he wouldnt come out to prove that the echoing entryway wasnt too coldwhich it was i only have two invitations like they could stop me he said and i smiled at ivys snicker i left the bag unzipped as ivy and i clacked our feminine way to the restaurants elevator where the man in the white uniform checked our invitations and then our coats the night air from the revolving door was cold on my bare shoulders and i let my coat go with regret the doors to the elevator had been polished to a shine and i resisted the urge to adjust my nylons as i shifted to get a better appreciation of the work i had done to look like this my heels nylons and a long black dress with no shoulders and a choker neckline looked good id picked it out last week almost able to feel kisten in my thoughts as i shut out the clerks enthusiastic recommendations for something with more flash id nearly gotten the little dress that showed off my butt but id listened to kistens memory instead i looked great with my hair up off my neck in a complicated braid that had taken five of jenkss kids to do it had even held up in the wind ivy was dressed just as dramatically having pulled a bright red dress out of her closet and going from workout tights to glamorous sophisticate in ten minutes her neckline was cut low and the slit in the dress went to midthigh a lace shawl graced her shoulders i knew the shawl was for a vampires benefit more enticing around her neck than bare skin apart we looked good together we looked fantastic with her asian heritage standing as a beautiful contrast to my pale deadfish complexion an older couple smelling of too much perfume and aftershave stood ahead of us as the silver doors opened and we all got in a spike of adrenaline went through me and i shifted my lumpy bag to my front this had to work id prepped pierces substance spells in exactly the same way and i had my splat gun loaded with sleepytime charms ivy would man the bathroom door jenks would help me with al nothing would get past them and when it was over we could party the new year in together ghost vamp witch and pixy there was another doorman inside the elevator in case we didnt know how to push a button and as i nervously stood in the dead center of the small lift the hairs on the back of my neck pricked i slowly turned to see the couple who had gotten in with us the womans lips pressed tight and the man staring straight ahead with a strained look on his face i turned back around and ivy snickered youre a fun date she whispered as she leaned sideways people look at you whatever embarrassed i stared at the elevator man while he hid a grin finally the doors opened the older woman who looked good in her own right gave her husband a smack on the shoulder with her beaded handbag as they got out he took it like a man but i noticed he was already ogling the serving ladies in their modestly short skirts the murmur of conversations and the scent of highcalorie appetizers hit me first and my shoulders eased in the warmth hidden around the curve of the restaurant a live band played slow jazz the tables were gone but for a ring around the windows elegantly dressed people mingled holding little plates of food or champagne flutes the occasional feminine laugh mixing with the clinking of expensive china to invoke a feeling of high class servers moved sedately or darted about depending on what they were doing and behind it all as a backdrop was cincinnati herself forgetting myself i stood for a moment and took in the view it had been pretty during the day but now with the black of the sky and the lightsit was riveting the hollows was glittering showing the contours of the land as it rose up and away a ribbon of illumination on the expressway ran as an informal border the river was a black shadow and i could see where it had cut into the hills over the millennium a womans laugh and the flash of jenks darting from my bag drew my eyes away immediately the conversation seemed to grow loud jenks flew two circles around me to stretch his wings then landed on ivys shoulder she was staring at the city mesmerized it looks peaceful from up here she said when her line of sight was broken by a member of the waitstaff jenks snorted it looks peaceful when you get up real close too he said and i thought of my garden its only the middle ground thats ugly a woman with a tray was slowly passing and i met her eyes she smiled at jenks and handed me a little plate weve got twenty minutes i said nervous as i put a few bites of food on it jenks you want to scope out the bathrooms you got it rache he said and he was gone by the looks ivy and i were getting it was growing obvious that this was almost an office party everyone seemed to know everyone else and they were all dressed alike too elegant but a little out of dateclassy geek maybe no wonder ivy and i were getting eyed slowly we made our way onto the revolving floor balloons were netted to the ceiling for midnight and the lights were low to keep the view fabulous i didnt see anyone i recognized but it had been a long time since id been in school and id taken only one class at the university id flunked it but that was because the teacher had faked her own death before finals ivy snagged two light amber glasses as we moved she handed one to me without looking and as soon as we found the band i stopped beside a potted plant at the window there was a small dance floor and i turned when the woman started singing whats new crap it was the same band that had been playing at trents weddingrehearsal dinnerminus most of the players there were only five this time but it was her the womans voice bobbled as she caught sight of me and i looked away being recognized shouldnt cause fear nice music ivy said seeing my flush taking a deep breath she added eddens here my back to the band i stared at her edden you can smell him she smiled hes standing behind you startled i spun almost spilling my drink edden i cried as i set my glass down and took in his tux there was a thickening at his chest that told me he was wearing a sidearm in a holster but he looked great with his hair slicked back and his almost squat figure standing shoulder to shoulder with mine what are you doing here i asked working he said clearly glad to see me i see glenn got through to you thanks for coming in you look nice attention going to ivy he added both of you ivy smiled but i was flustered thats not why im here i said i told glenn no im here doing some personal spelling i didnt know this was the party you were talking about and even if i did i wouldnt be working it mia isnt going to show ivy tell him mia wont be here ivy adjusted her little clutch purse hanging on a thin strap she wont be here oh yeah that was a big help captain edden rocked back in his dress shoes to look mildly irritated he had a plate with a stuffed puff on it and showing a thinning spot in his short hair he took a bite personal spelling what is that witch speak for washing your hair i am spelling i said jenks is here somewhere ivys chaperoning i guess and my date will be along about midnight ive got his clothes in my bag eddens gaze dropped to my oversize shoulder bag that didnt match my shoes my dress or my hair i bet you do he said dryly clearly still upset id turned him down then showed up at the same party he wanted me to come to with him well he said as he wiped his fingers on his napkin and set his plate aside if you arent here for mia then im going to guess your personal spelling involves trent i shook my head and he sighed rachel dont make me arrest you tonight trent has nothing to do with this i said as i watched ivy mentally map out the floor and mia isnt going to be here your profilers are way off shes not worried about you bringing her in shes fighting her own personal war with ms walker and edden you need to back off and let things cool down you hire me for my opinion well there it is dont you have one of those amulets i gave you its blank isnt it edden frowned telling me it was his eyes scanned everywhere with the skill and patience of the military officer hed once been after the incident at astons three independent profilers put mia here or at another highly visible party he said as if not having heard me well catch her with or without your help enjoy your evening ms morgan jenks ivy his last words though dry held a hint of anxiety and my instincts kicked in hows glenn i asked and eddens jaw clenched ivy saw it too and when jenks flew up we all faced him square on not letting him leave my god you didnt put glenn back on duty did you i looked over the edge of the windows to the party below and the fib cruisers is he down there at fountain square with his compromised aura edden are you crazy i told you im not ready to face a banshee and glenn sure as hell isnt ivy set her plate down and eddens squat form shifted uncomfortably hes fine hes got one of those amulets and he knows what she looks like the minute she shows he calls lower your voice my pulse quickened and i put my face right by eddens he is not fine i almost hissed and im not so sure those amulets are all working feeling the tension rise ivy gave us a professional smile rachel its getting stuffy in here she said pleasantly im going to go downstairs and get some air jenks you got this okay tinks panties yes he said as he landed on my shoulder protectively my breath slipped out in relief shed watch him good i didnt think mia would show but she sure as hell wouldnt be up here jenks and i could handle al pierce if he wasnt hurt could help too my son is fine edden said his brow furrowed and his posture hunched i like watching fine men ivy said and checking that her phone was on she slid it away in her clutch purse and started for the elevator youre the one who wanted us to work the party ill be downstairs call me if you need me edden took that with a bad grace muttering you do the same i have a warrant for both of them now she nodded and sashayed off not three steps away and two guys approached her dont do it i mentally warned them but she laughed like the happy woman shed never be and the two men thought they had it made they were going to be made all right made into happy little burgers if they werent careful i want to talk to ivy before she goes jenks said spilling heavy dust as he hovered beside me be nice to trent okay youre going to need his help someday trent i asked stiffening at the faint scent of wine and cinnamon jenks inclined his head to someone behind me before darting off to join ivy in the elevator and edden and i turned my jaw clenched and i forced my teeth apart it was trent and oh my god he looked good hi trent i said wryly as i tried not to show my appreciation as hard as that was seeing him in a slim tux that showed off his height and frame the fabric looked silky and free moving making me want to run my hand down his shoulder just to feel it a sharp professionallooking tie with a pattern that said he wasnt uptight gave the impression of a clever witty man but it was his bearing that made it all work he had a nearly full wineglass in hand and he was clearly comfortably in control with no doubts about who he was and what he wantedand how to get it feeling his eyes on me i stood a little straighter and remembered how good we had looked together the night kisten had blown up the casino boat wed been on kisten hadnt known we were on it but thanks to ivys warning trent and i had survived wed been the only two to do so my brow furrowed as i considered that we had gotten out of the everafter together as well we were survivors trent saw my frown and the cocky boyish front that he used to beguile grew stilted he touched his babyfine hair to make sure it was lying flat and i knew he was nervous ms morgan he said saluting me with his glass so i wouldnt shake his hand that just ticked me off and i wasnt happy hed been keeping ceri away from me like i was the plague even if i was weve shared a cell in the everafter i said i think we ought to be on a firstname basis dont you a single pale eyebrow rose theyre dressing the help nicely this year he said and edden disguised a laugh as a cough it was all i could do to not give the fib captain a backhanded swat the distinctive click and whine of a shutter snapping pulled my head around and i froze it was the cincinnati enquirer the photographer looking odd dressed in a fulllength sequined gown with two cameras draped over her councilman kalamack she said enthusiastically can i get a picture of you the lady and captain edden together edden shifted closer hiding a smile as he muttered for me alone she aint no lady shes my witch stop that i whispered then i stiffened as trent sidled closer slipping his hand about my waist so that his fingers would show for the camera it was possessive and i didnt like it smile ms morgan the woman said brightly you might make the front page swell trents touch was light compared to eddens heavy pressure on my shoulder i sucked in my gut and turned a little sideways to put my back to trent to balance out his hand on my waist he smelled like the outdoors the shutter clicked several times and i stiffened when i spotted quen trents bodyguard watching jenks zipped over us to talk to quen and the woman snapped another picture when his dust glittered upon us my tension eased jenks was back wonderful the photographer said as she looked at the back of the camera thank you enjoy the party always a pleasure to talk to the press trent said as he started drifting away the woman looked up captain edden if i could get a picture of you and the dean of the university i promise ill leave you alone after that edden gave me a severe look that told me to behave myself then smiled benevolently as he talked to the woman about the fibs annual fundraiser while she led him away trent was gazing at nothing in the hope that either i would go away or someone would come rescue him but the photographer had given everyone the idea that we were here together and they were leaving us alone i wanted to talk to him about a pandora charm to possibly return my memory but i couldnt come right out and ask cocking my hip i tapped my heel once then turned to him how is ceri he hesitated and still not looking at me he said fine his voice was beautiful and i nodded as if waiting for more when he remained silent i added my calls are being stopped at the switchboard he didnt even twitch ill look into it his eyes were mocking when they met mine and then he started to walk away trent i said as i jumped to keep up with him dont touch me morgan he said without moving his lips waving pleasantly at someone across the room jenks made a noise of affronted surprise and angry i got in front of trent the man rocked to a halt clearly bothered trent i said as my heart pounded this is stupid again his eyebrows rose high you are a demon if i could id have you jailed on that alone shunning is hardly justice my expression became stiff but i wasnt surprised he knew id been shunned take me down and you go with me eh i said as jenks landed on my shoulder in support trent smiled mirthlessly thats about it im not a demon i protested softly aware of the people around us the man sniffed as if smelling something rank youre close enough for me he started to push by me again and i muttered it was your dads fault at that he jerked to a stop ooooh jenks mocked sparkles sifting down my front as his wings made a draft dont you talk about my daddy he saved your life trent said clearly affronted it was a mistake that cost him his own my father didnt make you you were born what you are and if you need any more proof just look at who you settled into an apprenticeship with i felt that keenly but i swallowed my anger id been trying to talk to him for months to clear the air but he wouldnt take my calls wouldnt let me talk to ceri this might be my last chance to explain myself you just dont get it do you i said leaning close since my words were barely above a whisper and jenks took off i did what i did to save your life laying claim to you was the only way to get you out of there and to do that i had to agree to a very tight tie to al tight tie he mocked under his breath youre his student i did it to save your damned freaking life my knees were shaking and i locked them i dont expect any thanks from you as youre so irritatingly unable to thank anyone when they do something youre afraid to do but stop taking your guilt or shame out on me i was done and kissing goodbye my chance at getting a pandoras charm or him to understand i turned my back on him and stomped to the window the restaurant had shifted and i was looking right down at the square damn it why wouldnt he at least listen the familiar wing hum of jenks brought my head up and i wiped an eye an instant before he landed on my shoulder again you have a way with him dont you the pixy said i sniffed wiping my eyes look at that i muttered the bastard made me cry jenkss wings made a cool spot on my neck want me to pixy him no but now i dont have the chance of a ghosts fart in a windstorm to get that pandora charm thats not really what was bothering me though it was trent why did i even care what he thought the soft scuff of a shoe on flat carpet and jenkss soft oath brought me around shocked to see trent he had a glass in his hand and he extended it heres your water he said loudly his jaw clenched i looked him up and down wondering what the devil was going on behind him quen was doing his security thing arms crossed and expression severe it was obvious that quen had made him come over sighing i took the glass turning to look out the window in the attempt to divorce myself from everything i needed to find a quiet place out of the way jenks could you see if the bathroom is clear the pixys wings buzzed a warning but he lifted from my shoulder sure rache in an instant he was gone leaving in his path delighted coos of sound from some of the older ladies i dont have anything to say to you right now i said softly to trent trent shifted to stand shoulder to shoulder with me together we looked over the edge to the mass of people down below i should have just taken my chances in the parking garage as i had originally planned this was starting to have all the signs of one of my famous backfires i dont have anything to say to you either trent said but tension was showing i could play this game id already lost so it didnt matter you need a pandora charm the man said casually and i jerked cripes he heard me pretending indifference i breathed on the glass to fog it up yes trent put a shoulder against the glass and faced me thats a rare branch of magic why does he have to be so insufferably smug i know elven my mother says he was silent while the band took a break tell me what you need to remember and maybe ill look into it id been down this path with him before and had gotten burned every time i didnt want to owe him anything but what harm would it do if he knew sighing i faced him thinking that leaning against the window like that looked really dangerous im trying to remember who killed kisten felps trents jaw unclenched it was a small move but i caught it i thought youd want to remember something from the makeawish camp or your father he said i looked out the window again they had a band down there ivy was probably having a lot more fun than me what if it was i whispered i might have said yes behind us the party continued excitement growing as the serving people started distributing champagne for the upcoming toasts my eyes searched the ceiling for jenks i had to move no one would be in the ladies restroom when the clock ticked over nervous i tightened my grip on my bag what do you want trent i asked trying to hurry this up you wouldnt offer if you didnt want something other than me dead that is he smiled with half his mouth then became serious how do you figure i want something im just curious as to what makes you tick my head tilted and for the first time all night i felt in control youve approached me twice youve touched your hair three times you had a drink in your hand when we had our picture taken that will be a first if it goes to press youre nervous and upset not thinking clearly trents face lost all expression he dropped his head as if in irritation and when he pulled it back up there was a new tightness to his eyes he glanced at quen and the older man shrugged is it ceri i asked mocked almost his brow furrowed and he looked out the window you want to know what she really thinks of you still he said nothing and i felt a sloppy smile come over me hiding it i took a sip of water and set it on the tiny railing slowly it started to move away as the restaurant turned you wont like what i say i dont like a lot of things i sighed i couldnt do this to him i really couldnt much as i would like to see trent hurt betraying ceris trust was not going to happen i didnt think he had a pandora charm anyway ask ceri shell tell you a pretty story that will save your pride okay so i wasnt above a little dig rachel he was reaching out and i pulled back a step dont touch me i said coldly jenks flew up the glow of his dust reflected in the black glass he hovered uncertainly and he tapped his wrist like hed seen ivy do when we were running late he had his sword bared and though it looked like a shiny olive pick it could be deadly my pulse jumped it was almost time if you will excuse me i said tightly i have to use the little girls room happy new year trent without a backward glance i walked away my head high and my bag in my grip jenks landed on my shoulder almost immediately get on the elevator he said and curiosity filled me people were getting out of my way with whispers and stares but i didnt care elevator i echoed why whats wrong he took off flying backward so i could see him grin nothing theres a maintenance floor where they store the tables i wouldnt have been able to find it if they hadnt left the key wedged atop the frame holding the inspection notice he grinned i sat on it when i took ivy downstairs arms swinging i smiled at the elevator man as i entered the lift and with no regret shoved him out with a wellplanted foot the poor guy hit the carpet facefirst his loud complaint cutting off as the doors shut excited i held my hand out and the key dropped into it thanks jenks i said as i keyed the panel and hit the button he indicated i dont know what i would do without you probably die he said grinning maybe i could pull this off yet twentyseven the elevator hardly moved dropping a floor before the silver doors slid apart to show a dark lowceilinged entryway jenks i said as i edged to the opening lit by the elevator itself are you sure about this the hum of his wings rose over the faint sound of machinery as he lifted off from my shoulder ill get the lights hit the button for the lobby before you come out so it looks like you left okay i did what he said and his faint glow darted out and was lost there was undoubtedly a camera in the elevator but jenks wouldve taken care of it i followed the pixys sifting dust holding my bag more tightly to me it was cooler down here not like outside but worrisome jenks i called hearing my voice come back from hard walls and surfaces you okay with this temp there were chairs stacked up everywhere with a wide path leading out low carpet i didnt think the floor was moving but if it was like upstairs there would be only a ring of mobile floor moving with the steady pace of an hour hand jenkss faint voice came back tinks panties youre worse than my mother rache im just saying its cold the chairs gave way to tables stacked surface to surface i moved to an open spot before the bare black windows it had the same view as the restaurant above and i could see fountain square if i pressed my head to the glass we werent moving but the grinding of machinery was loud maybe it was too noisy to use this level found the lights jenks shouted and with that as warning bright light flashed into existence from the recessed fixtures overhead i jerked shrinking down below the level of the windows uh is there a dimmer all of cincinnati can see me immediately the lights went out and before i could stand jenkss wings were humming by my ear no sorry you want me to keep looking squinting to see with my lightblinded vision i fumbled for a chair stacked on an upsidedown table no theres enough ambient light i said ill just do this by the window he shook himself to light a small circle and i set the chair in it dropping my bag on top a second chair went beside it and a third about five feet to the side whats our time look like i asked tension knotting my stomach as i dug in my bag finally my eyes readjusted jenks landed on the back of the chair i recognized the pattern of brocade from having sat on it only yesterday less than two minutes why do i always cut these things so darn close i said dropping a pair of jeans on the chair beside me the eightyearold memory of pierce naked in the snow rose up in my thoughts and i forced it away setting the rest of his clothes there as well the shoes had come from ivy and they smelled like vampire i hadnt asked id just said thank you my splat gun topped the pile and moms redandwhite cruciblestone went on the chair across from me pulse quickening i set the three bottles on the window ledge almost ready i ran my hands down my dress to dry my palms despite it being chilly i was starting to sweat and in this dress it was going to show okay i cant make a protective circle so youre going to have to keep yourself intact i told jenks the pixys wings blurred into invisibility give me a freaking break a sigh slipped from me when al shows get yourself out of sight until he agrees to leave people with me alone got it jenks looked at me sure whatever like i believed that time i asked half a minute the bottles clinked as i chose one and jenks flew to the window looking down at fountain square as i twisted the groundglass stopper out and poured the liquid into the crucible the tinkling of the potion drew jenks back and hovering so that the draft from his wings shifted the surface he said it doesnt smell like it worked he looked worried and i remembered the failed locator charms i have to invoke it when they all start singing gotcha reassured he lit on the back of the chair and hes going to be naked yup i rolled the finger stick between my thumb and forefinger waiting man i hoped i did this right if i could get al to agree to this it would be the first time id gotten anything from him without leaving a bit of my soul behind from above i could hear the faint whisper of a countdown the concrete and machinery between us making the enthusiastic shouting hardly audible ten seconds i snapped the top to the finger stick and pricked my finger the sharp jab was a jolt and i massaged the tip wait for it jenks admonished waaaait for itnow heart pounding i let one two and then three drops of blood into the crucible think happy thoughts i whispered as jenks flew to me and we both waited for the redwood scent that would tell me if i had done the spell right like a wave the warm scent rolled out there it is jenks said brightly then his expression lit by his own dust faded i backed up from the chair okay id done it now wed see if i was as smart as we all hoped i was holy crap the pixy said as the liquid started to spontaneously steam my pulse quickened and i picked up my splat gun al was going to be pissed if this didnt get his attention nothing would let me know when you smell burnt amber okay i muttered but jenks was fascinated hovering between me and the rising mist unseen but for the faint dust slipping from him here he comes the pixy said excitedly and i got behind one of the chairs somewhere in the spell the dust was being used to give pierce material to form his temporary body around the mist started to take on a more human silhouette in the faint ambient light every second he looked more there i didnt know what kind of shape he was going to be in al couldve beaten him badly by now i was going to have my hands full with al and wouldnt be able to help pierce jenks get back i demanded and the pixy zipped to me and away again the mist was thickening and jenks swore as the misty shape seemed to shrink an inch all aroundand suddenly pierce was there his bare feet standing on the brocade fabric with his head near the ceiling facing away from me naked as a jaybird the man spun holding on to the back of the chair as he turned his eyes lit on me and he let go of the chair wobbling as he covered himself holy manure he said tossing his head to get the black tangle of hair out of his eyes his face creased in what looked like anger id be of a mind to know what the devil are you doing mistress witch jenks rose up his sword bared you scrawny ungrateful piece of crap jenks i shouted breathing deep for any sign of al as i leaned over the chair and tossed pierce the clothes he caught them with one hand and in a smooth motion he jumped to the floor putting his back to me as he fumbled to put the pants on i was scanning the dark cluttered floor for demonsign but jenks was more interested in pierce shocking the man as he flew to face him shedding bright sparkles were saving your ass thats what were doing he said and the correct vernacular is holy shit adrenaline spiked when i caught a whiff of burnt amber but it was coming from pierce the solid ghost was shoving his legs into the pants not bothering with the underwear i couldnt help but noticeeven in the darkthat they were nice legs strongly muscled used to work as if feeling my eyes on him he turned trying to get the zipper up what are you doing he said clearly aghast i opine that its not your responsibility to save me i can take care of myself still no al good i said anxious because in about three seconds al is going to show up and you need to take care of your own ass im going to be busy get behind me and stay out of the way okay pierce gave up on the zipper and snatched a white collared shirt up from the floor you rescued me without a plan he said his oldworld accent making him sound exotic as he shoved his arms into the sleeves and started buttoning it up this is a powerful fix nohow around it of course i have a plan but rescuing you wasnt the point i said affronted its the catalyst get behind me pierce grabbed the shoes and halfhopped beside me as he put one on his shirt was untucked to hide his open zipper the socks too he had ignored you didnt rescue me then not really do tell he said sounding almost unhappy his angular thin face was wearing disappointment as he got his last shoe on and looked up in the dim light i could see his dark hair was mussed and his narrow chin smooth though his blue eyes looked innocent i knew behind them was a devious mind clever and wicked and he was looking at me damn it to the turn and back stop it rachel pierce im sorry can we talk about this after i take care of al he stood matching my height after he questioned i looked over the dark storage room gripping my gun tighter as i started to sweat al wouldnt talk to me and pulling you out from under him was the only way i could think of to force the issue will you get behind me i cant tap a line or set a circle my aura is too thin youre taking on a demon with a thin aura i cant commune with the everafter either are you plum mad from above us jenks muttered i ask myself that at least three times a week his expression going empty pierce looked up at jenks unknown thoughts sifting behind his blue eyes looking black in the dim light from the windows im not taking him on i said as i scanned for signs of al im talking to him thick eyebrows furrowing pierce took a breath to say something my eyes narrowed but he stopped holding his breath as if listening to something i couldnt hear jenkss wings hit a higher pitch and the skin on the back of my neck crawled rache jenks had his sword out as he revolved in midair hes coming make yourself scarce jenks i mean it with a boom of sound the air pressure shifted my instinctive hunch straightened my eyes going first to the quivering windows and then the new shadow standing before us in the open space in one quick lurch pierce was beside me al was here about freaking time student al shouted his red goatslitted eyes glowing as he looked over his smoked glasses he was poised in anger his velvet coat and lace looking ominous against the black windows seeing pierce his jaw clenched there you are you little runt we had an agreement it wasnt me pierce shouted indignantly she did it he added pointing as he took three steps away agreement i thought as jenks started swearing she did it al i can explain i said even as i leveled my gun at him i wanted to talk to him but i wasnt going to be stupid about it you slimy little slug jenks was saying hovering over us to light the scene als growl of annoyance was loud and his whitegloved hands clenched i am going to pulp one or both of you he said in a low voice pride that i had snatched pierce mixed with a healthy dose of fear adrenaline was running and i felt alive i thought id kicked this particular high but apparently not al made a grab for pierce and i jerked him back jenks darted up and the shadows grew darker youre mine little runt al intoned the longer it takes the longer youre going to suffer mistress witch summoned me he said defiantly i have until sunrise before i am obliged to return i had a bad feeling about this it sounded as if pierce had already made a deal with al and worse that he was comfortable with it damn it i did it again i told you rache jenks said as i shoved pierce behind me and the pixy dropped down im sorry but i told you i dont have time for this al growled he gestured and pierce seized falling to the flat carpet in convulsions at my heels hey i shouted shifting to stand so al couldnt just scoop him up do you not see this gun ive got knock it off al im trying to talk to you al wasnt listening a black haze pulsing as he clenched his whitegloved hands together and pierce groaned tightening into a ball this was so not working al if you dont knock it off and pay attention to me im going to plug you i threatened his red eyes flicked to mine you wouldnt dare i squeezed the trigger al dove for the side falling into a roll and landing on his feet facing me behind me pierce gasped i missed on purpose i shouted stop tormenting pierce and talk to me rachel rachel rachel al said from the dark his low voice making me shudder that was a mistake my itchy witch never taking my eyes off the incensed demon i fumbled for pierce helping him up you okay as a summer day in the meadow he breathed heavily wiping his face jenks hovered between al and me his face ugly let al have him rache hes slug slime you heard him hes already got a deal going like i dont this isnt about pierce i said tightly its about al snagging people i turned to the demon and youre going to listen to me you should listen to the pixy al said pulling the lace from his sleeves before making a backward kick to send six tables sliding into the distant wall like dominoes if you were wise youd throw that pile of refuse to me and beg for leniency hes going to kill you the shakes were starting and i pushed pierce farther behind me soon as al got him they would be gone and i wanted to talk to al pierce isnt going to hurt me i quavered and al smiled his blocky teeth catching a glint of ambient light tell him what you are itchy witch doubt filled me seeing it al reclined against a table slowly i lowered my gun i just want to talk to you why are you making this so dramatic hes going to betray you al prophesied taking a step closer and my gun came up again why should he be any different from any other man i said jenks made a tiny huff and hearing it pierce turned his expression sour if you would give me a hooter of a moment i could explain yeah ill bet i said then more charitable i added later okay i want to talk to al i focused on the demon thats the only reason i snatched him the only reason i affirmed when jenks buzzed his disagreement seeing al listening i eased my posture al you cant snatch people when youre checking up on me its not fair wahh wahh wahh he mocked snapping his fingers in an unusual showmanship he vanished jenkss wings clattered a warning ah rache hes not gone really you think i whispered then spun when pierce made a choking sound damn it al i shouted falling back in frustration upon seeing that the demon had pierce by the neck his feet dangling three inches above the floor this one is already mine he snarled bringing pierce close to his face let me jump you to a line worm a year in my oubliette will teach you not to stray it wasnt me he gasped his face going purple in the dim light she spelled me here thats how we met pierce forced out whenshewaseightteen his last words warbled as he shook and i was seriously wondering how much damage even a solid ghost could take al stop it i said putting my gun down and tugging on als velveteenhidden arm i wouldnt have even taken him if you hadnt ignored me and picked up your damned line i just want to talk to you will you listen to me this is for your own good the demon said eyeing me from over his glasses pierce still hanging in his grip hell kill you rachel i dont freaking care knock it off and pay attention to me pierce gurgled and als focus became distant nervous i let go of his arm and backed up into jenkss dust you didnt rescue him to be your boyfriend al asked shifting his bloodsmeared whitegloved fingers around pierces throat no i exclaimed glancing at jenks why does everyone think hes my boyfriend pierce collapsed as al dropped him the demon stepped elegantly over the crumpled man and i backed to the window as elegant swearwords in an oldworld accent spilled out from the downed witch jenkss eyes widened the pixy clearly impressed al was looking at me in disbelief not your lover no but he is rachel candy al said his confusion too honest to be faked behind him on his hands and knees pierce pulled his head up his blue eyes were vivid and his hair was mussed go to hell you cant kill me until im alive looks like i can make you hurt though al said and pierce clenched into a ball my neck started to sweat okay al was here he was listening al i said loudly trying to get the demons attention back on me as he leaned over pierce and poked him we need to talk about you snagging people you need to stop it not only is it going to get me worse than shunned but do you really want to be known as the demon who snatches instead of the demon who cleverly outwits stupid humans and inderlanders come on this is your reputation were talking about on the floor pierce took a heaving breath of air and relaxed as al quit whatever he was doing to him and straightened you cant have this one here he said neither can you let him go pierces eyes met mine mistress witchthere are things you dont understand if you could only allow it in yourself to let me explain al put a foot on his neck and pierce choked jenks flew down from the unseen rafters his dust lighting the small space it doesnt make a difference i said my thoughts going to nick and his belief that you can outsmart demons and wondering how he was doing we all do what we have to in order to survive its up to me to become involved or not and im not im sorry rache jenks whispered a thick smirk was on als lips dali wouldnt help you eh i didnt ask him no al questioned and he pulled his foot from pierces neck i shrugged though it was hard to see in the dark why bother him when i can talk to you demon to student cocking my hip i made sure he could see my silhouette before the lighter darkness of the window the only student in five thousand years yours not dalis worried jenks began dusting even more heavily lighting a small space al made a small noise in thought you wouldnt he said confidently but there was doubt my heart pounded and i gave him a mocking look i doubt he could see it but my posture was clear enough behind al pierce opened one eye finding mine immediately there was defiance in him yet helpless as he was strong beyond belief but needing my help damn it he was classic rachel bait i only snatched him to get your attention i said now that ive got it this is what i want damn my dame al shouted hands raised to the ceiling i knew it not another list jenks had let a burst of light go in his surprise and in the new glow i held up a finger number one i said dont you ever not pick up when im trying to get in touch with you i dont call unless its important so answer your line okay al brought his attention back down from the ceiling you really dont want to have sex with him why whats wrong with him i flushed and held up a second finger two i want a little respect stop hurting people with me and no more snatching respect al huffed too bad so sad respect needs to be earned and you havent given me anything to buy it from me behind him pierce edged away but before he could gain his feet al jabbed his foot backward and the witch went sprawling respect i echoed you think i still need to earn your respect how about me not summoning you even when i wanted to talk to you how about me knowing all your friends names and not summoning them how about me not working with them so they can get their own bloody familiars i could walk away from you and go to any of them at any time done leaving him was an empty threat but because i had snatched pierce from him with no ley line magic and limited resources he was listening i didnt want another teacher maybe i should tell him that the light from jenkss last dusting had faded and i couldnt see als face he wasnt moving though three i said softly i want to stay your student you probably want to keep it that way too huh dont push me on this al ill leave and i dont want to pierce looked riven and als expression became unreadable taking a breath i focused on alwho had been listening intently so whats it going to be are you going to be nice or naughty in a smooth motion al swooped toward pierce grabbing him by the shirtfront and hoisting him up sorry about that little runt he said zipping up his pants and arranging his collar in motions so fast that it left pierce shocked and scrambling terrible misunderstanding he gave pierce a smack on the back to send him stumbling face red pierce caught his balance and pushed als hands off him stiff with pride he turned his back on us as he tugged his clothes back where they should be ran a hand over his hair and then turned around i wouldnt look at him jenks had moved closer to me in the fast exchange and he hovered suspiciously i wasnt satisfied though and i stayed where i was my back to the window so you agree no snatching smacking killing or scaring people with me i want to hear it this one doesnt count al said its not retroactive good god this is an addiction i exclaimed but seeing id pushed him far enoughand that he and pierce already seemed to have an agreementi nodded say it i insisted pierce was edging away from al the motion wasnt lost on the demon and he jerked him back i wont snatch harm or scare to death people with you or use checking up on you as an excuse to cause trouble youre worse than my mother rachel mine too jenks muttered thank you i said formally i was shaking inside id done it id freaking done it and it hadnt cost me my soul or a mark or anything hallelujah she can be taught al gave pierce a shove away and strolled closer to me i tensed then relaxed putting my gun away i could smell the burnt amber flowing from him and jenks hovered backward sword hefted as if ready to throw it i didnt move numb as al sidled up alongside me and together we eyed pierce nervous under our combined scrutiny if you give him a body he said lightly i will kill him i looked at al his eyes didnt look strange anymore and it scared me i dont know that curse i said blandly als jaw clenched and released he will eventually try to kill you rachel let me save you the trouble of killing him in turn tired i started tucking things away the empty bottle the crucible the used finger stick my hands were shaking and i made a fist pierce isnt going to kill me you got that right al and jenks said simultaneously tell him what you are itchy witch al added after a wary look at the pixy see what happens pierce had been in my church for almost a year i doubted very much he didnt know what i was it was only just after midnight but i was ready to go home why dont you leave before someone recognizes you i said as jenks landed on my shoulder my adrenaline was gone and i was cold in my little black dress i looked around but apart from the two bottles of potion still on the sill there was nothing of mine except pierce standing stoically by the window trying not to look naive as he gazed down at the streets of cincinnati full of people partying im already shunned thanks to you i finished a beautiful smile came over the demon and looking at me from over his smoked glasses he said leave but it is such a spectacular night that smile still on his face he strode to the window and picked up my potion bottles i held out my hand for them as he lifted them to the faint light and squinted you made more than one potion to give him substance al asked and when i said nothing he cracked one of the seals and breathed nice presentation he murmured then slid them into a jacket pocket hey those are mine i protested jolted out of my complacency jenks launched himself off my shoulder but pierce gave me what was almost a nasty look as if i should have known better and was being stupid al didnt even bother to acknowledge me as i stood with my arms crossed over my middle and sulked in a dropdead gorgeous dress underneath cincinnatis premier restaurant these are mine he finally said youre my student and i can claim anything you make i jumped when i suddenly became aware that pierce was behind me he gave me a heartfelt look trying to take my hands as he said rachel might i have a word with you my heart is breaking to explain ill bet i said sourly pulling my hands away why dont you vamoose so al will go with you and leave me the hell alone ill allow that this looks powerful suspicious he admitted and anyone would be in a fine pucker but you yourself have a mind to deal with the devil spawn upon occasion i have until sunrise to convince you that im honorable he looked at al you agreed to no snatching i have until sunrise al gestured grandly if you must but im not leaving you alone with her my eyebrows rose and even jenks made a tiny squeak of a sound whoa boys i have plans tonight and they dont include a demon and a ghost yeah jenks launched himself from my shoulder and hovered to brighten the area we got reservations at the warehouse he flitted to the window and looked down staying in flight and dusting heavily sounds like fun al said rubbing his whitegloved hands together pierce get the lift no way i shouted pierce will you just go i can talk to you next week the mans jaw was set as he ducked out from under als attempt to shove him to the elevator and he straightened saying ill not be moseyin until i have a chance to settle this and that is all im saying about it i sighed leaning back against the cold window with my butt on that narrow sill the last thing i needed was to put this circus on rails fine i said sourly crossing my ankles im listening al started pouting unable to leave and cause mischief lest pierce kill me i suppose more likely it was to keep the witch from telling me something that al didnt want me to know seeing me listening pierce took a breath he really didnt need his arms fell to his sides as he exhaled and his expressive face softened into one of persuasion uh guys jenks said hovering at the window fountain square is on fire what i jumped to my feet and turned in one motion al rushed to the window and we pressed our foreheads to the glass looking down jenks between us from overheard the groaning of machinery became loud and obvious faint calls were sifting down through the concrete or perhaps vibrating through the glass i could imagine that the entire party upstairs was now leaning against the glass as we were it was hard to see but jenks was right the stage was on fire people were gathering in the street from beside me pierce said i thought that was what it was supposed to look like shit ivy was down there and glenn i gotta go i said turning to the elevator my phone rang and i jerked to a stop it wouldnt work in the elevator the little screen lit up and al peered over my shoulder its ivy i said my relief obvious ivy i called as i flipped the phone open and the sound of screams and sirens filtered out i need you she said loudly over the chaos your locator amulets just lit up mia is here i stood at the window and looked down jenks says theres a fire i said she hesitated and then calmly said oh yes the stage is burning rachel im watching glenn but if he gets too close to a banshee crap got it i started walking to the elevator jenks hovering close so he could hear both ends of the conversation i think the walker is calling mia out ivy added and i punched the button for the lift im on my way breathless and fidgety i closed the phone and jammed it in my bag wheres the stupid elevator im not going to run down thirty flights of stairs al cleared his throat and i spun around just now remembering them oh uh pierce i said feeling myself warm im sorry i have to go al jiggled the mans elbow beaming from ear to ear this is going to be entertaining ive never watched rachel work apart from when she was working on me of course entertaining pierce slid away from him you have an almighty odd vision of entertainment demon i told you to call me al he said looking at his blurry reflection and adjusting his lace jenkss features scrunched up in annoyance and i rubbed my forehead i could not take the two of them down into fountain square pierce didnt have a coat and althanks to a couple of news shots the entirety of cincinnati knew his face pierce cant we do this another time i asked distracted where is the damn elevator i thought hitting the call button again my elbow smacking into it with undue force but pierce inclined his head dropping back to give me a half bow his eyes never leaving mine as he almost smiled his look reminded me of the night we had met racing off to save a young girl from a vampire he had liked my fiery spirit and clearly things hadnt changed i had though you summoned me mistress witch whether by intent or secondary purpose im not leaving until i have a chance to explain swell al straightened as the elevator dinged behind me im staying with him he affirmed peachy keen the elevator doors opened and jenks whistled long and slow tinks contractual hell he whispered and i turned to see who al was making bunnyeared kisskiss gestures to unbelieving i started shaking my head trent this isnt what it looks like the young man had pressed himself to the back of the elevator his terror showing for an instant before he pulled himself together and decided that if he was going to die he might as well do it looking good this just keeps getting better and better jenks said and i pushed the call button again well take the next one i said smiling plenty of room the demon exclaimed and my heels clattered on the steel frame of the door when al shoved me trent fended me off pressing into a corner as pierce and al followed me in jenks rose up high to sit on the top of the controls his feet tapping the screen that showed what floor we were on i do not believe this trent said his unbreakable composure shattered rachel you are unbelievable believe it you little cookie maker jenks chimed out and then to pierce hit the close button will you pierce we dont have all day pierce didnt have a clue and jenks flew down and hit the button feet first the doors slid shut and we started to drop holy shit pierce exclaimed pressing into the opposite corner and clutching the rail were falling i slid away from his suddenly green face bumping trent the elevator wasnt that big and everyone was giving al lots of room as he hummed the theme song todr zhivago summoning your demon at the top of carew tower trent hissed in my ear peeved i shifted a little more to stand between him and al im trying to make the world a little safer i muttered then beamed as al looked at us my smile fading the instant the demon looked away hes not abducting you is he turning you into a toad my voice was getting louder ive got this under control i smacked the lobby button praying we didnt stop anywhere between here and there there was no way this elevator could go fast enough you will be jailed for this trent was saying still having kittens in the corner nonsense al polished his glasses with another bit of red cloth im here to party on this side of the lines eat a little something but mostlyhe looked at me and put his glasses back onim here to keep our itchy witch from killing herself with an ashtoflesh spell jenkss wings buzzed in the sudden silence and i turned to trent the man was pale and his hair was in disarray but he was staring at al and me his eyes flicked to pierce whitefaced in the corner and he said you can bring the dead to life thats black magic not at all al protested grandly where do you think our itchy witch found this tricky little runt of a bastard he gave pierce a shove and the witch gagged hes a ghost the demon sniffed cant you smell the little worms on him my head thumped into the wall this was so not going well youre a ghost trent said and pierce shakily extended his hand from his corner gordian pierce coven of moral and ethical standards you are sir youre what i exclaimed my face warming al started laughing and jenks dropped down to my shoulder jenks tickled my ear almost getting smacked rache he hissed isnt that the coven that got you shunned i nodded and he added maybe he can get your shunning rescinded i thought about that having been buried in blasphemed ground and dealing with demons didnt stand well in his favor but he had worked for the coven of moral and ethical standards they were kind of like the is once a member always a member you couldnt retire but you could die trent shook his hand looking positively stunned ah im trent kalamack ceo of pierce jerked his hand from trent and pushed himself straight kalamack industries he said expression twisted as he wiped his hand on his pants i knew your father i do not freaking believe this i said shifting to stand where i could see both of them al beamed amazing who you can meet in an elevator he said and trent eyed me you have a charm to bring the dead to life and its white the elf stated i took a breath to answer and al interrupted smoothly and its for sale at apprentice rates no guarantees i have two right here he said patting his coat pocket its temporary the curse to give them a lasting body is a far sight trickier someone has to die you see id imagine that would make them black but you dont seem to worry about killing people for your own ends do you trenton aloysius kalamack he said with a simper funny how you call my witch black when you kill for profit and she kills he hesitated in mock thought why she hasnt killed anyone who didnt ask her to imagine that color spotted trents cheeks i dont kill for profit from the corner pierce muttered you kill for progress if youre anything like your father as one we all looked at pierce the elevator dinged and our attention was diverted as the doors opened splendid a fire al cried cheerfully striding out into the noisy crowd that had filled the downstairs lobby the smell of smoke hit me and i lurched to follow not wanting al to get out of my sight it was crowded as people in evening gowns and suits talked loudly mixing with people in jeans and heavy coats coming in to get warm but not ready to leave or perhaps they couldnt with the streets blocked off trying to watch al and pierce both i shuffled over to the coat clerk pierces hand landed on my arm as i extended my ticket and i spun almost smacking him best stay away from that one mistress witch his father was a devil on earth the dead witch said his eyes going to trent no kidding who should i believe a ghost or my dad my dad was a good man wasnt he he wouldnt work for the devil on earth would he confused i took my coat and scanned the crowd for als velveteen one seeing quen i gave trents security a little shrug to try to tell him everything was okay and to keep him from going into battle mode when he saw al the demon had once mauled trent trent was making his way to quen his pace slow for being recognized and delayed i pointed him out to quen and the security officer jumped into motion his employers coat over his arm i finally spotted al by the doors chatting up a pair of twins wearing baby bonnets for the years end and i unzipped my bag inside jenks i offered as i went to rescue the twins and the pixy dropped down cold and probably ready for that hand warmer i knew it killed him being shoved in a bag like this but he had no choice and as i zipped it up i vowed to be very careful with him tonight i shuffled into my coat as we went jerking from pierces reach when he tried to help me ive got this okay i said then winced when al grabbed my shoulder pinching me into submission as he helped me into my coat let go i demanded but my options were limited by the crowd my last arm went sliding into the cold sleeve and al leaned in reaching over my shoulders to fasten my top button i admire the way you are breaking trent al whispered from behind me his whitegloved fingers moving to my chin to force my gaze to trent and quen so slow like melting ice and with his own pride masterful i didnt know you had it in you rachel pain gets old after a time but its faster and profit is the name of the game unless youre making art im not breaking him i said softly as al backed up and i shifted my shoulders to get my coat to hang right trent and quen were leaving and the security officer looked back once before they vanished his expression blank i breathed easier when they were gone at least i wouldnt be responsible for trents death not tonight anyway the wail of sirens grew louder and i turned to a second door pierce jumped ahead of us to open it and i did a double take where did you get a coat pierces face reddened but it was al who leaned forward saying he stole it of course the man has many talents why do you think im so interested in him or you my itchy witch mood sour i headed out into the cold ducking down into my scarf and wishing i was anywhere other than here if ivy and glenn werent okay i was going to freaking kill someone twentyeight this is not going to go well i thought glancing ruefully at al beside me as we strode down the closedoff street toward fountain square i was cold and i hunched into my coat and squinted through the flashing lights for ivy pierce trailed behind us trying not to look like a goober but he was wideeyed and clearly from out of town if not from out of this century the square was organized chaos with what looked like five is vehicles just arriving the original two fib and is cruisers stationed at the event the expected news vans and ambulance topping it off we now had fire trucks and the spray from the hoses was turning into little pinpricks of ice on my face it was the cold that made it miserable the wind going right through my coat and to my core even in my bag jenks was going to have a hard go of it there were fewer people than one might have expected inderlanders being good at disappearing and naturally avoiding anything that breathed of scandal a handful of onlookers vied for the news crews attention avoiding eye contact i quickened my pace to get behind the yellow tape where they could only shout questions i could pretend not to hear there was a cluster of people at the dry fountain being treated for burns and what looked like smoke inhalation the fire was out but the firemen were still hosing down the stage performing i think for the news crews i spotted eddens squat form at the edge of the cordonedoff area and he turned when i shouted looking cold but sharp in his tux he held the yellow tape up for me and we slipped under immediately i felt protected and when my guard went down i shivered violently from the cold glad you could join us he said eyeing the two men behind me where did you find the twins twins i thought breath catching as i spun around to see a sullen pierce in jeans standing next to a laughing one with dark sunglasses and a brilliant red tie holy cow i thought feeling a sliver of worry slip through me al put a finger to his lips and i whipped back around to edden willing to play the game since it would keep me out of trouble for a few minutes longer oh you know us witches i said not knowing why but only that i had to say something hey is that tom i said as i spotted what i thought was a familiar face among the wounded where edden looked where i pointed the man in the black trench coat was getting his hand bandaged but when he saw us notice him he quickly strode away the person attending him shouting for him to come back well ill be damned edden cursed whistling and pointing to get someone to go after him but it was too late that was tom tom bansen i said in affront glaring at al when he chuckled the man had once summoned and released al to kill me thats the third time hes beat me to a crime scene this week i mused uneasily he must have better intel al said giving pierce a shove to stay behind him are you giving tom information i asked al as edden snagged a passing officer and started shooting off questions a mockhurt expression came in his eyes as al peered at me from over his glasses everything i do i do for you love i wasnt sure if that was an answer or not and i slowly let out my breath flicking a glance at pierce now gazing up at the carew tower restaurant there were three is agents headed our way and i had a moment of worry about al until edden flashed his badge and the men turned away the officer with him jogged away and edden put his hands on his hips to assess the situation standing there he looked like a squat jenks without the wings with a stiff mustache and a round face and a tux too cold for the weather okay so he didnt look anything like jenks but the same protectoroftheworld attitude was there seeing glenns tall form with a bunch of fib personnel i tapped eddens arm and we headed that way the poor guy looked colder than i was with his knit hat pulled low and his eyes pinched people were listening to him though and he looked like he was in charge ivy was next to him her vampire need to protect the weak just about flaming from her and making me smile her red dress flashed from under her coat as the wind whipped it she didnt look cold at all as if noticing my gaze on her her eyes rose to mine then shifted to al pierce was lagging behind eyes on the fountain her words never stopped as she talked to the surrounding fib agents the is is lying she said firmly as the wind brought her voice to us when we got close enough no evidence of a banshee being involved is an outright lie there should be tons of emotion here and there isnt barely enough to cover a fender bender its as if its a tuesday night not new years eve after the ball has dropped and theres been a fire emotion should be echoing between the buildings and it isnt theres nothing here someone sucked it up the circle of fib officers shifted to let us in and we rocked to a stop with al uncomfortably close behind me and pierce still at the fountain the missing emotion was exactly the force id used to catalyze pierces spell but unlike a banshee i hadnt used it up simply borrowed it to push the spell into working i wondered if that made witches and banshees somehow related i could see the shift of attention to edden as he approached and glenn stifled a sigh glenn where are we the fib captain asked to shift it back and his sons mood eased ivy frowned and crossed her arms over her middle someone sucked the emotion out of here and it wasnt rachel she said her magic doesnt work like that not exactly anyway glenn wiped a mittened hand under his nose absolutely miserable with the cold i know it was a banshee he admitted im not arguing with you tamwood but you arent licensed to give court evidence and im stuck using what the is is telling me all we have right now is conflicting testimony from multiple witnesses we know mia was here my amulet lit up an fib officer said his words echoed by another as the man brought out the spell and showed it to everyone it was black now but it was gratifying to know for sure that id done the spell right yet my blood wasnt able to invoke it ivy huffed okay she was here but that doesnt mean she started the fire arguments erupted and ivy took the opportunity to step out of the circle and come around to where we stood nodding to al she gave me a distracted smile it worked she said good im glad for you rachel pierce welcome to the chaos of rachels life the next few hours ought to be fun i shook my head but before i could explain al took her hand and kissed the top of her black glove your welcome means more to me ivy alisha tamwood than a thousand souls watching rachel work is a wonder of one catastrophe after another that was kind of insulting this isnt pierce i said softly its al pierce is at the fountain ivy jerked her hand from him glenn heard as did most of the fib agents but only glenn knew what al was his instruction cut off in midphrase and i shrugged to tell him that gathering fib souls wasnt on the demons agenda today eddens expression became questioning glenn thought for a moment before remembering what he was saying then continued shifting to keep al in his sights al huffed when the cautious man undid the snap to his holster it didnt go unnoticed by the surrounding fib officers either ivy flicked her attention between the demon and pierce now gaping at the fire trucks this was so not right and i glanced around the square not wanting to believe that mia had been here that shed kill a man to feed her daughter i might understand but up to now shed always been focused on the individual not the collective even if i wanted to believe she was responsible for this logic said it wasnt her edden broke away from the fib group as his sons voice took on the sound of instruction his gaze tight on al he approached rachel im sorry he said as he brought his gaze back to me i am going to do whats best for the sake of the child within the limits of the law but im not putting my neck out for mia not after this i was too cold to protest shivering glenn was giving out a final instruction and the men looked grim look for anyone with a baby probably a woman but it could be a man or a man and a woman together he was saying there shouldnt be too many infants out here ivy had her hip cocked mia did not set the fire she said bluntly more vampire vibes edden mocked and al grinned there is more than one banshee in this city ivy continued i saw her tall scary woman with long hair dressed like she should be surrounded by security not asian more mayan than anything else shed look hispanic to most people mayan i mused my thoughts immediately going to the top of carew tower and the lunch id had with edden yesterday thats ms walker i said feeling my pulse quicken edden mia might have been here but so was ms walker which makes perfect sense walker doesnt have her usual haunts so shes feeding where she can stirring up trouble to make herself stronger eddens face was thoughtful but he waved to glenn to get the men moving with a chorus of agreement they dispersed it suddenly felt a whole lot colder of course ms walker would be here edden said gruffly but i could hear a note of doubt in it shes tracking mia id be surprised if she wasnt here ivy sighed and shifted her weight but i was a lot more direct damn it edden i shouted why are you being so bullheaded about this are you so smitten with that woman that you cant look at things logically the few fib personnel within earshot turned and glenns eyes went wide i suddenly felt nervous as the stocky man forced his clenched jaw to loosen are you so bleedingheart stupid that you cant do the same he barked back i suddenly realized that al was quietly arranging the snowflakes on his sleeve turning them into blue butterflies the doomed insects flew from him only to die a few feet away their wings fluttering briefly before being covered by snow mia hurt me too i said to edden nervous that someone might see als show of demon skill whether you like it or not holly is going to grow up to be one hell of a predator you can either make her a friend or a foe think about it edden shook his head zipping up his coat and walking away with friends like her we dont need foes that was one of the lamest things id ever heard him say and i took several mincing steps to keep up with him stop thinking like a human i said roughly its not a human world anymore we dont have any proof it was mia but youre ready to put her in jail for it banshees are territorial and i think walker set the stage on fire to get a quick fix and call mia out edden stopped not looking at me his eyes tracked the ambulance people packing up behind him al was strolling forward and pierce was hotfooting it to us as well dont you love how rachel sides with the underdog the demon said then brushed the garden of tiny blue butterflies from his sleeve they fluttered to the ground dead before they touched the snowcaked cobbles its going to kill her someday he said lightly bending to pick one up but not tonight he added as he pulled my hand from my coat pocket to put a chrysalis into it curving my cold fingers protectively around it i glanced at the blue chrysalis then shoved it into my coat pocket to deal with later edden i pleaded wincing he sighed five steps away someone waited for him with a clipboard i cant promise mia anything especially now rachel go home i licked my lips and the wind made them into ice you cant prove she did this i cant prove ms walker did either go home i hesitated and he exclaimed rachel go home bad dog al whispered mocking me and my face flamed pierce slid up beside us and i gritted my teeth not liking the ghost seeing me being treated like this fine i said bitterly do what you want this is a crappy new years ivy im going home are you staying ivy looked from pierce to the beaming demon ah you dont mind if i hang here for a while do you glenn wants my opinion on something crime scene slut i thought bitterly more than a little jealous that they would let her stay but wanted me to leave i didnt want to be alone in a car with al and pierce but i gave her a wave goodbye and turned edden had already walked away in a huff and glenn was waiting uncomfortably for ivy ticked i turned my back on all of them and started walking twentynine this was the second time i had suffered a demon in the back of my car and i didnt like it any better than the first al was more obnoxious than minias had been leaning forward between pierce and me to point out red lights and shortcuts through human and inderland slums that only an idiot would take this time of nightthough with a demon along it might be safe the smell of burnt amber slowly grew in my small car despite whatever charm he was using but i didnt dare crack a window to let in the freezing night though the heater was cranked jenks was still cold he really shouldnt have been out of my bag much less sitting on the rearview mirror you could have made that light if you had gunned it al said no one was behind me and i let the car coast forward a foot to the red light before i jammed on the brakes als nose smacked into the headrest and pierces arm already extended to brace himself against the dash stiffened im driving i muttered with an apologetic glance at jenks my toes are freezing in these stupid heels what was i thinking yes but youre not doing it properly the demon protested in a better humor than i liked he hadnt given me any trouble about getting in the backseat but maybe he could keep a better eye on pierce that way honestly the man was not going to hurt me even now when i glanced at him his frustrated expression shifted to one of anxious hope mistress witch he said as our eyes met and my phone vibrated almost unheard do you know how to get that i asked him giving als hand a tart smack when he reached for it in my bag the demon had gone back to looking like himself and my fingers were soundless as they hit his whitegloved thick hand the light changed and i eased forward driving carefully as it was icy near the bridge ill help him jenks said dropping down into my bag youve seen rachel use it right he said sarcastically youve been spying on us for a year pierce frowned as he pulled the slim pink phone from my bag its not a powerful trick he said indignantly and ive not been spying rachel if i could explain just open the top okay jenks said and i frowned at him to be a little nicer the scent of burnt amber grew when al put the flat of his arms on the two seats to make a bridge for his head to rest on may i use your phone when hes done he asked sweetly i debated what might happen if i slammed the brakes on again no sit the way youre supposed to or were going to get pulled over for a breathalyzer no fun he simpered slumping back i breathed easier wishing pierce would simply leave so i could go home and forget this day had ever happened what a waste from the backseat came al humming the tune to jeopardy until pierce found the seam and wrangled the top open motions hesitant he went to put it to his ear stopping when jenks hovered before the phone hands on his hips as he barked this is rachels secretary the lazyass witch is currently busy can i take a message jenks i complained as al snickered and pierce looked appalled but jenksthe only one who could really hear whoever it washad become serious where he asked and a bad feeling trickled through me chilling me though the heater was cranked and sending my hair to tickle my face from the back came an unearthly satisfied chuckle all i could see in the rearview mirror was a dark shadow with red goatslitted eyes fear slithered through me shit i have a demon in my backseat what in hell am i playing with good witch al said his voice coming from nothing and i stifled a shudder youre starting to understand ill tell her jenks said then stomped on the end button i jumped when pierce snapped the phone closed then jerked the car back into the proper lane when a horn blew jenks rose up looking eerily dark in the chill car with no dust slipping from him that was ford he said surprising me i had thought edden or maybe glenn hes at a coffee shop downtown with mia she wants to talk to you i think ms walker gave her a good scare oh god its starting where i said tension knotting my gut ivy i had to call ivy jenks laughed filling the car with the sound of bitter wind chimes youre not going to believe me he said i checked behind me then in front juniors place right i said dryly then did a ubangy pierce reached for the dash his long face going white but al didnt shift an inch ramrod straight dead center in my tiny backseat the car swung wildly finding its new direction as another horn blew thats past eddens blockade isnt it i asked how does she do that the woman must have a way with the force im not the banshee you seek i may pass jenks walked pierce through calling ivy to tell the fib as i made my way back over the bridge into cincy and down to the shopping district i doubted very much that mia was giving up more likely she was sacrificing remus to buy her way out of trouble and my tension ratcheted up as we pulled into juniors place it was packed but al did something involving latin and what looked like the same gesture i occasionally used on people who cut me off in traffic on vine and the buick ready to pull into the last parking spot changed its mind my pulse quickened when i spotted fords gray car three vehicles down ivy we should wait for ivy and the fib but that might be too late both of you stay in the car i said as jenks dove for my bag and i zipped it up i didnt even see the demon get out one moment i was snatching up my bag and slamming my door shut and when i turned he was therestanding way too close the security lights shone on his hair carefully styled and ridged his jaw tight and his demon eyes almost glowing in the dim light he didnt say a word waiting on the other side of the car pierce got out and gave me a worried look ill get you a coffee i said as i pushed around al then stay out of my way i didnt hear al following when pierce took my elbow as i slipped in my heels but he was there the door jingled a welcome and the four of us entered me in my carew tower restaurant finery al in his usual velveteen and lace pierce in jeans and a stolen coat and jenks in my bag we didnt get as many looks as one might think it was new years and there was a wide span of dress juniors wasnt far from fountain square and the place was busy voices fastpaced and excited because of the fire downtown and the blockades if mia was here i was sure she was soaking up the excitement rachel if i could have but a moment not now pierce i said as i let jenks out the pixy rose not a speck of dust coming from him as he flew heavily to the nearest light fixture and parked himself beside the hot bulb he gave me a thumbsup but it was obvious he was suffering as he put his elbows on his knees and hunched over i was on my own till the fib got here worse i was babysitting al i shoved my gloves in my pockets and scanned the floor while standing in line a spike of adrenaline shot through me when i found mia smack in the middle of the place remus on one side of her ford on the other holly was on her lap the infant resting her eyes closed and at peace with the world i met fords eyes and he nodded before getting up and trying to find a chair for me that table looked too small to talk to two serial murderers pierce brushed my arm and i jerked mistress witch dont call me that i muttered conscious of the people around us there were too many people in here someone was going to get hurt rachel ill allow that my situation looks dire but im of a mind to help you my attention swung back to him remembering the night wed met he was basically a runnermember of the coven of moral and ethical standards aside even if he couldnt tap a line he could help i didnt think mia had arranged for this meeting to kill me so it was likely remus was going to be the biggest threat him i could handle and id put my best undies online if mia wasnt about to sacrifice him to remain out of jail and off the grid think you can do what i say i asked and he grinned tossing his hair from his eyes in a way that wasnt like kistens at all but reminded me of him all the same youre not alone he said eyes darting to fords table ill help you settle your hash and then we might talk his hand reached for mine and al shoved between us two grande lattes double espresso italian blend he said to the clerk light on the froth extra cinnamon use whole milk not two percent or halfandhalf put a shot of raspberry in one for my itchy witch here and put it in porcelain i thought wondering if this was the only way demons liked their coffee minias had ordered something similar minus the raspberry the runt will have a juice box he turned to pierce it will make you big and strong wont it little fella pierces jaw clenched and his blue eyes narrowed but he swallowed the insult anything else the clerk asked and i looked to find that it was junior himself espresso i said remembering jenks swinging my bag around i dug out my wallet the light caught the glitter on my dress and i thought how stupid it all seemed at least my toes had thawed hey junior said suddenly backing up a step when he saw the gun in my bag i heard about you youre shunned get out of my shop shocked i looked up blinking could he have said it any louder maybe but my mood quickly turned to anger look junior i said bitterly my bile finding an easy outlet id really like to going home and taking a bubble bath sounds really great right now i leaned in close so only he pierce al and probably jenks could hear me but two of those good people sitting in the middle of your freaking shop are wanted for the assault of an fib officer a double murder causing a riot at the mall and are the number one suspects in that fire at fountain square tonight why dont you get everyone else out of here so i can take care of it his eyes were wide and he stared at me do me a favor and forget that ive been shunned i said shaking inside think for yourself and do something for the greater good huh can you do that our coffee was up and after i dropped a twenty on the counter i handed pierce his juice box and al one of the paper cups there were three people behind the counter and they were looking at us like we weredemons thanks i said shaking as i picked up my drink with the big r for raspberry on it and jenkss espresso i hated it when my temper got loose like that al seemed to think it was funny the smell of coffee seemed to pull jenks from the light fixture and he dropped heavily onto my shoulder catching his balance with a sudden tugging on my hair you okay i breathed and he shivered his wings just cold he said and i nodded agreeing my coat wasnt doing much to cut the chill either there was too much inandout traffic for my comfort mostly in halfway to the table i realized there was no way wed all fit and in all truthfulness i didnt want pierce or al near mia or remus jenks can you and pierce get people out of here i asked trying to get rid of two birds with one stone im not babysitting ghost boy jenks exclaimed from my shoulder pierce added a quick i suspect you think me less than likely mistress witch both of them were frowning when i stopped dead still in the store and turned coat bumping my calves al was smiling jenks youre so cold youre not dusting i said trying not to sound worried i need to get people out of here quietly and you can do that by the time i need you youll be warm i hope until then let me know if mia touches my aura i handed pierce jenkss coffee and added im giving you my phone ivy will probably call when the fib is here let me know and tell them not to barge in here okay jenks can do that he said grudgingly i put a hand to my forehead feeling a headache coming on if im right ugly guy over there is going to have a hissy long before the fib gets here im going to need your help and at that point you can let your testosterone rip meantime jenks can brief you on what remus has occupied his last twenty years with so you dont get smeared kay i handed pierce my phone and when he looked at me wryly jenkss wings clattered to life okay the pixy conceded laboriously making the flight to the wary man eyeing him before landing on his shoulder and telling him to start at the front two down i turned to al and the demon beamed al why dont you be a good boy and take the seat of the first people pierce gets out of here i want to be closer he said then looked over his glasses at the couple the next table over their chairs scraped as they beat a hasty path to the exit and al sat taking meticulous care in arranging his coat okay time to earn your rent i thought as i exhaled heavily i took a moment to loosen another button on my coat and feel for the comforting weight of my splat gun in my bag as i approached ford mia and remus ivy would probably tell edden to be circumspect but it wouldnt surprise me that if in their zeal six fib cars pulled up with lights on and sirens going if mia didnt behave herself this was going to be over really quickly she had tried to kill me twice and i knew i shouldve been concerned when i said hi to ford and sat down in the chair he had pulled up for me but the only thing i was feeling was tired that edden had a warrant and i could shoot them now was a comfort eyes were heavy on me as i took the lid off my drink and sipped it my shoulders relaxed as the hot rich coffee slipped down with a little effort i could see the door and counter both either mia was going to sacrifice remus and promise to be good or this was a plot to see me dead but i didnt think ford would read the situation wrong the door jingled when a couple left with frightened backward glances and jenks gave me a distant thumbsup damn this was good stuff and i made a mental note of what it was in case i survived raspberry italian latte my eyes rose over the rim of the paper cup remuss expression was both angry and frighteneda bad combination as his attention flicked from me to al and back mia had an unsettling confidence about her as she held the sleeping holly in her little pink snowsuit one would never guess they were wanted for assault and possible murder she was going to bail on him i knew it what did she know of love mia i said seeing that no one else was talking did you set the fire no her voice was soft to keep holly from waking and the toddlers hands moved in her sleep mias eyes were fixed on mine trying to impress me with what i already believed was the truth the walker did shes trying to pit my own city against me i told you she had the skill of a falling log her high voice held a shocking amount of hatred she wants holly mia held her daughter closer and the child shifted into a more comfortable position lips pouting in her sleep remuss hands clenched and when he saw me notice their whiteknuckled strength he moved them out of my sight i put my hands under the table keeping my elbows still while i pulled my splat gun out and set it atop my knees i didnt think it was you i said to try to get them to relax im trying to stop ms walker mia but you were seen at the fire the fib isnt going out of their way to help anymore you need to come in someones going to get hurt like me remus stood and my heart jumped we need to go mia people are leaving a faint musty scent drifted from the angry man at his movement tickling my memory fear pinged through me and i froze it smelled like cement cold and rough mia felt my fear the woman going almost slack as my emotions puddled out from me ford did too but his expression was of confusion not satisfaction he knew my fear didnt stem from mia but something else and i shoved the emotion away kisten its from kisten i dont have time for this mia moved holly to a more comfortable position ignoring remus the babys eyes opened silently she stared and as i watched hollys pale blue eyes became the pupil black of hunger did you tell the fib to drop their investigation mia asked me i jerked my attention from holly surprised ah yes but someone needs to go to jail for the tilsons you were living in their house you beat up an fib officer tried to kill me twice jeez what am i doing here beside me ford swallowed hard feeling everyones emotions and having a hard time separating himself he was better than a truth amulet but something was shifting and i gripped my gun setting my free hand casually around my cup mia let me tell them you are ready to cooperate i tried again i didnt want to shoot her unless i had to the captain of the fib knows youre sorry liar liar he knows the lengths to which ms walker will go to gain custody of holly pants on fire hes angry about what happened to his son but if you come in as a sign of trust he will look past it we can keep you and holly together remus bent over his wife hissing in her ear they lie to get what they want then tell you youre a liar when you ask for it i wont have my daughter pushed from foster home to foster home sleeping on stained mattresses and beat up for not having a real mom or dad i doubted that would happen with holly and mia reached up and touched his hand remus love she said eyes on mine im not turning us in im finding out if the fib is taking me seriously she warned them and if they come ill know their answer oh shit heart pounding i dropped my hand below the top of the table and gripped my gun with both hands show of lethal force or not if you twitch ill down you both think about it miayou broke the law you either live by societys punishments or live outside it in the abandoned stretches off scraps you said you made this city youre really going to leave it killing me wont help you it will tick them off ford stood and remus tensed held in check by mias hand on his atop her shoulder you told me you werent going to hurt anyone the psychiatrist said i believed you mia jiggled holly as she fussed at the time i thought the fib was smarter than that clearly the fib wont listen until scores of them are dead but they will listen the witch is shunned dross i can kill with impunity shes nuts she is freaking insane behind me i felt pierce turn it was the eeriest thing id ever felt but i swear i felt him turn in an instant jenks was before me shedding hot sparkles i wouldnt say impunity the pixy said blade pointing at her im of a mind to agree with the pixy pierce said from behind me i watched remus assess them but it was mia who said what the devil are you you dont even have an aura so ive been told and if youre powerful smart youll pull foot and not look back holly started to whimper and mia jiggled her gaze rising up to remus behind me i heard the clatter of boots and the jingle of the door as someone left they were going voluntarily now and the place was almost empty i turned to the counter junior was there staring frightened call the is i mouthed this was too much for the fib no way remus saw and in a bellow of rage he ran at junior i bolted upright gun tracking remus but i didnt have a clear shot ford dropped staying out of the way a woman gasped and ducked under her table juniors eyes widened at remus shouting a word of latin made strong in his fear he set a circle remus ran right into it as he tried to jump over the counter blood spurted from his nose as he fell back bellowing as he hit the floor pierce grabbed his arm and remus smacked him with an unfocused blow that sent him reeling catching his balance the small man licked his thumb and fell into a boxers stance he was going to get himself killed again git the blood out of your eyes and stand so i can row you up salt river pierce said then made a face at me to get on with it jenks too was shrilling at me to shoot him but it was too late i couldnt hit one without hitting the other dont kill him remus mia was saying calmly i think i know the little man back up rache jenks exclaimed darting from one end of the shop to the other before she starts sucking on you and al was laughing almost choking on his grande latte as he clapped a chair scraped as mia stood the scent of cold cement and mold flowed from her and holly i backed up my hand had crept up to my throat as if i could feel cold fingers there killing me isnt going to stop the fib mia i said thinking this was a great time to be having a flashback to kistens killer mia stood the table between us holly holding tight to her as the baby howled behind me pierce grunted as he took a blow and something crashed youre mistaken she said eyes on me not the fight behind me killing you will stop everything remus quit playing with that dead man and hold the witch down holly is hungry oh my god thats why she hadnt touched me yet there was a thump and pierce groaned again i turned to see pierce slumped against the wall among the remnants of a table grinning remus came at me with grasping hands i shoved a chair aside for some room and kicked off my heels pissed i swung the barrel up and at the bottom of an exhale i pulled the trigger no mia shouted but the little blue plastic ball hit him square in the chest potion soaked his shirt and splashed up to his neckand the man dropped i danced back as he fell into the table and from there to the floor coffee went everywhere thank you god now for mrs bitch the door jingled and i turned damn it i shouted as mias silhouette raced past the window ford was tight behind her what in hell was he doing pierce jenks pierce was getting up shaking his head from remuss blow jenks hovered over him dusting heavily to stop the cut on his head jenks stay put tell them to bring some salt water im downing her rache wait he couldnt come with me my arm hit the door and it crashed open i raced after them in my feet bare but for nylons and my splat gun in my grip to the left a fast patter of heels drew my attention i took a deep breath and ran through the snowy parking lot in an instant id passed the cars and was on the sidewalk the cold cement numbed my feet and i ran faster my breath puffed out and my body fell into a rhythm i could keep up for an hour my slit dress hiked up as i ran and i was glad my stupidity in choosing fashion over functionality had stopped at my shoes ahead the smallest movement in the light a block up told me where theyd gone god how had she gotten ahead so fast a toddler wailed the odd cadence telling me she was being held in the arms of someone running i couldnt help but gain on them fords silhouette was clear in the light for an instant then they were past the light and they were gone i gripped my splat gun as i followed slowing so i didnt run into them coming to a stop under the light i listened it was dark in all directions new years celebrations were going on all over the city but here on the outskirts of an old industrial park it was dark a baby cried and i heard the crack of cold metal heart pounding i spun ford i called he didnt answer and i jogged to the end of the street a small cement hut surrounded by a chainlink fence was the only logical option though the chainlink door was shut i could see in the snow the track it had made when it opened footprints marked the otherwisepristine snow slower yet i approached my feet hurting from the cold ford i whispered then edged into the tiny fenced yard it was no bigger than a dog run and i guessed this was a switching house for the citys electric or phone lines but the small room was empty when i stood on tiptoe and looked in the high window my fingertips numb from the cold two sets of prints had tracked in the snow i licked my lips going in alone was really stupid i looked back toward the coffeehouse no fib no is i couldnt wait dumb i said as i started to remove my coat then shivering hiked up my dress and stripped off my nylons instead hanging them over the tall fence for them to find and know where id gone dumb you are a dumb witch i muttered and shivering i pushed the heavy metal door open and went in thirty the smell of damp stone hit me and i recognized the scent that had been coming off mia and remus tonight theyd been here before and i moved quickly to the conventional steel door at the back of the empty room the doorjamb had been broken from the inside and feeling this was really wrong i pulled it open to see a staircase going down down i muttered as i hiked my dress up why is it always down gun in hand i felt the rough cement walls as i descended there was a bare bulb glowing showing that the way was straight and even wires ran along the sloping ceiling as if put in after the building was constructed my steps were silent because i was barefoot and my feet were numb on the old but unworn cement it stank like mold and dust people were talking their voices unclear but echoing i heard a small feminine gasp and then ford shouted mia its just me its okay im trying to help you you have to come in but i promise i wont let them take holly from you i dont need your help mia said tightly i never should have wished for love how do you live like this hes dead that witch killed remus hes not dead mia ford said it was a sleeping charm not dead mia said it was a painfilled whisper and thinking mia was ready to break i ghosted down the rest of the stairs the light from the bulb in the stairway was overpowered by the shifting beam of a highpowered flashlight slowing i crept to the end of the stairway and with my hands on my splat gun i peeked around the archway the echoing room was huge stretching fifteen feet high at least with beautiful vaulted ceilings mia was standing in the middle with a lanternlike flashlight in her gripford was before her with his back to me i think he sensed my emotions but he didnt turn behind mia was a sunken tunnel stretching in two directions it looked like a subway tube but there were no rails or tracks there was no electricity no benches no graffiti there was nothing but empty walls and forgotten bits of trash smelling of dust mias face was proud and determined in the light reflecting off the walls as she tried to soothe the toddler to no avail since she was upset herself she hadnt had the lantern in the coffee shop it must have been in the little room upstairs and it suddenly hit me that this was how mia and remus had been getting around moving under the city to evade the fib and the is i hadnt even known the tunnels existed but mia had probably witnessed their construction mias eyes flicked to mine and discovered by my emotions i stepped out remus is fine mia you have to turn yourself in no i dont she said the defiant pride in her voice telling me she wasnt giving up ever this is my city i shook my head things are different i slowly moved forward it was frigid down here and i shivered edging closer yet almost close enough to make the splat ball gun a sure thing if you dont come in the fib will bring everything against you i know they look stupid but they arent without a show of goodwill ms walker will leave with holly i stopped when mias chin lifted mia i swear i will do everything i can to keep walker from taking her but you have to help me mia shook her head and backed up the light in her hand swung wildly over the cold walls and holly started to cry remus is right im going back to the old ways theyve kept me alive for hundreds of years give me remus and leave me and my child alone or there will be more deaths youve been warned turning her back on us mia headed for the black arch of the tunnel my gun swung up and ford got in my way mia he exclaimed as i tried to edge around him for a clear shot think about your future my future the words were a cold imperialistic bark and she stopped at the edge of the threefoot drop you are children you are all children i saw the birth of this city when she was a wallowing hole that pigs ran through heedlessly i helped her grow by removing the people who would keep her ignorant and small this is my city i built her how dare you think to put your laws and rules on me and lecture me about the future im not running away tell captain edden that if the fib follows me his son will be in a casket not a hospital bed you she said child on one hip and light in her hand are nothing animals to be culled and sucked dry i am still living among pigs i had my gun aimed at her but id have to hit her face for it to do any good with her wearing that heavy winter coat mia ford said in his best psychologist voice im not as old as you are but ive lived more heartache and joy than you can comprehend dont do this love is worth the trial its what defines us nothing can stain your love for holly and you do love her it is as clear as your voice isnt that purity worth some pain dont risk losing that from pride from behind me in the stairway came the soft scuffing of shoes adrenaline surged but i couldnt take my eyes from mia id give anything for edden or glenn right about now mias eyes tracked behind me and her face grew even more determined as i heard the presence of only one person not the ten i wanted the turn take it morgan you are worse than my mother a masculine voice mocked always showing up at the wrong place at the wrong time to mess up my day i spun around i couldnt help it tom i exclaimed backing up and not knowing who to point my gun at anymore get out of here mia is my tag mias brow furrowed dropping my nylons tom came even with ford his bandaged hand out in warning to me and pointing his wand at the banshee looking like a bad actor in a fantasy flick his expression was far too condescending for him to get out of this alive you can have her he said all i want is the baby mias face went white and my jaw dropped as it all came together he wasnt trying to bring in mia he was working for the walker he was a freaking baby snatcher he hadnt been spying on me when i kept finding him at crime scenes id been messing up his takes my face burned and i shifted the aim of my weapon to him slime and how is the fib going to find me now what do you think you are doing i said but it was obvious you cant touch holly and mia sure as hell isnt going to help you unlike you morgan i dont mind a little smut on my soul he said grimly his brow furrowing to tell me that whatever was in his wand wasnt legalnot to mention nasty enough that it bothered him ms harbor is going to walk up those stairs and hand that kid to whoever i say he smiled an ugly smile at the angry woman standing with her heel at the edge of the dropoff and you walk away with a pocketful of change huh i said backing up to better get him in my sights subjection spells are nasty tom did you take the tongue out of the goat yourself or did you pay someone to do it toms jaw clenched but he didnt move whats it going to be mia he said either walk up those stairs on your own or you do it charmed bloody hell witch she cursed her head lowered to eye him from under her hair it was the look of a predator her eyes black and her muscles tense mia let holly slide from her and i retreatedgetting out of the way ford was doing the same you wont have her mia said setting her lantern down as well hands free she stepped forward i earned this child with blood and death oh this isnt looking good oblivious holly patted the floor where the light fell fascinated with the shadow her chubby hand made and trying to catch it getting to her knees she started crawling chasing the echoes i eyed the dropoff it was far too close for my comfort mia i warned but she wasnt listening mias eyes had narrowed and her stance shifted pulling herself up tall she became a wronged goddess her face beautiful and calm savage and without pity she was a queen a giver of life and death and her eyes shone like black coals oh she was pissed tom look out i shouted as mia leapt at him her hands bent like ugly claws tom panicked and mia easily knocked the wand from him it skittered to the base of the stairs you will all die to feed my child she said looking small as she stood in front of him and i will weep tears to suck your life for all of eternity mia stop i shouted my gun pointed at her i wont let you kill him im not going to let him take your baby either just stop back off and we can find a way i promise mia hesitated either considering it or trying to think of a way to kill us all at once i mean it mia i intoned and her grip on tom trembled a bead of sweat rolled down his face he understood how close he was to death not knowing if id really bother to save his sorry ass or not i honestly didnt know why i cared holly squealed in delight and my eyes darted to her fear pulsed through me and i almost jerked into a run oblivious to the anger of the adults immune to it because of her history the child was contentedly playing in the shifting light wobbling on her feet and entranced as she reached for the shadows we were making on the curved wall of the tunnel she was at the edge of the dropoff teetering she cooed and mias face was riven with indecision if she moved tom would run for his wand if she didnt her baby would fall ford no i shouted as he lunged for the little girl in her pink snowsuit got you he exhaled as she tipped into a fall and he pulled her back at the last instant the two of them landed against the cold floor with a puff of fords breath holly thumped into his chest safe but ford was holding her oh godford i breathed as the little girl peered up at him and smiled that same smile she had given meright before she pulled my aura away and ate my soul i couldnt move if i did mia would kill us all hollys chubby hand reached up and patted fords face ford gasped in pain mias eyes narrowed in satisfaction my anger burned and i tightened my grip on my gun damn it i didnt know who to shoot maybe the girl and throat tight i swung my gun to her no ford breathed and my finger tightening on the trigger jerked loose hes okay we all stared as ford hunched around holly shaking in a spasm before he took a deep breath its gone he moaned the words almost a sob oblivious to us the tears ran down his tired lined face not that one holly he whispered sounding exhausted thats mine take the rest youre an angel youre a beautiful innocent angel my pulse hammered mia stared at ford in stark shocked wonder the little girl was patting his face feeling the beginnings of his six oclock shadow and babbling she wasnt killing him she wasi didnt know what she was doing but fords tears were in relief not pain what the hell is going on tom said and i felt him tap a line damn it i couldnt tap a line i was playing pattycake with a black arts witch and all i had was a sleepytime charm i dont know i shifted my attention to mia maybe shes gotten control of herself mias lips parted clearly the woman was stunned to see another man holding her child its too soon she breathed her feet scuffed as she turned to them holly holly babbled in fords arms the purity of the sound echoing against the curved cold ceilings far overhead then i guess i dont need you anymore do i tom said suddenly i felt a drop in the ley line instinct kicked in i swung my gun around and pulled the trigger a little blue ball hit tom squarely in the chest but it was too late a nasty green ball of something was already in the air down i shouted then dropped to the hard cement as an explosion of green sparkles pushed my hair back my ears hurt and i looked to see mia picking herself up off the floor ford was out cold a shimmering green haze marking his aura toms spell apparently tom wasnt moving either tag youre it pushing myself up i went for mia landing a side kick squarely in her gut i fell from the impact and the woman was shoved into the wall her head hit the cement and she collapsed whoops my bad but damn that had felt good i turned to ford to see that the green shimmer was gone and that holly was crying beside him in the curve of his body ford shifted his face off the cement and relief spilled into me he was alive thank you god i got to my feet and tugged my coat straight rubbing my sore hand where a new scrape and probably another bruise would run come morning but it was done all that was left was the mopping up he was going to snatch her baby i thought shivering as i turned mia over with a foot glancing at the gun in my hand i debated hitting her with one of my few remaining sleepytime potions since i couldnt make a circle to contain her but if id given her a concussion the charm might send her into a coma id just have to watch her like the predator she was until the fib caught up with me and mia was a predator a freaking tiger a crocodile shedding crocodile tears stay there sweetheart i whispered to holly when she crawled to pat at her mothers face and cry baby tears i couldnt help her god help me why did i feel like such a bad guy the soft scrape of wood on cement whispered and i spun gun pointed not only was tom awake but he was moving and i gaped at him as he scooped his wand up from the floor with his bandaged hand and looked at me from under his raggedy bangs hatred in his every motion id hit him i knew id hit him this wasnt fair anticharm gear he explained rubbing his nose and wiping away the blood you think id come against you without something to defuse your infamous little blue sleepytime charms you need to diversify rachel my eyes narrowed and my grip shifted it will probably hurt if i hit you in the eye i threatened dont move he said and i froze that wand was a lot more dangerous seeing holly unattended his eyes took on a satisfied glint tom i said shaking my head in warning dont be stupid you give holly to walker and mia will freaking kill you i think shell be more angry at you than me he said twirling the wand dexterously or at least she will be when i get done with her back up get away from the kid i had nothing well i could talk him to death maybe this is a bad idea i said as i edged away while he moved closer pushing me from holly with his presence think about this youre not going to walk away from it and if you do you wont be alive for long like you know a bad idea from a good one he said motioning with his wand for me to keep moving back if a human can touch the kid then i can too he added as he scooped her up tom dont i exclaimed and holly keened an eerie coo of pleasure and delight that chilled me to my core the man stiffened his eyes bulged and his mouth opened in a silent scream he fell to his knees and i tensed to knock the child from him only to fall back and cower as a wave of bright force burst from him i couldnt see itmy eyes were blind to itbut it was there i could feel it and my skin tingled as if a thousand summers were pressing on me in the smothering dark of the sunken room toms cry of pain echoed against the curved ceiling and came again a thousand times back arched he hung poised as holly pressed her hand to his cheek rapture infusing her holly no remembering my gun i aimed at holly and pulled the trigger the ball went wild when someone hit my arm shocked i dropped back when i saw al pierce was behind him looking afraid and that chilled me to my core what are you doing i asked shocked but the demon in his green velvet and with his reddish complexion only smiled celero inanio he whispered and i yelped dropping my suddenly hot gun damn it al i said frustrated as i shook my hand what are you doing keeping you alive itchy witch he held a warning hand out behind him at pierce and the man rocked back stay put or the deal is off and youre really dead deal tom moaned in pain i didnt care if he was a black witch no one should die like that giving up on any help from al or pierce i ran to help him only to fall when al tripped me gasping i fell and pain whitened the world as my cheek scraped the cement when i didnt turn my head fast enough i looked up shocked into stillness its toms life i thought in despair as i shook the hair from my eyes holly was taking him like she had tried to take me the room pulsed with the force of toms soul a hidden heartbeat of intent that measured his life i could feel it as his aura was sucked away and nothing was left to hold his soul to his will and it was fading a soft scuff behind me was my only warning and i yelped again when al roughly pulled me up he grinned his flat blocky teeth glinting in the light from mias lantern too late he said smiling as he watched in macabre rapture almost salivating at the death of the black witch and making me wonder if al was here to collect on a debt too late and perfect timing ford was out cold the emotions of the room having brought him to his knees the air pounded with whitelight thoughts a lifetime of whispered conversations at the edge of my awareness but they were fading holly made a delighted squeal of surprise when tom completely collapsed the black pulse echoing in my head was sucked into oblivion and i staggered unwittingly pushing back into al the small child awkwardly got to her feet and wobbled to her kneeling mother now smiling and holding out her arms to her god help us tom was dead mia was awake and holly was walking let me go al i have toget her i finished lamely but with what the heat had probably popped the sleepytime charms in my gun the demons grip on my arm tightened when i tried to pull away not yet he said and pain shot up my arm as i twisted in his grip i need something i stared at him my heart pounding need what this he unexpectedly swung at me and my head rocked back my ears rang and i staggered pierce protested but it was the smooth clean touch of velvet against my neck that caught and cradled me as i fell so sorry itchy witch al said as he gently eased me to the floor the scent of burnt amber and mold made me ill and i tried to focus dizzy i was dizzy the cold seeped up through my back my coat doing little to keep me warm i felt a moment of panic when i saw the shiny gold knife in als hand as he knelt by me but i was helpless al gave me a little pat on the cheek that stung and i pushed ineffectively at him you are a font of opportunity he said in a wonderful mood as he caught my wrist never would i have been able to plan this itchy witch but good things just seem to follow you like a puppy good i wondered was he crazy what are you doing i panted trying to pull my arm from his grip temporarily putting the knife between his teeth al pulled from his coat pocket the black potion bottle hed taken from me i need a wee bit of your blood love he said when he took the knife from his mouth something to invoke the excellent charm you cooked up for me pierces charm panic slid through me when he set the potion aside and took the knife behind him pierce stood with his hands fisted clearly upset but not going to do a thing sstop i said then jerked at the icy pain of the blade al stop i cried trying to pull my wrist from him al stood i tried to follow but he put a booted foot across my throat and my upward surge ended in a gurgle and a thrashing of legs masters prerogative he said as he swirled the potion with the three drops of blood in it i can claim any spell you make weve been over this before tilting his head he looked at me from over his smoked glasses as if in a toast he held up the potion mine his foot lifted and i gasped putting a hand to my throat and sitting up my finger throbbed and i looked seeing that he had cut right across the closed loop of my fingerprint he wasnt doing the charm right it should be spilled into a hollowedout stone and allowed to disperse he was using my potion but for what what are you doing i said truly horrified when he yanked toms body up and dumped the potion into the corpses mouth was he trying to resurrect him al dropped the body and turned in a jaunty motion i cant have a corpse for a familiar how gauche would that be people would talk and with you idling your time away i need a real familiar thanks love this will do fine enjoy the rest of your night this one is mine preexisting agreement you see its not a snatch itchy witch and he laughed i scrambled upright with a hand to my stomach al was using my potion but for what ta love he said and with a wicked smile he yanked tom to him and vanished he took tom holy crap he took tom and i think he used my potion to keep him from dying al i cried panicked that it had been my charm to do it this was not my fault you play with black magic you pay the cost the light shifted and i turned to find that i was alone down here with an unconscious fib agent and one extremely pissed banshee pierce was gone a pile of clothes and the stolen coat marked where he had been and i cursed al thinking he had snagged both witches and left tom apparently being more important than keeping his word mia had holly on her hip and the child watched me with eyes as black as her mothers as innocent and unforgiving as death itself backing up i looked at my nowuseless splat gun i couldnt make a circle and running after a banshee without backupor better yet angrywas going to bite me on the ass but id gone out tonight intent on talking al into agreeing to stop snatching people not to rescue the world from a banshee having a bad day you will die for your part in this the woman snarled i tried to help i said grabbing the back of fords shirt and dragging him out of her reach he was conscious but not going to be of any help unable to sit under his own power yet you are alone the woman said letting holly slip from her so i said stupidly then gasped and backpedaled when the woman lunged forward hands grasping rachel ford called with a slurred shout and i stumbled tripping over his legs i went down mia on top of me we hit the floor my breath whooshed out and i tapped a line frantic pain hit me as the heat of the ley line suddenly burned across my unprotected neurons and synapses and when her hands touched my face i screamed as my aura pulled through my soul you think you can kill me i screamed defiantly go ahead i panted make my freakingday her teeth bared inches from me her breath came in a pant her gaze wild fevered with savage instinct but i had fought off ivy and this didnt scare me the line was humming through me and i let her have it i let her have it all mia screamed her fingernails dug into my jaw her agony reverberating through me like her voice echoing against the curved ceilings of stone over us she screamed again and i clenched my teeth refusing to let go of the line even as it burned me power flowed into her burning her mind and body but she wouldnt let go the scent of cold dust and forgotten air filled me and then her eyes opened against the torment blacker than the sin of betrayal she fixed her gaze on mine panting from the agony if it was that easy she said clearly hurting i would have died before my twenties i had a second of doubt and feeling it she attacked it was as if the world flipped over with a curious twist of vertigo she ripped my thin aura from me pain lit through me as the ley line i was pulling on hit me completely raw and unfiltered i jerked instinct shoving her away but she had me and pinned me to the floor the line still flowed but i wouldnt let go as it was clearly hurting her too pain was etched on her forehead and sweat beaded up her breath came in a pant and she held it behind her pain i could see my soul slipping into her my strength going with it if i couldnt stop her from taking my soul she would freaking kill me line or no rachel i heard from behind the roaring in my ears and then someone knocked us apart mias grip tore away as she fell back the cool air of the tunnel hit me and i groaned as the strength of the line boomeranged back into me unable to breathe i curled into myself and rolled to my stomach clenching in hurt my face rubbed into the dusty cement and i sucked in the air as if it would help me find my soul i still had it i still had some of my aura or id be dead i didnt think i was dead i hurt too much only now did i let go of the line a pained sob escaped me as the incoming force ceased and i pushed enough out of me so i could think but even so it hurt power leaked from my muscles cramping them when i tried to move in the distance i could hear holly crying or maybe it was me im sorry mia ford was saying faintly as i tried to breathe without taking in the dust youve had all the chances i can give a person holly will be fine shes give her to me mia screamed her raw voice scraping my awareness i turned my head and cracked my eyes it hurt god it hurt to do even that little bit but i found them ford was holding holly the young girl blinking at her raging mother but not upset ford had my splat gun and was holding mia off the charms must not have popped or he would have knocked himself out picking up the gun how he could hold the baby and tom couldnt was beyond me holly take him the banshee shouted and ford shifted her higher on his hip she is the man said his face screwing up with emotion and then he forced his expression to calm shes taking everything from me but what is mine there are no thoughts in me but my own and mia you are a criminal you helped make our society and you will live by our rules no she howled then lunged the flash of the lantern was red against my eyes as it fell over my sight went gray as the pain in my head almost made me black out it was either that or the light was busted groaning i didnt see but heard the puff of my splatball gun and the thump of someone hitting the floor its okay i heard ford whisper his voice pitched high to tell me he was talking to holly your mommy is okay shes going to sleep for a while and youll see her every day holly i promise stay with her ill be right back i couldnt breathe my chest hurt so bad rachel are you okay ford said his voice heavy with heartache and i felt him turn me over lifting my head from the cold cement masculine fingers traced my face but i couldnt tell if my eyes were open or not i was so cold and i shivered violently making the pain worse the dust on his hands turned to damp grit as he wiped my tears away and the scent of wet cement rose higher it trickled through my thoughts mixing with my pain in a slurry of confusion i breathed not knowing if i was in my past or my present i was going unconscious i could feel everything shutting down the light was gone and i couldnt see but someone held me and he smelled like cold cement kisten i forced my lungs to work someone in kistens boat had smelled like this like old abandoned cement i struggled and he pulled me closer holding my wrists when i tried to fight him we have to go i sobbed but he only pressed me into his chest as he cried with me telling me to remember that he had me and that he wouldnt let me remember alone that he would bring me back the stink of cement filled me pulling a memory into existence it trickled painfully through me drawn by the scent of wet stone and dust and i panicked we had to get away the vampire was coming and we had to go now i struggled to break from kisten but he held me close his voice mixing with my frustration as he wiped my tears i jerked when a memory surfaced kisten had wiped my tears away he wouldnt leave with me and then it was too late i couldnt think that dammed dust caking my thoughts mixing my past and now i couldntthink was i here or on kistens boat id been crying i had tried to save him and he had loved me but it hadnt made a difference he had still died and i was alone not alone echoed in my mind go ill bring you back tears leaked out even as i fought oblivion and my mind rebelled dropping me into a memory lost for an instant in time triggered by the scent of dust the sensation of pain and the feeling of love turned into the pain of sacrifice my heart beat and i closed my eyes falling thirtyone you son of a bastard i exclaimed in frustrated anger wiping the helpless tears away and shaking from adrenaline as i faced kisten his blue eyes pinched in distress because id found him in this tiny backwater of the ohio river i dont care what vampire law says youre not a box of candy ive got everything we need my car is in the lot just put on the disguise charm and well get the hell out of here but kisten smiled at me with his bright blue eyes and ran a shaking hand under my eye to leave the cool breath of drying skin no love he said voice utterly devoid of his fake accent i cant live outside my societys rules i dont want to id rather die among them im sorry you think im a fool youre being stupid i yelled stomping my foot god if i was stronger id knock him out and drag him away theres no reason for it kisten stiffened and when his eyes went over my shoulder i remembered the boats ohsosubtle shift of motion and the sound of water lapping the smell of vampire rose thick and i turned pressing my back into kistens chest my chin trembled and i clenched my jaw kistens killer wasnt a big man kisten could probably take him in a fair fight i knew there would be no such thing his eyes were black from blood lust and there was a faint trembling in his hands as if he was holding himself back relishing the last drawings out faint wrinkles marked the corners of his eyes his suit looked like it was from the eighties and his tie was wide stuffed into his shirt for an undead he looked sloppy and out of date but he was hungry blood lust apparently never went out of style piscary said i might get a taste of witch he said and i swallowed at the angry bitterness just beneath his softly aggressive voice he might look the fool but he was a predator and as he moved slowly into kistens lowceilinged bedroom at the back of his cruiser i realized how deep in the crapper id fallen eyes unmoving i felt in my bag for my splat gun it would down him as fast as anyone else but only if he didnt see it coming undead vampires were fast and i was sure hed been dead long enough to pass the tricky fortyyear ceiling that killed most of the undead which meant he was smart too oh god why hadnt i just left when kisten told me to but i knew that answer and i fumbled for kistens hand rachel leave he has no claim on you kisten said as if he was still in control and the vampire facing us smiled at his innocence his fangs were a stark white gleaming in the lowvoltage lights wet with saliva and my neckoh god it was starting to tingle my hand pressed to my old scar and i retreated my only thought to put enough distance between us so i could get out my splat gun the vampire lunged gasping i flung myself to the side my arm burned as i found the carpet facedown a terrifying sound filled the boat and whipping my hair from my eyes i watched them grapple i couldnt breathe and still on the floor i sat up and fumbled in my bag but my fingers wouldnt work and it took an agonizingly long time to find my gun i cried out in relief shoved my bag aside and pointed the muzzle at him id shoot them both if i had to not like this the older vampire said with a snarl you got that right coffin breath i said and i pulled the trigger his face an ugly mask of anger the vampire shoved kisten he flew backward across the room and his head made a loud thump as it hit the boats metal wall behind the paneling kisten i shouted as his eyes rolled back and he slumped to the floor out cold shaking i got to my feet you son of a bitch i said hardly able to point the gun you have no idea the vampire said then showed me the splat ball safely in his hand unbroken and worthless he set it gently on the dresser and it rolled falling behind it eyes slitted he breathed deeply of the fear i was filling the room with tears of frustration started leaking out i had to let him get closer or hed just catch the next ball but too close and hed have me kisten wasnt moving and i backed up kisten i said nudging him kisten please wake up i cant keep both of us alive i need your help the smell of blood drew my eyes down and i felt my face go pale kisten wasnt breathing kisten i whispered shock filling my entire world kisten my eyes warmed and hot tears slipped down as i realized he was dead the vampire had killed him the son of a bitch had killed kisten bastard i shouted in agonized pain and anger you sonofabitch bastard you killed him the vampire stopped short and stared at kisten his black eyes widened as he realized he had and his mouth twisted into a grimace an ugly rumble of anger almost a growl lifted through the air you puking little witch he snarled he was mine to kill and you made me do it before i had even tasted him i couldnt stop shaking and as i stood with my feet spread wide before kisten i aimed my gun at him im going to kill me he taunted his expression so full of hate it was frightening right he moved my back hit the same wood that had crushed kistens brain against his skull killing him instantly the air left my lungs the flat of the vampires arm was at my throat pinning me there my eyes bulged and i struggled to breathe his weight let up and i got a gasp of air in as the world spun and suddenly he had my front against the wall pain exploded in my wrist and my hand opened i heard the dull thump of my gun hitting the carpet and the pressure vanished you ruined my entire evening the vampire said leaning against me so i could see the thin rim of brown around his eyes i was promised someones last blood and kistens is gone guess what that means he was feeding off my fear bringing himself to a higher pitch i struggled and he pressed his entire body length against mine i couldnt move and my fear edged into panic my fingers dug at the paneling and my tears slipped down it means he said sending the scent of damp cement over me ill drain you instead i jerked as he pulled the last of my braid apart and ran his dustscented fingers through my hair id rather have played with kisten he said as he breathed deeply of my curls piscary has been at him a good long time and the boy has so much saliva in him that i could probably cut out his heart and he would writhe for more bastard i said to the wall terrified he sucked in air as he ran the flat of his nose along my neck to breathe in my scent i shuddered as his pheromones dove deep and brought the scar to life tension shifted to adrenaline and i stifled a moan of what might have been ecstasy but there could be no ecstasy here this was evil i was not turned on i was scared shitless leave me alone i said but it was a powerless demand and he knew it mmmm he said as he turned me around and i could see the lust reflected in his eyes ive a better idea im going to keep you alive as my shadow take my revenge on sweet ivy slowly piscarys little bitch needs to be taught her place he knows ivy terror gave me strength and i fought him he let me go he had to have i couldnt have gotten away otherwise hes playing with me i thought as i ran for the door i was on the water i couldnt tap a line unless i could get off the boat i am so lost stars exploded and i stumbled falling on the bed he had hit me i hadnt even seen him move but the freaking bastard had hit me and i felt my face grow hot as i tried to figure out where the floor and walls were the bed dipped as he landed on it and i rolled finding myself farther from the door i was going the wrong way i had to get our positions reversed i had to make a run for it his eyes glinted as he reached out and with a soft exhalation he said ivys bitten you hasnt she maybe we can have some fun after all my face lost its expression and i forced my hand from creeping up to hide my neck got a taste for vampires he mocked and i made the mistake of taking a deep breath vampire incense tinged with the scent of cement filled me lighting a path from my neck to my groin oh shit i moaned and my back hit the wall kisten lay dead at my feet and i had a sexual high running through me twisting perverting my fear into pleasure no wonder ivy was screwed up get the hell away from me i panted the vampire had followed me and he touched my shoulder making my knees almost give way soon youll be begging me to sleep with you he promised in a soft whisper tears filled my eyes and he kissed them away his fingers smelling of damp cement as my tears moistened the dust from his fingers i brought my hand up to claw at his eyes and i gasped when he crushed them stop i said begging him please stop his wide hand splayed across my face he forced my jaw open one finger rubbing my neck he slipped a dusttasting finger in my mouth feeling inside me dont i panted even as i writhed in his grip and he forced his mouth to mine now that he knew i wasnt going to bite off his tongue his rough hand pressed fully into my neck and he gave a hard rub ecstasy surged it wasnt him it was like hitting a reflex and i hated myself for the lust that hit me even as i struggled to get away struggled to take a breath that wasnt full of him to just get away i was crying and he pulled away with my lip between his teeth the sharp spike of pain through my lip was like an electric shock he probably expected me to swoon at his feet but it had the opposite effect fear overrode the breathstealing surge and i lashed out my nails raked his eyes he swore and stumbled back he had bitten me god he had bitten me hand over my mouth i ran for the door im not done yet the vampire bellowed and i lunged down the narrow hall falling into the living room i ran for the door to the galley and my freedom i tried to turn the handle but my wrist wouldnt work still numb from where he had forced my gun from me the fingers on my other hand were purple and unresponsive sobbing i kicked at the door pain stabbed through my ankle but i aimed again with a sidekick i screamed as it hit and this time the doorjamb splintered my numb fingers scrabbled for the door and i shrieked when a heavy hand jerked me from the broken wood i struggled for consciousness as my head hit the far wall and i fell i said im not done yet the vampire said as he dragged me back to the bedroom by my hair fighting like a mad thing i tried to grab the door to the bathroom as we passed but he gave a yank and my fingers scraped the carpet until they burned he didnt let go of my hair until he jerked me up by the arm and threw me on the bed i bounced off before i could find my balance and i hit the floor on the far side between the bed and the wall my eyes went to kisten and my panic paused he was gone the floor was empty shaking i peered over the bed to find my love standing calmly at the window staring at the night its beautiful he said softly and my heart broke to hear his familiar voice coming from the mouth of a stranger he was dead kisten was an undead i can see everything hear everything even the mosquitoes over the water he added in wonder and he turned my chest clenched at the familiar smile but the eyes behind it had lost something if he could hear mosquitoes then he had heard me scream and had done nothing his blue eyes were without recognition a confused beautiful angel he didnt know me and my tears wouldnt stop the vampire who had killed him had an irate expression almost bothered you need to leave he said brusquely youre worthless now used up get out one by one the tears fell and i stood not expecting any help from kisten i know you kisten said suddenly and his eyes lit with remembrance my bruised hands clasped at my chest and i closed my eyes weeping they flashed open when his soft touch on my chin came too soon for him to have crossed the room but there he was his head cocked as he puzzled it through i loved you he said with the wonder of the suns first rising and i caught back a sob i love you too i whispered dying inside ivy was right this was hell piscary kisten said confused he told me to kill you but i didnt he smiled and my soul was crushed to nothing by the familiar twinkle in hindsight that might have been a stupid thing to do but it felt right at the time he took my other hand and frowned at my swollen fingers i dont want you to hurt but i dont remember why it took me three times before i could make the words come out youre dead i said softly thats why you dont remember kisten frowned confused it makes a difference my head hurt it was a nightmare a freaking nightmare it shouldnt i whispered i dont remember dying he said then let me go and turned to the vampire who had killed him do i know you he asked and the vampire smiled no you need to leave shes mine and im not sharing your blood needs are not my problem go take a long walk in a short shadow again kisten frowned puzzling it through no he finally said i love her even if i dont remember why i wont let you touch her she doesnt like you i held my breath as i realized what was going to happen shit i was going to be bound either to kisten or to his killer my fear coloring the air i started backing up shell adore me in a few moments the vampire said with a low growl he dropped his head to eye kisten from under his brows and his hair swung forward kisten hunched mimicking him turning into an animal on two legs the beauty and allure were gone it was pure savagery and i was the prize the vampire silently jumped at kisten shifting at the last moment to lunge over his head he was headed right for me eyes wide i ducked swearing when his fist smacked my shoulder and sent me spinning into the wall my head hit and i struggled to focus i started to slide down the wall but propped my feet against the carpet and locked my knees i wouldnt go down if i did i might never get up i watched riveted as the two fought kisten was not as fast but he was ferocious barroom brawls had given him dirty fighting techniques that kept him moving and upright as the attacking vampire struck hard enough to break bones each block and punch did damage that the vampire virus mended get out rachel kisten said calmly when he finally got the vampire pinned in a corner crying i went for my bag instead i had charms in there my numb hand fumbled for something to save kisten to save myself seeing what i was doing the attacking vampire took a hit and lunged at me terrified i dropped the bag i had the bottle of sticky silk in my hand from when i had pasted jenks to my bathroom mirror so he wouldnt follow me i dodged out of the way and sprayed the vampire the man screamed in shock as it hit him squarely in the eyes but he was between me and the door again i tried to edge by and his arm flashed out flinging me into the dresser my gut landed squarely on the edge and my momentum flung my head into the mirror pulse hammering i spun going stockstill when i saw kisten in the other vampires grip his arm around kistens throat in what could easily become a necksnapping grip fear took me again come here or he dies again the vampire said to me and i obediently took a step forward kisten had only one life left kistens eyes were wide you love me he said and i nodded wiping the tears from my eyes so i could see the vampire smiled long and toothy as he held kisten close like a lover it would have been so distracting to take your last blood he said into kistens ear lips brushing the hair that i had once run my fingers through the only thing id have enjoyed more would be to take ivys that bitch but i cant have her he snarled jerking kisten so his feet were on tiptoe for an instant shes piscarys fucking queen but this will hurt i owe her some pain for the years i spent in prison living off scraps and discarded shadows who bleed for anyone killing you is a good start making a puppet out of her roommate is better and when shes a whining bitch with dead eyes and no soul ill move on to ivys sister and then every last person she ever loved kisten became frightened the emotion crossing death where love couldnt leave ivy alone he demanded kistens killers lips brushed his hair youre so young i remember loving someone but they died and now all i have is the purity of nothing my god youre still warm kisten looked at me and from somewhere more tears welled forth we were all so very lost it shouldnt end like this so take my blood instead of hers kisten said and the other vampire laughed right he said sarcastically and shoved kisten away like the poison his blood now was to him kisten gathered himself no he said softly in a voice i had heard only once before on a cold snowy night when hed fought off six black witches i insist he jumped at the vampire the man stumbled arms raised and almost helpless from the shock of the attack kistens fangs flashed still short for an undead but they were enough no the vampire screamed and kistens teeth sank into his neck i stared pressed into the wide windows as kistens killer jammed a palm into kistens chin i heard a sickening snap and kisten fell he hit the floor convulsing before he even found the carpet the other vampire clutched his neck and stomach as he staggered to the door i heard him stumble down the hall fleeing as he fell into dry heaves the boat rocked and i heard a splash kisten i dropped down beside him dragging his head up into my lap the convulsions slowed and i wiped his face with my hands his mouth was red with blood but it wasnt his it was his killers and now they both would die nothing could save him the undead couldnt feed upon each other the virus attacked itself and both would die kisten no i sobbed dont do this to me kisten you sweet idiot look at me his eyes opened and i stared breathless into their precious blue depths the haze of death quavered and cleared my chest clenched as i saw a moment of lucidity return to him as he teetered on his final true death dont cry he said his hand touching my cheek as he looked up and it was kisten he was himself and he remembered why he loved im sorry im going to die and so will that fucking bastard if i got enough of my saliva into him he wont be able to harm you or ivy ivy this was going to destroy her kisten please dont leave me i said my tears spotting his face his hand fell from my cheek and i grabbed it holding it to me im glad youre here he said his eyes closing as he took a breath i didnt mean to make you cry you should have left with me you dummy i sobbed his skin was hot to the touch and he convulsed once and took a rasping breath i couldnt stop it he was dying in my arms and i couldnt stop it yeah he whispered his finger twitching against my jaw where i held it sorry kisten please dont leave me i begged and his eyes opened im cold he said fear rising in his blue eyes i held him tighter im holding you its going to be okay tell ivy he said with a gasp clenching in on himself tell ivy that it wasnt her fault and tell her that at the endyou remember love i dont thinkwe lose our soulsat all i think god keeps them for us until wecome home i love you rachel i love you too kisten i sobbed and as i watched his eyes memorizing my face silvered and he died thirtytwo somewhere i could hear mia and holly each screaming different lyrics to the same song of frustrated anger and loss the smooth rhythm of the fibs miranda serving as a background chorus my eyes opened and it took me a moment to focus on the moving patterns of light playing over the ugly cement walls and ceilings the tight chatter of twoways was loud and the room was echoing mias tirade and hollys unhappy complaints being the least of the noise i bolted upright going dizzy when i clutched the blue fib blanket draped over me people were everywhere ignoring me flashing their lights up and down the tunnel pointing their weapons at mia as they read her her rights she was being led away by is agents and ford was standing across the room with holly the little girl wasnt happy but ford was holding her with impunity his expression was pained for his part in separating mother and child but with him able to touch holly the walker wouldnt have her beside me on the cold cement floor like an offering was my splat gun my eyes widened as i saw it and a second wave of vertigo took me as i remembered oh god kistens dead bile rose and i fell into dry heaves i tried to rise but never made it up too dizzy to get off my hands and knees when i rolled over to try to stand no one noticed me fascinated by mias threats and struggles as she was pulled up the stairway like a wet wildcat four undead vampires holding her leash two before two behind so she couldnt touch anyone their policy of ignoring her had shifted forced by the fib to take action staring past my stringy hair at the filthy floor i struggled to breathe to work the memory of kistens death into my existence but it hurt like a broken knife across my soul ah crap im crying now i looked at my hand half expecting to see it pulped and bruised but only als cut was there holly mia wailed as if giving my grief voice and i looked past my lank hair at her shocked by the fear coming from the woman we were all having a fabulous new year fords words rose above hollys soft crying stilling the womans struggles your daughter is beautiful ms harbor he said easily containing the little girls struggles and the vampires pulling at her paused i will protect her with my life shes mine mia cried out distress turning her from a powercrazed banshee to a mother watching her child being taken from her and the tears pricked again for holly this time shes your child ford said calmly im holding her in trust and i will not turn her against you shesmy sanity mia she quiets the emotions that hurt me she will never want for emotion around me and i will not twist her against you as the walker would have mias face was stark with fear but under it was hope she wont have my daughter ford shifted holly to a more comfortable position never the paperwork is being pushed through unless walker can prove that shes related to holly she doesnt have a chance banshee or not i will have custody of holly until youre able to become her mother again and ill bring her to see you whenever you ask and remus if they will let me as long as i am alive that woman will not have her holly mia said tremulously her voice holding only love and the little girl turned her pale skin red from tears ford moved close and mother and child touched one last time tears leaked from mia and she brushed them away shocked to find them wet my daughter she whispered then pulled her hand back when the two vampires in the lead gave a tug ford backed behind the security of the armed fib officers its not forever he said you killed people to make your life easier making your task of finding enough emotion to raise your child simple rather than the chore it rightfully should be if you live in society you have to live by its rules those same rules will let you go if youre willing to abide by them right now holly is safe you wont get her away from me without killing me or those who watch you kill me and the walker will have holly when they catch you againand we will catch you there are too many of us and we know what to look for now mia nodded she looked back only once as she headed up the stairs the two is agents before and behind her her eyes were black with tears that turned silver as she wept for herself the tension in the room dropped i moved to sit against the wall in an angry motion i pulled my knees to my chin and not caring what anyone thought i put my head down and cried the wool of my coat rough against my scraped cheek kisten he had died to save my life he killed himself to keep me alive rachel there was the rasp of dress shoes head down and hair covering my vision i shoved whoever it was away but they came right back thin masculine fingers landed on my shoulder gripping briefly then falling away someone smelling of cookies and aftershave eased himself down to sit beside me with his back to the wall i could hear hollys soft fussing and i figured it was ford wiping my nose on the corner of the blue blanket i snuck a look ford said nothing gazing over the fib people as they packed up and started moving out the show was over apparently id woken in time for the last act ford sighed when he noticed me looking at him and making sure holly couldnt touch me he reached into a coat pocket and pulled out a package of handi wipes i sniffed loudly as he worked one free and handed it to me taking it i held my breath and leaned my head back against the wall as i washed the dust and tears from my face the soap stinging against my scraped face and cut finger i took a breath and the clean smell went right to my core pulling some of the pain away either that or just walling it off the tight band around my chest seemed to ease and i could breathe again you okay ford asked and i shrugged feeling as miserable as holly looked im alive i thought as i clenched the wipe into a tiny ball im okay i sighed exhaling as if it were my last breath but i took another then another the thought of fords presence with mine as i remembered surfaced and his promise that i wouldnt have to live through it alone is ivy here i breathed i had to tell her id tell edden too but not until ivy and i had a chance to deal with this first upstairs talking to the is my wandering gaze landed on an fib agent tagging and bagging pierces clothes and my nylons they could have them for all i cared and toms abduction wasnt my fault how did they find me i asked tired ford smiled and holly leaned against him in exhaustion quiet at last your locator amulets and footprints in the snow apparently your feet must be freezing i nodded glad i had the blanket to rest them on my gaze rose from the lumps my feet made to find his eyes remembering him taking holly for the first time tears flowing in relief as she devoured every last emotion he had but his own you can hold her i said my heart aching that something good might come from this holly i mean even when shes upset walker wasnt going to get holly after all and wouldnt she be pleased about that fords gaze was beautiful when he looked at the sleeping little girl she absorbs everything before it gets to me he said his voice carrying awe i dont really need to hold her just be close but im not going to put her on the floor i smiled and tugged the blanket up higher around my shoulders it was freezing down here i was glad for ford but i was cold bitterly disillusioned and aching from a memory id thought i wouldnt have to deal with the last of the fib guys was leaving and i gathered myself hey you probably have a diaper to change huh i said as i got to my feet dizzy i put a hand to the wall to find my balance my stomach clenched and i sat back down fast mia had stripped my aura again damn it you want a stretcher ford asked and after i reluctantly nodded he went to talk to one of the departing fib officers i couldnt make it up the stairs like this pride be damned slowly the dizziness abated and i concentrated on breathing as i looked over the room i wasnt sure how i was going to explain pierces clothes toms abduction was going to be even harder it wasnt like i could pretend he hadnt been here both ford and mia had seen him that al had taken both of them was not going to look good for me at all damn it i am so not going to take the blame for this ford came back as the last fib agent headed upstairs setting mias lantern by me he sank back down with holly to wait this is unbelievable he said i dont know for sure what youre feeling i can see it in your face but not feeling it thats freaky he dropped his eyes as i noticed they were filling with emotion hes not dead anymore you know the shadows shifted as i banked the lantern to focus the light ahead and toward the stairs tom i said glad he couldnt feel my emotions while he was holding holly it had to be tom he was talking about kisten was gone gone gone and id just relived his death i know al took him a pang of fear hit me fear that if the is knew they would use it against me not tom ford said and my head jerked up tom is dead i felt him die im talking about pierce startled i turned to him al snagged him i said broke the charm and took him his clothes were right over there fords smile widened and he shifted the sleeping child higher that wasnt tom the demon pulled into the everafter it was pierce this wasnt making sense and i just stared at him hunched in the blue fib blanket your potion was targeted to pierce ford explained tom died and al used your summoning charm to force pierce into his body i felt toms emotions die pierces emotions took their place coming from toms body id know his thought signature anywhere hes a unique individual i looked to where pierces clothes had been a chill rippling through me as i shivered thats black magic i whispered hearing it echo in the tunnels behind me like sin itself it was my spell i didnt know it was black it was in a university textbook ford leaned back against the wall clearly not bothered it was your spell and it was white but the demon perverted it he loves you you know al i yelped and ford laughed holly smiled in her sleep and the mans face calmed no pierce i was dizzy from my outburst and i looked at the stairway wishing they would hurry kisten had loved me pierce was a teen crush pierce doesnt even know me i said softly heart aching except for that one night god i was eighteen ford shrugged it would explain your troubled history with men you saw what you wanted at eighteen and no one now is measuring up i sighed i was sitting on my butt on the cold dusty concrete waiting for a stretcher and he was analyzing me ford i dont love pierce it was teenage infatuation attraction to a charismatic power i lovedkisten i know his hand touched my shoulder shocking me im sorry i turned away forcing my thoughts from kisten lest i start to cry again pierce had a deal going with al probably about getting a body in return for service i felt my face scrunch in hopelessness and i helped how nice is that i dont even know why he did it he was better off as a ghost i looked to the stairway there was the distinct possibility they might forget we were down here i told you why ford said grimacing as he shifted hollys weight he loves you i guess he figured being a familiar to your demon and having a body was better than being a ghost without one in your graveyard give the man a break rachel hes been hanging around your church for almost a year a smile threatened then disappeared i was cold dizzy and numb from thoughts of kisten it stank down here like cold dust like kistens killer all i wanted was to go home and take a bath i think they forgot us i said help me up ford grunted getting to his feet holly cooed in her sleep as he extended his free hand and i slowly found my balance leaning against the wall until i was sure i wouldnt fall over the cement was cold on my feet and i shifted to stand on a corner of the blanket well take it slow he said clearly unused to hollys unfamiliar weight yeah i whispered my thoughts turning to him and the relief holly was giving him it was beautiful and i wondered if ford was truly a human or a very rare type of inderlander who hadnt been discovered yet one who balanced out a banshee vampires balanced weres pixies balanced fairies witchesokay maybe there wasnt anything to balance banshees either unless witches balanced out demons ford i said as we started for the stairs mias light bobbing im happy for you he smiled that blissful smile again when he glanced over his shoulder me too shes a gift and ill have to give her back someday but even this little bit is heaven ill try to repay mia by teaching holly what love is i can show her that though i believe mia and remus were already doing that admirably in their own way my pace bobbled when ivys and eddens voices filtered down the stairs kisten had died to save us both to keep some lameass vampire from screwing our lives up any more than they already were and he had loved us enough to give his life in exchange for ours how could i tell ivy my strength pooled out of me and blinking fast i stopped slumping against a pillar ford looked uneasy rachel youre a good person he said from out of the blue surprising me remember that justdont worry about the next few hours i stared at him becoming frightened what did he know that i didnt call me tomorrow if you need to talk he said before i could ask theres nothing that will ever make me think youre not a good person thats whats important rachel who we love and what we do for them a last smile and he started up the stairs with holly i heard him speak to ivy and edden on the stairs and then ivys familiar steps continued down she rounded the bottom of the steps and i smiled thinly when her pace quickened are you okay kisten i thought and my eyes teared yeah i said softly and she stood there looking helpless throat thick i gave her a hug and this time ivy returned it her grip almost pressing the air from me my first startled reaction shifted to heartache and i hugged her back my eyes closed and my heart clenched all the harder her vampire incense lifted through me soothing and exciting at the same time you scared me she said when she let go and backed up a step edden was now behind her playing his flashlight over the ceiling i dont like it when you tag someone without backup jenks said you tore out of there like a bat out of hell is he okay i asked and she let go head bobbing as she wiped her eyes my own tears threatened as i tried to find the words to tell her i remembered kistens death thoughts of him were ringing from one ear to the other making me dizzy knowing something was wrong ivy took my arm and didnt let go wheres pierce she asked as her eyes lingered on the scrape on my cheek my thoughts went to tom hanging in the demons grip and i hesitated had it really been pierce either way tom was gone and mia had seen the entire thing misreading my sudden worry ivy said al took him didnt he i shook my head yes no it wasnt my fault i said and edden squinted at me rachel the fib officer warned as he took the lantern and gestured to the stairs tell me now or ill make you fill out paperwork i swallowed hard and shifted my feet because of the cold the stairs were only thirty steps awayit looked like a mile my finger throbbed where al had cut it and i curled my hands into fists tom bansen was down here he was working a deal with walker to get holly he saw ford touch holly so he thought she was safe holly killed him edden grunted where is he corpses just dont get up and walk away yes they do ivy said and i leaned heavily on her arm as i looked up the long stairway forcing my breath to stay even i decided a little lie wouldnt hurt anyone no one needed to know id made the spell that put pierce inside the shunned witch al got him breathing again and dragged him off i said softly eddens mouth dropped open but ivy snorted its not my fault i protested crap i was tired and as edden winced i started for the stairs muttering im going home i wanted to move fast but it was barely a crawl as ivy and i shuffled along the light swung in eddens grip as he waited for us to actually reach the stairs i want a statement before you leave he said and i made a noise of disgust hours id be here for freaking hours if i had to give a statement beside and a little behind us edden played his light over the tunnel so this is how remus and mia did it he said gazing back at the vaulted ceilings going shadowy behind us i hoped thered be someone upstairs in a hospital coat if i moaned enough theyd cart me out of here and i could slip away statement or not how they did what i asked wincing when my foot found a chunk of concrete edden took my other arm and gestured to the tunnel stretching into the black how they kept slipping through our lines he explained i nodded head down as i walked between them what are these anyway a vamp underground i never knew this was down here its an old masstransit plan started in the s he said sounding like an instructor as the walls of the stairway closed in around us too little money too much political infighting unexpected structural damage when they drained the canal a war and a depression it never got finished some of the tunnels are filled in but stretches of it still exist here and there its cheaper to inspect them once a year than destroy them some carry water pipes now and mia would know because she was here when it was built i said sourly edden chuckled id be willing to bet she was on the committee to beautify it or something making a little grunt of remembrance he thumbed the twoway on his belt and said loudly hey someone call utilities and tell them we need a new lock out here and then to me rachel im not one to say i told you so a flash of anger lit through me then ill say it for you i snapped as my foot almost slipped off the stair i told you so she is a bad seed a spoiled brat with a goddess complex she wants to live above the law and i should have treated her like an animal and gunned her down on sight heart pounding i shut my mouth and concentrated on the next step and yet you stopped her with just your earth magic edden said completely unruffled as he took my other arm youre becoming a superhero witch i winced as i remembered hollys plaintive cries for her mama when theyd hauled mia upstairs roped like a tiger thats funny i said sourly i so totally feel like crap no one said anything another step behind me i took a breath and let it out we were almost to the top and all i wanted was to go home edden can i give my statement later eye to eye with me he nodded go home ill send someone tomorrow after noon right i reminded him wobbling when the stairway opened up and the tight confines of the small room took us the cold was worse up here and i clenched my coat closer id never be warm again you okay rachel ivy asked i exhaled heavily thinking of jenks and missing his support making a face i leaned harder on ivys arm and started to shake i was cold my feet were numb and would probably have cuts when they thawed out and kistens death once safely removed from my mind had reached out and bitchslapped me with all its broken promises and shattered beauty no i said wondering if id have to walk all the way back to the coffee shop in my bare feet edden followed my gaze to my bruised white toes and after murmuring something about socks he set the lantern down and left me with ivy alone at last i caught ivys eyes she saw my fear and they dilated while i was unconscious i remembered the night on kistens boat i whispered all of it ivys breath caught outside i could hear edden on his radio yelling for a car to come the hell back and pick us up i swallowed hard barely able to force the words out kistens murderer had been in the tunnels before he came to take kistens last blood i said my soul as cold as the snow drifting in thats what ive been smelling i added as i dismally brushed at the filth on me its this damned dust hed been in it and it was all over him ivy didnt move tell me she demanded her eyes black and her long hands clenched i gave her an evaluating look wondering if this might be better at home with some wine or even in a car with some privacy but if she was going to vamp out id rather have a few dozen fib agents with guns around voice low i said the vampire had come for kisten and i was in the way kisten died from a blow to the head before the vamp could do more than sniff his blood he was really mad i said my voice going high so i wouldnt start crying again as i remembered his grip on me and my helpless rage but then he decided to make me his shadow to hurt you kisten woke up blinking fast i wiped the sting of tears from my scraped cheek as i remembered his confused eyes and his angelic grace he was beautiful ivy i said crying he was innocent and savage he remembered he loved me and on that alone he tried to save me save us the only way he could remember jenks said i told him kisten bit his attacker he did it to save us ivy he died in my arms as his attacker ran away my voice broke and i went silent i couldnt tell her the rest not here not now ivy blinked fast it almost looked like panic in her slowly widening pupils he killed himself to save you she asked because he loved you i clenched my jaw not me us he chose to sacrifice the rest of his existence to save both of us that vampire hates you ivy he was going on and on about how you were piscarys queen and he couldnt touch you but killing kisten wasnt enough and how he was going to make you pay for his going to jail and living off discarded shadows for five years ivy backed up frightened she put a hand to her throat it wasnt someone who went to visit piscary it was someone who was in jail at the same time she whispered her eyes went utterly black in the dim shadows of the lanternlit room and i stifled a shiver the psycho was going to kill everyone you had ever loved including your sister just to hurt you after kisten bit him he ran away he fell off the boat kisten didnt know if he got enough saliva in him to start a rejection of the virus he might still be alive i dont know drained my voice trailed off at the end for a moment ivy said nothing then she turned to the door yanking it open with enough force to send it crashing into the wall edden she shouted into the snowy darkness i know who killed kisten hes down here bring me another flashlight thirtythree its art its got to be art ivy said as she paced beside me in the empty tunnel fretting at my slow pace wed make faster time if she carried me but that wasnt going to happen why are we just now hearing about him edden asked and i blanched as she turned her angerblack eyes to him because im a stupid ass she said caustically any more questions i dont understand why you didnt recognize his scent i said to distract her but having her glaring at me wasnt a vast improvement ivy took a slow breath the shadows of mias lantern moved with us making it seem as if we werent moving at all edden had his own flashlight and i was shaking too much to hold one the fib captain had predictably wanted us to wait for a car but ivy was predictably so sure she knew where he was that she headed down before they could get back here so of course we predictably went with her at least i had eddens socks on now something i hadnt predicted but greatly appreciated slowly ivy eased her tension and once calm she answered it was five years ago and smells change especially when you go from living in a nice house in the city to a dank hole in the ground he was my is supervisor ivy clenched her jaw seeing not the darkness ahead of us but her past fidgeting so subtly that only jenks or i would notice i told you remember i put him in jail for one of piscarys accidental deaths so i wouldnt have to sleep with him to move up in the is hierarchy my eyes narrowed and edden took an aggressive stance yyou he stammered thats not legal he added ivy was nonplussed unvoiced thoughts flitting behind her eyes she glanced at me and said vampires have a different outlook on legal it was making a lot of ugly sense and a slow burn of anger took root as i hiked my coat closer and put one cold foot before the other the deeper we went the thicker the dust and dirt were so you put him in jail for piscarys crimes and then got demoted to me huh ivy jerked mouth open in embarrassment she said it wasnt like that yes it was i said hearing the bitterness as my words echoed back i was your punishment no one puts a witch working with a vampire i wasnt blind those first few weeks until youlightened up i was shivering violently but i wasnt going to go back and wait in a car shadows on her face ivy looked at me i could have gone to the arcane i chose to be a runner that i was assigned to you is one of the best things in my life edden cleared his throat uncomfortably and my face warmed what could i say to that sorry i muttered and she looked ahead ivy eddens voice was tired wed been walking for a good five minutes his radio wasnt working and i knew he wasnt happy no one is down here i understand your desire to search but they inspect the tunnels every year if there was a vampire here living or dead they would have found evidence of it by now ivy glared at him as if he might turn around and walk off who inspects the tunnels she said determination etched on her tight brow the fib humans inderlanders made these tunnels as much as humans did there will be oubliettes for destitute vampires a place to hide before hope is abandoned to the sun art is down here ive been searching the city for three months i wasnt looking for him but if he was around someone would have seen him her face went frighteningly still its the only place left edden stopped placing his feet wide tucking his flashlight under his arm and becoming immovable he took a breath and suddenly ivy was right in front of him surprised he let his breath out and backed up a step dont think youre big enough to get me to go upstairs so you can come down here and find him yourself she said softly you wont find the safe hole without me if you ask the is for help they will walk right on by and come back without you later she was right and i shifted to stand on my other foot as edden thought about it clearly bothered he exhaled long and slow okay five more minutes we started off again ivy bolting ahead before she remembered me and slowed down i ought to be in carew tower partying the new year in but no here i was slogging under the city looking for a dead vampire anger was what was keeping me moving now ford had said i was a good person it was what i wanted to be i wasnt so sure anymore that he was right with no warning ivys head came up and she stopped breathing deeply the lantern in her grip swung to make fast shadows and the whisper of our feet echoed eerily as edden and i stopped adrenaline jabbed me my roommate smelled the air backtracking a few steps with her hand running at shoulder height along the uniform wall her eyes were black in the gloom and i picked up the lantern when she set it down to run both hands against the stone close she whispered and i stifled a shudder when she moved to the other side of the tunnels wall with that vampire speed here my heart pounded at the raw hatred in her voice edden and i came nearer lights held high my shadow stretched behind me and i shivered again the wall looked utterly unmarked apart from a small indentation where someone had chipped a hunk of stone away but if it was a vampire oubliette it wouldnt have a neon arrow pointing to it it was going to be a secret door and it was likely locked ivy put her fingers in the indentation and pulled nothing happened her head came up and she tossed the hair from her cold dark eyes damn she was ready to vamp out please get this door open for me rachel she whispered okay if it was a door she couldnt open it was going to be witch magic which meant i was going to have to cut my finger or tap a line my thumb felt the rough edges of the cut on my finger as i thought drawing blood while she was like this was not a good idea but tapping a line was going to hurt i looked at the door and placed a hand on it speak friend and enter ran through my mind and i choked back a bark of laughter nice i said when a quiver in my middle brought forth a twin pull from the magic stored in the door the wall had been built with a ley line charm in it buried in the concrete was one hell of a charmed circle of iron id have to tap a line my hand dropped and i got a sick feeling whatever was behind the door was going to be nasty its a charmed door i said glancing from ivy to edden and the squat man frowned whats that he asked looking defensive i shifted uneasily just what it sounds like remember when i told you that all inderland magic runs on witch magic i thought of the elves and added mostly anyway vampires love witch magic they use it to look young after they die to call demons to beat up helpless witches and when they want to hide themselves they use it to lock themselves in i was going to have to tap a freaking ley line but a little pain would be a small payment for finding kistens killer edden tucked his flashlight under his arm and angled it to the line between the wall and the floor there was a shifting of dust to show where the door had been opened once how long ago was up for debate invisible unless you were looking hand shaking i put my palm against the smooth rock the fib captains bulk shifted to take an aggressive stance by the door edden i complained if there is an undead vampire in there he will kill you before the door even finishes opening ugly but true back up the fib captain frowned just open the door morgan your funeral i muttered then took a deep breath this was going to hurt my fingers were numb from the cold and they cramped as i pressed them deeper into the stone taking a breath and gritting my teeth against the coming pain i locked my knees and tapped a line i gasped jerking straight as the line hit me i tried not to but i did rachel ivy said close and concerned my stomach was rolling and i panted to keep from vomiting the undulating surges of power from the nearby line were making me seasick and every nerve felt the power grating across it fine i gasped unable to even think of the right words there were three charms that were generally used and my dad had taught me them all plus one that wasnt used except for the most dire situations oh god this was awful i took a heaving breath and held it fighting to think past the pain and dizziness ivys cool hand touched my shoulder and my breath exploded out as i felt her aura slip to cover me soothing im sorry ivy shouted her hand leaving me and i almost fell when the pain returned no i said as i reached to grasp her hand and the pain again vanished youre helping i said watching her fear that shed hurt me replaced with wonder it doesnt hurt when im touching you dont let go please there in the lamplit dark she swallowed hard and her fingers in mine became firmer it wasnt perfect i could still feel the waves of ley line coming at me but at least it wasnt so raw and the agony across my nerves was muted my thoughts returned to last halloween when she had bitten me that last time our auras had become one before she lost it was i seeing a lingering effect of that were ivys and my auras the same able to protect each other when one was compromised was it love edden stood beside us not sure of anything and taking a steadying breath i put my free hand more firmly on the door quod est ante pedes nemo spectat i whispered and nothing happened i shifted my feet quis custodiet ipsos custodes i tried again and still nothing edden scuffed his feet rachel its okay my hand quivered nil tam difficile est quin quaerendo investigari possit that one did it and i pulled my hand back when i felt a quiver of response rise up from the charm buried in the cement and ping through my soul nothing is so hard that it cant be found by searching it figured that it would be that one i stepped back and dropped the line and ivy searched my face before she let go of my hand and i fisted it edden put his fingers into the curve of the handle and pulled the door cracked and ivy flung herself back with her hand over her face holy crap i exclaimed gagging and falling back as well i almost tripped edden as he reared back at the stench the light from the lantern showed eddens expression twisted in distaste whatever was in there was long dead and anger started trickling in kisten had succeeded in killing our attacker now who would i yell at hold this the fib captain said as he shoved the flashlight at me i set my lantern down and took it edden pulled the door farther open to show a black archway and little else the stench rolled out old and putrid it wasnt the smell of decay which would have been muted from the cold and perhaps sheer time but the stink of vampire death that lingered until the sun or wind had a chance to disperse it it was incense gone bad decaying flowers spoiled musk and dead sea salt we couldnt go in it was that bad it was as if all the oxygen had been replaced with thick poisonous decaying oil edden took his flashlight back holding a hand across his nose he played the light over the floor to find the edges of the room i stayed where i was but ivy came forward to stand at the threshold her face was damp from tears and her expression was blank edden moved to get his shoulder in front of hers but it was the smell that was keeping her out not his presence the floor was the same dustcolored stone and the walls were cement a black scum stained the floor crinkled and cracked the color of old blood edden followed it to the wall to find scratches gouged in the concrete neither of you go in there edden said then gagged from the deep breath he had taken to say the words i nodded and he quickly played the light over the rest of the room it was a nasty hole of a place with a madeup cot and a cardboard box table on the bare floor beside another smaller puddle of dried blood was the body of a big black man faceup and spreadeagled he had on a lightweight shirt open to show that his throat had been completely torn out his lower body cavity had been opened as well almost as if an animal had been at him though i expected the small mounds of something piled beside him were probably his insides i couldnt tell if he had been attacked while not wearing any pants or if his attacker had eaten through them vampires didnt do this at least not that id heard and this wasnt the man who id remembered at kistens boat eddens light shook as i held it on the body damn it it had all been for nothing is that art edden asked and i shook my head its denon ivy said and my gaze jerked from the corpse to her and back again denon i gasped feeling my gore rise eddens light dropped away god help him i think it is i leaned against the wall as my knees went wobbly thats why i hadnt seen him lately if denon had been arts scion assigning ivy to his stable of runners would make it really easy to watch her and insulting to assign her to me the cot ivy said her hand over her face bring your light to the cot i think its a body on there im notsure i came close and carefully angled the lanterns light to the cot but my hand was shaking and it wasnt clear edden had known denon had a friendly rivalry with him finding him torn apart was hard i heard him take a shallow breath and his light found the bed as well i squinted trying to figure out what i was seeing what had first looked like a bundle of forgotten clothes and strapsshit i whispered as my mind shifted and it made sense it was a gray grotesquely twisted body the bones warped into unnatural curves as the two viruses had fought for control each trying to make the vampire into its version of perfection pale white parchment skin had flaked off in sheets drifting slightly in the draft that opening the door had created the black hair was puddled around the skull and there were no eyes in the sockets gazing at the ceiling canines twice as long as a normal vampires spouted from the jaw the mouth had been ripped wide and the jaw was hanging at a broken angle a hand with several fingers missing hung from the corner of it god had he done it to himself ivy jerked and i swung the light wildly as she tried to go in edden grunted grabbing her arm and using her momentum to fling her to the opposite wall of the tunnel she hit with a thump her eyes wide and angry but he had his arm under her chin and wasnt letting up stay out of that room he shouted pinning her to the wall his voice echoing in what sounded like pity you are not going in there ivy i dont care if you kill me you are not going in thatfilthyhe took a gasping breath trying to find wordscesspit of a hole he finished tears shining in his eyes youre better than that he finished you have nothing to do with that perversion its not you ivy wasnt trying to move if shed wanted to she could have broken his arm without a thought tears shimmered in the light as i angled the flashlight down kisten died because of something i did she said anger shifting to pain and now i cant do anything to make the hurt go away hes dead art even took that from me what are you going to do edden shouted at her his voice echoing the vampire is dead you cant get revenge from a dead body you want to tear him apart and throw chunks of him at the wall hes dead let it go or it will ruin your life and then he wins again ivy was crying silently edden was right but i didnt know how to convince her of it edden snatched the lantern from me and turned look at that ivy he said shining it directly on the corpse look at that and tell me that is a victory she tensed as if to scream but then the tears flowed and she gave up arms wrapped around herself she whispered the son of a bitch the fucking son of a bitch both of them the deep chill took the core of my being as i stared at the twisted pieces of what remained the dusty scent of arts fingers on me was heavy in my memory as i looked at his broken hand and the flesh pulled tight to the bone i could feel his touch on my throat my wrist it had been a hard death leaving him mummified a gross caricature of twisted limbs and contorted bones as the two strains of vampire virus fought for control breaking him until he couldnt survive even as an undead it was easy to imagine what had happened dying from the undead blood kisten had given him art called his scion denon died by accident or design as art tried to gain enough strength to fight off kistens undead blood no wonder ivy wanted a way out this was ugly edden let the light fall from the cot his eyes were tired as he flicked it off and only mias lantern lit the tunnel he looked at ivys raw misery then hiked his belt up to try to find a semblance of his usual demeanor well let the room air out then get a shoe for a print match were done here ivy was against the wall staring at the black doorway he never would have touched kisten if it hadnt been for me no i said firmly kisten said it wasnt your fault he said it ivy told me to tell you setting the lantern down i crossed the tunnel my shadow blanketing her he said so i repeated as i touched her shoulder finding her ice cold her eyes were black but they werent looking at me they were focused on the dark hole across from us ivy if you take this on your conscience it will be one of the dumbest things ive ever seen you do that got through to her and her gaze flicked to me he didnt blame you i said as i gave her bicep a squeeze if he did he wouldnt have sacrificed his life to kill the bastard for you and me both he loved me ivy but it was thinking of you that made his decision he did it because he loved you ivys expression cracked and her face twisted in pain i loved him she shouted voice echoing i loved him and theres nothing i can do to prove it art is dead she said gesturing piscary is dead i cant do anything to prove i loved kisten this isnt fair rachel i want to hurt someone and no one is left edden shifted uneasily my throat was tight i wanted to hug her and tell her that it was going to be okay but it wasnt there was no one to take revenge on no one to point to and say i know what you did and you are shit for it that piscary was dead and art was a twisted corpse didnt come close to being enough ladies edden prompted gesturing down the tunnel with his light ill get a forensics team down here tonight once we are sure of the identities ill let you know he took a step to leave hesitating to make sure we would follow clearly exhausted ivy pushed herself from the wall piscary gave kisten to art as compensation for me putting him in jail it was political god i hate my life i stared at the black hole in the wall tension rising in me she was right kisten had died in a political power play his bright soul just starting to learn its own strength had been snuffed out to soothe an ego and bring ivy to her knees revenge i might have understood but this whispering goodbye to kisten ivy dropped her head and passed me i didnt move staring at the black hole eddens hand fell on my shoulder you need to get warmed up i jerked out from under him warmed up good idea i wasnt ready to walk away kistens soul was at rest because he had fought back and won but what about those of us who were left behind what about ivy and me didnt we have the right to satisfaction too my heart pounded and i clenched my jaw i am not going to live with this pain ivys boots scuffed to a stop and edden squinted suspiciously at me shaking i pointed at the dark hole im not going to let the is cover this up put them in the ground with pretty headstones and dignified names and dates and say that kisten was murdered to further someones political agenda ivy shook her head it makes no difference it made a difference to me the room was cloaked in black hiding the depravity of what happened when a lifetime was spent afraid of death when ones entire existence was bent to the selfish desires of the self when the soul was exchanged for the mindless drive to survive real lives were ruined in the wake of these ugly caricatures of power kistens soul lost just as he found the strength in himself ivy winding the noose tighter in her attempts to find peace darkness wouldnt cover this up i wanted the room bright bright with a savage truth so that it would never be consigned to the shelter of the earth rachel ivy asked and shaking i tapped a line it touched me tearing my thin aura like a flame i went down on a knee but gritting my teeth i stood letting the pain flow through me accepting it celero inanio i shouted giving the force an outlet of a black charm gesture id seen al do it how hard could it be the line roared into me pulled by the charm agony flamed and i convulsed refusing to let go of the line as the spell worked rachel ivy shouted and i fell back at the whitelight explosion in the middle of the room my hair blew back then shifted forward as the air in the room burnt itself out and new rushed in to replace it like heaven itself the glory of fire burned white a tiny spot of black at the center of my rage i fell to my knees eyes fixed on the doorway and the hard stone going unnoticed as my knees bruised and then ivy had me her arms cushioned me and i gasped not at their icy softness but at the sudden cessation of pain from the line she had me again and her aura protected me filtering the worst of it you stupid witch she said bitterly as she held me what the hell are you doing i stared up at her the line cool and clean in me are you sure you cant feel anything i questioned not believing her aura was protecting me from this just my heart breaking let it go rachel not yet i said and with her arms around me i pointed at the hellhole celero inanio i said again stop ivy shouted and i screamed as her hands left me and the pain bent me double i gasped feeling my lungs burn but i couldnt let it go it wasnt done yet the cot burst into flame a glowing haze of orange hovering over it looking like a body contorting in torment the blood on the floor was a puff of black that whirled up as more air was sucked in to replace that which was burnt ivys hands found me from behind and i took a clean breath as the pain was muted and i could bear it again please dont let go i said tears of pain and heartache trickling down and i felt her nod celero inanio i cried again my tears evaporating as they fell to make glittering sparkles of salt and still the rage burned in me pulsing in time with my heart the ley line streamed in like vengeance burning trying to take me with it like a mindless flood i could smell my hair starting to burn the scrape on my cheek felt like fire rachel stop ivy screamed but i could see the sparkle of kistens eyes in the flames smiling at meand i couldnt a shadow darted between me and the roaring inferno the heat beat at me as it blinked past i could hear edden swearing and then the stone door shifting a sliver of cool shade touched my knee crept up my leg and kissed the edge of my cheek i leaned into it as the band of white vengeance narrowed my balance left me and i collapsed but i held on to the line it was the only clean thing i had ivy gave me a little shake to bring my attention to her her eyes were black with fear and i loved her let go of the line she pleaded her tears burning as they hit me rachel let go of the line please i blinked let go of the line the tunnel was plunged into darkness as edden finally got the door shut a wave of cold air burned my skin my eyes slowly recognized the outline of her face as she held me eddens silhouette grew more defined as a red glow became brighter showing where the wall was thinnest at the door my fire still raged behind it and the glow of the heat lit the tunnel with a soft haze eddens shape stared at the door his hands on his hips sweet mother of jesus he breathed then drew his hand back when he went to touch the lines the spell had etched in the door i could see the bright ring of the charmed circle of iron embedded in the door radiating out from it were black threads making a spiral pentagram with arcane symbols in the middle was my handprint and it was molding to the spell making it wholly mine no one would open the door again hes gone let it go ivy shouted and this time i did i gasped as the power shut off jerking as the cold swarmed in to replace the heat i clenched in on myself whispering i take it i take it i take it before the imbalance could strike me tears leaked out through my clenched eyes as i felt the ugly black slither over me like a cool silk sheet it had been a black curse but i had used it without thought even so the tears werent for me they were for kisten silence apart from my rasping breaths my chest hurt it felt like it was burning nothing flowed in me i was a burntout shell everything was silent as if the sounds themselves had been turned to ash can you stand it was ivy and i blinked at her unable to answer edden leaned over us and i cried out in pain when his arms slipped between ivy and me raising me up as if i were a child oh shit rachel he said when i fought back a wave of nausea you look like youve got a bad sunburn it was worth it i whispered my lips were cracked and my eyebrows felt singed when i touched them the wall was still glowing as edden shifted into motion a spiderweb of black was etching through the door turning the rock silver as it cooled it was the curse that i had spoken slowly lightening like stretch marks as the stone cooled the door was fused shut and my mark would warn anyone away from tampering with it not that i thought there was anything behind the door now i caught my breath in pain when edden almost tripped and my tender skin was rubbed ivy touched my arm as if needing to reassure herself that i was okay was that a ley line she asked hesitantly you did that with power right off a line right my chest hurt and i hoped i hadnt damaged my lungs yeah i said softly thank you for cushioning it you have that kind of power all the time she said almost a whisper i went to nod then thought better of it when my skin pulled yes the memory of the black magic symbol etched on the door rose through my thoughts so it was a black charm so what i might be a black witch but at least i was an honest one edden slowly carried me back to the surface silent but for his breathing everyone who knew kisten had been murdered to satisfy a political agenda was either dead or in this hallway my love would be remembered for dying to save ivys and my life that was why he had died not because of someones whim that was who kisten was had been and no one would ever say different thirtyfour though my mom was hundreds of miles away by now my room still smelled like her light lavender perfume wafting up from the dusty boxes stacked where robbie had left them beside my bed it had been nice of him to bring them all in while mom showed me the brochure of the apartment she had waiting for her in portland kneeling beside my bed i pulled the top box to me reading my adolescent scrawl before i shoved the box aside to take to the brat pack at the hospital later the moving van had shown up at my moms house yesterday and i was tired of packing peanuts and bubble wrap depressed by all the goodbyes mom and robbie had brought the last of my things over early this afternoon waking me up and taking me out for a bon voyage breakfast at an oldlady eatery since by robbies guess her kitchen was already in kansas i think we got bad service because of my shunning but it was hard to tell unless your waitress wrote black witch on the back of your napkin it didnt matter we werent in any hurry the coffee sucked dishwater though robbie had been in a good mood because hed paid for the moving van mom had been in a good mood because she had some excitement in her life i was in a bad mood because she wouldnt have had to do this if i hadnt gotten shunned it didnt matter that my mother had been apartment hunting since getting back from visiting takata she was moving because of me robbie and my mom had probably landed by now and all that remained of them in cincinnati were six boxes her new fridge in my kitchen and her old buick out front melancholy i pulled new tape off an old box peeking inside to find my dads old ley line stuff making a pleased sound i stood and hoisted the box onto a hip to take it to the kitchen the pixies were noisy up front in the sanctuary as i made my way to the back of the church and i didnt even bother to turn on the lights as i shoved the box on the center counter in the corner the little blue lights on my moms fridge glowed it had a throughthedoor ice dispenser and ivy and i had been thrilled when she gave it to us the pixies had taken all of six seconds to discover that if three of them hit the ice dispenser together theyd get a cube which they then used like a surfboard to skate around the kitchen floor smiling at the memory i left the box and went back to my room id unpack it later the entire back part of the church had a chill air about it that couldnt all be blamed on the late hour ivy being out might account for some of it but most was because we had inherited my moms space heater along with half her attic the electric heater was going full tilt up front and the pixies were enjoying a hot summer evening in january but since the thermostat for the entire church was in the sanctuary the heat hadnt clicked on in hours it was cool away from the reach of the space heater making me shiver in my stilltender skin coffee would be nice but since having that grande latteraspberrything nothing seemed to taste good anymore thoughts of cinnamon and raspberry dogged me back to my room and i pulled the tape from the next box to find music id forgotten i ever had pleased i shoved the box into the hall to go through with ivy later ivy was doing well having borrowed my moms buick after sundown to go talk to rynn cormel i didnt expect her back until after sunrise she had told him about the oubliette last week how denon had been arts ghoul set to watch her until she quit the is and how art had died i hoped shed kept quiet about how her aura had protected me when i pulled on a line so hard that it melted stone but i bet shed told rynn cormel that too not that i was embarrassed or anything but why advertise to the citys master vampire that you can do that sort of thing had it surprised me that her aura could shield my soul id never heard of such a thing before and a search on the internet and in my books yielded nothing but since our auras had blended the last time she had bitten mei wasnt surprisedi was scared there was the potential here to find a way to reunite her mind body and soul after her first death i just didnt see how yet kisten had his soul when he died that second time i knew it what i didnt know was if it was me and our love for each other or if it had been because he had died twice in quick succession or if it had been something completely different it wasnt worth risking ivys soul to find out just the thought of her dead terrified me a third unmarked box turned out to be more stuffed animals and i sat back on my heels as my fingers went to pick one up my smile became sad and i brushed the unicorns mane this one was special it had graced my dresser for most of my high school years maybe ill keep you jasmine i whispered then i straightened at a zing of adrenaline jasmine that was her name i thought elated that was the name of the blackhaired girl id hung around with at trents dads makeawish camp jasmine i whispered excited as i held the stuffed animal close and smiled with a bitter happiness the toy made a small spot of warmth against me i remembered it covering a much larger area when i was younger happy i stretched to set it next to the giraffe on my dresser id never forget again welcome home jasmine i whispered trent had wanted to know jasmines name as much as i had having had a crush on her and nothing to remember her by maybe if i told him her name he might tell me if shed survivedonce he looked her up in his dads records i ought to try to mend that fence i thought rummaging to find a toy that didnt have a name or face associated with it that i could take to ford and holly i knew hed appreciate something to distract and help socialize the young banshee the two of them were doing great the last time id called though edden wasnt happy about ford taking sick days or setting up a nursery in the corner of his office not to mention the potty chair in the mens room i grinned edden had ranted for an entire fifteen minutes about that pulling out the elephant named raymond and the blue bear named gummie that had nothing but happy memories associated with them i set them aside folding the box closed and setting it atop the other box to take to the hospital my aura was just about back to normal and i really wanted to see the kids the girl in the red pajamas especially i needed to talk to her tell her the chance was real if her parents would let me that is i held my breath against the dust as i hoisted the two light boxes nudging my door open with a foot and taking them to the foyer the pixies chorused a cheerful hello as i entered the sanctuary and rex darted through the cat door to the belfry stairway spooked when i dropped the boxes on top of the one already there her head poked back through the door and i crouched and extended my hand whats up rex i crooned and she came out tail high as she sedately made her way to me for a little scritch under her chin shed been in the foyer when i brought the first box in too the hum of pixy wings pulled our attention up toys for the kids jenks said his wings a bright red from sitting under the fullspectrum light i had put in my desk lamp yup you want to come with me and ivy when we take them sure he drawled i might raid the witchs floor for some fern seed though i harrumphed as i stood be my guest it was harder to get stuff now that i was shunned and jenks was already planning out a third more garden space to compensate for it there was the black market but i wasnt going there if i did then id be saying i agreed with what theyd labeled me as and i didnt rex went to stand under my coat and i hesitated when she stood on her hind legs to pat the pocket my eyebrows rose and i looked at jenks id chased her out of the foyer twice now is one of your kids in there i asked jenks then jumped for the cat when her nails hooked the felt and started to pull her claw disengaged when i scooped her up but i had to drop her when her back claw dug into my arm tail bristled she ran for the back of the church there was a brief shout from jenkss kids and then disappointment having the sanctuary warmer than the rest of the church was better than putting them in a bubble jenks was laughing but when i pushed my sleeve up i found a long scratch jenks i complained your cat needs her nails trimmed i said id do it rache look at this i tugged my sleeve down head coming up to find jenks hovering before me with a blue something in his hands if i hadnt known better i would have said it was a little bambino wrapped up in a blue blanket by the way jenks was carrying it what is it i asked and he dropped it into my waiting hand it was in your pocket he said landing on my palm and we looked at it together in the light coming from the sanctuary its a chrysalis but i dont know what species he added nudging it with his booted toe my confusion cleared and i took a breath remembered al curling my fingers around it on new years eve can you tell if its alive i asked hands on his hips he nodded yup where did you get it jenks flew up as my fingers closed over it and i started for the kitchen to wash my scratch uh al gave it to me i said as we passed through the sanctuary and into the cooler hall he was making little blue butterflies out of snow and this was the only thing that survived tinks a disney whore that is the creepiest thing ive seen since bis got stuck in the downspout he said softly his wings a soft hum in the dark i thunked the lights on in the kitchen with my elbow and not knowing what to do with it i set it on the windowsill didnt see ivys last date huh i asked as i turned on the taps and grabbed the soap the window was black throwing back a skewed vision of myself and jenks rex jumped up onto the counter and i splashed her when she reached for the chrysalis no bad kitty jenks shouted to make the cat leap for the floor and arm dripping i set one of mr fishs oversize brandy snifters upside down over it mr fish was still in the everafter and if he was dead when i got back there i was going to be pissed it had been a week now because of my thin aura at least thats what al was saying personally i think he was breaking in pierce and didnt want me around mucking things up jenks shes just being a cat i said as the pixy scolded the orange ball of unrepentant fur she stared lovingly up at her pixy master licking her chops and twitching the tip of her tail i dont want her to eat it he said rising to be even with me she might turn into a frog or something tinks knickers its probably full of black magic its just a butterfly i said drying my arm and pulling the sleeve back down yeah with fangs and a thirst for blood for all you know he muttered i scooped up the cat and fondled her ears wanting to be sure that we were still friends rex hadnt been watching me from doorways all week and i kind of missed it the more i thought about it the more i believed i had played right into als plans pierce would want a body and al could give it to him i could easily imagine that the two had come to an agreement body for servitude winwin all the way around al got a useful familiar pierce got a body and a chance to see me once a week and knowing pierce he thought hed find a way to slip als leash eventually leaving me in the middle to suffer the fallout id be willing to bet most of als bluster and anger at me for snatching pierce had been an act i had freaking made the charm that he corrupted to make the curse work that pierce was now in tom bansens body was just squeamy even worse hed done it to himself no wonder his plight wasnt hitting any of my rescue impulses stupid man id find out what happened come saturday and my stint with al the faint tingling of rexs bell caught my interest and i looked at the pretty thing before letting her slip to the floor my eyes widened at the pattern of loops and swirls that made up its shape it looked exactly like the bell trent had found in the everafter id never noticed before ah jenks i questioned not believing it where did you get this bell he was on top of my dads box of stuff trying to wedge it open ceri gave it to me he said puffing why i took a breath to tell him where it had come from then changed my mind no reason i said letting rex slip from me its really unique is all so whats in the box he asked giving up and putting his hands on his hips i smiled and crossed the kitchen my dads charms you should see some of this stuff as jenks and i talked i brought out wrapped gadgets and utensils laying them down for him to unwrap jenks buzzed around in the cupboards to find nooks and crannies his wings slowly losing their red tint to become their normal grayish hue he was better than a flashlight for seeing what was at the back of a cupboard hey jenks i said as i set a box of uncharmed ley line amulets and pins at the back of my silverware drawer im uh really sorry about pasting you against my bathroom mirror with sticky silk the pixy flashed red the dust slipping from him mirroring his embarrassed color you remember that huh he said it sure made the decision easy to down you with that forget charm he hesitated then added softly sorry about that i was only trying to help the box was empty and not seeing ivys scissors i ran my ceremonial knife along the tape lines to collapse the box so the rani of recycling wouldnt yell at me its okay i said as i wrestled the thing flat ive forgotten about it already see i quipped tired i tucked the box in the pantry and began sorting the remaining charms jenks landed beside me watching the sound of his kids was nice im sorry about kisten jenks said surprising me i dont think i said that yet thanks i said grabbing a handful of spent charms i still miss him but the pain was gone burned to ash under the city and i could move on the old spells went into my dissolution vat of salt water making a soft splash i missed marshal too i understood why hed left he hadnt been my boyfriend but something moremy friend one id really messed up with doing a power pull with him made the entire situation look worse than it really was i held nothing against him for leaving he hadnt betrayed me by walking away and he wasnt a coward for not sticking around id made a very large mistake by getting shunned and it wasnt his responsibility to fix it i didnt expect him to wait for me until i did he hadnt said he would he was rightfully ticked at me for screwing up if anything id betrayed him breaking his trust when i told him i could keep everything under control rache what does this one do jenks said as he messed around with the last charm id left on the counter finding my keys in my bag i came closer that one detects strong magic i said pointing out the rune scratched on it i thought thats what that one does he said as i wedged it on my key ring beside my original badmojo or rather lethalamulet detector this one detects lethal magic i explained flipping the original earthmagic amulet and letting it drop the one from my dad detects strong magic and since all lethal magic is strong it will do the same thing im hoping it wont set off the security systems at the mall like the lethal amulet does since theyre both ley line based im going to take them shopping and see which works best gotcha he said nodding my dad made it i said feeling closer to him as i dropped my keys back in my bag the charm was over twelve years old but because it had never been used it was still good better than batteries you want some coffee i asked jenks nodded and a chorus of pixy shouts pulled him into the air i wasnt surprised when the front bell rang the pixies were better than a security system ill get it jenks said darting away but before i could do more than get the coffee grounds out he was back its a delivery service he said slipping a thin trace of silver pixy dust as he came back in you need to sign for something i cant do it its for you a pang of fear slipped into me and vanished id been shunned it could be anything dont be a baby jenks said instinctively knowing my warning flags had been tripped do you have any idea of the penalty for sending a bad charm through the mail besides its from trent really interested now i flicked on the coffeemaker and followed him out a bewildered human was standing on my doorstep in the light from the sign overhead the door gaping open was letting out the heat and pixies were darting in and out on dares stop it enough i called waving them back inside whats wrong with you i said loudly as i took the pen and signed for a thickly padded envelope you all act like you were born in a stump it was a flower box ms morgan one of jenkss kids said merrily perched on my shoulder out of the cold night and nestled in my hair whatever i muttered smiling at the confused man and taking the package everyone inside i asked and when i got off a round of counting up to fiftysomething i shut the door a good dozen of jenkss kids braved the chill of the kitchen curiosity winning out over comfort and they all wove in and out before me in a nightmare of silk and highpitched voices that scraped along the inside of my eyelids it wasnt until jenks made that awful screech with his wings that they quit nervousness hit me as i tossed the manilawrapped package on my spot at the table to deal with later id wait until ivy got home so she could pick me up off the floor when the joke charm trent had sent me exploded in my face arm around my middle i got my vampiric charms mug out of the cupboard i hadnt had a good cup of coffee in a week not since the last one at juniors i wanted another one but was afraid to go back not that i remembered what it was anyway cinnamon something jenks buzzed close then away you going to open it he prompted as he hovered over the table its got bumps inside i licked my lips and looked askance at him you open it and get blasted by whatever nasty elf charm he put in there he said no way elf charm i turned around curious crossing the kitchen i dug my keys out of my bag watching the heavymagic amulet glow a faint red the lethal one was quiet though interested i waved the pixies off it it wasnt lethalbut still open it rache tinks tampons the coffeemaker finished with a hissing gurgle and enduring the complaints of twentysome pixies i smiled and poured myself a cup i took a careful sip as i brought it to the table frowning maybe i could get some raspberry syrup to put in it the next time i was at the store pixies clustered on my shoulders shoving each other as i used my ceremonial knife still out on the counter to cut the brown envelope open not looking inside i angled the envelope and cautiously shook whatever it was out and away from me its a rope jenks exclaimed hovering over it and i peeked inside the envelope to make sure there wasnt a note trent sent you a rope is that a joke he said looking so angry that his kids started to back off whispering to hang yourself with maybe or is it an elven version of getting a horse head in your bed its made out of horsehair i cautiously picked up the short length of rough rope feeling the knotted bumps its probably made from his familiar i said remembering trent once telling me that his familiar was a horse jenks i said heart beating fast i think its a pandora charm immediately jenks lost his anger from behind us i heard a rumble and chunk of an ice cube dropping onto the floor and his kids swarmed it rex appeared at the doorway and hunched down watching jenkss kids push and shove to be the first five on the long cube of ice wings going in tandem they shot across the floor under the table and around the island pixy squeals rose high and they all flew off an instant before the cube hit the wall out of control he just gave it to you jenks said as he landed beside me kicking it are you sure thats what it is i think so i said not sure what to make of it you undo the knots and a memory returns i picked it up looking at the gray strand knotted with complex figures that reminded me of the sea id be willing to bet trent had made it himself i could feel the rising tension of wild magic making a quiver in me as it tickled my compromised aura or maybe elf magic always felt that way jenks looked from the blackandsilver strand of knotted rope to me you gonna do it i shrugged i dont know what memory its for kistens murder he said confidently but i shook my head maybe i ran the string through my fingers feeling the bumps like notes of music it might be something about my dad or his dad or the makeawish camp carefully i set it down i didnt want to know what memory was there not yet id had enough of memories i wanted to live for a while without them dealing with the present without the hurt of the past my phone rang from my bag and i eyed jenks when zz tops sharp dressed man jingled out the pixy gave me an innocent stare but when rex perked up sitting to stare at the corner of the room with a familiar intensity my expression left me and i drew back from answering my phone pierce i whispered the air pressure shifted and with a soft pop a misty shape in the corner grew solidified and turned into pierce rex stood with a little kitty trill and i jumped to my feet shocked it had to be pierce unless it was al disguised as him pierce i asked again and he turned to me his eyes twinkling and dressed to the nines in midnineteenhundreds high fashion he looked like himself i mean he didnt look like tom and i wondered what in hell was going on mistress witch he said darting across the kitchen to take my hands i cant stay he said breathlessly eyes glinting al will be of a mind to track me down faster than a dog trees a coon on a moonlit night but i had to visit you first to explain you took toms body i said pulling away pierce im glad to see you but he nodded his hair sliding into his eyes until he tossed it back roguishly its black magic yes and im not proud of it but it wasnt me who killed the black witch he killed himself but you look like myself yes he finished drawing me into almost a dance he was so happy that was part of the deal rachel his expression suddenly became concerned youve been burned he said every last other thought clearly out of his head his hand went out and i stopped it before it touched my face my pulse was hammering and i was hot kistens pyre i said flustered pierce gave me a firm look it is ended then i nodded please dont tell me you sold your soul for this i looked him up and down and he dropped my hands and stepped back that is a matter of some debate you must be able to hold what you claim and though i entered into an agreement he cant hold me none of them can hold me his smile was way too smug and i felt a quiver in myself you escaped once i had obtained a body and could commune with a line it was only a matter of time nothing can hold me forever except perhaps you beaming he pulled me close and knowing he was going to kiss me i blurted jenks is here immediately his hands flashed from me blue eyes wide in charming shock he dropped back a step jenks he said flushing my apologies i followed the sound of an angry humming to see jenks hovering over the middle counter staring at us with his hands on his hips and a grimace on his face get out he said flatly i just got her normal again get out before you turn her into a sniveling twitterpatedtwit jenks i exclaimed and pierce put a calming hand on me that is my intent jenks he said gallantly and i wondered if pierce meant his intent was to leave or to turn me into a twitterpated twit pierce bent to rex who was twining about his ankles i have to go he said as he rose with her in his arms i was of a mind to explain before al fills your head with his view of what happened this past week i will see you as soon as i can al is a devilishly fine demon more fun than a nest of bunnies to outwit hes playing with al pierce i said almost laughing i was so confused he had escaped him he had used al to gain a body and then escaped him pierce brought his gaze back to me i must pull foot but until i find myself in a better situation i will think of you every evening between candle lighting and dawn wait a minute pierce im not but he had swooped forward and as jenks angrily dusted silver sparkles on us he kissed me soundly he stole it that was the only way i could describe it he stole a kiss wrapping his arms about me and holding me tight as he took a kiss from me and left me breathless hey i exclaimed not shoving him away but pulling back letting go he inclined his headand vanished with the soft scent of coal dust and shoe polish i stared at where he had been from behind me a forgotten cube of ice slipped down and hit the floor uh jenks i warbled he had come he had befuddled me he had escaped al on his own and come to crow to me about it ohhhhh crap i was in trouble no jenks shouted damn it to the turn and back he shrilled throwing a hotsparkled tantrum two feet above the counter ill not have you falling for him rachel no but as i ran my fingers over my lips remembering his there i thought it might be too late he was just sorachelly hitting a spot in me that hadnt been alive since i was eighteen and with that thought my face went blank damn it ford had been right this was why i hadnt had any luck with guys i had been measuring them against pierce all this time and they had all come up lacking i was in big trouble big maybe as an eighteenyearold i thought it was romantic to be involved with a smart intelligent devilmaycare handsome witch who could take on demons vamps and the is but i was smarter now right right the air pressure shifted with a bang i cowered below the level of the counter and jenks shot up to the ceiling witch al bellowed and i peeked over the counter his eyes met mine and he yelled where is my familiar i stood a smile quirking the corners of my lips uh he was here i said i didnt summon him he just kind of showed up my focus sharpened on al and he narrowed his eyes trying to gauge the truthfulness of my words kind of like how you just did i added he popped in and then he left where did he go he bellowed gloved hands clenching i had him in a snare that would take alexander the great a lifetime to untwist and he did it in a week al took a step pinwheeling as his booted heel found an ice cube i dont know i said then shouted i dont know when al growled at me i think he went that way i pointed off in a vague direction making an mmmm of discontent al tugged his frock coat ill see you saturday rachel he said roughly and bring a silvercore rope to tie gordian nathaniel pierce down with if i ever find him im going to sell him to newt i swear if i didnt need him id kill him myself with a foulsmelling gust of air al vanished i stared at the spot blinking sweet mother of tink jenks whispered from the ladle what just happened leaning against the counter i shook my head from the front of the church came the sound of the door opening rachel ivys voice filtered in im home why did pierce pop into the car and tell me to pick up a grande latte double espresso italian blend light on the froth heavy on the cinnamon with a shot of raspberry my lips curved up in a smile i loved my life acknowlegdements id like to thank my editor diana gill the more i know the harder her job looks and my agent richard curtis my knight in shining armor
