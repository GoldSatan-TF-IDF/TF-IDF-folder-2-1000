jack higgins the killing ground the sean dillon series now the field of battle is a land of standing corpses those determined to die will live those who hope to escape with their lives will die wu chi for henrietta with love chapter blake johnson was received with courtesy at the american embassy in grosvenor square as befitted president jake cazalets most important security adviser the head of a secret white house operation known simply as the basement an aide took him to the ambassadors office a fine young marine captain in dress uniform bearing medals from bosnia iraq and afghanistan the ambassadors hosting a cocktail party mostly for those who werent invited to brussels for the conference and who would that be blake asked the dregs of every embassy in london major i know the feeling and its not major vietnam was a long time ago once a marine always a marine major my dad was in vietnam and my grandfather was in north africa and in normandy on dday they must be proud of you that navy cross speaks for itself thank you sir ill alert the ambassador he went out blake helped himself to scotch from a decanter on the sideboard and moved to the window at the terrace and looked into grosvenor square the roads shining in the streetlights rain pounding down he stood under the canopy inhaling the freshness savoring his drink and the door opened behind him he turned and it was the ambassador frank mars a friend of many years standing as little more than boys theyd served together in nam mars shook his hand warmly its good to see you blake but also a bit of a surprise i thought you were in brussels with the president well at first i wasnt going but the president decided that his meeting with the prime minister and president putin might veer into my territory so he decided he wanted me in brussels anyway im meeting charles ferguson tonight and were flying over together ferguson was the head of the group of special operatives often referred to as the prime ministers private army blake had run many operations with him and the tempo had only picked up of late mars topped up their glasses and they stood there looking into the square all the years ive known this place and now i have to look down at those great ugly concrete blocks protecting us the terrorists have accomplished what two world wars could not not to mention the cold war blake said still it all helped lead to this those years of strife the atomic submarines the cancer of communism east versus west we got it wrong with berlin in said mars allowing russia to take the city thats when they first sensed they could roll over us i remember the first trip i made behind the wall in berlin it chilled the soul blake gestured to the left of the square to the statue of eisenhower on its plinth what do you think hed make of it after all it was he roosevelt and winston churchill who were responsible id remind you that joseph stalin had something to do with it mars pointed out blake nodded thoughtfully and now we have vladimir putin think the cold war is on its way back frank mars put a hand on his shoulder blake old friend its not on its way its arrived from the moment putin became president of the russian federation he had an agenda weve seen it unfold bit by bit and hes got the money to back it up all that gas and oil i think hes capable of anything and theres something else about him thats very dangerous indeed and what would that be hes a patriot mars swallowed his drink but enough of that come and let me introduce you to my guests most of the guests were not too important mostly minor attachés of one kind or another the big fish were either in brussels already or on the way there after a little bit of talk blake stood in the corner and soon mars joined him so if youre flying off tonight youre not staying at the embassy house off south audley street right my luggage is there though and im expecting sean dillon and billy salter to pick me up and deliver me to farley field to join ferguson so ferguson s promoted young salter to be an agent in the secret intelligence service i understand yes mind you ferguson had to obliterate salters criminal records from the files to get him in but he and dillon make quite a team you could say that an east ender gangster and the most fearsome enforcer the provisional ira ever had quite a combination as they talked blake noticed someone observing them a man with slavic features an excellent suit and an eager smile he was going heavy on the vodka and as blake watched took another from a waiters tray mars halfturned and murmured to blake colonel boris lhuzkov senior commercial attaché for the embassy of the russian federation of course hes actually head of station for the gru theyre all something else over there would you like a word if i must mars waved and lhuzkov gulped another vodka and rushed over smiled ingratiatingly and shook hands a great pleasure mr ambassador why boris i thought youd be in brussels that is reserved for those more important than i he glanced inquiringly at blake mars said mr johnson is on his way to brussels this evening it seems the president cant talk to your boss without him blake johnson mr johnson your reputation goes before you lhuzkov shook hands and his hand was damp and trembled a little yes well just another day at the office blake said and suddenly had had enough youll excuse me i must thank you for the offer of the embassy house frank ill stop over another time of course lhuzkov watched as blake went to fetch his raincoat then immediately went into a corner and called a number on his mobile phone hes on his way now to the embassy house yes do it now and he switched off and went down to the cloakroom blake refused a car and accepted an umbrella went down to the steps into the square and walked down toward south audley street he made a brief call on his mobile and was answered by sean dillon in the passenger seat of harry salters aston martin billy was driving where are you sean demanded moving down to the embassy house i felt like the walk the rain all that stuff the romance of a great city you damn fool you know youre a marked man anybody special at the embassy as a matter of fact yes a guy called boris lhuzkov station head of the gru apparently idiot sean said you know the moment you landed here the gru were on to you dont you he switched off where is he billy demanded pulling his hat down near the embassy house make it fast pass him as a matter of fact go straight up that little side lane turn in there whoevers up to no good is probably parked by the house ill bail out fast and you can join me are you tooled up what do you think billy moved out to pass three parked cars and then blake the umbrella over his head they ignored him moved into the turning by the house and noticed a small sedan billy slowed and dillon pulled a walther ppk with a silencer from his raincoat pocket opened the door of the slowmoving car and rolled out the car carried on he pulled open the door of the waiting sedan and menaced the two men waiting inside one of them was just clutching the driving wheel but the other had a browning which dillon wrenched from his hand billy arrived a moment later opened the car door and relieved the driver of a colt from his waistband here what is this the driver protested it started the usual bluster i hate people being stupid billy said dont you absolutely dillon told him and at that moment blake turned the corner and approached whats going on he demanded just go and get your luggage and well be on our way idiot dillon told him get moving did i have company ah well i knew i could rely on you two blake laughed and went to the front door of the house assume the position both of you dillon said which they did with reluctance billy went through their pockets did a quick check and found a wad of fiftypound notes two thousand he said counting must have been more originally had to be dillon stuck his pistol in the first mans ear who put you up to this get stuffed the man said he sounded cockney the driver stayed silent stupid and arrogant dillon said a lethal combination and he shot half the mans left ear off the man cursed and moaned at the same time and dillon said if you want the other one taken care of as well thats all right with me he slipped the two thousand into the mans pocket you can keep this just tell me who it was george moon the man said gasping runs the harvest moon pub in trenchard street soho farms out work and pretty dirty work too if that old sods still at it and who was he representing billy said to the driver you might as well come clean russian guy moon said he was called lhuzkov he met us in a pub in kensington across the high street from the russian embassy and the gig was to kill off blake johnson something like that dillon gave him his handkerchief its clean now piss off and find a hospital they couldnt get in the car fast enough billy said nice and generous of you letting them keep the two grand it helped grease the wheels billy a little pain a little reward the front door opened and blake came out carrying a couple of flight bags he put them in the back of the car anybody dead we wouldnt do a thing like that blake said who was it couple of smalltime hoods hired by lhuzkov blake said interesting he wouldnt have done that on his own dont worry billy said well sort that lot out itll be a pleasure they drove off dillon lit a cigarette and leaned back foot down to farley field billy ferguson wont be pleased if blakes late at farley field the rain fell relentlessly ferguson s pilots squadron leader lacey and flight lieutenant parry busied themselves with the aircraft while the general drank coffee and a bushmills whiskey and stood at the window of the small lounge staring out at the rain he was indeed not best pleased youre late well if you can be bothered to wipe the scowl from your face general dear i have news for you dillon told him ferguson s face became wary and what would that be a couple of gentlemen of evil intent tried to hurry blake into a better world explain billy i need another drink he sampled the bushmills and listened and blake watched amused what i want to know said ferguson is whats with all this bloody gameplaying a thirdrate colonel working for russian military intelligence wants to shoot the presidents key security man and the best he can do is hire these incompetents somebodys head is going to roll all right billy said so where does that get us well obviously were going to have to look into whoever put lhuzkov up to it but that will have to wait until i return in four days after brussels putin visits germany and the prime minister and the president will be trying desperately to knock some sense into france ill be glad to help with the france thing billy said very funny ive got something else for you to do weve gotten a tip that some very bad actors may be flying in during the next twentyfour hours dont know who or from where but it bears checking out sean you know a lot of these people by sightyou and billy go to heathrow and haunt passport control see whos flying in from nasty places weve got other men there too but they havent got your experience dillon nodded meanwhile blake said we have to be off coming general he got up onto the plane and ferguson turned on the steps ill send the gulfstream back in case of emergencies use it at your discretion if something comes up you might also want to check in at the holland park safe house major ropers just gotten in a new batch of satellite computer equipment very powerful stuffyoull find it interesting and gretas there nowi thought it would be good experience for her he was referring to major greta novikova once employed by the russian army in chechnya and iraq circumstances had made it seem sensible for her to transfer allegiance to ferguson the door closed the plane started to move and they turned back to the aston and drove away dillon called billys father harry salter at his pub the dark man are you on your own roper and gretare here thats all managing a steak with all the trimmings with sergeants henderson and doyle eating fish and chips in a booth in their best blazers and flannels and trying not to look like military police cant say theyre succeeding are you coming round no but you can do me a favor anything tell roper that lhuzkov was hanging around having drinks at the embassy huh light a match close to that one and the vodka would explode what a clown yes well that clown arranged for a couple of nobodies to take out blake who was rather foolishly walking down south audley street in the rain stupid because he knows its open season on him here we cant have that whats the game oh billy and i sorted it with a little ungentle persuasion that left one of them with only half an ear but it was lhuzkov who laid it on and our old friend george moon who did the hiring paid them two grand apparently he gave harry the rest of the details george moon i didnt realize he was still breathing had a nice little wife ruby she was straight he wasnt right its taken care of are you coming to the pub no ferguson s got a job for us well enjoy yourselves harry switched off the mobile and nodded across to his two minders joe baxter and sam hall ill have a large scotch im thinking vodka greta she was most attractive wearing a black silk russian shirt and trousers and kneelength boots her hair was tied at the nape of her neck why not a large one is there any other one for a russian probably not what about the major roper sat in his stateoftheart wheelchair wearing a reefer coat his collar turned up to his bombscarred face he didnt get a chance to say no because dora brought the drinks on a tray and distributed them good girl dora harry said what are we going to do without you shell be leaving in a week australia got a daughter and two girls wants to test the water might never come back heres to her greta swallowed her vodka knock back that whiskey she told roper because i know youre eager to get back to your machines thats all he ever does she said eats sandwiches drinks a bottle of scotch a night smokes hardly sleeps and plays around on those damn machines yes roper said its a wonderful life lets move it gentlemen greta called to the military police take it easy harry the policemen took the chair out to the special van loaded it and a few moments later drove off to holland park another one boss harry shook his head no ive got a mind to a bit of action remember george moon and his boyfriend big harold baxter said a couple of years ago they tried to run roper into traffic in his wheelchair sam hall laughed i remember the major shot harold in the side of the knee and moon through the thigh the word to the police was theyd been attacked by muggers the cops didnt have much sympathy they would have been only too glad to do it themselves so whats the point on behalf of a russian geezer who is no friend of dillon and billy george moon produced a couple of lowlifes who tried to take out blake johnson for two grand anybody damaged baxter said grimly one of them left minus half his left ear and the other one told dillon the score so that leaves george moon in deep trouble id say so harry got up so lets make it a visit to the harvest moon home of the worst pint of beer in london and make sure youre carrying trenchard street was victorian and the harvest moon even more so they arrived over cobblestones to the pub with its halfmoon over the door harry told sam hall wait by the car anything could happen in a dump like this hall nodded lit a cigarette and paused for a moment the door swung open and a rough voice called i told you to lock up ruby moon stepped into the rain trying to put a mackintosh on big harold reached behind and pulled her hair making her cry out cry ill make you cry he said and then slapped her twice across the face you need discipline ill enjoy taking care of that harry turned to joe baxter look at that neanderthal man come back to haunt us from the stone age and it slaps girls around too he moved her to one side and she burst into angry tears wont do harry said and removed his smart military trench coat which he placed over her shoulders do you know who i am shed stopped crying oh god i think so for maybe you know my nephew young billy if hes who i think he is i do thats good slip up to your bedroom find a few necessaries put them in a suitcase and come back anything else you can get tomorrow im losing dora at my pub the dark man at cable wharf and you can take over the bar now hurry but this animal whats he going to do he wont let me go dear me i was forgetting harry offered his hand to baxter who passed him a colt with a silencer and as big harold tried to step back harry shot him through the fleshy part of the thigh and shoved him back on the stair find him a towel in the gents harry said and you get upstairs girl she ran up wildly and harry and baxter followed inside george moon was peering through a halfopen door and harry could see a room lined with books behind him moon was small balding and generally unsavory and just now sweating profusely he retreated to his desk and sank into a chair harry my old friend is that you old friend you must be bleeding joking salter put his gun on the table and walked to a sideboard whiskeya large one and feel free yourself joe certainly baxter said moon didnt have the bottle to reach for the colt harry said im in a hurry george old friend a couple of geezers tried to knock off an actual friend of mine tonight but dillon and my boy billy managed to turn things around on my life harry i swear nothing you pain me in my backside now confirm that a russian named lhuzkov approached you for two hard men all right its true it was for two grand and i gave him two men good men i was just brokering the deal for two grand thats rubbish money these days give me the truth harry slapped the gun on the sweaty face ill do for you i swear it please ill tell they met me in a daimler at hyde park lhuzkov was driving the passenger was also a russian cigarsmoking drinking vodka out of a flask laughing all the time he had a bad scar from his left eye down to the corner of the nose he gave me a briefcase with ten grand in it so you pocketed eight and gave those two guys only two very naughty harry i wasnt sure what to do he struggled for something good to say i know who the other one was though i saw him in the dorchester bar one evening and got his name out of a waiter someone named max chekov yes ten thousand quid would make more sense harry turned to baxter see if the safe works moon moaned please harry but the safe did work and there was even a key in the door baxter held up a briefcase the contents spoke for themselves excellent ruby can buy some nice things go down and get her in the car yes boss baxter went out and harry made for the door and paused dear me i was forgetting ruby is leaving you he shot moon through the right thigh harry said it would be wise to get some medical help for that these days terrible things happen street robberies gunsits just a shame he shook his head get me he left the room was quiet then there was only the sound of the limousine driving away moon groaned and reached for the telephone in the bentley harry passed the briefcase over youll need a savings account ruby examined it my god this cant be happening it is happening youll do a great job running the pub im never wrong about people happy days sweetheart at heathrow it wasnt busy possibly due to the lateness of the hour and though the custom and passport officers on duty regarded them with deep suspicion they knew better than to object to dillon and billys presence theyd been there a couple of hours with no one particularly interesting coming through when a new entry on the arrivals screen caught dillons attention well look at that billy he said an old friend hazar billy stopped smiling and shivered a little at the memory of the ordeals theyd gone through in that desolate middle eastern country dear god kate rashid of blessed memory is that how you remember her she was some woman billy shook his head at the thought of the woman who had sworn to kill them and almost succeeded if i never see that place again ill only be too happy a long time ago dillon said but thinking of her brings events flowing back enough to want to take a look at whos doing night runs from hazar these days to good old london lets see as the queues lengthened a supervisor called over the loudspeaker for people specifically traveling from hazar to move to a special section which they did with surprisingly little fuss caspar rashid was one of them a tall handsome man comparatively light in color his chin and mouth covered by a beard that was almost blond he had one piece of folding hand luggage and a briefcase billy said he looks like a bedouin thats because he is billy lets join him as they approached the passport officer had already opened the passport and was examining it mr caspar rashid address gulf road hampstead rashid told him country of birth england would you like to have a look sir the passport man passed it across and rashid waited impassively while dillon stepped back and examined the pages finally dillon said fine and handed the passport to rashid who gave him a wonderful smile and walked away he has you would agree a great smile dillon said yes i suppose so but then hes a goodlooking guy but that isnt why hes smiling hes smiling because he thinks hes got away with it and im smiling because ive caught him hes hiding something billy i dont know what but hes hiding something lets go rashid was tired from the flight and obviously beyond caution his vehicle was a red hire car on the ground floor of the car park opposite the exit rashid unlocked the door including the luggage compartment they were close enough to have a look when rashid heaved out the spare tire and started to lift up the carpet get him billy dillon said and they moved fast and rashid turned to face them dillon produced his walther hands behind your neck see what you can find billy billy struck gold straightaway lifting out a cloth in which were wrapped a few toolsand a pistol he held it up thirtyeight smith amp wesson automatic loaded cuff him billy did as he was told do we take him in he asked no he interests me why you didnt need to be sherlock holmes to know he was up to no good his passport indicates that he arrived in cairo last week by plane from london took a train to mombasa then a ferry from mombasa to hazar he didnt even stay a full day before flying back to london why did he do all that why not fly from london to hazar and back i see what you mean billy nodded probably because he didnt want to be noticed and there was a better chance of that by the roundabout route so why didnt you want to be noticed mr rashid because rashid said his face twisting with emotion i couldnt they might have killed me they might have killed her i had no choice wait a minute said billy who are we talking about here alqaeda and the army of god a chill ran through them at the mention of the two terrorist organizations what did they want with you asked dillon they called me the man spoke excellent english and perfect arabic he told me i was under surveillance and could be killed at any time he said i had to think of him as the broker he gave me no connecting number but said they wanted to talk to me in person thats why i went to hazar thats why i took such a roundabout route they told me no one must know the gun was given to me in london it appeared in my desk drawer but i didnt know what to do with it and i just wrapped it up in the cloth and stuck it in the car im not a terrorist you must believe me but why did they call you rashids face contorted again to talk about my daughter my beautiful thirteenyearold daughter sara they were they were brought in by my father he is very wedded to the old ways and when he told us he intended to marry sara to a cousin a person we had never even heard ofa thirteenyearold girlwe refused my wife and i shes english too a doctor we refusedand then he just took her took her away and now sara is in iraq bloody hell billy said pleasei dont know who you are but you must be with the government in some way can you help me im not a terrorist but ive learned a lot about the army of god i can tell you everything i know if you only help me get my daughter back please take off the handcuffs dillon lit a cigarette leave his car well use the aston martin billy did as he was told where to to see roper london brussels chapter at holland park they were admitted by sergeant doyle who was on night duty unexpected guest dillon told him get henderson out of bed billy you stick rashid in the interview room and wait ill see if roper is still up which he was roaming cyberspace as usual cole porter sounding softly from a player he was humming perfectly happy with greta in a nearby chair browsing through the new statesman come into the viewing room both of you they assembled quickly all of them watching through the glass as billy left rashid alone in total silence this is caspar rashid a doctor of electronics at london university hes fortytwo born in london and his wife molly is a medical doctor hope youre getting this roper id like a fullflow analysis as you record details of the interview assist by all means of course lets keep it friendly roper said and brought the lights up on both sides of the glass so rashid could see them as well dr rashid were a mixture of military and intelligence personnel my name is roper the lady is major greta novikova of the gru and dillon and billy salter you already know im impressed rashid said we belong to a group personally authorized by the prime minister normal rules do not apply to us so your complete honesty will be required that was dillon billy laughed the only rules we have are not to have any it saves time i understand said rashid greta suddenly said in arabic what nonsense is this the analysis on major ropers flow machine fits no arab i ever knew its there now rashid said in good russian oh im arab enough although i prefer bedouin im a member of the rashid tribe based in the empty quarter he continued in english my father was a london heart surgeon from a wealthy family in baghdad money meant nothing to him and you forswore your faith renounced islam greta asked i cant believe it my parents moved back to baghdad nearly thirteen years ago my marriage to a christian was a terrible shame for them unfortunately for them i had been left a fortune by my grandmother so i was independent shed even left me the hampstead house i was born in it was dillon who said and all this without provoking any blowbacks from your fellow muslims many and often i became what someone once called a christmas muslim once a year the kind of electronic engineering i specialize in is linked to the modern railway im well known in my field as an expert i visit many muslim areas ive been subject to pressure from extremist colleagues on many occasions at the university and on my travels i know of things happening in places that would probably disturb you such as roper said i will not say not until my terms are met i will only say that eight months ago when i was in algiers for a week and my wife was on a heavy operating schedule my daughter was abducted from her prep school at lunchtime driven to a flying club near london and flown out of the country by agents of the army of god backed by alqaeda she was delivered to my fathers villa at amara north of baghdad good god theres a war on greta said why would he be there instead of getting the hell out of it a man like him hes seen the light is dedicated to osama he allowed sara to speak to us on the telephone once but said i would never see her again since then ive tried everything and ive gotten nowhere so thats where we come in roper said no one in any official capacity can help the place we call iraq is an inferno rashid said im interested in why your father a man of such wealth and influence should stay in the war zone the major is right he has dedicated himself to the other side that is the most i will tell you what i know about the army of god during the past months and related dealings with alqaeda in many areas of the middle east and north africa would interest you mr dillon particularly as an irishman now youve got the pot boiling what in the hell is that supposed to mean not now you know what i want what about your wife greta put in she wont crack shes too strong a great surgeon children are her specialty and she never knew about your problems with the islamic business and the army of god i thought i was protecting her from it but the abduction of sara changed all that she has her work that is her mainstay there was a long pause dillon said to roper can it be done well there is the small matter of the war but well just have to see what we can do its a good thing ferguson s in brussels so we dont have to tell him allow henderson to take this poor sod away for a shower he called to rashid as he stood up your trip to hazar you thought it had a purpose but those army of god people were playing with you was that it ive nothing more to say good roper said always nice to be reassured sitting in the computer room roper who liked to think of himself as the planning genius of all time had a large scotch and smoked for twenty minutes but he wasnt taking it easy first he checked on molly rashids whereabouts she was a professor of pediatrics at several hospitals but that night she had performed heart surgery at great ormond street and gone home at midnight he also checked the rashids in iraq the villa on the north road beyond the village of amara outside baghdad was according to american sources still intact and inhabited by the head of the household abdul aged eighty there were two or three aging females and five or six young men of the akcarrying variety and many refugees from the bombing he was also pleased to see a mention of a thirteenyearold girl named sara so she was still there roper had rashid brought back to the viewing room what now rashid asked dr rashid were now going to call your wife i can speak to her rashid had brightened i insist on it im afraid it has to be on speakerphone and i suggest you tell her everythingwhich i suspect you havent there was the heavily magnified sound of a telephone and a womans voice caspar is that you she was well spoken a timbre to her voice roper said dr molly rashid yes who is this she was unsure uncertain my name is major giles roper before he could carry on she said good heavens i once met you at a charity lunch for the great ormond street hospital youre that wonderful man with all the medals for dealing with bombs she paused and roper carried on for her the man in the wheelchair yes what on earth do you want at this time of night dr rashid im here with your husband rashid broke in its true back from my trip to hazar listen carefully molly these people may be able to help us get sara back when hed finished talking everything was quiet the exchange had been full and frank roper said what do you think dr rashid im astonished i knew more than my husband realized of the great pressures hes suffered from radical islamic sources he im sure didnt want me to know about such matters and i allowed him to think i was ignorant its what wives do the abduction of sara finished all that the lack of any legal means to retrieve her from that dreadful war zone has been very hard your husband offers us a bargain if we can retrieve your daughter he will give us what he swears is incredibly valuable information touching on alqaeda and the army of god do you think i should believe him major roper he has never lied to me he is a bedouin his honor is everything it would mean him staying here in custody for the period the operation lasts and you dr rashid perhaps you would be better in protective custody too we live in a hard and dangerous world no thank you my operating schedule at the hospital would never permit it after what your husband has indicated about the people he wont talk about i think i could suggest a compromise dillon said major greta novikova a valued colleague is a highly skilled officer experienced in several wars she could travel with you as security molly rashid seemed to hesitate and her husband said take the offer please molly all right can i see caspar visit by all means major novikova will arrange to pick you up he hung up thats it for this show take him to bed henderson took rashid out afterward they gathered to talk it out while greta poured tea and vodka russian style so this is the way it looks to me said dillon roper youll handle logistics from here henderson and doyle will mind rashid i know theyll tell me they cant bear the sight of any other military police sergeants in this place anyway greta youll guard molly rashid i liked her greta said handing out vodka which leaves you and me billy boy to go to iraq dillon told him saving the world again the job of all great men dillon said now tell me how you see this gig going he asked roper well at some stage i imagine it would involve you or billy kicking the door of that villa open gun in hand very funny roper at that moment ropers codex four his secure mobile phone rang and he could see it was harry salter harry whats up he asked is everyone there not for long put me on speakerphone and ill tell you whats up he waited a moment remember george moon and his thug big harold personally ill never forget them roper said listen and learn children harrys voice floated out of the phone by the time he had finished everybody was up to date on the events at the harvest moon at the end billy groaned ruby ruby moon at the dark man shes safely tucked up in bed right now it could be a lot worse billy itll make a man of you old boy isnt that what they say not at the school i went to and it was one of the finest public schools in london too i wanted to make a gent of him teach him how to behave look how it turned out yes youve created a gentleman gangster a highwayman roper laughed it certainly suits billy all right lets have you home billy i smell things happening over there make an old man happy and tell me all about it ill see you in twenty minutes billy said and clicked off he turned to roper and dillon so whats the deal well keep ferguson out of it entirely said roper ill arrange false papersi think youll play war correspondents again ill book a flight from farley field dillon takes the rap for telling lacey and parry its an unexpected flight highly secret and so on the weapons will be supplied by the quartermaster at farley i know a firm called recovery thatll help us in baghdad itll just take a call to make sure i can let you know tomorrow off you go christ almighty titanium waistcoats again billy left and dillon walked greta out and watched as henderson let billy out of the electronic gates after he drove away they went back inside i think ill sleep in staff quarters greta said and at that moment ferguson s voice echoed out of ropers computer and he sounded annoyed isnt anyone there greta jumped roper placed a finger on his lips and dillon poured bushmills from a bottle on the corner table im here boss you know us we never close roper said hows brussels dillon put in bloody boring but thats politics for you as far as the prime minister is concerned though were into another time of the wolf a second cold war dillon said i think weve known that for a while general volkov never leaves putins side and as for that fat fool lhuzkov at the embassy well deal with him later so things are quiet at the moment absolutely your honor and boring with it the stage irishman act is past its sellby date dillon all right if thats all ill say good night ill check in with you tomorrow he clicked off and dillon said im going to bed for a while knowing you youre going to get started on the false papers nothing like a bit of forgery to pass away my lonely night its like something out of dickens and roper turned to his beloved computers seanthe mystery man from alqaeda the broker do you believe in him absolutely dillon said roper smiled im so pleased so do i in the embassy in brussels vladimir putin sat drinking vodka with general volkov his most trusted security adviser and max chekov so things are proceeding well with belov international the president said of course mr president thanks to belovs untimely demise we control oil fields and gas pipelines from siberia to norway and over the north sea to england volkov shrugged and we can stop most of those pipelines anytime we want stop go stop go play with them chekov put in when you think of all the effort in the old days devoted to the threat of the atom bomb he shook his head now we can achieve more than we ever dreamed of by just turning off a few taps yes putin said it was a wonderful gift when belov ended up at the bottom of the irish sea thanks to ferguson s people whats happened to belovs irish estate chekov said drumore place ive visited it twice it has been developed for light industry theres a decent runway for light aircraft and a helicopter pad a nice little harbor all in all a useful property for us to have he smiled and if you ever want to visit and have a drink theres a great pub called the george strange putin once a kgb colonel knew his history king george was the man who oppressed the irish peasantry in the eighteenth century for being roman catholic they hated him for this so why call their public house the george chekov said i asked the publican a man called ryan the very question he answered that it was their pub and they liked it the way it was and let me note they may all be catholic by persuasion but their real religion is the provisional ira yes putin sniffed at his drink those former ira men so violentand so useful for certain jobs well he raised his glass let us drink to the future of belov international he nodded toward chekov and to its chief executive officer the vodka went down and another then chekov excused himself volkov poured another couple of vodkas what do you think of him putin asked of chekov said volkov hell be fine hes got a good tough army record the kind who laughs and kills you know and hes so personally wealthy that he seems totally trustworthy from my point of view and hes just unlikely to get too greedy good now volkov concerning this sorry business with blake johnson you need to check the quality of your staff taking on such a prestigious target is only worthwhile if success is certain failure is not an option and i keep seeing that damn dillons name popping up everywhere of course sir i understand as for dillonhes an exceptional man are you saying we have no such individuals whatever happened to igor levin for example volkov hesitated he became unreliable mr president by the end of the belov affair he decamped to dublin with two gru sergeants chomsky and popov chomsky i believe is studying law at trinity college in dublin now its difficult youre wrongvladimir putin said its very simple tell them their president needs them and russia needs them and if that doesnt work well we have ways of dealing with people who decamp dont we as for ferguson and company im sick of them its time to finish it once and for all every time we make headway in our goal they interfere disorder chaos anarchy leading to a breakdown in the social order this should be our aim cultivate our arab friends let them do the dirty work their favorite weapon is the bomb which means civilian casualtiesthatll stoke the fires of hate for all things muslim anywhere in europe you have my full authority volkov tried to smile im very grateful mr president for everything ill have a vodka with you then ill let you go my pleasurevolkov went to the side table and refilled their glasses which he brought back ive been thinking putin said this arab youre running in london professor dreq khan the army of god man he seems almost untouchable all those committees hes on in parliament all those political connections he could get away with murder he laughed dont you think he raised his glass to victory and to mother russia and he took the vodka down in one easy swallow called out at am to warley general hospital by an a ampe department that was two general surgeons short molly found herself dealing with far too many drunks and victims of violent attack many of them women and some of the patients were scuffling amongst themselves on duty too was abu hassim a general porter not tall but strong and wiry and more than able to look after himself in that brawling crowd abu born in streatham had a cockney edge to his voice although his features were arab he knew molly and she knew him enough to nod and say hello because he lived in a corner shop owned by his uncle and aunt half a mile from mollys house she was hot and sweaty and deadly tired and as she pushed through the crowd a man of thirty or so hugely drunk screaming and shouting and demanding a doctor saw her whos this babe he yelled and tried to kiss her she cried out leave me alone damn you and tried to fight him off he slapped her on the side of the face bitch the crowd surged and a hand pulled her away it was abu hassim who said thats no way to treat a lady took one step forward and headbutted the drunk with great precision the drunk went backward and abu grabbed him by the front of his jacket and eased him into a chair she wiped her face with a hand towelthat was definitely not in the book but thanks abu hassim isnt it yes doctor sorry about thatgood thing i was here it certainly was but all in a days work i guess thanks again dont mention it ill see you in the morning he said not me ive got the morning off lucky you he went out into a windswept rainy road there was no one at the late night bus stop he waited in a few minutes molly drove out of the main gate at the wheel of a land rover she pulled up and opened the passenger door get in its the least i can do why thank you and he accepted it with every appearance of gratitude ive seen you coming out of that corner shop in delamere road molly said my uncle and aunt own it where are you from right here in good old london im a cockney muslim im sorry she laughed uncertainly nothing to be sorry about i like being what i am she felt in deep water for some reason your parents are deadabu said they were originally from iraq two years ago they returned for family reasons and were killed in a bombing she felt the most intense shock oh abu thats terrible so far to go and so little time to do it his face remained calm but as we say inshallah as god wills i suppose so she pulled up outside the shop ill see you soon she was so nice and he liked her very much it was such a pity she was what she was but allah had placed this duty on him and he got out sleep well doctor allah protect you he walked to the side door of the shop and she drove away more tired than she had ever been and the electronic gates swung open and she was home in the shop abu and his uncle embraced a foul night and you are wet put this on the old man handed him a robe ill put some tea on your aunt has been called to birmingham her niece has gone into labor he busied himself with the kettle now tell me what has happened abu held the offered cup of tea between his hands our quarry dr mollys husband the bedouin rashid arrived off the plane from hazar and was apprehended we had two sweepers working close enough to the action he was seen walking away pursued by two individuals who turned out to be some kind of government officials this was confirmed by one of our brothers working on a passport desk nearby he said they were called dillon and salter another of our people saw them get into an aston car with rashid and drive away what then nothing except that our man got the license number how do you know all this my control called me at the hospital to see what the situation was with the wife obviously the police will contact her he shook his head i like dr molly shes a good woman why does she have to be one of them instead of offering an explanation his uncle said do you weaken in your resolve not at all not before allah abu shrugged im going to bed she has the morning free so it will be difficult to check the house then well see his uncle embraced him you are a very good boy sleep well the uncle found that with age he slept lightly and he rested on the couch by the fire he dozed contemplating the current situation and how lucky he was with the strengthening faith of age to have such power from allah the phone rang ah so you are still awake ali my brother what can i do for you abu has done well to involve himself with the rashid woman tell him to take the day off from the hospital tomorrow and observe her one of my agents at heathrow managed to follow caspar rashid to a place in holland park there was a lot of security there the man speaking was professor dreq khan whose field was comparative religion he was a highly regarded academic in many countries but especially in london where he was on many government and interfaith committees his great secret was his fateful meeting with osama bin laden in afghanistan years before and the changes in his thinking that had led him to found the army of god well find out what we can but if im right i think it would be a waste of time trying to get in my computer assistants at the university have come up with an owner for the car who turns out to have been a rather famous criminal in his day named harry salter he is incredibly rich but an informant tells me he still gets up to his old tricks you know what he tells people smuggling cigarettes pays the same as heroin but only gets you six months if caught london is truly an amazing place he has a nephew named billy salter but the computer listing shows nothing for him ill put the word out though perhaps the authorities have wiped his records in any event do what you can and god be with you ali hassim sighed folded his hands and lay back an hour or so earlier billy had driven up to the dark man he knew the front door would be locked so he went through the side door and passed through to the lounge bar and found harry sitting by the fire being served coffee by ruby they both looked up and she managed to smile for she had realized billy might prove to be her greatest obstacle but ruby was ruby and undeniably pretty you were stupid to put up with it ruby he was always a toad and about as appetizing as a corpse now im about to break some bad news to my good old uncle harry you might as well hear it too because since youve become a member of the team and live here youd wriggle it out of any man wearing wellcut trousers anyway do i take that as a compliment ruby asked absolutely now shut up he turned to harry were going to baghdad again wonderful harry said the troops are coming home but my nephew and some wild irishman have to do the exact opposite its worthwhile he went through the details the girl is just a kid thirteen for christs sake so if roper has worked a way we might pull it off then im for it frankly the more i think of that kid and what her future is likely to be the more im inclined to go for it he got up im going to bed now before i fall down he went out there was silence and harry said very stubborn my nephew what would you say ruby id say he needs a good nights sleep she carried the coffee things to the bar but id also like to say that i think hes marvelous and on that im going to bed too and she walked out hampstead at six oclock in the morning greta novikova was moving through rainsoaked streets that were relatively empty a mini cooper dark blue a couple of years old was what she preferred the engine lethal the house was easy enough to find with its large oldfashioned edwardian railings she called roper im here ill give her a nudge and after a few moments she heard over a voice box gate opening it revealed a fine driveway lined by poplars a gracious edwardian house standing at the far end with terraces and french windows greta had left her phone on fantastic thats worth four or five million easily clever lady four and a half but when his greatgrandfather bought the place it went for one hundred and seventyfive thousand pounds gasp away thats inflation on the housing market for you molly rashid opened the front door at the top of the terrace steps her hand outstretched major novikova welcome its so beautiful the house oh were very happy here my husband worships the place and so does my daughter it was as if everything was normal greta looked around noticing dramatic paintings everywhere and yorkshire stone on the floor which from the warmth was heated underneath kitchens at the end of the corridor molly said ill make us a brew unless you would prefer coffee im russian remember a tea person its so useful having a husband who is a bedouin rashids are great tea drinkers go on five minutes poke your nose anywhere see if you can see why theres no bathroom in the main bedroom greta moved quite quickly from bedroom to bedroom several bathrooms and dressing rooms all beautifully decorated a cheerful fullsize stuffed bear standing on the landing finally she reached the master bedroom which was a work of art with a superb dressing room next door she returned to the bedroom and looked thoughtfully at the wardrobe mirrored doors she opened them one by one and suddenly a section swung back disclosing a hidden bathroom a joy in contrasting marbles she went downstairs to find molly sitting at one of the bar stools dispensing tea how did you get on i found it after a thorough search its a refuge i presume well ive never had to use it in that way the idea of needing it for such a purpose fills me with alarm why does it have to be us your husband is a man of some distinction in the world therefore of great use for the dark side of the muslim world positive publicity would emerge if he went public supporting extremism instead he turns away from his faith spurns it that makes him a traitor in their world fundamentalists or many of them do not wish to acknowledge their britishness even when born here she got up i think we better get moving a few minutes later they were drawing out of the main gate how far did you say it was to abus shop five minutes thats all the traffic at that time of night is very sparse well actually pass it so ill show you she did pulling to a halt on the other side of the road there was a yellow painted van parked outside the shop with a sign that said cleansing department two men stood beside it with arabic features and yellow oilskins not surprising because of the rain and then a third man in a yellow oilskin appeared pushing a yellow painted wheelie bin spades and brushes falling out of it they exchanged words and the van drove away now thats strange molly said what is that third man was abu hes supposed to be on shift today maybe he works a second job greta said but she didnt believe that for a moment ill call roper she said she did and he returned her call fifteen minutes later youre getting nervous ladies theyve got half a dozen vans traveling the area and checking drains its a monthly exercise all right greta said well see you soon then what about breakfast taken care of tonys café round the corner in arch street takeaway delivery congealed scrambled egg bacon toast long since past its best id like to take someone on to cook but i havent the authority i also lack the genius that allows general charles ferguson dso military cross to select middleaged women with rosy cheeks to run a successful canteen like mrs grant did unfortunately shes gone to a better place or wasnt that her funeral i went to three weeks ago youre mad roper greta said i have been ever since i met you dear girl its a privilege to serve you until then greta was laughing hugely hes such a fool all bluff molly said oh yes theres no hope all those lives he saved and what was his return a burned face and severed spine shrapnel still in five places a wife who dumped him its true dillon told me when we were drinking too much one night apparently she simply couldnt cope she was young weak and vulnerable it happens to have done what he has is proof that major roper is a remarkable man dont think that beneath the surface there must be a man who is cursed by his suffering he is a survivor tell me about it youre a nice lady with a good heart i on the other hand served in chechnya afghanistan and iraq i still havent discovered what that means about me when i have ill let you know im so sorry molly said dont be in a strange way i rather enjoyed it i wonder what that makes me and she turned into the safe house and waited for the gate the breakfast from tonys was delivered to sergeant doyle in a vacuumpacked carrying box and he allowed molly to join her husband in his cell the others made do with the committee table in the conference room after they were all done roper asked the rashids to join them in the conference room well finish our coffee in a civilized way and then ill fill you all in he said im expecting a couple of people who are essential if were ever going to get off the ground a moment later the doorbell sounded and sergeant doyle returned with two fitlooking men in leather bomber jackets the raf mustaches said it all greetings were exchanged and roper made the introductions squadron leader lacey afc and flight lieutenant parry afc theyll be flying the gulfstream they specialize in operations for our outfit anything and everything lacey said dillon who had a flask of bushmills in his pocket took it out unscrewed the cap and toasted them theres just one small correction it seems that our two distinguished pilots have not one but two air force crosses apiece they both looked at him dumbfounded harry always reads the times it appears youve been gazetted in this mornings issue something about covert operations cant imagine where they got that from billy said dillon said to many more happy landings and raised the flask many more congratulations followed until roper opened a briefcase and took out a document pouch all right squadron leader this is for you flight details to baghdad its rather like that job we did a year and a half ago your passengers are billy and dillon the purpose of the trip is contained in that file youll wait for them and on the return therell be one other passenger a thirteenyearold girl being held under restraint in iraq dillon and billy will recover her and bring her back home lacey said the situation in baghdad is still very rough in the last two weeks seven helicopters have been downed naturally well do our best though we know you will when sir id say within the next twentyfour hours right major anything more roper put a little mystery into his voice squadron leader you will have seen many war films where the hero being asked to do some deed of daring is told it could win the war for us well this is rather like that there are security repercussions that would be hugely favorable for us if we can pull it off they took that very seriously indeed just let us get on with it well get straight up to farley now dillon turned to rashid caspar you should know that billy and i had dealings with the rashid tribe ourselves the other year with paul the earl of loch dhu and his sister lady kate both of them in turn the leaders of the tribe when they were still alive billy put in caspar stiffened did you have anything to do with that the events were a huge shock to the people it nearly cost them a railway bridge billy said you probably know itthe bacu spans a fivehundredfoot gorge constructed during world war two the bridge almost got blown up rashid was most disturbed the earl and his sister were killed that was you my friend youre not telling us your secrets why should i tell you ours incredible view from the bridge billy said molly said slowly are you trying to tell us you executed them notice the interesting scar on billys face said dillon that was kate rashid as well as two bullets in the pelvic girdle and another in the neck i know the rights and wrongs of these things are difficult to handle but thats the way it was believe me when i tell you they were very bad people perhaps you should retire to your husbands holding cell and try to come to terms with it roper said and we are the good guys doctor confusing isnt it doyle appeared to escort them and roper said you might as well sit in on this greta the rashid villa is north of the city in amara and thanks to the genius of my equipment i can show you it now amazing what we owe to the satellite look and marvel children the villa was obviously the home of a wealthy man there was no sign of bomb damage it was surrounded by palm trees in clumps and there was a sizable orange grove plus lemons and olives boats drifted along the tigris all very peaceful youd never think a war was going on billy said look carefully some women on the house terrace go through the orange and lemon groves at least half a dozen male workers and the main gate is fortified three men down there and ill bet those rifles they are carrying are aks a few tents in the grounds though tough nut to crack but not impossible on the river a fortyfoot speedboat flashed past because of the state of things in the city the boat business is booming it avoids roadside bombs exnavy guys sas former green berets are all at it who have you got dillon demanded a rogue named jack savage he was a sergeantmajor in the special boat service royal marines used to specialize in operations against the ira during the irish troubles knocking off trawlers and the like running guns in the irish sea ive negotiated an extremely large fee for which hell organize everything youll meet him in baghdad where a club down by the river he owns it in partnership with a wife named rawan savage originally rawan feleyah shes druze hes named it the river room tells me it reminds him of the savoy ive filled him in on the situation hell have the right sort of plan worked out you mean an approach from the tigris he and other vessels travel up and down particularly at night on good business and bad dillon nodded and turned to billy run me down to wapping lets fill harry in you know he likes that hell try and come too warned billy hes done that before tell me about it dillon said to greta youd better try to prise the good doctor from her husband greta went to their room and molly and caspar rose to greet her time to go you wont be seeing each other again until this whole thing is over how do you feel about that as allah wills he said for a man who doesnt follow his religion you reflect on allah a lot you could be right but we are all at the mercy of events this will be a violent affair if things go right it could go very simply and if they go wrong people will die even sara could die there are always risks but let me tell you about the man youre dealing with sean dillon he was the most feared enforcer the provisional ira ever had and what went wrong during the war in bosnia he flew a private plane into serbia carrying medical supplies for children he was shot down and facing death when charles ferguson arrived ferguson blackmailed dillon into joining his organization and then did a deal with his captors what kind of people inhabit your world molly rashid asked in a kind of horror people who are prepared to do whatever is necessary we must go you said you were on call at the hospital yes i am do you want to visit the house no not really i have everything i need good ill drop you then check to see that all is well ill see you again at the end of the afternoon i have your mobile number the rest of the journey passed in silence at the hospital molly rashid took the umbrella she was offered opened it and stood looking down you must have killed people yourself many times greta said serenely im in the death business but then so are you id have thought youd have got used to it by now molly rashid smiled sadly i imagined i was in the life business but it seems i was misinformed she turned toward the hospital entrance and abu came out and down the steps abu she called where are you going i thought you were on duty he smiled at them both ladies no ive got this afternoon off a friend is picking me up and at that moment the yellow van appeared carrying just the driver an arab with a pockmarked face this is jamal i often help him in my spare time jamal who looked like the kind of man who was permanently angry nodded unwillingly abu climbed in beside him and they drove away greta said to molly ill see you later and followed them the traffic was light at that time of the afternoon and on a hunch she drove straight to the rashids house parked in the garage and locked the door she went upstairs to the highest window in the house and only a few minutes later she could see the yellow van pause across the road as abu got out and came across and the van moved away and parked under the trees greta nodded better to let abu make a forced entrance information on caspar rashid that must be what he was after she listened to the sudden crash of a pantry window then retreated to the master bedroom and concealed herself in the refuge she could hear him moving around and finally entering the bedroom then he used his mobile phone and spoke in arabic to jamal thanks to her service in iraq she spoke fair arabic herself theres no one here no wait for me you have your orders im going to search the study see if i can find anything for professor khan just stay by the canal greta took her walther from the waist holster and twisted the carswell silencer on the muzzle she stepped out into the corridor he was toward the far end a pistol hanging in his right hand surprise surprise she said softly in arabic nice of you to call dr rashid is not at home but im her minder he swung round thunderstruck and for a moment seemed dazed she continued in english caspar rashid isnt at home either weve got him which must make you army of god people mad as hell and whos professor khan it was like an explosion his face contorted his hand started to lift and she shot him between the eyes a dull thud and he fell backward dead instantly she followed procedure as she had been taught got through to roper on her codex four where are you whats up ive got a disposal im at the rashid house alone the abu boy broke in armed id no choice theyll be on their way immediately hell be six pounds of gray ash at the crematorium in a matter of hours should i tell her when i see her at the hospital if i judge her right no shes not like us shes one of the good people corpses arent part of her world they were excellent the men in dark suits they might have been undertakers all their lives abus head was wrapped he was bodybagged and one of the men cleaned the corridor which luckily was varnished wood youd hardly notice major he produced a throw rug and laid it down there you are she saw them out then walked down the track beside the canal jamal was sitting behind the wheel and she leaned down he started violently and she tapped the walther on the van dont try anything she said in arabic the army of god is one man down ive shot abu dead and my people have taken him away if hes lucky all those virgins are waiting in paradise if not youve all been sold a bill of goods but who are you he asked in english british intelligence and ive got a message for you to deliver tell your boss professor khan were on to him his little army is out of business starting today or youll all be following in abus footsteps is that clear jamal said nothing but his forehead was sweating greta turned and walked away the engine started up behind her and she heard the van squeal off her codex went and roper said were all set we even replaced the window and swept up the glass so there should be no sign of what went on you okay on your end yes tell me roper does the name of a professor khan mean anything to you it certainly did to abu and jamal the van driver no it doesnt ring a bell i think if you put said professor through the wringer you might get a surprise i might just do that which he did and immediately opened an incredible can of worms when molly rashid came out of the hospital it was close to eight oclock and it was wet and miserable out she slid into the car im absolutely bushed hard day greta asked never stopped one operation after another frankly all i want is a sandwich and then bed what about you oh the usual kind of day bloody boring greta laughed as she drove away come on lets get you home baghdad chapter the deal roper had made with jack savage had been enough to make him sit up and take notice especially as the payment would be in american dollars they had known each other well during the irish troubles roper up to his ears in bomb disposal work savage chasing gun runners by night in the irish sea when they had discussed ropers requirements roper had told him of dillon and billy of sara rashid and their intention of spiriting her away savage couldnt care less what they were up to the deal was so good there was no way he was turning it down his wife rawan saw things differently a couple of years ago abdul rashid had used his connections to spirit her parents out of iraq to jordan after extremists had burned their houseboat on the river she owed him one when her husband explained what their guests would be doing when they arrived she made it clear she didnt approve listen he said im not turning down a payday like this and the connection with british intelligence is likely to be worth even more in the future just get that through your head bastard she said moneythats all you care about you can sleep on the deck tonight im not missing much it suits me fine he grabbed a couple of rugs a bottle of scotch and went on deck the only major point that roper had got wrong was that sara rashid wouldnt be running anywhere because her grandfather had arranged to have her fitted with leg irons after her persistent attempts to escape she had been locked in a bedroom for most of each day for exercise she was given the chance to walk in the gardens and orange groves but there were guards with her armed with ak assault rifles and her cousin hussein who one day would marry her was always one of them she was treated with due respect by the guards in fact by all the servants for her grandfather was not only rich but powerful his connections with osama bin laden and the army of god well known his love for sara was genuine and very deep especially since the death of his own wife one of seventytwo other people killed in a car bombing in downtown baghdad the fact that sara was of mixed race he could accept but his son forswearing his religion that was an abomination sara mature beyond her years sat in her room and with little better to do improved her arabic and contemplated what her grandfather had told her that they would eventually be forced to join the exodus of middleclass iraqis from baghdad hazar would be their destination to join her grandfathers brother jemal head of the family in that country they were rich and the rashid bedouins lived in the empty quarter one of the most ferocious deserts in the world it would be a guarantee of safety so that was the way things would probably work out outside now on one of her walks the wind off the water played with the wonderful silk scarf that framed her face she was pretty and she knew it hussein adored her and she took full advantage of that fact do you want to return to your room not yet who is that she pointed to a shabby motor launch approaching as it slowed and drifted into the jetty she saw that it was a woman at the wheel dressed in western style her hair tied back wearing a khaki bush shirt and pants and a shoulder holster under her left arm the woman tossed a line and one of the men caught it and tied up the launch had an english nameeagle hussein how are you she said id rather be doing my final year at medical school but there you are the war the war the bloody war this is sara sara this is rawan savage she turned to sara ive known you were here for some months but weve never had an opportunity to meet my you are pretty arent you all this was delivered in english sara said were you born in baghdad yes but to a druze family she turned to face hussein i need to see your uncle right away hussein can i go up of course hes in the orange grove until i see you again she said to sara and started up the steps leading through the oranges to where rashid was seated rashid greeted her courteously and leaned close to her while she spoke and when she had finished he placed his hand on her head in a blessing she stood up and returned to the boat he called to hussein wait for me here hussein said and mounted the steps uncle see sara goes to her room and ill send women to help her pack pack uncle ive prepared for this day for months it is time for us to go shell need a woman take jasmine well need two land rovers i think three of the men to assist with security youre in charge but where are we to go kuwait only four hundred miles by road the instructions are in the briefcase ill give you my people there will make all arrangements for your onward flight to my brother jemal in hazar but why uncle rawan brought me disturbing news that her husband is engaged in a plot with two men from england named dillon and salter to kidnap sara and return her to my son in london this cannot be hussein said i have made what i trust will be a suitable greeting for them she informs me they arrive later today then ill deal with them noi hope i have taken care of it sara is my most precious jewel you are the only one i can trust swear to me you will guard her with your life always in the name of allah i swear it go now and allah go with you and he turned and went in content for hussein rashid was no ordinary man twentythree years of age dark hair but blue eyes he could have passed as a western european he was slim but muscular and hugely intelligent and when his anger sparked in the eyes he changed became truly frightening the warrior few people realized he was hed been a medical student at harvard when the gulf war started and had immediately packed his bags to go home only to be arrested at logan airport in boston it was six months before lawyers succeeded in obtaining his freedom and he had gone home to discover that his parents had been killed in a bombing raid three months earlier his uncle had kept him sane during the bad time had provided him with money set up accounts for him in paris and london had provided him with addresses the right people to see people who would pass him hand by hand until he reached the camp in the algerian desert there theyd turned him into the man known as the hammer of god and it was there that hed grown the luxuriant long hair and the beard that became his trademark he was not a religious fanatic hardly religious at all but hed discovered his true calling there to be a soldier theyd taught him everything and by the time he was done he was an expert in weaponry explosives handtohand fighting vehicles and the fine art of assassination his medical training was just a bonus they even taught him to fly he had worked for what some people might call terrorist organizations in such places as chechnya and kosovo but his specialty had been assassination and he had become a master in the mess that iraq developed into he had lived with his uncle operating as a freelance sniper his personal score was twentyseven american and british soldiers and iraqi politicians it was all the same to hussein and then his uncle had kidnapped sara and everything changed in london roper wished them well and grinned as dillon and billy made final preparations for departure got everything he asked of course billy told him as he zipped up an aircraft bag what would we bloody leave for gods sake theres always your codex four very funny billy said never mind billy youre going off to war and you know from experience theres nothing like a nice war try not to get your head blown off yes well youve got ferguson to think about what if he phones up and tells you he wants his plane you mean i could get the sack i doubt it roper smiled i inhabit a wheelchair and ive got medals as for the gulfstream didnt he tell dillon he was sending it back in case of emergencies so he did mind you he might think baghdad a bit of a stretch well worry about that when we have to now get moving sergeant doyles waiting with the land rover try not to screw up as if we would they left and ten minutes later ferguson did come on the line how are things going you mean at the coal face sir is that a reprimand roper now would i imply that you werent beating your brains out general taking care of world affairs well we were up half the night and im just about to join the conference again anything to report not a whisper sir its as if every terrorist in the land has rolled over and died the chaps are all polishing their nails youre incorrigible roper a bell sounded faintly must go ill be in touch yes sir i look forward to it roper poured a large scotch lit a cigarette and continued his investigation of the mysterious professor khan at farley field the quartermaster had loaded their supplies and weaponry two aks a couple of colts with hollowpoint cartridges and ankle holster titanium waistcoats nothing left to chance sergeant major i dont believe it should be mr dillon thats not the way to operate good luck gentlemen at the top of the steps parry in flying overalls reached a hand out and a car horn sounded and the aston came round from the entrance and pulled up harry at the wheel he ran forward and as billy turned he flung his arms round him take care dillon said i always knew you were a sentimentalist at heart you think what you like as long as you bring him back they went up the steps into the gulfstream parry closed the door and joined lacey in the cockpit billy and dillon settled down and a few minutes later the gulfstream took off roper came online two hours into the flight is everything going all right fine what about you dillon asked professor khan is proving more than promising dreq khan is his name he was a clever young man who took a first degree at home in pakistan then earned a scholarship to oxford totally anglicized now with apparently an unlimited supply of cash he started as an assistant lecturer in morality at leeds university billy laughed sorry i didnt know you could be one of those apparently left after a year and moved to america the university of chicago then a year later to berkeley in california dillon said you see billy he couldnt resist the call of hollywood came back east for a post at the united nations secretary to the international committee for racial harmony let me guess dillon said after that he finally made it back to good old england londonistan right you are and hes certainly made his way in politics the committee for socialist valuesthat really made his bones in london got him in good with a lot of wellmeaning socialists hes also on the interfaith committee at the house of commons and is sponsored by various anglican bishops hes muted his support for the army of god ever since three of its members were arrested in yorkshire for that bomb in a bus station that killed three and injured fourteen but he insists that those three were a splinter group that the organization itself is purely spiritual and educational billy said what do you think i think hes dangerous as hell and all those committees just obscure what he really is roper said ive never been so certain of anything in my life but theres no proof of anything not even a whisper of terrorist activity theres nothing to spark an investigation by the police antiterrorist squad dillon said except that when greta raised the question of professor khan with that driver and told him shed killed abu he was terrified and made no attempt to deny it billy said its still not enough roper said but ill keep at it i heard from ferguson what did you hear dillon said only that he keeps going into conference with the prime minister and the great and the good has he indicated when hes coming back not exactly i wouldnt give it more than a couple of days so its all up to you gentlemen keep in touch he clicked off an hour out of baghdad with dawn coming up fast they descended to thirty thousand feet there was considerable traffic and parry came back from the cockpit to fill them in were doing night approach which means the sods on the ground dont have as good a viewthe raggedarse brigade are good unfortunately particularly with handheld missiles a lot of helicopters get wasted over the city so whats the solution billy asked its a trick the yanks resurrected from the vietnam war we approach from fifteen thousand then dive pull up only at the last possible moment that sounds pretty hairy to me billy said but it works the raf used it in kosovo too and with larger planes now as to whats facing you down there i know you gentlemen have done this once before so ill only say its even worse theres an old saying hell is a city well gentlemen i doubt whether anywhere in the world could be worse than baghdad take care at all times and rememberin this town you cant even trust your grandmother the last time we did this dillon said we were cared for by a flight lieutenant robson he was police still at it squadron leader now hes already been on the radio everythings waiting and we had a safe car with an raf police sergeant named parker a really good guy he stood by us in a firefight dillon said do we get him again unfortunately not he was killed by a roadside bomb last month id better join lacey now jesus billy said what a bloody place as he looked down to the city below there was an explosion a mushroom cloud of smoke rising from the damage never mind billy youve seen worse dillon took out his flask unscrewed the cap and swallowed a generous mouthful of bushmills no dillon i dont think i have billy leaned back and closed his eyes for the descent in baghdad they were received in the mess by robson himself as a waiter in a white tunic arranged tea things robson said so bloody hot in this hellhole teas just the thing as they discovered in the days of the raj well things have certainly been happening to you he told lacey and parry awarded a second air force cross each what are you doing trying to fight the war on your own something like that lacey told him as the tea was poured robson turned to dillon and billy i wont ask what you two have been up to i dont know and i dont want to just like last time the gulfstream will stand by here ready for an immediate exit at any time i have a red security one tag for each of you it covers everything you must be hot stuff even the station commander doesnt have one of these dillon said im sorry to hear of sergeant parkers death most unfortunate happens all the time im afraid you wont need anything like that this time a mr jack savage is picking you up i understand we know him well is someone taking my name in vain they all turned and saw him standing in the mess doorway medium height roughly cut blond hair a broken nose a reefer coat over his arm come in you old bastard robson said and thats an order sergeant major someone once said that in baghdad all the streets seemed to be some sort of market although many of them seemed to be lucky to have any buildings left at all and the peasants were still there their donkeys carrying not just produce from the countryside but everything from laptops to televisions the detritus of war they moved through narrow streets down toward the river finally turning into a courtyard outside an old colonial house with a fountain that still worked a sign over the door traced out the river room with bulbs they got out and savage snapped his fingers for two boys to grab the luggage and take it inside the sign billy asked does it still light up im missing half a dozen bulbs theyre special but it reminds me of london the savoy the old river room why do you stay dillon asked these days it must be the ultimate way of living on the knife edge thats what i like about it you can make money here like nowhere else on earth lets go in they followed it was shadowy a floor of arabic tiles tables and chairs of cane even the bar was cane with a mirror and what looked like every kind of bottle in the world stacked against it the bartender who stood polishing glasses was big and fat wearing a white shirt and pants a scarlet belt of some kind around his middle whats your pleasure savage asked for billy nothing he doesnt indulge ill have bushmills irish whiskey two farouk takes me back to northern ireland in the troubles so youre the great sean dillon and youre the bad jack savage dillon turned to billy he had a lovely racket going chasing down gun runners on the one hand then selling the proceeds to the provisional ira on the other but not while i was in the royal marines not while wearing the badge that wouldnt have been honorable hes big on honor rawan savage moved into the room ill have a large vodkavery large god its hot in here she walked out onto a wooden balcony and they followed a couple of minutes later farouk was distributing the drinks cheers to new friends rawan raised her glass and in a way seemed to swallow it whole but that was only an illusion she held it out to farouk without saying a word he turned and went back inside the river wasnt particularly busy below them tied to the jetty was the motor launch eagle rawan said just up there a quarter of a mile is abdul rashids place do you want to have a look shut up rawan savage told her yes sir she gave him a mock salute look i wont tell you again savage said drink up or shut up take your choice is that so she turned to dillon well i know why youre here and i dont admire it is that so dillon said snatching a thirteenyearold girl from her grandfather lets keep to the facts billy put in the said thirteenyearold girl was snatched from her parents in london in the first place but she didnt want to listen and charged into the bar where farouk stood behind the counter a strange threatening stillness to him customers four of them were there one with an ak on the table close to his hand another with one slung from his shoulder the other two had a hand each in a pocket a woman slipped through the door her clothes held tightly around her she looked terrified and glanced anxiously about her rawan said ah someone bearing ill news gentlemen this is bibi one of sara rashids ladies of the bedchamber whats wrong bibi have they gone without you the woman cried bitterly flung herself to her knees and a flood of arabic ensued rawan said excellent someone seems to have spoiled the party and warned abdul rashid several hours ago he dispatched sara with hussein rashid her intended in a small convoy to kuwait by road once there friends will forward them by private plane to hazar where the rest of the rashids thrive it is all true bibi heard it being discussed you are dead men walking hussein will see to it there was a silence savage said but who told him who do you think im sick of you jack have been for a long time you can rot in hell in the near distance there was a huge explosion and everybody instinctively ducked the sound of the aftershock drifted like a wave the telephone on the bar sounded farouk picked it up and listened then held it out to savage omar the boy you had watching the rashid villa he saw the convoy for kuwait leave two hours ago so old rashid had just driven out in his mercedes accompanied by two guards it exploded as it went through the gate his face said it all because of people like you who come amongst us and destroy everything you touch there must have been something about his expression that gave warning a twitch a glint of determination because dillon who had been sitting down pulled on the ankle holster yanked out the colt and shot farouk between the eyes the hollowpoint cartridge wreaking havoc in almost the same moment he pulled out the silenced walther from his waistband under the jacket and shot the one who was reaching for the ak on a table billy produced his walther as a third man was trying to get a browning out of his righthand pocket and snagged it billy shot him instantly and the man was hurled against his companion who shot him inadvertently in the back dont shoot for gods sake the companion called in as irish a voice as you could wish for but as billy hesitated the irishmans hand swung up to fire and it was dillon who finished him off dont do that again billy it never pays christ i thought he was irish billy went down felt in an inside pocket and produced a passport brown with the gold harp of ireland on it and a few papers bring them with you dillon turned and rawan said damn you damn you all and damn this stinking country jack she ran down the steps to the jetty untied the line on the eagle and cast off savage clattered down the steps after her and jumped for the eagle as it drifted out rawan he called just listen not anymore she said and pressed the starter it rattled a couple of times and then there was a huge explosion and the boat simply came apart billy was hurled backward over a cane chair dillon pulled him up lets get out of it and fast the military will be here in no time well take that land rover savage used to bring us from the airport our stuff is still on board they were out in seconds and into the land rover billy at the wheel and moved into the main street as two scimitars came the opposite way a sizable crowd was already assembling but the confusion of it helped them to make a rapid exit dillon called roper who answered at once just listen dillon said and gave him an account my god you have been in action why does this sort of thing always reach out to touch you dillon just tell robson to alert the boys to get us out of here god knows where to the mad side of me wants to pursue them to hazar but i dont think the general would approve no he damn well wouldnt ferguson cut in outrageous finding my plane has been hijacked get yourselves back here immediately at baghdad airport they were admitted through a discreet security entrance and found lacey and robson waiting in a jeep just follow lacey called to billy which he did and found the gulfstream waiting off you go robson said we prefer to think of you as never having been here they went up the steps and lacey locked the door thanks a lot you bastards the general was not exactly thrilled when he tried to book his personal plane for the flight from paris and found it elsewhere what in the hell were you playing at didnt i tell you dillon said trying to win the war dillon got his flask out as they climbed but it was empty he waited until they leveled off at forty thousand feet and peered out the window goodbye to baghdad city of romance intrigue and adventure yes everything you can do without billy said i cant figure it so the rawan bird is fed up with jack and spills her guts to old rashidand he responds by having someone arrange to have the launch blown up he was after the three of ussavage you and me it was just too bad about her and what about the car bomb a daily risk a man like him would have more enemies than he could count dillon got up and went to the rear of the cockpit opened the firstaid drawer and helped himself to the half bottle of brandy it contained purely medicinal he told parry who had glanced over his shoulder always is with you when dillon returned to his seat he found billy examining the irish passport taken from the man he had killed in the bar terence omalley age fortytwo an address in bangor northern ireland a nice place dillon opened the brandy and poured some into a plastic cup what else does it tell us apparently hes a schoolmaster id bet hes not been that for a long time ira id say so we know many old hands have moved into organized crime its a very small step from what they were doing into the world of the mercenary billy wild geese thats what theyve always been called in ireland or out of it if youve been a provo for all those years its difficult to turn your hand to something else when its all over what have you got in there a monthly rental bill from dublin a letter from a man named tom a pleasecomehome letter signed your loving mother rose address in bangor cash five onehundreddollar bills american he looked up what do we do about his mother i mean id let it go billy if she knows nothing then it leaves her hope now im going to catch a little sleep and he dropped his seat on the road south from baghdad to kuwait it was a macabre situation a landscape of burnedout tanks and trucks and civilian vehicles dating back to the original gulf war the highway of death they had called it a landscape that also contained the remains of many thousands of refugees and yet all the way along the highway at suitable intervals there were gas stations open twentyfour hours for that was the one thing they werent short of and places you could get coffee and shortorder cooking and the telephones worked in the first land rover were husseins three henchmen armed to the teeth veterans of the streets men who knew their business which was proved by the fact that they were still here in the rear was hussein sara and jasmine another cousin of saras who was devoted to her fifty miles out of baghdad the little convoy had pulled up in the car park of a gas station hussein received a call on his satellite phone from the man he knew only as the broker he had been allocated to him by alqaeda for three years now they spoke on occasion in arabic but in english when appropriate and on those occasions the broker sounded like an oxford professor hussein answered at once where are you said the voice hussein told him good you were in an impossible situation other contacts covered events for me one of rashids men placed the bomb in the savage peoples boat and rashid himself it was a local sunni group who got him an old score how has sara taken it he sounded strangely paternalistic and yet there was a certain concern in his voice im just about to tell her but ive further information the woman who told rashid of the kidnap attempt said the men involved are called dillon and salter are they familiar to you no but they soon will be ill call you when i know more take care of sara ive made all the arrangements in kuwait a hawk youll enjoy flying that when hussein returned to the group they were waiting you could have gone for coffee and a bite to eat he said not in my leg irons cousin must i endure further humiliation and he didnt hesitate extracted no false promises forgive me cousin so much has happened he produced a key and unlocked the chains dropping them over the seat then said i have grave news from baghdad his words lingered his people waited so used to bad news they knew this must be special and hussein put an arm around saras shoulders my uncle saras grandfather has been taken from us at the villa it was a car bomb as he was leaving in his mercedes jasmine gave a short wail then started to sob one of the men hassim said sunnis it would appear so may they rot in hell hamid joined in cursed for a thousand years two thousand said khazid sara stood there saying nothingcome hussein said we all agree but we still have a long trip ahead of us we must eat she nodded torn in her heart between her feelings for her parents and a stubborn old man who had wronged her terribly yet loved her deeply yes she said yes she took husseins arm and they walked to the café london dublin kuwait chapter at farley field as the gulfstream touched down dillon looked out and saw ferguson standing under an umbrella smoking a cigarette what do you think trouble billy asked oh i dont know you might be surprised dillon answered parry opened the door and they moved out followed by lacey who said dammit sean we dont like our time wasted im not sure thats a correct description savage and his wife were blown up in their boat on the tigris and four very unpleasant geezers tried to take us out in the bar at savages club when we left it looked like the last chance saloon in a bad movie billy pointed out how many lacey said slowly four dillon told him so your time wasnt wastedand i suspect were about to use your services again where to this time lacey said youve been there before hazar christ almighty parry saidyou nearly left your bones there billy well i didnt and ive no intention of leaving them there this time they reached ferguson who said all right gentlemen get in the back of the daimler and explain yourselves your body count is beginning to rival tombstone s after dillon sketched in the events he said after all general you did say we could use the gulfstream in an emergency yes but i hadnt envisaged this and it all started with you billy said last time you saw us you suggested we go to heathrow and haunt passport control which is where we came up with caspar rashid dillon cut in all right all right ferguson was getting testy as they coasted through london toward holland park im the first to admit he could be very useful for us have you told him we failed to get sara not yet i thought his wife should be considered too shes operating now but major novikova will tell her and then bring her to us eleven oclock should be about right great billy said time for a full english breakfast we dont have a cook dillon reminded him who says so ferguson frowned all i had to do was telephone the civil service pool a mrs hall appeared almost straightaway answers to maggie shes from jamaica thoughim not sure about the full english breakfast for gods sake general they probably invented it that was billy so they failed at the hospital molly rashid was very pale no color in her face at all and weary suddenly in a way she hadnt been before greta noticed that at once and the hands were shaking you need a drink she said no molly ran a hand through her hair ive got another operation this afternoon i dont think so your right hand is shaking like a leaf you couldnt possibly operate in your present condition molly covered her face with both hands what am i going to do greta got a glass took a bottle of vodka from the fridge she almost filled the glass come on take it straight down it numbs the brain molly hesitated then did as she was told she gagged staggered to the sink for a moment it was as if she was going to be sick but she took a couple of deep breaths and pulled herself together my god that hit the spot she turned and smiled wanly wed better go and face it i suppose yes greta said i suppose we should what do you mean you failed rashid said as he turned from the window to dillon we simply couldnt get anywhere near her oh dear you couldnt get anywhere near her my father will be pleased mr rashid your father is dead rashid was stricken aged visibly took a step stumbled reached for a chair and grabbed hold of it to steady himself i think youd better sit down dillon said which rashid did how did he die was it you no id nothing to do with it he was killed going out of the main gate of his villa with his chauffeur car bomb the word is that it was a sunni operation were there any other casualties yes four men intent on killing us he seemed to come alive again not that it lasted since they obviously didnt succeed i assume you managed to kill them thats correct your wife has been informedmajor novikova went to give her the sad news and bring her back here for a conference a conference he said it slowly as if he was finding it difficult to speak at all or to understand he plucked at words reaching in a futile way and running his fingers through his hair and then he took an enormous deep breath took out a cigarette lit it and inhaled deeply thats better i think lets get to it and see if theres some way of sorting this out they sat in the committee room ferguson at the head of the table rashid and molly close together holding hands greta was pouring coffee dillon and billy stood together by the window listening and roper in his chair was at the far end of the table ill come directly to the point ferguson said there was a bargain between you and my people which was not fulfilled rashid said i dont see my daughter here that was due to circumstances dillon said the body count makes that clear the point now is what comes next comes next rashid asked of course ferguson told him nothing has changed fundamentally you want your daughter back and so do we and we know her destination hazar its a place weve all worked in before you were there yourself recently dillon said what for rashid didnt reply his face showing great emotion it was his wife who intervenedfor gods sake caspar talk to them what happened wasnt their fault were not playing games here people died i want my daughter back so tell them what they need to know to make that happen caspar sighed i was fooled into believing that my uncle jemal in hazar would act as a middleman between my father and me what made you think that not what but who it was the broker he first spoke to me over a year ago when i was being pressured by army of god fanatics to join their organization a colleague at the university professor dreq khan was the chief mover and shaker behind the army of god and at first they seemed harmless just a charitable organization but then on my world travels i started receiving approaches from a number of extreme groups when i tried to withdraw from my involvement dreq khan warned me that i would be considered a traitor that i would be targeted by muslim extremists and then came my daughters abduction the broker told me that if i did what they told me he would arrange for jemal to act as a gobetween with my father so i felt i had no choice i mainly acted as a bagman under orders passing highly technical information on various matters to khan who obviously passed it on then the broker told me i should come to hazar that they were ready to talk to me but it was all a lie they just wanted me to take a look at an old railway that alqaeda wanted to update i was near to despairand thats when you found me so here we are ferguson said here we are and the mideast wasnt the only place they sent me they sent me to ireland too im a visiting professor at trinity college dublin good god ferguson said are you going to tell us thats a center of muslim radicalism not at all but in my bagman identity i had to act as a gobetween for certain organizations there such as ferguson asked outfits claiming to be security firms its an open secret that with peace in northern ireland many former members of the provisional ira have found themselves on the scrapheap and dont much care for it one way out for them is crime i believe that in the last year there have been at least seventy shootings in the dublin area that show evidence of having been committed by professionals so what dillon said what do you expect after thirtyodd years of their own war i accept that but what im talking about are firms claiming legitimacy in security affairs but actually supplying what can only be described as mercenaries people hired as instructors for terrorist training camps in north africa algeria one of them for instance is called scamrock security run by a man named michael flynn and you have details of these camps roper asked of some of themyes there are one or two in the empty quarter as well there was a long silence while ferguson drummed his fingers on the table finally he said youve given us a lot to digest while ropers working on this information we have to consider our next step regarding your daughter which would be to move the action to hazar would you wish us to do that it was molly who answered instantly oh god yes i want my daughter more than anything but can you do it as i said weve operated in hazar in the past for the past three years my cousin professor hal stone of corpus christi college cambridge has been diving on an ancient phoenician wreck on the edge of the harbor at hazar he works from an old dhow using arabs its a shoestring operation but i happen to know his diving season is soon to start dillon and billy are expert divers themselves and hed welcome us i assure you wed pass as a perfectly acceptable group of mad english archaeologists would that be acceptable you could come with us no not that she shook her head im partway through some of the most important work of my life she turned to her husband caspar of course he nodded i must isnt there the chance youll be recognized billy asked caspar shook his head ill wear robes a fold of cloth across my face use the language it will work suddenly he looked fierce determined it must work right ferguson said things to do i must contact my cousin you dr rashid will oblige me by pouring your heart out to roper as for you he said to dillon see to the plane molly rashid stood up ill get back to the hospital ferguson put an arm around her shoulder dont worry my dear well succeed i promise you greta said ill take you back they went out and caspar waited until the door closed and said there is something else of great importance i must tell you and what would that be ferguson asked saras cousin the man who is to be her future husband when she is of age hussein isnt it roper said a medical student does the hammer of god mean anything to you not that i know of when i last counted his score was twentyseven allied soldiers and a handful of political assassinations in europe good god ferguson said tell us about him which rashid did when he had finished dillon said trimly well at least we know he turned to billy lets get moving as they left he said to roper michael flynn years ago he was ira chief of staff till he ended up in the maze prison look him up sitting in his suite in paris volkov went over in his mind the last conversation he had had with vladimir putin the elimination of ferguson and company made sense it had already started with the murder of detective superintendent hannah bernstein the year before igor levin was a more difficult case however because he had a few million sterling tucked away in london he could not be bought chomsky the sergeant who had gone to dublin with him was a clever one but irritatingly seemed to feel some sort of loyalty to levin popov was the weak link volkov took out his address book found popovs number in dublin and phoned him it was a mobile and found popov strolling along wellington quay beside the river liffey it was raining and popov was holding an umbrella over his head a young woman named mary otoole at his side my dear popov volkov spoke in russian volkov speaking how are you its been some time popov was shocked and replied with difficulty general i cant believe it its been so long oh i like to keep in touch volkov said popov and the girl were approaching a hotel he knew he squeezed her waist mary my love you go in and get us a table in the cocktail bar this is important so she went and he reverted to russian general i dont know what to say why just that youre happy to hear from me hows the job still at scamrock security how is my old friend mr flynn popov swallowed hard my god i didnt realize that i got you the job oh yes flynn and i go way way back to the very early days of the irish struggle that he hasnt mentioned this to you shows how much he is to be trusted i presume you find that your experience in military intelligence is of value in your work absolutely general youve heard about belov international that max chekov is the new chief executive officer did you ever serve under him i never had that privilege you may have that pleasure to come i trust that i can still rely on you of course general excellent how is chomsky he breezed through his law exams and works for a city attorney as a legman and levin enjoys himself he is after all rich as im well aware so nice to talk to you ill be in touch but please keep this conversation private for some reason he couldnt explain popov was thrilled of course general the line went dead and he went up the steps to the hotel two at a time the bar was half empty and mary was seated in a booth by the window she was a secretary at scamrock security was used to hearing him speaking foreign languages for he was proficient in german and french russian she said thats a new one you always surprise me popov had an english mother and hed been raised on the language as a child in moscow he was perfectly able to pass himself off as an englishman and did business he said you can never get away from it now what would you like to drink chomsky was a different proposition he had a firstclass academic brain and a firm belief in himself hed completed his law degree in just over a year at trinity a phenomenal achievement and working as a legman for a top firm of attorneys suited him perfectly he much preferred to be out of the office for he could handle himself and had a medal for bravery in chechnya to prove it he was walking through temple bar one of his favorite places in the city with its bars restaurants shops and galleries and was making for crown alley with its cafés and brightly painted shops his intention was to meet levin enjoy a drink go to the cinema and eat afterward when his phone rang and he heard volkovs voice it did not affect him the way it had popov he was used to handling people especially under the stress of legal and illegal situations nothing in life surprised him anymore he dodged in a doorway to avoid the rain general what a surprise i thought id catch up my spies tell me you performed magnificently in your law exam true though i say it myself and your work for the riley partnership more than interesting chomsky laughed why general youve been checking up on me my dear boy we do have an embassy in dublin in which the gru is well represented checking on your activities gives them something to do i can imagine and how is levin come now general im sure you are well aware how he is he has a luxury apartment looking out over the liffey and more than one lady and he enjoys his life completely but a bit boring for someone of his background i should have thought on that i cant comment this firm popov works for scamrock security my information is that it supplies contract mercenaries to the trade now that there is peace in ireland there must be many members of the provisional ira seeking gainful employment now if it was the police saying that to me general id have to say i dont know what youre talking about but of course nice to talk to you goodbye for now and what was all that about chomsky asked himself as he stepped out into the road volkov caught levin a few moments later after he had stepped out of the rain into a quiet bar called kellys it was an oldfashioned sort of a place with comfortable booths giving privacy he was greeted with familiarity by a barman named mick who brought him a large bushmills whiskey chomsky entered the bar at that moment same for me mick he took off his raincoat guess whos just been on the phone to me shock me levin said volkov at the same moment levins mobile rang he answered it and smiled and leaned close to chomsky so that he could hear it was volkov general what a pleasure levin said amiably ah chomsky has joined you you are still close siamese twins this is good how are you in excellent spirits rain in dublin is curiously refreshing and the girls are more than beautiful they have irish charm life couldnt be better where are you moscow no paris im with president putin at the brussels conference he was asking after you igor really levin said yes charles ferguson was in brussels too with the british prime minister it jogged putins memory ferguson s people have been an intolerable nuisance you could say that plus blake johnson my original order was to get rid of the lot of them but we only succeeded with superintendent hannah bernstein the mention made levin feel uncomfortable always had in spite of the fact that all he had done there was chauffeur an ira hit man to heathrow airport whats this all about he asked why i miss your valuable services you and the boys the president wants you i told him youd decamped to dublin and that it was difficult and what did he say to tell you that your president needs you and russia needs you think about it good help is hard to find and youre the best its amazing how frequently people let you down and whats that supposed to mean ill give you an example a few days ago blake johnson was in london available to all walking down the street lhuzkov and max chekov arranged for a couple of wouldbe assassins to take care of him instead dillon and salter took care of them it was ludicrous you would never have let that happen like you said good help is hard to find never mind general if at first you dont succeed you know the rest my poor levin you must find life infinitely boring not being in the game just think about what ive said well speak again the old bastard chomsky said well speak again he waved to the barman same again mick interesting though levin said a piece of crap like max chekov in charge of belov international ive been following that one closely nothing changes it would seem chomsky said i wonderdo you think hes called popov a good point dont tell popov about our conversations with volkov just see if he mentions his in fact why dont you phone him now chomsky did finding popov still with mary in the cocktail bar of the hotel hello its me chomsky said in english im just having a drink with igor and then were going to a show do you want to join us popov didnt even hesitate not tonight thanks im about to have dinner with mary thats all right then so how are things with you anything new no just the same old thing okay just thought id ask have a good time he slipped his mobile into his pocket hes having dinner again with the girl from the office hes getting serious levin said no i dont think so not if the way hes talked in the past is anything to go by but he didnt mention volkov did he its inconceivable that the general would have spoken to us and not to him which shows hes stupid then surely he would know that wed assume that he had chomsky shrugged what does it prove that maybejust maybefriend popov is in volkovs pocket has been since we left london i knew one of you was im satisfied it isnt you circumstances indicate otherwise thanks very much is there any reason why it matters i think volkovs approach indicates that there could be but enough levin got up the delights of james bond await well dine afterwards michael flynn was in his early fifties almost six feet tall a powerful figure of a man in an excellent suit of donegal tweed his face strong and purposeful the face of a man who didnt waste time on anything his office at scamrock security had paneled walls of oak dark green velvet curtains at the windows green velvet carpet the desk and furniture speaking of a successful man who liked to be exact in the great days of revolution he had been for a while chief of staff in the provisional ira although prison had followed that those days were far behind him now he was a successful businessman head of a company offering its expertise in the field of international security he looked out the window at the rain but he was in a cheerful mood business was good the death businesswith all the wars and rumors of wars it was the kind of world in which his business could only thrive he returned to his desk took the stopper out of a cut glass decanter and poured whiskey into a glass and then his mobile sounded the special one he kept only in his inside pocket yes he said mr flynn this is volkov sweet jesus flynn swallowed the whiskey and poured anotherits been a while since i heard from you he sat on the edge of the desk so what can i do for you oh i just wanted to keep you informed as you know i have a direct pipeline to alqaeda the broker right yes he has informed me that an associate of mine abdul rashid was carbombed in baghdad it was a sunni operation so how does this touch me a man you supplied worked for him his name was terence omalley a provo the schoolmaster a good man came from bangor what happened he was killed in a firefight with a man named sean dillon and a london gangster called billy salter have you heard of them you could say that dillon and i were comrades in the old days salter i know only by reputation what was it about a personal matter old rashid had kidnapped his granddaughter from england a girl of thirteen apparently dillon and salter were trying to get her back a good deed in a naughty world that sounds like sean dillon mad as a hatter anyway i thought you should know i appreciate it listen flynn said the new company belov international does it need security work as a matter of fact it probably does especially at the irish end drumore place thats a good idea flynn well speak about it later goodbye for now flynn sat there thinking about it a pity about omalley a good comrade and big for the cause but like so many unable to handle a future without it he poured another whiskey and raised his glass heres to you terence rest in peace he emptied his glass put on a trench coat and went out kuwait the empty quarter london chapter kuwait was kuwait the oil wells working away the visible signs of war no longer in evidence desert storm had been a long time ago hussein had checked on the satellite phone and before arrival had been given instructions to a part of the airport some distance away from the terminals used for jumbos and other passenger planes the land rovers moved through a number of parked cargo planes and finally reached a place of separate hangars and private planes parked with precision the one on the end was an old hawk eightseater and a man in stained overalls came down the steps from the interior he was american from his accent my names grant mr rashid thats me rashid said shes all yours are you familiar with this aircraft im familiar with many aircraft types have i anything to sign no everythings taken care of he opened an envelope and took a document out ill return your pilots license it was an excellent forgery but hussein made no comment on that my thanks flying down to hazar how long would it take in such a plane two and a half hours maybe three how experienced are you at desert flying ive flown many times in morocco and algeria this is the empty quarter winds of great force can come out of nowhere so be careful i have flown in the area south of here and im familiar with the landmarks and the airport good anyway i photocopied a section of the map for you just in case you need itthe route there and the airport between hazar town and the small coastal village of kafkar on the bluff overlooking it thank you right lets get on board hussein ordered jasmine and sara they went up the steps followed by khazid hamid and hussein passed weaponry up to him several ak rifles some uzi machine pistols and assault bags loaded with ammunition and grenades and three or four shoulderfired missiles are you guys expecting a war or something i thought there was always a war of some kind in the empty quarter thats true my family is rashid shipping as im sure you know piracy is not unheard of tell me about it if youd just sign the manifest you can be on your way hussein was the last to board heaving up the steps and closing the hatch behind him jasmine and sara had already discovered a large basket and were examining it plenty of food in here and good bread jasmine said sara opened another one and took out a bottle you can tell he was american she said wine red and white whiskey and brandy hardly what the prophet whose name be praised would recommend ive always found the prophet very understanding said young hamid who had been an artist before taking up the gun well each man makes his own arrangements hussein eased himself into the pilots seat he unfolded the map grant had given him and sara said can i get in the copilots seat why not she did and he said you can help navigate just follow the red line that the american grant has drawn whats this she asked and ran her finger a good hundred miles or more along the line saint anthonys hospice its a christian monastery thats served the trunk road across the desert since before islam there are only twenty or thirty men there now greek orthodox in strange black robes fifty miles further on is the oasis of fuad with whats called saint anthonys well in ancient times they served travelers of all religions he pressed the starter and the engines rattled into life first the port then the starboard fasten your seat belts he called as he boosted speed and they roared down the runway sara was excited and grabbed his arm oh this is so thrilling she stared out at great mountains of sand dunes extending into infinity a bit different from baghdad oh yes very different no war he leveled out at ten thousand feet and put the automatic pilot on although there was air conditioning on such an old plane it was not perfect hussein was wearing dark aviators sunglasses and a tan suit of fine egyptian linen he removed the jacket and revealed a shoulder holster under his left armpit holding a beretta pistol sara looked upon him hussein had been very careful in his dealings with her during the months she had been at the villa as far as he was concerned she knew nothing of his background other than the fact that hed attended harvard to qualify as a doctor and the war had prevented it but she was a remarkably astute young lady soon to be fourteen as she was fond of pointing out to people and could not fail to notice the enormous respect with which he was treated by other people and not just at the villa even important politicians and imams treated him as special the truth was that she loved her father very dearly and he had been the most important man in her life he had strong principles you somehow took it for granted that anything he did was exactly the right thing for you no argument needed hussein was exactly the same by religion she had been baptized and raised as a christian she had no intention of changing that although she had never argued about it with her grandfather being perceptive enough to realize it would get her nowhere and intelligent enough to understand she was embroiled in a complicated problem she liked hussein very much as her cousin but the idea that at an appropriate age it would lead to marriage was something she had no intention of taking seriously her father would find a solution all she had to do was wait the war of course was the war but she was in a strange position it was on the television every time you turned it on and it was also on the streets very real and it wouldnt go away even the death of her grandfather had failed to shock her many members of the household staff had been killed on the streets one way or another during her time in baghdad the young men were already sampling wine behind her when they offered a glass to hussein he refused pointing out that he was flying but he accepted salad sandwiches in leavened bread and sat eating a couple with sara who noticed that when his right trouser leg slid up a little it disclosed an ankle holster containing a colt pistol when she asked what it was for he made light of it stressing that though it was hardly likely that anything would go wrong there were arabs down there whose lives were hardly formal on the other hand he omitted to mention that an ankle holster was the mark of the true professional for the moment she was content and quite thrilled and gradually her head went back and she dozed charles fergusons cousin professor hal stone a fellow of corpus christi college cambridge and hoxley professor of marine archaeology had what was common to most academics in his profession an almost total lack of money with which to conduct any kind of significant research at hazar a diving operation on a world war ii freighter had disclosed beneath it a phoenician trading ship of hannibal s era he could afford only one or two annual visits using local arab divers operating from an ancient boat called the sultan on a previous visit dillon and billy both expert divers had been able to render him some assistance the phone call from ferguson had sent the good professor into a frenzy of delight when he wasnt there he employed his arab foreman a man named selim as caretaker he phoned him with the news that he would be arriving and packed hurriedly he hadnt felt so cheerful in a long time and it wasnt only because of the prospect of diving his dark secret was that as a young man he had worked for the secret security services and was well aware of the kind of thing ferguson and his minions got up to to be involved delighted him transport provided he asked ferguson of course weve got a gulfstream these days the boys will have to get rid of the raf rondels well call ita united nations ocean survey that sounds good absolutely so the reason your people are going there what is it this time come by my flat and ill fill you in stone hung up and checked himself in the wardrobe mirror the man who looked out at him was in his sixties tanned whitebearded wearing a khaki bush jacket khaki shirt and slacks and a crumpled bush hat he produced a pair of dark rayban sunglasses thats better he said not exactly indiana jones but not bad here we go again then he opened the door to his rooms got a bag in each hand and left roper had had a few problems running to earth the details of the charter plane flying from kuwait with hussein and party the american grant found himself visited by a captain jackson of military intelligence at the british embassy who was delighted to do charles ferguson the favor the fact that just on the corner of the hangar was a security camera which on inspection proved to have taken several photos of the entire party brought jackson s visit to a more than satisfactory conclusion in no time at all everyone interested was able to examine them as much as they liked the photos of hussein rashid are a real bonus ferguson said what do you think of the girl roper asked typical of these cases making the girl dress in that way what about you roper poured a whiskey she has a calm sort of face a face that doesnt give a great deal away im not sure it resembles the father to any great degree at that moment caspar rashid hurried in with sergeant doyle whats all this about photos here they are roper told him fresh in from our contact in kuwait caspar examined them carefully shuffling the photos several times finally he said its amazing to actually have photos taken such a short time ago how do you think she looks ferguson asked i dont know i really dont i know i might sound strange saying this but its the clothes shes wearing they change her personality so much or so it seems can my wife see these good heavens yes its a real stroke of luck getting such excellent photos of hussein and his merry men caspar examined a couple of them more closely you know i barely recognize him its been several years and then there were those six months in that american prison i recall him as a very nice boy when young dillon who had come in quietly and was looking at the photos said people change and circumstances change them even more his mother and father killed in a bombing raid that six months in jail it must have seemed cruel and heartless he helped himself to a shot of ropers whiskey god knows i had enough experience in ireland during the troubles to see how people can change fundamentally well you would know sean roper said this hussein though hes no ordinary one judging by his score hes almost as good as you there was a heavy silence for there was not much left for anyone else to say sara engrossed with her map reading and following the red line saw the palm trees and the buildings that were st anthonys hospice before anybody else she pointed and called out and jasmine and the boys stood up and crowded to the windows to see hussein went down lower and lower to no more than two thousand feet he circled there was a parapet several monks on it in black hats and black robes they waved hussein waggled his wings and turned south it was perhaps ten minutes later that their luck ran out quite suddenly smoke black and oily started to come out of the port engine jasmine saw it first and cried out and there was a general disturbance but no sign of flames just that heavy black plume of smoke sara whod dozed off again came awake with a start to hear him say calm down all of you he switched off the engine and turned on the extinguisher for the port engine spray mingled with the smoke but there were still no flames i think i know what it is the oil seals have gone leaking oil over the hot engine and creating all that black smoke everybody fasten their seat belts and well go down he said to sara follow grants line on the map we must be close to the oasis at fuad and saint anthonys well he went down fast the black plume of smoke flaring out from the wing and sara said calmly over there on the right and she pointed through the windscreen good girl they went down lower and lower until they were only a few hundred feet above the sand and the oasis seemed to be coming toward them fast sara saw a clump of palm trees a small flatroofed building to go with it the clearly defined line of the road marked by the feet of countless travelers over the centuries there was a large pool of water six horses drinking from it bedouins in robes beside a cooking fire gazing up hands raised to shade their eyes from the sun of further interest was a man in black robes his wrists tied above him as he hung from a pole beside the house hussein dropped the hawk down on the road and rolled to a halt some distance from the oasis he said to his three men out you go rifles at the ready one of the men by the pool was holding a riding whip he turned as if ignoring them and slashed it across the monks back the monks robe had slipped from his shoulders and they were already bloody sara said they cant do that hes a priest calm yourself hussein reached for his phone which rang as his men disembarked and discovered it was the broker good hussein said i was hoping youd be available he explained the situation with the plane and detailed their position ill contact the airport at hazar and arrange a recovery said the broker probably by helicopter ill call you back when i know more hussein said lets get moving ladies he smiled at sara pass me my jacket will you as she handed it to him she saw the makers label inside and it said armani and she thought it was the most beautiful jacket shed ever seen and suited him completely be ready for anything boys he said some bad bastards here i think remember your blood rashid before anything else as one cousin we are with you khazid said and they started forward hussein with jasmine on one arm and sara on the other the six men by the pool watched them approach cradling their rifles wearing black robes and blackandwhite head scarves the leader tall and bearded waited the whip dangling from his right hand and who have we here he demanded who asks hussein asked and moved to the right where a pole protruded from a wooden fence and sat on it mind your manners pretty boy the man said i am ali ben levi i say who comes and goes here i claim the well and this one cannot gainsay me he turned and slashed the priest across the shoulders again and sara cried out no learn your place girl he is only a christian and i am christian too she said in arabic would you lash me she ran at him and he grabbed her wrist and laughed to do so would give me great pleasure he flung her to the ground and raised the whip and husseins hand fastened on the colt in the ankle holster and he drew it and fired catching ben levi between the eyes the hollowpoint cartridge propelling him backward into the pool and blowing away the back of his skull in virtually the same moment one of the men opposite started to raise his rifle and hassim shot him just with his ak there was dead silence hussein gestured the colt still in his hand on this occasion i allow you to live he told the rest of ben levis men so take your dead and go go now hurriedly they collected their horses tied the bodies of the two dead men over the saddles of two mares and mounted they waited for a moment and hussein spoke i am hussein rashid i am the hammer of god i welcome any man of the ben levi tribe who seeks satisfaction which they did not and left jasmine was trembling but sara was strangely calm ill see to the priest she said and went to him the satellite phone sounded but there was heavy static the broker shouted its me is the static clearing im here theyre sending a helicopter is everything okay a minor problem its been taken care of good well be needing you soon hussein theres work to be done you know that osama himself was inquiring about you when we last spoke he sends you his blessing tell him i thank him goodbye for now by the pool sara and jasmine tended the priest sara washing his back carefully with a cloth from the house are you truly a christian child he asked my mother is english my father rashid i am baptized and yet you wear the clothes of a muslim woman hussein and his men sat smoking and listening and heard her say in the whole of the koran there are only two mothers of prophets the first the mother of mohammed whose name be praised and the second mary the mother of the prophet jesus there is good in all things i think this is true of the bible and the koran so young and yet so wise he counted his beads and started to pray she stood up and went and sat on the ground beside hussein and the others stood up out of respect and moved away i didnt know she said in english about you of course you didnt you werent meant to i thought i knew you now i see i never knew you at all the hammer of god she shook her head repeating it in arabic the servants would speak of you and sometimes you were mentioned in newspapers strange she shook her head again i read the news to improve my arabic and didnt realize i was sometimes reading about you and your doings she changed to arabic the great warrior never your face on television but when you spoke on radio you always described yourself as the hammer of god in english even the young children learned it that way some of the tshirts also were printed with the english phrase why did you allow this personal arroganceto mock my enemies in the english papers the wording would be rather different not great warrior but terrorist i think yes its amazing how much its a matter of the words one chooses how wise he said such wisdom in one so young in the distance a sound emerged the unmistakable stutter of a helicopter so another stage on our journey he pulled her up say goodbye to the good father and well be on our way the port of hazar was small with white buildings and narrow alleys the vivid blue of the sea contrasting with the whiteness of the buildings the harbor was well used with coastal shipping of various kinds fishing vessels oldfashioned dhows and motor cruisers they came in from the sea in a halfcircle and about a mile out from the town sara noticed a big dhow very ancient from the look of it sara said that looks interesting hussein said it is its really being used as a diving platform they call it the sultan some years ago marine archaeologists discovered the wreck of a freighter about ninety feet down that had been sunk by a uboat in the second world war when they dived on it they discovered phoenician pottery from about two hundred bc the freighters been sitting on a much more interesting wreck are they doing anything about it the hazar government they couldnt care less a few years ago a professor from cambridge university got a license to dive it he came back occasionally but he never had any money to speak of as i recall he used local divers and treated it like a holiday it sounds lovely have you ever dived oh yes many times when i was younger its a different world down there they swung in across the town circling the airfield complex to the left and beyond and then they drifted to the right to what looked like a small village above a tiny port and on the hillside above it was an extensive villa obviously old and standing in gardens and terracing of great beauty and this is the pride of the rashid family the great house that has stood here for three hundred years this is kafkar the helicopter swung down toward a landing pad and there were people waiting there many people all in traditional dress and standing alone in front of them was a very old man in a white linen suit a bedouin burnoose on his head from the look of him he had once been a man of great power but he was leaning on a stick now as the engine stopped hussein said your greatuncle jemal you go first he opened the door sent out the steps and she went down there was silence then the old man beckoned to her saracome to me child she started forward and the crowd broke into spontaneous applause later they sat on a wide terrace above the garden palm trees and exotic plants on every side the sound of water was everywhere as it channeled from terrace to terrace in small waterfalls and jemal and hussein sat and smoked news of the shooting at the oasis had spread jemal said the ben levi business is nothing ali was a bandit of low repute therell be no question of an honor killing in revenge dont worry i dont hussein said they needed a lesson these people they received one what of your plans i shall stay a few days leave sara in your hands and go there is work for me to doimportant work i am in close touch with alqaeda osama himself sent me a message only today of course you have been picked for great things the chosen of allah the child will be safe here what happened in baghdad was a terrible thing my brothers death was the will of allah and the work of sunnis but the presence of these devils from london who would steal sarathis troubles me and me my brother was disturbed that she was not happy certainly she attempted to run away at first so they tell me hussein said my brother and i discussed it we made a decision to chain her im surprised to see this is not so now i put her on her honor and she gave me her word the traveling would have been difficult she is not traveling now hussein was on dangerous ground needed to proceed with caution and knew it for a young woman to be shackled so is at best awkward and difficult he played on his uncles sense of what was fitting after all she is rashid for the world to see her shackled would be a great shame there is your authority to consider you are right to see her in public thus would shame us all also a particular shame to you uncle he played now on the old mans vanity that she was seen so this is true there can be no question of the shackles the woman jasmine will accompany her at all times when she is outside two armed guards he looked up at the house the blue room will be her living quarters all the doors and shutters are fitted with keys no telephone that should suffice hussein inclined his head your wisdom as usual is boundless at that moment sara came down the steps with jasmine behind her they were both wearing fresh clothing ah there you are child come to me jemal put out his hand she glanced at hussein who gave her a hardly visible nod so she went and knelt at the old mans knee it is good to see you sara he kissed her lightly on the head it is good to see you uncle she took his hand and kissed it i regret the passing of my aunt last year before i could have the privilege of knowing her a fault not of your making but of your fathers but we will say no more of that sorry affair comewalk with me in the garden and tell me how it is in baghdad he pushed himself up on his stick and gave her his arm and they moved along the path stopping now and then for him to speak to gardeners hussein watched them go she was a clever girl and would soon learn to handle the old man he lit a cigarette and leaned back looking a mile out to sea at the sultan it was all so beautiful and he felt a drowsiness but not for long there was after all work to be done his satellite phone rang it was the broker have you arrived are you settled yes thanks be to allah good now i said hussein we have need of you i knowi know give me some time that is what we do not have there was a pause a week then one week and i need you in london for a purpose hussein shook his head ten days all right there is a man who handles the british prime ministers personal security general charles ferguson i need to do the russians a favor and they want him dead can you do it if the will is there it is possible to kill anyone excellent ill talk to you again tomorrow if you check on the computer there you will find everything you need to know ill be in touch the broker poured a cup of green tea and leaned back in his chair every so often things came together the will of allah actually existed take this present business ferguson and the prime minister blake johnson and president cazalet volkov and putin hussein rashid and the whole nonsense of sara rashid dillon and salter flynn in dublin levin chomsky and popov there wasnt one of them he didnt have a hand on it was all very satisfactory london hazar chapter at holland park they all met for a final briefing the rashids harry and billy salter ferguson and hal stone dillon greta roper boyd and henderson lacey and parry ill turn you over to roper ferguson said hes worked everything out roper swung round his wheelchair if this is going to work the greatest thing in our favor is speed you all know about what happened in hazar the narrow escape with the plane and so on computer records indicate that a learjet for rashid shipping has been booked in exactly seven days i think its a reasonable assumption its for hussein rashid how can you be sure it could have something to do with sara molly said not likely my dear ferguson told her theyve gone to such trouble to get her to a place of safety why would they disturb things now but such thinking works in our favor roper said shes only just got there who in their right mind would imagine her spirited away so soon so why are we wasting our time talking when we should be there caspar rashid demanded he was restless sweating a little roper said our plane leaves at five in the morning the flight takes ten hours and you would rather i didnt come ferguson cut in on the contrary having the girl recognize her own father in the midst of the confusion when we snatch her back has considerable merit to it and your suggestion that you could wear robes a fold of cloth across your face to pass as a desert bedouin speaks for itself roper put in obviously professor stone has to go after all its his gig billy and dillon will pose as divers to explain their presence and give credibility to him the two pilots will pretend to attend to maintenance on the aircraft what about me greta asked continue to act as minder to dr molly if you would greta fine ferguson said to rashid satisfied rashid perhaps understandably still appeared nervous roper said lets examine the situation calmly you arent going to get your daughter back by presenting yourself at your uncles house and asking for her frankly getting our hands on her is likely to be completely opportunistic walking in a garden walking in the street swimming off a beach who knows i suppose so rashid said reluctantly hes right darling molly told him all i can tell you is that when it does happen it will have to be damn quick thats why well have the pilots hanging round the plane for a quick departure thats about it then ferguson told them now our new cook has promised an early dinner so lets get on with it roper said just one thing something i want to show you they all turned i hope were successfuli hope like hellbut the one unproven quantity is the hammer of god himself hussein rashid here he is on a screen appeared a photo of hussein taken from the security camera at kuwait airport in this one hed taken off his black rayban sunglasses for a moment and his bearded face was on show he had in a strange way the look of a young che guevara whats your point ferguson said its this the moment the gulfstream leaves the ground at hazar we release to the press this portrait of hussein rashid hammer of god known associate of osama bin laden rumor has it he could be in britain itll make it very difficult for him to follow us my god you wonderful bastard ferguson said how in the hell could he cope with that he turned to molly rashid and they may just be the end of your problem the dinner bell sounded and he offered her his arm shall we go in in hazar the heat of the day was intense and sara was not happy if things had been difficult at her grandfathers villa in iraq they were infinitely worse at the great house at kafkar to start with her uncle had stipulated that not only jasmine would have a bed in her room but also two older family widows armed guards on the terraces made things no better its intolerable she told hussein i feel as if im being swallowed whole let things settle down he urged her after everything thats happened hes feeling a bit paranoid im not even allowed to eat with you im consigned to the women and most of them are old enough to be my grandmother i cant go for a swim in the pool unless i dress for it the way muslim girls do its like going swimming at brighton in edwardian times but you are a muslim girl and before you waste my time arguing the point i will remind you that your uncle is very oldfashioned tell me about it she was furious and gestured down to the private beach and the sea beyond it looks so normal down there tourists water skiing jet skis speedboats and up here its armed guards a parallel world what nonsense even you leave me for most of the time i have important matters to attend to i can imagine back to the war or something everything a discussion ive seen you constantly on that satellite phone arranging things with your friend the broker he was shocked whats this the pool at fuad i heard him shouting at you on the phone when the static was bad he shrugged hes simply an investment counselora broker just as i said can i at least go shopping in the town or out in the bay in a motorboat well see he stood up or go to town to visit the mosque even your uncle cant say no to that he smiled aware of how much of a child she was when she chose and was suddenly acutely aware of what he had promised her grandfather its all for your own good it really is ill see what i can do and let hassim and hamid guard me at least theyre friends as is khazid they know what wars about not like the people here not like you he was touched she couldnt have pleased him more which was exactly why shed said it ill do what i can be a good girl and he left her to jasmine and the other two women whod been seated some little distance away sara moved to the balustrade at the edge of the terrace and looked down toward the harbor there was a life down there things were busy the old dhow the sultan was picturesque and fit the landscape there was activity on deck they were unloading a large rubber boat with what looked like gas cylinders it was difficult to see at this distance however at that moment hamid appeared with hassim they both wore camouflage trousers green tshirts and sunglasses and carried ak rifles there was no doubt they looked good and were much admired by the female staff hamid said hussein has sent us little cousin he says you are bored he delivered this in english for he was trying to improve it and she knew that he had a pair of zeiss glasses slung around his neck she said excellentyou can start by letting me have your glasses he handed them over she raised them to her eyes focusing on the dhow there was an arab on deck and another a desert bedouin very dashing in black robes and blackandwhite turban a fold across his face leaving only the eyes uncovered although she did not know it her father was helping selim the caretaker of the sultan pull up air canisters as they were passed from the rubber boat by dillon and billy at the same moment hal stone emerged from the wheelhouse what are you looking at hamid asked the big dhow hussein told me all about it its used by a cambridge university professor as a diving platform there is a very ancient boat down therephoenician i believe you know about that sure i do hamid said i learned about the phoenicians in school lets look she gave him the glasses and he raised them yes thats diving equipment theyre taking on board it must be fun id like to try he passed the glasses to hassim if we were allowed to go out in a boat we could take a look she said that would depend on your uncle he accepted a cigarette from hamid and they sat on a bench and smoked the gulfstream had managed an uneventful trip with no need to refuel they had discussed things over and over again caspar rashids recent trip to hazar had been his first since boyhood his face was not a familiar one certainly not to the caretaker of the sultan each of them had photos provided by roper first one of sara in her school uniform with her mother and father taken earlier that year then group photos of dillon billy and hal stone taken with molly and caspar these were all obviously to establish credentials with sara though they provided no solution about how to make contact the first situation they encountered had to do with selim there had been a family death up country in the empty quarter it required his presence and he needed five days for the trip if anything it made things easier though particularly regarding caspar hal stone provided selim with his blessing and a hundred american dollars checked that hed stocked up on everything needed in the galley and ran him across to the jetty in the early evening while there dillon and billy hired jet skis from a hire shop plus a battered station wagon and returned to the dhow where they found hal stone and caspar looking across to the rashid house through glasses there was plenty of tourist traffic around and hal said the jet skis made sense theres a lot of that kind of stuff over there you can blend in thats the idea dillon said get a diving suit on billy and well take a look hello he stiffened there are two guys walking along a terrace over there with slung rifles he paused yes two more and a third above place is a fortress billy said come on take a look okay and remember were just tourists do what everybody else is doing and nothing more at the airfield it was bakingly hot but as a shabby unshaven police lieutenant had told them it wasnt a busy time of year for them the ba flight to london was their main connection to london and that was only three times a week the rest of the traffic was made up of smaller aircraft private jets owned by the rich or local firms the lieutenants name was said and they gave him cigarettes and lacey slipped him five hundred dollars the direct result of such munificence being the empty hangar he had allocated them it was a damned sight cooler than being outside and there were even crew quarters with four truckle beds a shower room and a toilet everything was broken down and shabby but as lacey had said with luck it wouldnt be for long the first task was to refuel which they did and then they returned the gulfstream to the hangar and removed the port engines cowling said appeared and watched them for a couple of minutes are you sure you want to sleep here i could send you to a good hotel my cousin lacey cut him off this engine wasnt its usual happy self so were going to check it out working for the united nations is good parry told him we not only get excellent wages but very good expenses well spend it later in a better place dubai or the south of france lacey smiled you get a better class of girls there i see your point i see from the files that you were here before a couple of years ago lacey said calmly the united nations again well for professor stone really parry said the united nations ocean survey funds him all for the sake of some old boat ninety feet down in the old days there were sponges down there as a boy my father was one of those who dived to the boat he and his friends jumped holding big rocks and the weight took them straight down jesus parry said hadnt they heard of the bends they would snatch a sponge and go straight back to the surface such youths were much admired for their bravery well they would be lacey said drily the café in the terminal keeps going even when business isnt good her cooking is to be recommended she is a cousin of mine on my mothers side lacey said ill see how the engine goes but ill need to testfly it will that be okay of course whenever you want you can see what its like here agraveyard he turned and walked away lacey said i think you can say thats sorted i vote we check out the café parry gazed out over the single runway everything shimmering in the great heat the mountains in the distance lining the empty quarter i know one thing he said as he joined lacey this has to be the last place god made you can say that again i wonder how theyre doing on the sultan ill call them later give them time to settle in they entered the small terminal where there were no passengers to be seen just arabs here and there who were obviously staff the restaurant was open and the smell was appetizing my god that does look good lets give it a try and lacey led the way the wind was blowing in from the land warm and musky with a certain amount of sand in it dillon and billy sat amongst the diving equipment and got ready and billy was so eager he was first he was wearing a green diving suit and clamped a tank to his inflatable and an orca computer to the line of his air pressure gauge he spat in his mask and pulled it on made an okay signal with a finger and thumb and went over the rail backward dillon went after him the complete bliss of it enveloping him the great blue vault of the sea the myriad of fish he checked the dive computer which told him his depth how long hed been down how long he could stay the old freighter was clear below at ninety feet covered in barnacles and marine growth of all kinds fish passing in and out of portholes billy ventured inside through the jagged hole the german torpedoes had left and dillon followed they played a kind of hideandseek in those dark sunken passageways emerging by the stern and hovering over a mixture of sand sea grass and detritus that was what was left of the ancient phoenician trading ship billy had found a figurine there once a temple votive figure of a woman with a swollen belly and big eyes in hazar hed come as close to death as a man could but hed made it through because in his pocket was sam the name hed given the votive figure she was his good luck piece and yet when an old boy at the british museum had gone potty over her billy had handed her over still he knew the glass display case she lived in could see her whenever he wanted he turned away and pointed a gloved hand on a rail dillon beckoned to him and they started up toward the keel of the sultan and the diving platform at the bottom of the boarding ladder as they surfaced a large rubber boat swept past hamid was at the tiller hassim in the bow an ak across his knees sara was seated in the center beside jasmine it had not been intended the excursion round the bay but hussein and old jemal had been summoned to what was called the south port along the coast from where the freight ships for the indian trade operated the terminus for the singletrack steam railway and the oil pipeline they were late for an appointment and when sara asked if they could cruise the harbor the old man halfdeaf was in a fuss and under pressure and relented telling hamid he had full responsibility and not to go far on wednesday morning im taking you to the mosque to meet the imam dont forget study your koran i want him to be impressed with you he told sara of course uncle the truth was the business at south port in which he and hussein were mixed up was very delicate and involved arrangements for various illegal cargoes north to militia sources in iraq in any case the young people set off in their boat its powerful outboard motor pushing them very fast on a crisscrossing route in the harbor and sara became more demanding urging them on shed observed the sultan the people on deck and those entering the water theyre diving she said circle around which hamid did and hassim leaned over cradling the ak and peered down through the incredibly crystal clear water you can see everything sarathe boat the diverslook little cousin he had spoken in english and she replied in the same language gosh its absolutely marvelous on deck standing beside hal stone caspar rashid heard her voice and moaned slightly and one foot moved forward but cloaked in his desert robes the fold of his turban hiding half of his face there was no way she could recognize him hal stone squeezed hard on his arm felt caspar pause and then a sigh went out of him and now sara said exactly the right thing i wonder if youre professor hal stone of cambridge university why yes i am but how did you know that oh ive been told all about you and the old freighter down there on top of the phoenician ship im from the big house over there on the bluff my name is sara rashid its a pretty romantic story at that moment dillon emerged followed by billy and they grabbed the edge of the diving platform hal stone thinking very fast on his feet took his hand out of the pocket of his bush jacket palming two of the small photos provided by roper fancy you knowing all that of course its not quite true i am a professor at cambridge but home is fifteen gulf road in hampstead its awfully nice to meet you he leaned down dropping to one knee and pressed the palmed photos into her right hand as he shook it she frowned and for a moment might have ruined everything but it was only a small moment and hal carried on well be here for a while perhaps you could visit us properly but what am i thinking of ive offered you no hospitality caspar ice water for our guests and caspar rashid responded with a nod turned as if to go and the strangest thing happened her face was wiped clean for the briefest of moments and then she smiled and it was the most wonderful smile hal stone had seen in his life hamid said thank you for your offer of hospitality but we must go now sara i hope to see you again professor are you diving again tomorrow i cant come on wednesday im visiting the imam at the mosque oh yes tomorrow you can see the divers at work the water is so clear and we always hope to find something special caspar said i think we already have the boat turned away sara slipping her hand into her pocket her heart was beating furiously she had to swallow hard she said to hamid the arab who was he a bedouin by his robes obviously the boats caretaker a real country boy from the look of him from the empty quarter are you okay fine just fine but im tired and ive had enough take me back they did and repaired to her suite where she took refuge from her women in the sanctuary of the bathroom there she examined the photos the first was the one of her in school uniform taken earlier in the year with her mother and father the second showed hal stone dillon and billy and her father in bedouin robes only in this one his face was not concealed by the flap of his turban hot tears sprang to her eyes her hands shook a little the photo of stone and company she examined again and again taking so long that jasmine knocked on the bathroom door and called to ask if she was unwell she had never felt better suddenly full of energy the life force flooding through her very carefully she cut the photos into pieces with little nail scissors put them down the toilet and flushed them away the women were waiting are my uncle and hussein back yet no sara jasmine said but supper is ready then so am i sara smiled lets go down to the terrace and enjoy ourselves they did and the servants lit the flares and candles and set the floor cushions and piled food high on the side tables and two musicians sat crosslegged and plucked the strings of their instruments the music plaintive on the evening air and she moved over to the balustrade and looked out across the harbor to the sultan its deck lights were on and she had never been so excited in her life in the sultan seated in canvas chairs at a table in the stern they discussed the situation i must say it was a hell of a thing to do caspar rashid said for a while there i didnt know whether i was coming or going hal stone said remember what roper said about the whole thing being opportunistic well what happened earlier was a perfect example everything just fell into place it occurred to me that those two arab boys couldnt have the slightest idea where she lived in london good point billy said shes a remarkable young woman dillon said to field that ball and the mention of her fathers name took some doing but slipping in her visit to the mosque on wednesday was a nice one hal stone said yes but we cant go in as a team billy pointed out i can go see what the situation is in the mosque itself caspar produced a pack of cigarettes and lit one theres no need to worry about me anymore gentlemen all my doubts are absolved all passion spent its going to work i know that now the only thing is how i know one thing hal stone said her visit to the mosque will do us no good a family affair wouldnt you agree im afraid so its a kind of state visit to the imam and my uncle and hussein are bound to go dillon said roper was right it all comes down to recognizing the opportunity and taking it what do you mean hal stone said billy and i werent available but you two were all you had to do was shoot the two boys billy billy poured dillon a bushmills and handed it to him im afraid hes right gents he turned to casparits why were along to be worse than the bad guys dont kid yourself about those two nice boys with their kalashnikovs theyve accompanied her from baghdad theyve done their share of killing caspar took a deep breath how would it be done we keep a lookout and hope for an approach billy and i can be in the water just in diving jackets silenced walthers are just as good in water and the woman with sara straight down the companionway and lock her in a cabin he looked across to the jetty turn up the speed and were there in fifteen minutes warn lacey were on our way pile into the station wagon and its the airport next stop if by some odd chance hussein turns up well kill him too im going to the stateroom to call lacey and parry and bring them up to date then ferguson then bed see you all in the morning ferguson was himself in bed reading defense

avoid trouble of the violent or disruptive sort they brought in ivan stransky he was sixfootfour built like a brick wall his hair cropped and half of his left ear missing left in chechnya where hed served in a guards regiment he was standing at the end of the bar a black leather coat straining at his shoulders a cigarette between his fingers and saw chekov at once a waitress was passing and

who was sitting in a booth joe baxter and sam hall were propping up the bar behind him its thinning out a bit harry we can go if you like rita can close up she came round the bar in a demure white blouse and a black velvet skirt and shoes to die for bleeding marvelous harry said and turned to his minders isnt she absolutely harry they chorused right lets check how things are going at harrys

wholl stick a shiv in you as soon as look at you ive got mates who are italian mafia and theyre the good guys now sam hall pulled in outside the warehouse salter had transformed into harrys place a red neon sign above the door and a queue outside two young black men in dinner suits had the door the harker twins harry told ruby baxter and hall took the shogun to the car park and harry and ruby walked along the side of the queue they found five youths in black leather pushing and shoving alarming people ahead of them ruby said theyre russians harry i used to serve a lot like that at the old pub they were in fact makeev and four of his friends whod been hired by stransky as ordered here you bleeding well cut it out harry told them they jeered in good cockney english who the hell are you her father he handed ruby up the steps where one of the harker twins apologized profusely sorry boss real sorry and more bad news big ivan stransky and another guy came in just before these guys turned up baxter and hall arrived on the run and ranged themselves beside the harkers making a formidable barrier harry said dont let them in well see what stransky wants he held out his hand baxter slipped a colt into it and harry took rubys arm as fernando the headwaiter appeared full of apologies not needed harry said this is mrs moon take us to my table he added to baxter and hall you come with us the place was rather pretty in an art deco style with a cocktail bar small intimate tables a dance floor a trio playing music of the cole porter variety harrys table was in a booth with mirrors behind it and baxter and hall stood one on each side a waiter in a white waistcoat with brass buttons who had responded to harrys nod brought a large brandy and ginger ale for him and a champagne cocktail for ruby i thought you should have a champagne cocktail on your first visit its lovely she said whats that brandy and ginger ale they call it a horses neck i wonder why doesnt really matter rubyits a british thing were funny that way heres to you you look lovely he took his drink straight down and nodded to the waiter then folded his arms as stransky bikov behind him came down the steps from the bar and crossed the dance floor toward them nice little place youve got harry stransky said mr salter to you now what can i do for you and the fairy prince here bikovs hand went in his pocket his face tightened but sam hall stepped close and slipped his hand in the same pocket gawd bless me but someones got a big one he produced a smith amp wesson bankers special and put it on the table in front of harry a little oldfashioned harry said bloody rude bringing it in at all ladies present and so on stransky looked around ladies i dont see any ladies he smiled at ruby of course i dont count the whore here shes got more class than you any day you fat pig stransky stopped smiling youll be sorry you said that salter and when youre gonehe laughed out loud reached over and patted rubys facewell see outside harry told him what an excellent idea come on bikov and they went what do you think boss baxter said theyll be up to no good outside with that bunch he brought along he sighed im really getting too old for this lets go out and see what theyre up to you stay ruby love not bloody likely all right then stay by the door just be a good girl i told billy id look after you what a liar you are harry salter she took his arm and the whole group left there was a story about you going the rounds year before last when the franconi twins were running wild over half of london the word was they got an ira expert to put a bomb in your jaguar god was on my side he told her cheerfully the guy got the timer wrong and it blew up before billy and i got there and is it true the franconis are in cement on the north circular road ruby love do i look like id do a thing like that outside the queue had gone and it was quiet only the sound of the trio playing night and day drifting out whats happening harry asked the harkers the russian punks cleared off as far as i know and stransky and his driver went off to get his car but harry didnt believe it and with hall and baxter walked to the car park suddenly the russians appeared three of them with baseball bats swinging sideways into the cars smashing windows denting fenders harry didnt hesitate took the colt from his pocket and ducked under makeevs flailing baseball bat stuck the weapon against the russians right kneecap and pulled the trigger the others shocked wavered and baxter picked up the baseball bat makeev had dropped he swung it sideways fracturing the side of a mans face and then the other way fracturing an arm the harker twins arrived on the run ruby behind them and harry fired in the air the russians froze makeev was writhing on the ground moaning terribly harry reached out and pulled the nearest russian over you came in a carwhich is it the man pointed to a white van get him in it in fact all of you get in it and deliver him to saint marys of course youll stay shtum because i wasnt here was i i was elsewhere lots of people saw me who was the contract for he inquired of the driver better tell me sunshine i wont hold it against you stransky said it was for max chekov really harry said the oligarch interesting thanks very much the van drove away and stransky sitting in his car nearby whispered to bikov we better go ill have to switch on the engine bikov said harrys boys moved in their direction instantly and harry himself tapped on the window on the passengers side get the door open unless you want broken glass all over you stransky complied now look harry i thought you knew only my friends call me harry what have i done to chekov to make him annoyed he was doing a favor for a friend thats all i know some broker guy told me to mess you up he didnt bother telling harry that wasnt all chekov intended to do bizarre harry said but i like it london s everybodys favorite destination these days capital of the world even for the gangsters i feel it might be necessary for me to keep up the reputation of the british gangster he reached inside the car prodded stranskys left kneecap and pulled the trigger he couldnt tell what stransky said because it was in russian but the man howled like a werewolf go on get out of here harry said and bikov put his foot down and drove away baxter and hall applauded as he offered his arm to ruby god youre a hard man ruby said i never realized well lets go back inside champagne for everyone the following morning as chekov was getting out of the shower in his sumptuous apartment off park lane the front doorbell sounded chekov cursed because the maid didnt come in until nine oclock he went to the window toweling himself the flat was a duplex and when he looked out a motorcycle was parked at the curb and a man stood on the step wearing black leather and helmet and a yellow waistcoat with express delivery emblazoned on it he held a cardboard box and waited chekov pulled on a robe went downstairs and opened the door the face was anonymous behind the black plastic mr max chekov thats me what have we got here he took the box in both hands flowers the man said lilies he pulled at the end of the box produced a sawnoff doublebarreled shotgun rammed it against chekovs left knee and pulled the trigger chekov was hurled backward the man said have a nice day went down the steps to the motorcycle and drove away chapter it was quiet at the airport at six in the morning as lacey and parry kept up a semblance of working on the gulfstream the cowling of the port engine still off a hawk of some kind swept in dived on some creature or other in the brush on the other side of the runway and said appeared in a land rover have you fixed it just about lacey nodded started early while its still cool i know what you mean im going downtown early for the same reason things dont look too busy as usual its like the morgue theres an old dakota on a transport run from kuwait in around eleven oclock and todays a british airways flight due at three in the afternoon that should be lively not really ive seen the numbers seventythree people hardly worth bothering with ill see you later ill need to be back for the dakota i might be ready for that test flight later no problem theres no traffic so just go he drove away and parry said thats nice of him dont count your chickens now lets go across and see if shes open for breakfast yet about seven caspar and billy ran the inflatable to the jetty where the station wagon was parked billy got behind the wheel and drove it a short distance to the garage and made certain the tank was full when he returned caspar passed him three flight bags billy was just wearing his green diving jacket his eyes anonymous behind dark glasses caspar maintained his full disguise the fold across his face the harbor was barely stirring its going to be hot later billy said you could be right they got into the boat and billy turned on the engine and moved away from the jetty how are you feeling how should i feel damn it caspar you are her father true but in such a situation as i find myself i realize im still a muslim and as we say inshallahas god wills maybe billy pushed up to top speed and went out in a long sweeping curve toward the sultan and maybe not hal stone was sitting in a wicker chair a cup of coffee on the table beside him a pair of enormous glasses to his eyes gazing toward the great house on the cliff a number of gardeners working away activity already on the water several fishing boats mainly on that side things like motorboats skiers the beach over there attracts them billy took the glasses from him and looked i see what you mean he handed them back wheres dillon in the galley seeing to bacon and eggs thats even better billy said and went down the companionway dillon was whisking scrambled eggs like billy he just wore a diving jacket ive left the weapons in the saloon on the table youd better take a look what about the woman billy asked shell be frightened out of her wits if things go our way ive put some stuff out that should take care of it billy went into the saloon there were two walther ppks on the table carswell silencers screwed in place he handled them both expertly and two uzi machine pistols that lay beside them there were some plastic clipon handcuffs a roll of plastic tape dillon looked in breakfasts ready billy turned went to the kitchen behind him picked up a laden tray and dillon brought another it was all calm and orderly the sounds of traffic drifting across the water they found the others at the table what happens now billy said as he ate we finish eating then we seem busy just in case anyone is looking mess around with the diving equipment stuff like that hal stone said the uzis on the table in the saloon i shouldnt think caspar and i would need them nice weaponalways liked them dillon said if you drop one it stops automatically i remember very well the professor said its just that its been a long time what about you caspar my experience with any kind of firearms has been severely limited rashid saidso if things go according to plan the woman with sara will be handcuffed dragged below and locked in a cabin better than a bullet which is what shed get from some people theyll find her whenever they come looking for sara and the others a lot of places to look hal stone said i think youll find the women at the house have already heard about yesterdays visit dillon shrugged hussein rashid is a special kind of man every sense in him sharpened like some jungle animal hell work out whats happened here quickly thats why weve got to move very fast indeed there was silence billy went to the side table got a bottle of bushmills whiskey poured half a glass and brought it to dillon oh if only i didnt hate alcohol but to us heres looking at you dillon toasted them and emptied the glass then got up lets look busy billy im with you caspar loaded the tray ill get rid of this hal stone said better bring the weapons back with you and as dillon went over the side he picked up the glasses and focused them on the house on the bluff they didnt know it but nobody at the house except sara even wanted to go to south port that morning sitting at a table on the terrace and reading an arab newspaper hussein was enjoying a coffee after breakfast his uncle had just been called away sara with jasmine stood on the upper terrace looking down on him hamid and hassim behind them smoking and talking sara turned to them do you know if hes going to south port this morning well he doesnt look like it hamid replied he hasnt said a word she tried to stay calm what a shame id hoped to go and see them diving again i dont think so at that moment relief came from an unexpected quarter jemal appeared on the upper terrace a few yards away from them leaned over and shouted to hussein we must leave at once ive had a message from south port the loading of the kandara has been disrupted hussein rose and started up the steps what happened he called the train was coming down from bacu with the last load two hours ago when one of the freight cars was derailed on that bend by stack four how bad is it it could mean the kandaras departure being delayed for some days that would be unfortunate our friends in iraq need those weapons for the big push in basra next month we must go at once see if anything can be done of course hussein turned to sara and the young men you heard that bad trouble we must get moving behave yourself sara can we go out in the boat all rightthe harbor only hamid he took his uncles arm and helped him up to the entrance to the living room and they vanished inside sothe boat it is hamid looked through the zeiss glasses at the sultan yes theyre on the deck the bedouin and the old professor and the two divers are getting ready to go down from the looks of it well go and take a look now that the moment had come sara was intensely nervous her heart beating if anything she felt a little sick but she tried to pull herself together come on jasmine lets get going she picked up a parasol one of the women had left on a bench and led the way down to the inflatable tied up at the small jetty on the beach below hamid handed her in then jasmine hassim sat in the prow his ak across his knees and hamid untied the line and stepped in and sat in the stern sara opened the parasol jasmine smiled and hamid pressed the starter on the huge outboard motor on the sultan hal stone said theyre coming saras the one with the parasol her companion is the same one as yesterday the boys are the same how do we handle it dillon and billy had discussed it already and they came up from the diving platform dillon pulled the zip of his diving jacket down and slipped one of the walthers inside billy did the same caspar you stand on the diving platform to take their line billy and i will jump into the sea on the other side when theyre closer swim round underwater and deal with the boys hal you just be ready for anything caspar said desperately god forgive me but its as good as murder you want your daughter back dont you dillon said harshly so pull yourself together come on billy he dodged round the mast to the other side of the deckhouse the sound of the inflatables engine was somehow very loud and then it died saras voice sounded good morning professor here we are again dillon and billy dropped over the side went four or five feet under the water and swam past the prow and toward the diving platform on its line the inflatable beside it dillon gestured to the stern and went up and billy made for the prow hassim was leaning overits so clear i can see the ship and billys hand clutching the silenced walther emerged the first round caught the boy in the throat the second between the eyes hurling him back against jasmine who pushed at him with a shrill cry sending him over into the water hamid was quick but not quick enough for his ak was propped against the seat beside him realizing how hopeless it was he flung himself over the stern as dillon appeared tearing at dillon as he did so leaving dillon with no option but to pull the trigger several times jasmine cried out again and hal stone leaned down at the side of caspar and pulled her up oh my god there was absolute horror in saras voice caspar pulled the fold away revealing his face saraits me dillon and billy hauled themselves out of the water hamid floated up rolled over but there was no sign of hassim daddy it is you weve come for you my darling he got down beside her in the inflatable in a short while well be flying back to london in our own plane your mothers waiting for you there was a vacant look on her face as hal stone appeared and piled into the boat jasmine she asked where is she quite safe in a cabin below love billy said dillon nodded when hussein comes searching for you theyll find jasmine he pressed the starter the engine coughed into life and they raced toward the jetty but not hamid or hassim she said dully was that necessary im afraid it was my dear hal stone took out a bottle poured a couple of pills into his palm and offered them these will help to calm you sara she turned to her father daddy take them darling so she did and he put an arm around her and she nestled against him and a few moments later they swerved into the jetty and disembarked as they drove off in the station wagon billy at the wheel dillon called lacey on our way fifteen minutes no more couldnt be better said isnt back yet and i got his permission to do a test flight drive straight in the hangar parry will stand outside to show you which one well load inside shall i notify ferguson no im superstitious ill do that when were clear and on our way it was so strange that the end of something that had been so difficult and painful seemed so simple minutes later they were loading the flight bags and boarding the gulfstream parry closed the hatch and went and sat beside lacey a quick word with an englishspeaking arab in the control tower who knew all about the test flight and they were taking off lacey climbed steadily to fifty thousand feet then turned to parry done it again old boy you take over and ill go back and see how things are so high in the incredible blue of that sky parry felt extremely cheerful and smiled as he veered to port to pass over distant egypt and into the mediterranean beyond caspar rashid had taken off his robe and wrapped his daughter in it she was very sleepy now the pills taking their effect at one moment nestling in his arms she said what about hussein when he knows im gone hell be terribly angry hamid and hassim were his men its a matter of honor he can do nothing caspar said not now some people would say he can do anything he is the hammer of god and he has killed twentyseven soldiers he has his friend the broker to help him and then she was asleep they looked at each other you have to admit the mans got an impressive track record hal stone said especially for somebody who was training to be a doctor before the war dillon said hal stone frowned i wonder who the broker is a mystery man associated with osama bin laden caspar said when i was first approached he was the man a voice on a satellite phone the kind youd expect to hear at high table at any ancient oxford college ill let ferguson know the good news dillon went and closeted himself at the other end of the cabin with his codex four to say that ferguson was over the moon was an understatement he demanded chapter and verse come on everything dillon the childs mother is going to be ecstatic never mind roper and greta so dillon told him leaving nothing out it was a rough ride for sara especially being party to the shooting of the boys but there was no other way i agree a hell of a shock for hussein rashid you can say that again dont forget you were going to see his face plastered in every paper in the uk and every police station by the time blake johnsons finished with him the states will be offlimits too i wouldnt think his chances in iraq would be very good the girl hasnt said anything special about him has she she was on pills a bit woozy she obviously thinks hussein is hot stuff and she mentioned his friend the broker then fell asleep the broker again which means osama roper will love the connection so ten or eleven hours ill see you at farley anything happened while weve been away nothing much apart from the russian mafia trying to do a number on harry last night good god what happened ferguson told him theres life in the old dog yet naturally he passed the whole thing to roper for his intelligence pool and believe it or not the broker came up again and so did our old friend chekov maybe something should be done about that taken care of harry sent an express delivery man round on his motorcycle with lilies oh dear oh dear indeed ill leave you now and spread the good word which he did he told greta first because as usual molly was in surgery id like you to pick her up and bring her back here its going to be about midnight when they get in shell want to see her daughter leave it to me ferguson went into the computer room and found roper i think we deserve a drink together i agree with you roper poured very large scotches to the team great stuff once again and harry didnt do too badly last night hes given a sad blow not only to the russian mafia in london but to the broker that bastard is mixed up in everything trouble is we all know that but we dont know who he is nobody seems to well id say its about time we found out by the way i think youll approve of this watch the screen said roper the picture that appeared was of hussein rashid a good photo of him holding a pair of sunglasses the one next to it showed him wearing the glasses underneath it said hussein rashid known to be an associate of osama bin laden there was more text beside it the kind of stuff for subeditors to sink their teeth into especially regarding rashids penchant for shooting soldiers no mention of recent events what are you doing with it it appears in most of the press in the morning plus police stations a certain amount of tv well lets hope the publicity kills off any hope of hussein rashids turning up in england he can go back to the struggle in iraq as far as im concerned and get his head blown off good work roper im going to my office it was quiet the faint pings from cyberspace the sizzle of static roper poured a scotch and then he lit a cigarette and sat there looking at the man on the screen you bastard he said youre probably already on the way well ill be waiting he raised his glass and drank the whiskey in a single swallow at the great house in kafkar it had taken some time for anyone to realize that something was wrong khazid first became worried when the boating party failed to turn up for lunch at noon when he had checked the sultan through his glasses there was no sign of anybody or of any kind of activity he immediately called hamid on his mobile phone it didnt ring slightly worried now he shouldered his ak went down to the jetty took one of the jet skis and drove off across the harbor toward the sultan there was a fishing boat a few yards away from it two fishermen leaning over the side of the boat pulling at something in the water when he got closer he saw that it was a body closer still switching off the jet ski motor as he coasted in it turned over in the current and he saw to his horror that it was hamid he called the police not that they had a reputation for efficiency it took twenty minutes for the launch to appear because on the way from the jetty it came across the body of hassim and stopped to pull it up out of the water as well the two police officers were simple men so khazid very young but his skills honed in the killing grounds of baghdad took charge ordering them to follow him he approached the sultan on the jet ski by the time the police joined him he had searched the deserted ship rescued jasmine from the cabin and discovered from her the full horror not only that sara had been abducted but that the bedouin in his robes on the boat had been her father it was at that point he phoned hussein rashid on his mobile hussein was some little way out of south port beside the track supervising the recovery of the derailed wagon stunned by the enormity of what he was hearing he found difficulty in taking it in but the facts were clear two dead bodies and no sara he pulled himself together clear the line i want to make a call well return as soon as possible he phoned the airport and asked for control it was said who took the call hussein rashid have you had a departure up there yes im still trying to work it out ive been in town all morning a gulfstream belonging to the united nations ocean survey has been here a couple of days they had some engine trouble asked me if they could do a flight test but as i was going to town i left them to it they havent come back im getting worried where in the hell could they be probably well over the horn of africa by now hussein said and went in search of his uncle the old man was so shocked he required the attention of his physician who was waiting for them when they got to the house it required servants to help carry the old man upstairs to his bedroom and dr aziz accompanied him he waved the servants away and checked the heart hussein waited for the bad news aziz turned his face grave it is not good hes in a poor state of health anyway much worse than you perhaps realized he opened his bag took out a hypodermic and charged it hold his arm hussein did so and aziz made the injection the old man groaned his vacant eyes traveled the room and settled on hussein there was a light there for a while why did you trust her because she gave me her word hussein said bleakly they could not have done this thing those who did it unless she was willing her father right under our noses and the man who accompanied him the men from baghdad this dillon and salter it must be but her father the apostate the cursed one who turns his back on allah may every devil in hell wait for you caspar rashid he shook his head that he bears the name of our family shames me beyond belief he began to weep aziz had retreated to the door to speak on the phone now he beckoned to hussein ive sent for an ambulance you think its that bad let me put it this way its a good thing rashid shipping invested in the development of the hospital the past few years weve got the equipment to at least give him a fighting chance he put an arm around husseins shoulders its also good that your doctor is indian and so are his nurses there will be no muslim stupidities to make things difficult i think weve seen enough muslim stupidities for one day hussein said two friends to bury lads i soldiered with he shook his head why did she betray me so thats how you see it she was in shacklesi freed her when a dog named ali ben levi laid a hand on her i killed him but more than that i swore a hand on the koran that i would prove a true husband to her in thought and deed when she came of age more than this no more than a couple of hours before his death her grandfather put her welfare in my hands when he placed her in my care for the journey to hazar on my honor i swore to him to protect her always can you be certain my friend it is not just your pride which has been hurt pride hussein shrugged what has this miserable affair to do with such a shallow emotion an approaching siren outside heralded the ambulance aziz went out to meet four porters in green hospital overalls carrying a stretcher followed by two nurses in saris within a few moments the old man was maneuvered onto a stretcher drips were inserted bottles held high as he was lifted ill come with you hussein said id rather you left it till later the little column descended the stairs accompanied by weeping women of the household the servants visibly upset below hussein went down moved amongst them pray for him pray hard now attend to your work khazid stood by the open window his ak hanging from his left shoulder he looked somber and they went outside on the terrace hussein took out a pack of american cigarettes gave him one and a light khazid said the look on hamids face i think it was surprise well it would be come on little brother youve seen enough of death to recognize it any way it comes no shock there not anymore well then youve been in touch with said at the terminal since i last called him what did he have to say the gulfstream as you know was un it turned up the other day two pilots this professor hal stone the archaeologist who has worked on this wreck in the harbor and three men with him one was your cousin caspar rashid two were logged in as divers interestingly the pilots had been here beforethe other year and hal stone it would appear so he came several times they talked about it the pilots and the aircrafts insignia was definitely un which i dont believe for a moment ill tell you what i think dillon and salter went to baghdad and we know what happened there they then went back to london probably having found out we were on our way to hazar so youve been involved in enough of my exploits in the past to know that the one essential ingredient is surprise what greater surprise for them than attempting to snatch sara from us virtually the moment we arrived who in the hell would have expected it yesbut there are still mysteries here there must have been some sort of communication between them and sara possibly but well never know without being told be a good soldier now go to the hospital and stand vigil for me and you you think it ends here this business hussein shook his head not if i can help it off you go and leave me to speak to the one man in the world who can truly help me the broker found little to comfort him at the news volkov had already called him with word about max chekovs unfortunate fate some of the best doctors in london struggling to save his leg what the hell is going on volkov wanted to know this could have a huge effect on our future plans you hardly need to make the point the broker said but it confirms what i suspected salter and his associates are totally ruthless men together with dillon and billy salter they pose a real threat then i suggest you do something about it volkov said its hardly the kind of news that will please president putin and he ended the conversation the broker sat there brooding an important kill was what was needed obviously to see harry salter stonecold dead in the market would be good but ferguson that really would be something but for that he needed hussein more than ever even putin would be impressed with ferguson out of the way he reached for his phone and called hussein only to receive the shocking news about sara as hussein spoke he sat there trying to take it all in part of him unwilling to believe what had happened when the account was finished the broker said what do you want to do you wanted me to come to england anyway and deal with ferguson this would suit me very much and not just for personal revenge i refuse to leave sara wherever she is i made a promise a sacred oath to her grandfather i intend to carry it out and so you shall i will arrange things general support in the uk will be from the army of god network of spies and informers i had meant to send professor dreq khan to hazar ill call him back at once to london and put him to work he will be useful to you how do i come plane to paris then the channel tunnel you brought your special flight bag from baghdad the black one of course use the british passport hugh darcy i like that one get yourself a blazer youll look like an english gentleman whos been on holiday the passport will support that ill arrange what happens to you when you reach london with khan when will you come tomorrow if i can but it depends on my uncles health at the moment this business has hit him hard i look forward to hearing from you they disconnected and the broker called professor khan in brussels catching him at his hotel on his way out to dinner he quickly filled him in on the situation in hazar my god khan said i cant believe that caspar has managed to regain his daughter helped by thoroughly ruthless men which you would do well to remember there is no point in your going to hazar now you are ordered back to london but ferguson would move heaven and earth to get his hands on me ferguson s got nothing to hold you on you know that he cant touch you youll book out of your hotel in the morning and catch the first flight to london is that clear osama himself has an interest in this affair which was enough of course ill do as you say and await further instructions in the gulfstream everything had gone smoothly after sleeping for five or six hours sara had awakened had something to eat and talked a great deal with her father and hal stone and later responded to some gentle probing from dillon and even billy she seemed very calm partly it was her nature but dillon considered it likely that to a certain extent it was also a kind of denial of what had gone before when you thought about it the original circumstances had been extraordinary the kidnap itself the transfer to the war zone the constant daily violence of baghdad itself every impossible bad thing had been visited on her the apparent genuine affection of her grandfather and yet leg irons and then the final act in hazar the killing of ali ben levi when he laid hands on her the sudden realization that hussein was the hammer of god this arab fantasy figure from newspapers and television the events that had developed with the sultan and the shocking deaths of hamid and hassim so close that there were bloodstains on her clothing for an adult to cope with what had happened to her in the few months since the kidnapping would have been a near impossibility for a young girl little more than a child to most people what hope she dropped off to sleep again and dillon turning in his seat to pour a bushmills found hal stone observing him what do you think the professor asked how in the hell is she ever going to get over whats happened her father was also dozing an arm around her and dillon looked at them again theres the mother a pretty remarkable lady but i dont know he shook his head shes got a lot to cut free from hussein rashid for one thing oh him most of all dillon said hal stone nodded at least theres a few thousand miles between them and little likelihood of her ever having to see him again lets hope so dillon said and laceys voice over the intercom announced farley field in fifteen minutes its midnight right now so that means were moving into a new day and if youre listening sara god bless and welcome home she sat up next to her father slightly dazed as the plane coasted down what happened next was all a strange confusion in which everything happened in slow motion the gulfstream landing parry opening the door people outside rain falling quite fast then going down the steps ahead of her father and her mother crying out her name and throwing her arms about her fiercely they were all taken to the holland park safe house sitting across from charles ferguson her arms around sara molly rashid said what now you try to put some sanity into your lives again at least youve nothing to fear from this man anymore weve seen to that heres the early edition of the times there was the photo of hussein without his sunglasses on the extreme bottom of the front page in the lefthand corner the few lines of text said known associate of osama bin laden sara said but thats hussein there was panic on her face ferguson said youve nothing to worry about with this photo in all the papers hed never dare come to england hussein rashid hammer of god saras voice was suddenly very small and she buried her face against her mother the electronic gate swung open at holland park and they turned in and several thousand miles away in the hospital at hazar hussein and khazid stood smoking on a balcony the glass door open behind them to a corridor two nurses sat at a small table opposite sipping tea ready for backup if necessary a door opened aziz came out and there was a glimpse behind him of jemal festooned with cables and tubes two more nurses at his bedside how is he hussein asked we are in gods hands aziz told him thats all i can say at that moment an alarm sounded jarring ugly frightening aziz ran back into the room followed by the two nurses in the corridor the entire crash team was at work in seconds hussein and khazid watching at the door not that any of it did the slightest good time of death immaterial hussein stood looking down at his uncle then leaned over and kissed him on the forehead see my friend he said to dr aziz they killed hamid and hassim to get sara now they kill my uncle we cant have that can we khazid he covered his uncles face with the nearest sheet turned and went out chapter it was in husseins favor that his religion demanded so brief a period for the disposal of the body no matter how important the individual he needed action now needed to get on with it needed to channel the rage inside him the body was brought to the house and displayed in the entrance hall the people who arranged such things worked through the night the imam himself came to supervise giving hussein his blessing of course and not just because of his prowess in the war he was after all not only the head of rashid shipping now but of the clan itself the possessor of great wealth and his importance was shown by a new deference to him so what will you do now about sara the imam asked as allah wills you do not think her beyond hope of course not there were cruel influences at work what do you intend a return to the war zone well see hussein was keeping his own counsel lets bury my uncle first the imam departed and hussein went out onto the terrace and lit a cigarette khazid who had been listening followed him you wish to follow them to england dont you hussein smiled now why would i do that because it would be the most reckless thing to do can i come with you why would you want to do such a thing because were friends who have been through hell together because i appreciate it could be a oneonone mission but that you also need one person you can really rely on and you think that should be you it has been before how do you plan to go paris train to london i have both french and british passports both excellent forgeries and i speak french your alias hugh darcy what the english call a toff i used the passport last time i was in london and found the regimental tie of an english guards officer tucked in my briefing case it was the brokers joke the english still cant help touching their forelocks to a gentleman the queens son himself has served in such a regiment in afghanistan khazid said there you are then okay my friend you can come as far as paris im not promising anything more now go and lie down itll be dawn soon and we have three men to bury something were good at something weve grown very used to go on little brother good night khazid went and hussein stood there thinking about it then he went into the entrance hall where they had finished presenting his uncle hed given the orders no wailing women at this stage male servants only family members could join in on the morning but for the moment no he was restless uncertain and then he did a strange thing he went into his uncles small study where there was a liquor cabinet for nonmuslim guests he opened the lacquered doors and surveyed the contents finally selecting a bottle of icecold dom pérignon champagne he found in the bar fridge there was a strange excitement in him as he got a glass and walked out onto the terrace he stood there thumbing the cork out of course it was wrong he knew that but the night was dark and he had two comrades and his uncle to bury allah was merciful allah would understand he raised his glass to hassim and hamid then emptied the glass of champagne and threw the bottle from the terrace go to a good death my friends and watch over me in england he called roper saw the local radio and television reports of the death of jemal rashid from a heart attack there was television coverage of the cortege on its route to the mosque hussein leading the way roper recorded it and reported in to ferguson who was having breakfast at cavendish place he wont like it ferguson said hell blame us the old boy died as a direct result of the affair exactly what time did doyle deliver the rashids to hampstead about three oclock well have to inform them i know dammitill do it at the house in gulf road caspar rashid hadnt followed his wife to bed shed taken sara he couldnt sleep and when the daily telegraph was shoved through the front door he found hussein in a corner of the front page just like in the times and then the phone rang and it was ferguson not very good news he told caspar of the old mans death caspar rashid sat there taking it in dear god he said is there no end waiting at the airport in paris dreq khan bought a copy of the times and nearly had a heart attack he examined the papers on the newsstand and found husseins face staring out at him everywhere shortly afterwards the broker phoned him khan said have you seen the london papers yes this must change everything obviously hussein rashid cant go to london in fact i wonder where he can go it changes nothing you will still go to london and you will wait to hear from me you still believe in the power of osama of course now get on your flight he switched his phone off and hesitated no hussein would be busy with the funeral hed leave it till later a strange thing happened at the cemetery in hazar it rained suddenly a real tropical downpour that prevented the wild exuberance that usually marked funerals hassim and hamid had been wrapped in the green flag of islam as was proper for soldiers the old man in something more subdued and the rain fell and washed the dead and hussein and khazid took their turns with a spade and shoveled dirt and said goodbye in their own way then it was back to the house for hussein to receive condolences finally about three oclock in the afternoon there was some peace sitting on the terrace having a coffee with khazid husseins phone went and it was the broker i knew youd be busy with the funeral so i didnt try to get you earlier what is it trouble obviously ferguson s used his power in certain quarters your face appears in a number of british newspapers reported to be a known associate of osama bin laden and possibly in britain a clever bastard ferguson this is to make it impossible for me to go but it wont stop me if we try to put new plans into motion it will be difficult and very awkward not to say expensive dont talk to me of expense i know that osama has great funds i am a rich man myself from the death of my uncle im going to england with you or without you and im taking khazid with me all right all right ill get to work on it i cant wait you must understand that i do well get you to algeria there are many ways to move you around from there hold tight ill be back to you at holland park roper sat at his computers and showed the tv footage of the funeral cortege in hazar to greta what did ferguson say she wanted to know poor sod is that all absolutely hes gone to the ministry of defence for the rest of the day pass me the scotch youre worse than a russian with his vodka we drink for different reasons what do you think about hussein surely hes all washed up never mind coming to britain if he puts foot on a baghdad street hes a dead man you think so he lit a cigarette im wonderingafter the hannah bernstein affair last year when igor levin dumped his russian masters and legged it to good old dublin with his two sergeants he phoned me and gave me his number a sort of challenge in a way we couldnt track him legally in dublin ive spoken to him on the odd occasion late at night feeling cheesed off you never said i didnt think ferguson would like it the point is ive told him about our current experience with our russian friends and hes obliged me on occasion with his personal opinion he knows quite a bit about whats been going on with the broker and all that does he know who the broker is ive told younobody does does he know about chekov not from mebut i feel like telling him well dont stop because of me and she went and got herself a vodka levin was sitting in the corner of kellys bar waiting for chomsky when his mobile went and roper said its me homing in like spock from cyberspace tell me what happened in baghdad did it get anywhere let me give you a quick recap when he was finished he added what do you think i think youve got trouble my friend hell be on somebodys doorstep before you know it its good to know dillon and billy can still cut the mustard more to the point so can harry gretas standing right next to me let her tell you hey lovely he said so youre speaking to me i didnt know i could you rogue do you still love me naturally so whats this about harry she told him and was thoroughly amused chekov on sticks so much for the moscow mafia in london chomsky has just joined me he sends his best roper had put the call on the speaker dillon and billy arent here theyve gone to see harry at the dark man hes put ruby moon behind the bar remember her how could i forget now ive got something interesting to tell you enough for now but i just want to mention something remember friend popov he now works for michael flynn at a firm called scamrock security yes used to be chief of staff of the provisional ira years ago a bit of a bruiser whats your point this broker the mystery man who fronts for osama is apparently also heavily involved with michael flynn who it would seem is in the mercenary business i could have told you about the mercenary bit but not the broker who is involved with volkov i dont know whats going to happen at drumore with belov international but they will need a decent bunch to keep our soldiers out the decent bunch being exprovos i think youll find flynn is after the work interesting and i happen to know that volkov got popov the job at scamrock and as weve said volkov means the broker and the broker means osama did popov tell you he got the job from volkov chomskys voice was heard over the speaker no he didnt the bastard ive got my ear to igors phone roper ill deal with popov it was greta who cut in no dont be stupid chomsky you wait see just what his involvement is before making a move sorry major chomsky said youre right of course she is levin said take care my friends and call again roper switched off well that was interesting you must admit yes very much so charles ferguson said from the doorway the things the help gets up to when ones away oh dear roper said well it could be charles ferguson smiled but i always wanted to get my hands on levin as you well know hes too good to be sitting around on his backside well there you are then as for me i need a break if sergeant doyle is available he can run me to the dark man and ill go with you greta said all right you talked me into it doyle phoned ahead and when they got to the pub there was a booth waiting for them they crowded round two tables ruby supervising things baxter and hall as usual propping up the wall my goodness you did well in the car park affray ferguson said for you harry its a return to your old form it never went away billy said it was just like the old days yes i was a very naughty boy in my youth harry said lets have a drink my love champagne all round he made as if he would slap rubys bottom but managed to stop himself in time she smiled thats a good boy harry and went off for the champagne roper lit a cigarette and greta said what will you do when they ban the cigarettes roper shrugged ill figure out something by the way general item of news from heathrow which may interest you professor dreq khan is back flew in from brussels today that is interesting that bastard is untouchable dillon said and he knows it roper put in makes you wonder why hes come back greta said if that means could there be a purpose to his return im sure there is roper said and ruby arrived with the champagne on a trolley at ali hassims corner shop near gulf road professor khan drew up in an audi and went inside ali himself was behind the counter with a young girl in a smock a niqab covering her entire face except for the eyes professor he said in arabic what a surprise he nodded to the girl come on he told khan and led the way into the small back room they sat opposite each other at the table i thought you were to go to hazar ali said yes but the news from hazar is bad ive heard wild rumors can it be so absolutely so the rashid girl is once again at the house in gulf road the father assisted by devils from hell abducted her from hazar shed gone there with her cousin and future husband hussein rashid the hammer of god himself praise be his name praise indeed they had left baghdad where her grandfather was killed by a car bomb in his mercedes planted by sunni dogs curse them ali said what happened in hazar khan gave him as close an account as he was capable of so what happens now ali inquired hussein rashid is what he is and a great man but there arent just newspaper photos one of my sweepers had to go to hampstead police station for the new business and there were two photos on the big notice board in the most wanted section he could never come to england now so it would seem khan got up i must go ali accompanied him to the street door and stood by the audi khan saidyou never heard a word from abu in fact he knew perfectly well that abu was dead shot by greta novikova for jamal had told him but there had seemed little point informing ali hassim there were more important considerations and he had sworn jamal to secrecy ali hassim was remarkably calm in his reply i think they murdered him it is the only explanation if he was alive somewhere he would have let us know by now may you meet in paradise ill be in touch as he got in the audi ali said things go badly am i right no it is just a minor setback hold true to your faith in allah and in osama always that ali closed the door for him and khan drove away not long afterward there was an emergency at the hospital and molly rashid was called in an effort to return to some sort of normalcy the three of them had intended to go to the cinema together but the child in question at the hospital was only seven heart valves were involved and molly really was very good at that so off she went and when caspar suggested just the two of them going to the cinema sara said shed rather not he tried talking to her as they worked their way through the light salad molly had left for supper but he got little response afterward in the main drawing room by the fire he tried to make conversation and failed miserably when he tried to discuss the future it had disastrous results his hesitant mention of school drew a totally negative result she actually came alive do you really think that would be appropriate daddy school blazer jolly hockey sticks but look love youll have to go to school the law demands it the law there was a kind of fire in her eyes whats that all i saw for months were people shot saw it on a regular basis your mother was killed along with seventytwo people in a market bombing in downtown baghdad your father in a car bomb by sunnis i know darling he tried to take her hand she pulled away you say sunni as if you hate them why not at the villa including servants we had over forty people because those who lost their homes brought their families people lived in tents in the grounds and every week without fail somebody was killed there were always three or four one week was badten in another market bombing she shrugged and the dead were replaced by more refugees it was a cycle it never stopped there was no time for school i dont think ill ever find time for it again dont talk like that she said i think ill go to bed are you sure youre all right he asked oh yes youve got to look on the bright side she actually managed a smile ive just thought of something good at school we do our advanced level certificates in a few years just think i could probably do advanced arabic right now and get an a good night he sat there thinking about it and the terrible thing was that in spite of his learning his degree the books he had written there was nothing he could do about it he stood quietly in the hall for a while then went upstairs and tiptoed to her bedroom door she was crying he could hear that well enough as he went back downstairs hed never felt so helpless in his life hussein frustrated and angry hired a private jet from a company in kuwait a citation x a twinengined plane requiring two pilots the owners of the company were good muslims so it wasnt just a question of money when they realized who he was the aircraft was reputed to be the fastest commercial jet in the world since the concordes departure it was due the following day but like everyone in the brokers world he had no means of getting in touch with him and could only wait at last the call came and he took it angry what in hell is going on ive already booked a private jet its coming tomorrow morning excellent i have a destination for you where algeria just as i said you of course did your combat training there in the camps so did dillon thirty years ago when he was nineteen and first joined the ira do you know an area called the khufra on the coast no i was in the desert two hundred miles west it had a bad reputation why would we go there in a way its a message from me to major roper that im on to him ferguson s people had a hard time of it there last year theyre still wanted by the algerian police for several murders anyway its a bad place hundreds of miles of marsh creeks lots of boats and a hotbed of smuggling and drugrunning there is an airstrip old hangars a basic control tower and where do we go from there you will be met by major hakim mahmoud of the algerian secret police taking a bribe is second nature to him so there is no moral aim to anything he does money talks hussein ive nothing against a thief but he must be an honest thief i have no time to find this out by experience well my experience has been satisfactory hussein thought about it another thing this business of leaving all communication on your side has to stop i need to be able to communicate with you if things go wrong nomy privacy is nonnegotiable even for you it has always been so and so it will remain then ill make my own arrangements you wont be able to look lets discuss this with my face plastered all over the papers im not very hopeful that i can get to england from france by any known airline or train you must have some sort of plan for the final approach yes a small boat under cover of darkness from a port called saintdenis in brittany theres a man named george romano english used to be in the navy he specializes in highpriced clients who need to get into england the hard way will he have weapons i presume youll carry pistols but any heavy stuff you need youll get in england its all provided for there a man called darcus wellington he was an actor for years he still pops up in old british blackandwhite films on television but his homosexuality sent him to prison for a few years that was his downfall and crime followed he also has a flair for makeup which youll find very useful im hoping he may be able to disguise you in some way excellent now how do we get from khufra in algeria to saintdenis in brittany mahmoud is sorting that out now he intends to place you as passengers on a small plane making a smuggling run to france the drop will be at a private airfield where a car will be provided you can drive to saintdenis if roper checks hazar when he sees a citation x booked hell suspect its for you if he traces it to algeria it will simply fly away again leaving us to our anonymity youve described it exactly so no need for concern i suppose not there was reluctance in husseins voice there you are then you may download all this onto your laptop of course anything else yes your special flight bag the black one you brought from baghdad what about it when you open it you will find hidden in the lining of the bottom righthand corner a gold and enamel brooch rather pretty it slides open and a button is inside if you press it i will always call you straight back you alone have such a device you bastard ive been called that before the broker switched off algeria france chapter the citation arrived on schedule bearing two pilots named selim and ahmadi who came down to the house after they arrived and sat on the terrace with hussein and khazid and drank coffee you know who i am hussein asked selim did the talking yes we are here to serve you it is an honor are you familiar with the plane no but i hear great things about it i am a pilot myself excellent eager to please selim added you could try the controls its an experience flying this plane i can tell you im sure it is but theres no time to play your job is to get us to our destination drop us off and then you clear off is that understood ahmadi the younger one looked disappointed but selim was all business and the destination algeria hussein opened a file on the table all the details are there ill leave you to work out your flight plan and he walked away khazid following him they went into the study sat on either side of the desk and hussein opened a drawer produced a couple of walthers plus silencers and pushed one across two colts followed from the drawer and they started to load them you said you would promise me nothing beyond paris khazid said so i did now my future seems an inevitability hussein had downloaded his laptop and discussed everything with him so it would appear is there a problem not at all i am proud to serve khazid finished loading one of the colts but i was thinking ahead to england and heavy artillery ive given you all the details this darcus wellington will be taking care of our needs darcus wellingtonsuch a ridiculous name i marvel that such a person could involve himself in someone like the brokers business oh i dont know in a way its rather like his playacting in films i suppose only in this case its serious business and real bullets khazid slammed the magazine into the butt of the walther what next finish your packing travel light ill have a word with the pilots lets say we leave in one hour does that suit you absolutely they walked out into the great entrance hall here we go into the war zone again khazid said why us hussein put an arm about his shoulder because little brother allah has ordained it though to be honest i can no longer look at religion in the same way i once did it provides no solace for me so the business of war why do we take part in it because it is our nature and is that all im afraid so now go and get ready at his computers roper had inserted a trace element on aircraft movement at hazar though it was no big deal since traffic was so light he was being served bacon sandwiches and tea by sergeant doyle when the signal sounded get dillon for me he said hes in the dining room with the major doyle cleared off and roper checked into a series of screen images dillon and greta appeared whats the good word dillon demanded citation x left kuwait under charter to rashid shipping landed at hazar three hours ago its departed under a flight plan taking it to khufra in algeria not that dump what in the hell does he have to go there for lets look at this if hes on his way to anywhere you can bet the broker has organized it chartering the citation was a way of hussein saying its mewhat are you going to do about it because he and the broker know we must be watching but why khufra greta said look what we went through there last year the broker knows that and he knows im monitoring him so its his way of mocking me and i know that you know that kind of thing khufra by its nature is a hotbed of smuggling and drugrunning by boat as well as air and its a perfect place for hussein to drop out of sight my bet is the citation leaves him there and what happens to him greta asked across the water spain is convenient who knows one thing is certain she said he cant be coming to england not with his face plastered all over the place well he isnt going to stay in algeria there wouldnt be any point as for france thats a possibility actually some of the papers on the continent picked up the picture too roper said he tapped some keys and page four of the previous days paris soir appeared with husseins photo there you are page four but its enough so whats his next move dillon asked i think hell keep his head down greta said no dillon said there is one thing im sure of hiring the citation flaunting it with the trip to algeria it has to have reason to it he has a purpose and sooner or later its bound to become clear what that purpose is well just have to wait at the hampshire house molly and caspar in the kitchen discussed sara they could see sara in the garden on a bench on the terrace reading a book shes pretending caspar said you can tell have you discussed school again with her molly asked for gods sake its far too soon for that shed need a new school anyway fresh faces another environment perhaps a boarding school whatever it is its got to be faced this situation molly reached for the coffeepot and poured another cup and appropriate treatment found youre talking about her as if shes a patient caspar said but thats what doctors do i suppose personally i think we need to make a firm decision and whats that supposed to mean tell her weve decided she neednt go back to her old school and neednt go back to any school for six months let her vegetate find her own feet beyond his wife through the window he saw that sara had gone from the bench she was in fact in the hall but he didnt know that molly said i dont think thats any good at all to be frank with you i had a long chat on the phone this morning with professor janet hardcastle she was very interested in the case and has offered to take her on in spite of the fact that the lady in question was one of the most eminent psychiatrists in the country caspar was not impressed dammit molly psychiatrists now what about some simple loving kindness we should stop trying to understand until she understands herself because she is capable of that shes a hugely intelligent girl sara appeared at the door oh thats all right i dont mind playing word games with professor hardcastle but im still not going back to school i feel like a rest now ill go to my room she put the book she had been reading on the side and went out caspar picked it up glanced at his wife and held it out to her without a word it was the koran in arabic roper had enjoyed his chat with igor levin the former boy wonder of the gru for levin also had medals from all those dubious kremlin wars had sweated in afghanistan had got close enough to a chechen general to cut his throat roper remembered him as a socalled commercial attaché working for gru head of station colonel boris lhuzkov in london so now on a whim he contacted lhuzkov on his private number at the embassy of the russian federation situated in kensington gardens lhuzkov answered at once in russian and roper who actually spoke rather decent russian said in english cut that out boris who is it boris asked roper my godto what do i owe this pleasure nothing special i was just talking to igor levin in dublin and that put me in mind of you as every attempt made by lhuzkov to contact levin had been rebuffed he was intrigued how is igor just enjoying life as for his pals chomsky works for lawyers and popov is with a security firm but then you know this do i the thing is id have thought that futile attempt to knock off blake johnson would have taught you russians a lesson so what was all this nonsense with stransky and his goons at harrys place and chekov im shocked have they succeeded in saving the leg by the way my dear giles i have no comment at this time i bet you havent and whats with giles how did you discover that its a closely guarded secret like any good spy i have my sources may i also make a comment there are people who think that boris lhuzkov is a stumblebuman old buffer long past his best if there ever was a best but ivan stransky has a brain the size of a pea and as for chekov his brain is between his legs to anyone with half a brain the size of harry salters property empire and bank balance should have given pause for thought all by themselves i for one never fell for your act boris anyway is there going to be a new chief executive officer at belov international because the one youve got now cant do much more than go over to drumore place and sit on the terrace in a wheelchair an umbrella over his head mind you hed be all right for the weekends it only rains five days a week in ireland lhuzkov finally managed to stop laughing god but youve cheered me up so whos going to run the show you can tell me of course theyve managed to save chekovs leg but real recovery will take a very long time i might as well tell you because youll find out anyway general volkov will assume command for the moment surprise surprise the presidents righthand man exactly anything else yesfor volkovs ears and perhaps for his friend the broker lhuzkovs voice changed slightly to careful yes youve seen the press releases in the newspapers on hussein rashid i could hardly miss them how about the full story on the other rashidthe english wife the thirteenyearold daughter kidnapped by army of god fanatics for the grandfather in iraq its hussein whos supposed to marry her when she comes of age ive heard certain whispers well hussein took the girl down to hazar and dillon and billy and the childs father swooped down and stole her from right under his nose and flew off to good old blighty leaving two of his best men dead oh dear let me put my supposedly stupid mind to this these photos in the newspapers they are supposed to keep him out of britain something like that just for the moment and to make the family feel secure im not so sure it will work why not because hes the hammer of god he wont want to let his audience down thats what i think too roper said do you mind if i share all this with volkov thats why i told youat that moment greta came in greta sends her best shes thriving my god how i miss that girl such a beauty roper switched off and greta said who was that lhuzkov roper smiled i was feeling lonely the citation crossed saudi arabia egypt then northern libya following the coast at enormous speed and most of the time at fifty thousand feet selim invited hussein to take the controls when they were over libya and changing his mind hussein did for a while reveling in it later much later as they approached their destination selim came back to consult him im worried about fuel oran is only a couple of hundred miles away from khufra i think we should stop and refuel there hussein thought about it private planes like the citation were used only by the rich and always received preferential treatment they should be safe enough all right so oran it was he used the british passport and khazid a french one in the name of henri duval they got out to stretch their legs ahmadi took their passports to the office for them but he was waved away so simple khazid said yes but not to be taken for granted hussein said there could be a time when theyre all over us as allah wills perhaps but what if its all actually in our own hands i am a simple man my friend i accept what i know and do what im told and i prefer you that way hussein climbed back in the plane khazid followed then they soared again into an evening sky climbing to no more than ten thousand feet later they saw the marshes of the khufra sprawled on the desert below the creeks stretching out to the sea here and there a dhow sails bulging in the wind and sometimes motorboats and the odd freighter they descended to not more than a thousand feet and selim saw the runway to the left of them the control tower and two hangars but oddly there was no contact from the control tower selim circled again and passed over the town and small harbor there was a jetty at one point an old eagle floatplane tied up beside it selim said an eagle amphibian you can lower the wheels beneath the floats and taxi out of the water onto a shore years old but sturdy they were built for bush flying in places like canada he slowed right down and they almost seemed to hang there suspended strange still no response from the tower hussein pondered every sense alert this is what you do land go to the far end of the runway and turn for your takeoff well get out ahmadi closes the hatch and we wait if the right people are here theyll come for us if there is a problem i fire a shot and you get the hell out of here selim immediately protested we cant leave you it would be a great shame i order it my friend this is our business he put an arm around khazid were very good at it then i obey you with deep regret selim said they circled the runway but nothing moved it was strange great reeds piling in higher than a man and getting darker by the minute the two hangars with doors open but no sign of life down we go hussein said you take both flight bags good thing we travel light khazid smiled you need a suit you buy a suit thats my motto here we go again little brother the citation dropped in and rolled along the runway and it started to turn at the far end the reeds turbulent in the jet stream ahmadi came and turned the handle thrusting the hatch out as the steps fell khazid went down crouching in the blast hussein followed turned to glance up at ahmadi and there was a roaring and two land rovers emerged from one of the hangars at full speed and turned onto the runway close it hussein called and ahmadi did as he was told slamming the hatch shut hussein pulled out his walther firing into the air and selim boosted power and roared down the runway and the land rovers swerved to each side the citation rose lifted at the end of the runway and khazid was already turning into the reedsgo now keep in touch with your mobile ill hold them off hussein turned took careful aim and shot the front offside tire of the leading vehicle it swerved violently throwing the man next to the driver out the other swerved past and came on four men in some kind of khaki police uniform hussein fired again this time at the second land rover splintering the windshield and he turned and plunged into the reeds and immediately fell foul of a rusting cable hidden in the undergrowth he went headlong and they were all over him boot and fist everywhere he was pulled to his feet and someone found his walther but not the colt he had left that in his flight bag with khazid an overweight bearded captain appeared to be in charge one of the men gave him the walther nice one i appreciate your gift think nothing of it ah a cool customer you are here to see major hakim mahmoud of the algerian secret police if hes available oh yes you must be an important man that was a wonderful plane one of his men emerged from the reeds any sign of him no hes gone captain never mind the three men in the other land rover were fitting the spare tire ill be in the office but hurry up i want to get back to the fort they say its going to rain he turned to hussein i am captain ali im sure well get along he patted his face you are a handsome young man hussein got in the land rover between two policemen and they drove away behind them well hidden in the reeds khazid had heard everything and watched them go leaving the three men wrestling with the damaged tire one of them was a sergeant the one who had been thrown out of the vehicle khazid got his walther out unzipped his case and found a carswell silencer quickly he screwed it in place just as the two men on the tire had it fixed good the sergeant said lets go khazid put down the flight bags and stepped out of the reeds walther in hand he whistled they all turned and he shot the sergeant between the eyes the other two were completely shocked the captain said he was going to the office where is that the bottom of the control tower one man said excellent now this fort he mentioned the second man was shaking with fear so it was left to the other again the old foreign legion fort a half a mile down the road to the left thank you khazid shot both of them dead not because of any conscious cruelty but because he had no choice in the matter if he was to rescue his friend in one piece he put the flight bags in the passenger seat pausing only to pull up the canvas roof of the land rover because it would give him some sort of cover he drove away along the runway toward the control tower taking his time but when he got there the other land rover had gone it was dark now with no need for caution the door was unlocked he opened it and found a light switch it was a reception area he went behind a counter opened the door marked office and turned on the light the man behind the desk was seated in a swivel chair and from the state of him had obviously had a bad time of it his hands handcuffed behind his back his final end had been a bullet in the head he was presumably major hakim mahmoud khazid looked around him there was a large flashlight on the table which worked when he tried it he left it on switched off the light and went out to the land rover now for the fort it was cold surprisingly cold and hussein shivered as three of the policemen manhandled him out of the land rover there was a fort he could see that the green and white flag with the red crescent and star the flag of algeria flared in the lights from the battlements over his head and there were two lighted braziers on either side of the gate they passed through a sentry with a rifle beside each brazier they paused at the bottom of some steps leading up to the battlements and got hussein out captain ali was seated on a stone bench drinking whiskey he was obviously that kind of muslim hussein felt only contempt the man resembled a disease you wanted to stamp out major hakim mahmoud was a bad manan evil man he traded with drug dealers all things evil always his hand out for money so if you dealt with him you must be both very wicked and very rich not really i want to know who you are and your companions its against the rules rules so you want to play games you think you must now brace yourself to bear some physical force dont you well its not necessary in the old days they trained foreign legionnaires here hard men who needed to be controlled but the french were very practical people they had the hole over by the wall there very uncomfortable im sure it is i mean ratsyou either like them or you dont very intelligent creatures rats hussein told him above the hole was a windlass coiled with rope a turning handle two of you up here and bring a light and well let you see what youre up against one of the policemen was already holding a robe they made hussein put his foot in a kind of stirrup and lowered him it was cold and damp rain drifting down and he landed in two feet of water they tossed the robe down to him and he put it on there was a scurrying sound the rope was pulled back up he sat on a stone shelf switched on the light and found two rats eyes glinting in the beam they seemed curiously friendly now behave yourselves he said in arabic the rain increased its force and he shook his head khazid where are you he said softly khazid drove down the road in the heavy rain grateful for the canvas roof he could see the fort up ahead the flag hanging limply in the rain there wasnt a sentry box just a stone alcove from the old days a sentry sitting smoking a cigarette another one standing beside him they stopped and looked at khazid curiously the one who was standing came forward who are you what do you want secret police where would i find captain ali and the prisoner he just brought in from the airfield the policeman raised his rifle a little secret police i dont know you the walther with the silencer was on the seat beside him khazid picked it up and shot the policeman between the eyes the other man cried out and leaped to his feet khazid saidstand still i dont want to miss you the man was terrified and dropped his rifle so tell me he put the prisoner in the hole its on the battlements i dont know where he is himself he may be in the fort khazid got out and left the land rover where it was this place the hole he said to the sentry lead the way which the man did mounting the stairs to the battlements there was no sign of captain ali but there were lights down in the barracks and laughter the hole was selfevident with its windlass are you in one piece brother khazid called other than the rats trying for the odd nibble im fine hussein called ive missed you little brother im sure you did khazid nodded to the policeman lower the stirrup the man exerted himself on the creaking ancient handle the rope went down and hussein called thats fine and said to the rats goodbye my friends the windlass creaked again the man pushing against the weight and hussein emerged i stink like an old sow but youre in one piece which is more than i can say for the late major hakim mahmoud may he rest in peace remind me to let the broker know he should have known a door banged a moment later there were footsteps at the other end of the battlements and captain ali appeared looking rather incongruous an umbrella over his head he was humming to himself and looking down but not for long its you he said stupidly yes it is hussein patted his pockets and found the walther but strangely enough fat ali didnt show fear although that could have been because of the bottle of whiskey in his left hand i knew you were somebody special just from that plane if youre going to shoot me at least tell me who you are my name is hussein rashid they know me in baghdad merciful heaven they know you everywhere in the arab world i should kill you but i was trained in algerian camps which makes us brothers in a way ali said eagerly anything but down you go the rats are waiting my thanks you are a great man ali stuck his foot in the stirrup it took all the policemans strength to control the weight and khazid had to help alis voice echoed up i see what you mean i dont know what you are up to but go to a good grave my friend lets get out of here hussein said to khazid he nodded at the frightened policeman bring him with you they went down to the land rover and the dead man the policeman was terrified expecting death at any minute hussein said which way to town the man pointed theres been enough killing for one night run like hell and the man took off khazid said id say were in a bad fix we need to get out of here fast and brittany is a hell of a long way off hussein got in beside him ive had an idea what about flying out khazid started the engine but we havent got a plane who says we havent they drove quickly away there was a board on a building at the end of the jetty that said canair whatever that was supposed to mean but no lights showed at any of the windows beneath it and everything was quiet here and there was a light in some of the craft moored in the harbor and occasionally the sound of faint laughter from the cafés in the web of narrow streets but they didnt care about any of that khazid had the flashlight he had taken from the control tower and they used it to examine the pod enclosing the fuel tanks it was so oldfashioned there was a dipstick it registered about twothirds full not bad hussein said you still havent told me where were going the balearic islands majorca the largest would be best the airport at palma operates international flights dozens a day awash with tourists there are flights to almost anywhere are you saying we take a chance on a direct flight to england no that would be too much of a risk but there are plenty of flights from majorca to france crammed with holidaymakers going home thats a different proposition on the far side of the harbor a police car turned onto the far jetty and two officers got out a moment later another came down from the town and parked behind it do you think that could be trouble khazid asked maybe the captain is covering his back we did leave several dead men ive no intention of waiting to find out get in he got the door open khazid slipped the line pulled it in and joined him they strapped themselves in and hussein fired the engine and let the plane float away he started to taxi through the darkness toward the harbor entrance which was well lit he moved near the pier and beyond was only darkness khazid was looking out and saw one of the police cars racing round i think weve managed to attract some police attention well whatever they want its too late now hussein turned into the wind and boosted power he pulled back the column at exactly the right moment and the eagle climbed effortlessly over the darkness of the sea and lifted here and there were the lights of a boat of some sort how long to majorca khazid asked ill take my time ill use less fuel if i dont push this old bucket too hard besides i like it maybe three and a half hourssomething like that then well check the plane situation at palma ive got a good feeling it all worked out it could have been much worse he leveled off at five thousand feet and put the plane on automatic god i stink he looked down at the soiled suit i dont know what armani would think youre the man who said if you need a suit you buy a suit youll be okay at the airport yes palma s sophisticated enough i expect the airports full of boutiques open my flight bag for me in the bottom right corner theres a brooch in the lining khazid found it and hussein slid back the top and found the button our lifeline to the broker he pressed it and put the brooch in his pocket it was amazing how quickly the response came and the broker listened quietly to husseins story a pity about major hakim mahmoud a valued ally youll replace him soon enough so what happens now well park the seaplane when we get there then well go to the airport you check on flights for us and call me back a half hour later the broker did ive checked there are a lot of flights to french destinations including a number of cheap basic flights to provincial airports flights of the kind where they pack you in and dont even offer a cup of coffee but they dont give a damn who you are one such destination is rennes which is less than fifty miles by train from saintmalo on the brittany coast saintdenis is only twelve miles outside of saintmalo that should be your best bet the booking is your affair the insolence of this man is unique khazid said with his socalled perfect world showing signs of cracking his condescension is breathtaking dont let it get to you hussein put things back on manual try and get some sleep im going to fly the plane he took the control column leaned back and started to enjoy himself four oclock a halfmoon giving everything a faint luminosity they came in from the sea at five hundred feet turning parallel to the coast looking for just the right sort of place it was khazid who finally noticed one a small crescentshaped cove beneath a steep headland at the north end of the island there were many opulent villas on the coast on either side of it and a lonely jetty no boats tied up the kind of place tourists with hire boats may use most of the villas have their own i think people will think an item like a private aircraft properly belongs to somebody in a rich mans area like this it does have a certain logic hussein landed on the sea beyond the cove and taxied in his engines reduced to a muted rumble they coasted in and he cut the engines allowing small waves to edge the plane against the jetty then opened the door and got out followed by khazid with the curved rope of the line in one hand he tied up then got the two flight bags passing his to hussein there was a line of steps and a decent path beyond a pine wood was at the top and the path led them through it to an extensive vineyard beyond there were villas here and there cottages but it was a scattered sort of landscape coats off hussein said try to fit in look casual the sky was pink then gold the sun rose and they saw people occasionally in the distance it was all incredibly beautiful reaching the main road they came to their first village and already life was stirring well khazid said what next i dont know at that moment they came to the end of the village and found an inn with a pleasant garden a young woman brushing a terrace she smiled and said good morning in spanish and hussein answered in english khazid followed putting on a slight french accent good morning mademoiselle i see no sign of a bus service not until noon do you have a problem he said smoothly our problem is a hire car which gave up the ghost on us im afraid and ive tried their number but there is no reply and we have a plane at noon hussein said oh i see so you need to get to palma as soon as possible as it happens my barman juan is going to town in the truck for supplies after hes had his breakfast im sure you could come to an agreement with him ill go and have a word perhaps you would like some coffee and rolls while youre waiting she went out and they sat at a small table we do have another problem hussein said the plane we didnt get the one doing some sort of drug run from khufra to france was going to drop us off illegally which meant that we could still keep our weapons so no guns khazid said and none from romano everything we need will be provided by darcus wellington thats what the broker said okay lets get it over with khazid transferred the two walthers and the colts into his pockets it breaks my heart but if it must be done he shrugged ill go and find a drain he moved into the vineyard beside the garden and disappeared the girl returned with coffee rolls and marmalade she wrinkled her nose what happened to you i was trying to fix the car and fell into a ditch beside it if you want to use the washroom feel free its the door next to the bar theres a shower so in he went saying hello to a young man presumably juan cleaning the bar top in the washroom he examined himself a sorry sight then stripped his clothes and showered and toweled himself vigorously which made him look better although the clothes were still dreadful when he went back khazid was flirting outrageously with the girl and drinking red wine she had supplied come on mon ami he said try a glass its good for the heart and hussein knowing what he was trying to do took the wine down manfully juan appeared goodbyes were said and they got in the rear of the open truck their backs against the drivers cabin and departed nice girl khazid said just think a couple of real desperadoes like us and she never knew better for her i think much better hussein leaned back and closed his eyes in the early morning sun at the airport they gave juan fifty dollars then searched the numerous shops and selected a mens boutique hussein kept his flight bag but gave khazid his british passport on the off chance theyd allow him to get both tickets no one knew better than he did how slipshod matters of security could be especially when dealing with large numbers of people in the boutique the proprietor and an assistant who was obviously his boyfriend tuttutted when he explained about the accident and set about clothing him from head to toe underwear socks of silk shirts white and blue an expensive tan summer suit from armani and tan brogues finished things off he stood and examined himself in the mirror yes it would do for now he noticed a khaki trench coat on a rail bought that too and was just paying for it all when khazid returned my goodness but you look stylish he said flattery is the last thing i need what about the tickets easy the girl was french and i do french well two tickets in row e taking off for rennes at eleventhirty were returning holidaymakers good hide those extra passports in the special compartment in your flight bag well buy a suitcase put both flight bags inside so they can go in the hold im going to speak to the broker which he did calling him in with the panic button sitting in the corner of the airport lounge when they spoke we had to dispose of our guns an unlookedfor problem theres nothing i can do about that but youll be all right when you reach england darcus wellington may surprise you youll confirm to george romano were on the way all taken care of the broker departed and hussein said to khazid a decent meal i think is what we need now i couldnt agree more they made their way to one of the restaurants ireland london chapter it had been the previous day twentyfour hours before hussein and khazid reached majorca when roper had astonished boris lhuzkov with his candid conversation obviously lhuzkov couldnt speak to the broker but volkov was a different matter he phoned him on his secure line at the kremlin ive got something for yourather interesting well that makes a change ive just had a conversation with roper at holland park have you by god tell me everything it couldnt be quite everything for at that stage of the game hussein had just buried his uncle and his two friends admittedly the photo planted by roper in the british newspapers had just appeared but the broker hadnt made any mention to volkov of husseins determination still to travel to england what do you think lhuzkov said is roper a loose cannon no everything he does has a purpose so he tells you greta is working for charles ferguson we suspected that anyway he talks of levin in dublin we know very well that levin is in dublin and his sergeants this rashid business the girl in hazar is interesting though hardly surprising with dillon and that wretched salter involved personally the idea that hussein would for any reason come to england now confirms to me that it would be stupid in my opinion any hopes of using his services for any of our own problems must go out the window but weve still got to do something about ferguson this unholy alliance with dillon and harry salter and all his criminal connections is unacceptable and so we see even the moscow mafia confounded lhuzkov laughed now that chekov is out of the picture for a while what do you intend to do im not certain but it must be something and soon it needs to be something to make people sit up and take notice lhuzkov told him physical violence may be oldfashioned but stransky and chekov certainly got the point a great many people not only in our line of work but in the criminal underworld got the message that harry salter is back in business if he ever went away hes doing a very clever thing boris and even the police reluctantly approve the things he does he does to bad people unpopular people like russians in london lhuzkov said billionaire oligarchs and foot soldiers in the mafia so they got a rough passage why should ordinary londoners care id love to take salter down volkov said youd never get near him just the way youd never get near ferguson i dont knowvolkov said ive always believed if you want to shoot someone its perfectly possible look at that idiot who shot president reagan honey i forgot to duck he said to his wife yes he had a great sense of humor for a man intent on destroying communism and the soviet union thank you for reminding me let me remind you that when igor levin was given the job of disposing of that chechnyan general he got close enough to cut his throat in the hotel they were using as command headquarters yes levin was a true artist roper of course only talked to you so that you would talk to me i wonder why stirring the pot perhaps and with that they hung up and who is he ringing now lhuzkov wondered and indeed volkov was already calling igor levin it was eleven oclock on as wet a morning as dublin could provide levin was at his apartment with his great view of the liffey obscured by the gray curtain of rain outside levin answered always aware that a call on his encoded phone meant someone important and was surprised to find volkov on the other end considering how short a time it had been since the last one general what a surprise what can i do for you i wont beat about the bush when i spoke to you from paris the other day i told you i wanted you back i also said id spoken to president putin and he told me to tell you that russia needs you and that he needs you levin burst out laughing what a load of balls who do you want killed he laughed again there are plenty of killers in dublin shall i find you one volkov was furious and frustrated you jewish ingrate he shouted only halfjewish my mother of blessed memory and may i remind you that in his time my father was a muchdecorated colonel in the red army he wasnt seething at the slur he wasnt even angry hey general ive served russia well at the other end volkov breathed deeply a couple of times and moderated his tone my dear levin forgive me for what i have said as for your father he was indeed a great man and youve just given me an idea excuse me he hung up and immediately phoned michael flynn at scamrock security who was farther along the liffey sitting at his desk dictating to his secretary mary otoole the young woman popov had been taking out recently mr flynn its volkov we need to talk certainly is it important vitallyto both of us just a moment flynn said mary take your tea break ill call you later certainly mr flynn what transpired was unfortunate for flynn mary had received the kind of attention a man in his late fifties may well give a pretty girl in her twenties as usual the affair hadnt lasted leaving mary as girls often will in such cases feeling aggrieved especially as she was from a fenian family and had been proud of her association with a pillar of the original provisional ira being a security specialist flynn had a number of recording devices servicing the room some operated from the secretarys office outside it was only recently that mary had taken to listening in she did so now drumore place and the belov international complex are you still interested in the security job there volkov asked by god i am then its yours ill see your firm gets an official contract youll be responsible for all the security at the house and complex youve heard of max chekovs unfortunate problem in london bad news travels fast we know how to handle that sort of thing in dublin a damn shame im taking over frankly im wondering if you might be the one i am looking for to take over all the security services for belov international flynn couldnt believe it by god im your man general you are of course able to recruit old comrades from your days in the provisional ira you mean youre after mercenaries call them what you like men who are used to the gun and wont flinch at using it dont lets beat about the bush you know exactly what i am and i know what you were say i had work for you in london would you be able to provide suitable people to do what theres a general charles ferguson who heads a special intelligence unit and is a great thorn in my side i know youre already familiar with some of his associates like sean dillon and harry and billy salter ive known ferguson for nearly thirty years dillon as well though differently in those days a good comrade but if he got in my way now id shoot him without hesitation where is all this leading would you accept contracts on ferguson and on harry salter who is responsible for what happened to chekov volkov asked absolutely believe me there are old ira hands in london who can still do the business bomb or bullet the irish quarter kilburn never goes away you want sleepers working in the city or in publishing or on some newspapers i can supply them the muslims think they invented itthey only discovered it when do you want it sorted tonight would be fine good god but not absolutely necessary there is one thing you could do as soon as you like kill someone in dublin hes an exagent of mine called igor levin your man popov was his sergeant i should warn you hes a highly dangerous man we eat dangerous men for breakfast terms to be agreed in all cases levin will be my gift to you general this very day i expected nothing less well do great things together flynn hadnt been so excited in years he spoke on the intercom to popov and called him in mary watched the russian brush past her face flushed and continued to listen im taking over all security services at belov international so youll be working for general volkov again hes in charge of things now max chekov had an unfortunate accident thats marvelous the general i mean is there any way i can be of help you can help right now this friend of yours igor levin ah yes we worked together in the gru id like to have words with him its a confidential matter i might be able to throw a bit of work his way i dont know about that i should tell you hes quite rich a bit difficult well you know what they say in the mafia ill make him an offer he cant refuse popov agreed reluctantly what do i do tell him id like to see him on business take him down to rileys bar in crown street by the river itll be closed but just knock on the door and tell him ill be waiting have him there and you clear off say youll be at the café at the end of the street call him now go use your mobile ill see you later ive things to do popov gone he murmured into his own mobile that you riley im sending a disposal deal with him the usual people will pick the body up alone in the computer room flynn called the green tinker a good fenian pub in kilburn in irish lane run by jimmy nolan and his cousin patrick kelly both comrades from the old days whod served time with flynn in the maze prison he enjoyed a businesslike chat with jimmy which was received with great enthusiasm ah we know that bastard ferguson from the old days in belfast dillon too though what the hell hes doing mixed up with bowsers like ferguson ill never know salters your average gangster he probably started off sticking up grocery stores as a kid then graduated to a gun in his pocket and thought he was a big man people like that are criminals michael not like us at all im just tapping some photos and background info into your computer there you are call me when you come up with something theres real money in this a hundred thousand pounds my word on it dont screw up jimmy levin got the call that changed everything from mary otoole before popov arrived at his apartment she was determined to do what was right yes flynn had used her but it wasnt just that from a fiercely irish republican family her father shot dead by british paratroopers when she was seven years of age she was proud of her connection with the ira and flynn whom she had worshipped in the past when he was chief of staff had let her down spectacularly so she phoned igor levin whom she had met a time or two when she was with popov told him what had happened and what she could remember levin was not only grateful he believed her he immediately phoned chomsky and found him in his car in the city center and told him everything are you going to go youre being set up thats obvious and this stuff shes told you about dillon the salters ferguson this is serious business chomsky told him as we who served in afghanistan and chechnya know sergeant and isnt it great ive been sitting on my backside too long the bell went for the front door sounds like popov now levin said im in my car only five minutes away ill crash the party levin opened the door and expressed surprise on seeing popov and listened to his story with simulated interest i wonder what he wants maybe its something to do with a job in the firm popov said i told him i didnt think youd be interested i mean you know not with your money come in let me finish dressing levin led the way into the sitting room get yourself a drink he went into his bedroom found a tie and tweed jacket then went to his desk standing in the bow window with the river view opened a drawer felt in the back and produced first one walther then two both with silencers he put one in each pocket and went back to the sitting room as the doorbell rang again and opened the door to chomsky who stood there in his raincoat levin slipped a walther into one of chomskys pockets hello there youve just caught us popov and i have to meet a man called rileyrileys bar crown street i was just passing so i thought id check to see if you were free for lunch popov looked put out im not sure oh come on itll be good levin told him we can talk over old times after im finished with flynn and he took his arm and led him out they got in the car and chomsky drove away we think i might be getting a job offer security work levin said they were already down by the river turned into a maze of streets with what looked like old warehouses lining them and came to crown street chomsky parked behind a truck there wasnt much choice the café must be at the other end levin said im supposed to wait down there popov protested but wed miss you levin told him and here we are there was a wooden door paint peeling shutters at the windows a narrow alley down one side chomsky said excuse me he disappeared down it levin said go on open the door popov said in a panic its locked no it isnt levin turned the knob opened the door and pushed popov in halfway along the alley chomsky found a door opened it into a kitchen with a table chairs another door he pushed it gently farther along at the bottom of some stairs a man in blue overalls was holding a silenced pistol and looking toward a green curtain at the far end there was the sound of a voice and the man fired twice a dull thud each time popov came through the curtain headlong and fell on his face chomsky shot the man in the left shoulder spinning him around then shot him in the heart and he went down he jerked twice then went still levin checked popov our old friend seems to be dead no old friend of mine this bastards had it too what do we do unfortunately shootings are common occurrence in dublin these days people think because of old ira hands who cant get out of the habit so this alas will be just two more off we go nice and steady up the street and away it was absolutely pouring they got in the car and chomsky drove off now what back to my house to pick up a few things and dispose of the weapons why well we cant take them to london i mean the security people dont like that these days even if you fly in privately is that what were going to do id say so theres a flying club i know at killane executive planes just right for millionaires like me well call at your place too dont forget your passport and he leaned back roper received the call from killane at onethirty he was having a conference meeting with ferguson dillon billy and greta doyle and henderson stood against the wall ferguson had just said right people i want to bring you all up to speed on the present situation the phone went and roper flicked it on to open transmission levin said roper its me levin can we talk if you dont mind the entire firm hearing everybodys here fine by me very convenient actually volkov tried to stitch me up royally with the assistance of michael flynn stitch you up how ferguson demanded oh the coffin lid being slammed down firmly would you be interested to know that flynn is going to take over all security services at belov international yes i damn well would ferguson replied tell me more which levin did everything that mary otoole had told him the popov betrayal the shootings at rileys bar dillon broke in so youve two bodies lying there does that give you a problem no it seems in flynns original discussion with riley flynn told him the usual people would pick my body up now theyll have two i always thought popov would come to a bad end damn judas dillon said why do you think mary otoole told you everything interesting that she said that for a man who had been chief of staff of the provisional ira he was a disgrace then i recalled popov telling me once that her father was ira and killed in a gunfight with brit paratroopers in ulster god save us but that kind of fenian female can be harder than an orange presbyterian make sure shes safe you owe her bigtime i will be sure of that roper said so where are you now a flying club at killane outside dublin under the circumstances chomsky and i have decided to come over it was greta who broke in now does that mean what it sounds like greta my love im bored dublin is totally charming one of the worlds great cities but i pass my days in idle pleasure i would say that sounds unlikely based on what youve told us ferguson said but if what youre trying to say is that you and sergeant chomsky are seeking employment i welcome you with open arms are you sure of that general all sins forgiven youre booking a plane from killane thats right do bring your british passports i know you have a selection but id prefer it and tell your pilot to call his details ahead and hell be welcomed at farley field well see you soon general the deaths of riley and popov had not yet become known and flynn had not returned to scamrock security mary otoole pulled on her coat picked up her handbag and made for the door when the phone rang on her desk she picked it up mary otoole its levin i was just leaving flynns not back i trust youre leaving for good you saved my life miss otoole but so long as youve gotten rid of any evidence of your involvement you should be safe enough ive left my notice on his desk to be honest with you i think hell be glad to be shut of me we had an affair i was his leavings but that wasnt the reason i did what i did when i think of my dad and what he stood for and flynn and his scheming and rottenness i had to tell you very quickly do you live alone yesi rent a flat only fifteen minutes walk from the office do you have a passport of course i have you have done me the greatest favor in my life and i must repay the debt im at killane twenty minutes outside the city at the aero club chomsky and i are going to fly to england in a private plane i think youd be better out of things for a while just in case youre perfectly welcome to join us london s a big place easy to lose yourself do you really mean that absolutely do you have cab fare of course i do theres a rank outside the office ill get a driver to take me home and wait for me levin put his mobile away and standing at the counter of the small bar chomsky ordered two vodka shots he raised his glass to a nice girl called mary otoole who did the right thing and thank god for it levin said they moved out into the entrance and found magee the chief pilot standing under the canopy out of the rain smoking a cigarette and chatting to a young pilot named murphy they stopped their conversation have you sorted it out yet magee asked levin three passengersdestination farley field in kent just outside london its all fixed up were expected i dont know that one check it on the screen murphy murphy returned in a few moments its there all right and classified restricted did you send our names chomsky said the efficient sergeant taking over look again ill come with youand it was there on the screen captain igor levin and sergeant ivan chomsky magee looked my god you must have some pull for a place like that i think ill do the flight myself you can come with me he told murphy a couple of nights in london will do us good well take the king air he turned to levin turbo prop but it gets you there nearly as fast as the jet and the seats are bigger what about the other passenger a lady shell be here soon is she on the classified list thanks for reminding me are you as we both served in the raf i expect so roper answered at once levin said the girl mary otoole ive decided to get her out of here fast in case of any trouble from flynn so well give her a lift will that be okay certainly i was talking to harry he says he really owes you one if you hadnt come up with the story he could have had jimmy nolan and patrick kelly visiting with maybe a bomb and certainly guns yes but i wouldnt have known if it hadnt been for the girl if he wants to do anyone a favor he can help her get a job yes that makes sense ill see you at holland park you mean i cant stay at the dorchester anymore look on it as a debriefing anyway the safe house is a bit like a hotel these days a little later mary was delivered in her taxi she had only one small suitcase and a handbag she was excited im traveling light any sign of flynn levin asked not when i left let ivan have your passport hell put your details through she went off with chomsky leaving her case by the door murphy picked it up thats women for you there could be a bomb in there they never learn no they never do levin said with some irony took marys case from him and went to join them magee was finishing some sort of documentation at the desk and suddenly they were all together okay folks follow murphy im right behind they went out to the runway and the king air was there in the rain murphy got a couple of golfing umbrellas from a stand by the door and they walked under their shelter together toward the plane levin was smiling and so was chomsky when he glanced at him it was behind them what had been what was ahead was a new chapter and that could mean anything called by two of his collectors as he thought of them to rileys bar michael flynn was confronted by the bodies of riley and popov and couldnt believe what he saw riley was a creature of almost dickensian evil he had murdered many times both men and women available to whoever was capable of paying him a butcher allowed to exist by the ira in the hard times because of how useful he was even his presence had terrified people and here he was with two bullets in him his collectors were a couple on the same level as riley cant believe it mr flynn riley murdered i never thought id see the day flynn would hardly have described rileys death in quite that way hes finally dead and thats it get him in the body bag and the other his papers are here funny name one of them handed over popovs empty wallet flynn said ive told you before keep the cash but not credit cards or any identity stuff ill dispose of those the man gave them to him its lucky we had another body bag in the van where will you put them oh you wouldnt want to know that mr flynn no i wouldnt he took a bulging envelope from his pocket stuffed with euros it was supposed to be one mr flynn riley was extra so ill give you extra next time now get on with it and flynn left them he found his car and drove away it was unfortunate for popov but god alone knew what had happened to the man levin hed have him checked out he was annoyed with himself that his first attempt to do volkov a good turn had ended in failure but there was no need to tell the russian for the moment at the green tinker at about twothirty the snug was down to old bert fahy behind the bar and two aging men enjoying a beer nolan and kelly had been making calls and the result was two cars turning up outside and four men entering the snug one after the other they were all from kilburn the irish quarter for over a hundred and fifty years which is why its inhabitants were known as london irish and hard men hard and wild where danny delaney and sol flanagan were concerned they were the same age twentyfive wearing loose flashy suits in the italian style their hair just a little too long in both cases drugs were a priority and they had a mad dangerous look to them and a history mainly involving armed robbery jack burke and tim cohan were very different members of the ira since their youth veterans of that long struggle of what the irish had always called the troubles both were in their late forties hard calm faces giving little away it was the first time theyd met as a group and there was a hint of contempt in the way the older men looked at the younger one thing was certain the days of the ira holding london in thrall were over there was no disguising that by brave talk danny delaney said jimmy nolan told me he was bringing you in on this burke and cohan he laughed the slightly nervous giggle of somebody who was on something sounds like undertakers flanagan said i heard you were with the crew who knocked off that muslim travel agency in trenchard street the other week these pakis have real cash in those places delaney said i heard twenty grand the two older men didnt say a word and bert fahy spoke up as the two aging men left their beers and made for the door whats it to be gents lets just make it bushmills whiskey all round large ones delaney said if were talking business i like to keep a clear head he put a line of coke on the bar in an abstracted way whistling cheerfully and sniffed it and drank the glass of bushmills that fahy offered him now thats what i call good stuff man go on have a go flanagan did also pausing to down his whiskey thats so great man lets do it again burke looked on with obvious disapproval rots the inside of your nose i hear if you indulge enough cohan observed delaney was really on a roll your travel agency reminds me of that paki store we turned over the other week in bayswater big bastard with a beard wouldnt open the safe young girl was serving one of those things on her face with only the eyes showing i pulled it off the veil real goodlooker i mean id have given her one if id had time he took a pistol from his pocket a silencer on the end put her over the counter and shot her in her right bum cheek she never even screamed that was shock you see flanagan said but he got the safe open bloody quick after that delaney said and there was only eight hundred quid in it must have been to the bank id have given him one too only we had to get moving burke turned to cohan the great days are behind us indeed tim if this is what weve come down to so it would appear you wouldnt know how to have a laugh if you saw one delaney told him and you wouldnt know how to handle serious business if it hit you in the face sunshine delaney giggled again last of the old brigade a sort of dads army of the provisional ira burke grabbed him by the lapels dont take the piss out of the ira boy i did a stretch at long kesh the maze prison itself in five minutes youd have been on your knees in the shower room begging and ive got one of these too he produced a silenced pistol from his pocket and held it up delaney pulled away higher than ever but is it as big as mine the door to the office opened and nolan appeared cut it out get in here kelly was sitting on one end of the desk on the wall behind was the material flynn had sent on the computer a row of photos an information sheet under each one ferguson harry salter billy dillon and roper in his wheelchair there was nothing on greta novikova but harrys minders joe baxter and sam hall were represented they look like nothing much to me flanagan said i agree delaney nodded burke said i recognize that bastard ferguson years ago he was a colonel in derry when they lifted a bunch of us major general now hes the prime target and i can tell you boys there is big money in this for all of us you have my word on it cohan said how much a hundred grand and my client is good for it believe me but weve got to deliver the goods before we see any of that delaney frowned kelly who had been silent said so we do lets have some plain speaking i hate time wasting if the terms arent satisfactory theres the door no need to be so butch delaney said we might as well have a go nothing else on at the moment cohan said so what are we talking about the main targets are harry salter and a lot of people will heave a sigh of relief if you manage to kill that one and charles ferguson the others are minders backup people but salter and ferguson go down any way we can any suggestions burke asked a bullet in the head is as good as anything cohan nodded i wouldnt hesitate to shoot ferguson in the back if i saw him in the street on a wet night he looked at the photos again god save us sean dillon himself the small man some called him looks like rubbish to me delaney said chief enforcer in the movement for twenty years killed more men than you could imagine boy cohan said he never got his collar felt once by the army or the ruc delaney said you knew him then only by reputation nolan cut in have any of you been to the dark man salters pub at wapping nobody had thats okay then its friday night so it should be busy go down there mingle get the feel of the place the area its on cable wharf the pub is the first place salter owned theres a development next door it seems hes turned an old warehouse into luxury apartments he even keeps a boat along the wharf anything else cohan asked drive past ferguson s pad in cavendish place just to have a look and dillons at stable mews thats walking distance from cavendish place feel it all out but carefully at this stage well speak again delaney said impatiently so whats the point burke said to use the military term so youre familiar with the killing ground stupid and know what were talking about all the people on the board meet at the dark man on a regular basis im betting most of them will be there tonight nolan pointed out kelly said and so will we see that you are now away with you thank god for that delaney said come on sol and flanagan followed him cohan said are those two for real is this what weve come down to working with scum they kill without hesitation nolan told him its the only point in their favor and have to be drugged up to the eyeballs to be able to do it burke said cohan shook his head not delaney hes naturally evil that one and born that way as he followed burke out he paused at the door christ is this what it was all about the great days we knew and it comes down to this those days have gone nolan said and wont come back ever enough bloody nostalgia kelly put in he opened a drawer in the desk and took out a pistol and silencer and three clips which he pushed across to nolan then took out the same for himself well go for a drive check out ferguson s gaff and dillons nolan loaded his weapon a colt automatic and burke and cohan watched him that sounds sensible do it like the movies to hell with that i remember when we were the movies the biggest bombing campaign seen in london since the luftwaffe burke said the bowsers had to virtually wall off the city the bank of england the lot god you had to keep your head down at that time there was a bar called gradys in canal street a leftover from the victorian times there was a canal running down to the pool with a bridge over it i stayed there more than once in the great days when i was on the run kelly nodded as if to himself grady died years ago but a fella told me the other week his wife maggie still runs it she must be seventyfive if shes a day he turned to nolan lets check out gradys for old times sake nolan said thats a great idea spend some time there before the dark man kelly turned to burke and cohan why not join us say about six give the dark man the chance to warm up well have a couple of glasses to start the evening off and why not cohan said well see you there come on jack nolan took down a reefer coat from a peg whistling tunelessly he loaded his colt screwed on the silencer and kelly said come on then jimmy and nolan swung to look at him eyes wild and from somewhere deep inside it all burst out what in the hell happened to us patrick its simple jimmy we lost the war kelly patted him on the shoulder lets go old son and make the best of it they went out to the snug where fahy who had been listening at the door to all the comings and goings was suddenly busy polishing glasses behind the door well be out for the day nolan said thats fine jimmy ill see to things they went out and fahy his face grave poured himself a whiskey and filled his pipe chapter it was a little earlier that a council of war at holland park had examined the situation the real threat in all this ferguson said is russian by taking flynn on board volkov has thrown down the gauntlet so he must have presidential backing roper said im sure putin has felt for some time that something should be done about us general he glanced at harry and anyone whos on our side but the thing at the moment is nolan and kelly and that contract and what to do about it roper pointed out if we were police you couldnt touch them ferguson said because they havent done anything but i have implicit faith youll find a way of dealing with it i have a meeting in one hour with the prime minister ill call in later at holland park and ill greet our friends from dublin then i admit ive got things to do at the development harry said i mean we cant let stupid threats interfere with business i admire your spirit harry ferguson said but i think we can leave the activities at the green tinker to these three he and harry went out dillon said wheres greta she was going to call in at gulf road see how the rashids are coping hal stone has hit the highway for cambridge this morning to the halls of academia said roper my god the students would flock to his lectures if they knew only half of the things that fella gets up to do you think hussein will come only time will tell but now to the matter at hand jimmy nolan and patrick kelly his cousin they own the green tinker pub in kilburn both active in the movement and not only in ulster nolan was down as a suspect for that mortar attack on john majors cabinet during the gulf war but we discovered it was someone else billy looked at dillon and we know who still he was seven years into a fifteenyear prison term when it was all over so he was released from prison according to the terms of the peace agreement kelly got pretty much the same deal british citizens born in london they inherited the green tinker from nolans father served their time clean as a whistle both of them like hell they are billy said i think dillon and i will go and check the beer out stay calm billy with a couple of guys whove accepted a contract on my uncle well leave your walther at home roper old son id remind you that as an agent of her majestys secret services i actually have a license for it well go in my car dillon i thought so billy had just taken delivery of a scarlet alfa romeo spider and was obviously proud of it very nice dillon told him im impressed now as to business i dont recall these two from my ira time so theyre both a blank page to me except for what roper had to say so what theres only one way to handle this you noticed the prison photos on ropers screen were about twenty years old you wouldnt even recognize them now lets just see they parked outside the green tinker and went in the saloon bar three old men sat at a table by the window and played dominoes an unshaven young man in a black tshirt with short sleeves and lots of muscle stood behind the bar reading a newspaper the snug door was open and old fahy was filling a pipe he took one look at them and an expression of horror appeared on his face the barman glanced up he wore a black patch over his right eye from the expression on his face he wasnt impressed by what he saw yes ill have half a bottle of still water billy told him and a glass of your strongest for me dillon smiled bushmills if you have it and wed also like to see nolan and kelly billy said the man put dillons whiskey into a shot glass he gave it to dillon pushed another glass at billy and picked up a jug of water from behind the bar will this do sir billy reached for the glass why not the man started to pour then moved all the way up the sleeve of billys trench coat old fahy called i wouldnt do that michael but billy was already reaching pulling the man across the bar punching him heavily in the face several times the old man stopped talking billy pulled michael up jerked the left arm out straight the edge of his own right hand descending like a chopping axe he eased him down into a chair i think youll find ive broken it now nolan and kelly whos going to speak up old fahy said youd better come in the office i expect youll force your way in anyway they stood and looked at the display on the wall read what was said about them examined the photos i think yours is quite good dillon said im not sure about mine its called the older man look billy said you know been places done things is that it dillon passed his glass to fahy ill have the same again the bushmills as usual i know that well he poured a large one dillon said and how would you know because he heard you order one from the prick next door billy said the old man shook his head im from derry i saw you three times with martin mcguiness there i had my moments with the ira but ten years inside finished me off and i came to kilburn remember a pub called the irish guard i was pot man there gerry brady was the publican did me a favor and found me a job i remember the first time you came in and asked for gerry only you werent calling yourself sean dillon well i wouldnt be but i knew you february ninetyone it was the time somebody mounted a mortar attack on the prime minister and the war cabinet at downing street dillon smiledwe wont get into that one have a bushmills and tell us what you know about this lot on the wall and what bleeding nolan and kelly are up to billy said fahy poured himself the bushmills now do i look like an informer youd look a damn sight worse if i put you on sticks billy told him for you then mr dillon jimmy got all this stuff on his computer photos pages and so on from a man called flynn in dublin you listened in the walls are terribly thin here they were being offered a contract thats the upshot of it a hundred thousand pounds thats why they put everything up on the board the bastards billy said so they intend to do all of us the ferguson fella and harry salter are the prime targets that was the phrase used and how was this to be achieved dillon asked nolan and his cousin patrick run this place we know that billy said do they intend to do it themselves or put a crew together theyve got danny delaney and a worm called sol flanagan drugs booze theyre off their heads most of the time whats their game armed robbery shops particularly muslim stores of any kind delaney is crackers he really hates those pakistanis and he shoots without hesitation and flanagan cut from the same bolt of cloth and never been nailed for any of this dillon asked oh theyve been pulled in appeared in court on occasion but you cant get a conviction without witnesses can you who else dillon asked different breed altogether jack burke and tim cohan london irish the kind who slipped off to ulster to join the provos when they were kids they did the lot including the maze they know you mr dillon and were distressed to see you in bad company who did they particularly dislike ferguson burke said he was lifted along with some others when ferguson was a colonel in derry cohan said that if he passed him on a wet night in the rain hed shoot him in the back without hesitation never mind all this billy said where are nolan and kelly now they went out about forty minutes ago they were both armed and they arent coming back their conversation was all about filling the time until this evening they were going to drive past ferguson s house check out your place mr dillon then later visit the dark man something about the movies was mentionedmaybe they intend to kill time there until its late enough so the bastards intend to show up at the pub billy said well it is friday night so dont tell me you wont be busy he said the word was that most of you on that board had a habit of getting together at the dark man of an evening the idea is they go along familiarize themselves with the place the surroundings theyve also been ordered to check out ferguson s house and yours mr dillon obviously jimmy and patrick do the same and then what billy demanded who gets it first jimmy said after theyve done all that ive told you about theyd speak again oh there is something else burke and cohantheyre like a lot of the boys are the great days gone and they dont like it dillon said they dont care for the company they have to keep they once had pride and now its gone he tapped out his pipe would there be anything else youve told us a lot dillon said and i suspect its all true why ive always admired you mr dillon a great man and great for the cause but i havent done it for you my reasons are purely selfish your friend here looks like the kind of fella whod have beaten it out of me one way or another and im getting too old for that yes you are you old bastard billy turned to dillon stick him in the back of the alfa and take him to holland park put him behind lock and key until this is over good on you billy dillon patted fahy on the shoulder does it suit you a comfortable safe house well i certainly wont be safe here he led the way through the snug pausing to take his coat from behind the bar ill just check on michael he led the way into the saloon bar which was empty he called but there was no reply maybe hes gone to get his arm fixed not your problem billy said its the safe house for you youll love it better than a hotel dillon reported in to roper are harry and ferguson still occupied elsewhere they havent contacted me yet what have you discovered should we be worried see what you think and dillon gave him a brief account of what had happened when he had finished roper said ill put them all through my computer pull out photos and general information anything i can find it could be fun so youre in favor of letting these six guys do some nosing around tonight and we dont do anything about it i didnt say that from what your informant has told you they are not supposed to do anything except size the situation up what weve got to decide is what we do if things get out of hand ill try and contact the general and harry after all they are the main targets id remind you the flight from dublin is due in an hour what do we do about that well call in at holland park drop fahy off and take one of the people travellers to farley greta got back an hour ago shes having a drink with me now i think shed like to greet her compatriots it must be some russian thing there had been headwinds which had slowed them down but the king air had performed well and levin mary and chomsky having discovered a bottle of champagne in an icebox had consumed it between them so what do you fancy putting your hand to mary chomsky asked her im beyond caring mind you i have a degree in business studies and computer technology well in the world of today youll never starve chomsky told her and turned to levin dont you agree levin nodded all you need are the right connections and youve certainly got those you not only saved my life but that of harry salter and considering how much of the thames waterfront hes developed i think hell find you something as long as you dont mind being employed by one of the most prominent gangsters in london chomsky said this is nonsense levin told him a girl with her background would fit particularly well in harrys world but now they were dropping through clouds and there was london below and they drifted across and then they were descending and there was farley field and down they went to a perfect landing they rolled along the runway toward the terminal building magee following instructions he switched off the engines and murphy came and opened the door and magee followed he said to levin i was right about this place three raf planes and two helicopters you really are somebodies but youll never know who chomsky said cheerfully and followed mary out the people traveller stood beside the terminal building greta dillon billy beside it greta ran forward and flung her arms around levin first and then chomsky you wonderful bastards she said and there were tears in her eyes i never knew it would be so good to see you and if it wasnt for this girl i wouldnt even be here meet mary otoole levin told her billy moved in quickly im billy salter harry salters nephew i think youll find hell show you his gratitude bigtime dillon took her hand sean dillon her eyes widened mother mary that i should see the day ive heard of you since i was a young girl well youve seen me now so lets get in and well be away billy was at the wheel and as they drove off levin said whats happening so dillon told him when they reached holland park they found harry and ferguson had arrived mary was introduced and harry said youre coming back with me love to my pub the dark man our ruby can look after you for a while until you decide what you want to do lots of opportunities in my personal empire weve just got a few things to sort out here he turned to those assembled in the computer room lets see it again roper roper paraded flynns crew across the big screen the photos had been obtained from police files those of burke and cohan being several years old they had a certain rugged dignity that came with men who had believed they were fighting for a cause delaney and flanagan were a different proposition cocky smirking and in most photos obviously on something drugs alcohol or probably both give us your lecture major ferguson told roper delaney and flanagan shoot at will on store robberies theyve gotten away with it through intimidation of witnesses and cohan and burke ira foot soldiers for years total professionals and that means damned good at killing any psychological profile would tell you they dont like robbing convenience stores for a living but when youre pushing fifty men like that dont have much choice its a point of view ferguson said but i have little sympathy for them you play that kind of game you take the consequences when all is lost having said that i intend to get out my nylon and titanium waistcoat which fit quite snugly under my shirt when i last wore it guaranteed to stop a fortyfivemagnum round at pointblank range i recommend those who have one to wear it until we have this matter sorted i agree harry said its up to you dillon and billy of course you can pull in baxter and hall as foot soldiers and as captain levin and sergeant chomsky have already been involved in the circumstances leading to all this im sure they would be willing to assist no problem general id like you and chomsky to stay here for a few days for a thorough debriefing with major roper after that harrys suggested you move down to the warehouse development of his at hangmans wharf which youll remember from your visit last year i remember it well levin smiled quite convenient for the dark man well you would i wouldnt recommend you going for a swim in the thames with your clothes on again wrong time of year he went out briskly harry followed with mary and billy who said ill hand her over to ruby at the pub and join up with you later fine dillon said left levin and chomsky to sergeant doyle and went back to roper who had greta with him dillon helped himself to ascotch youve got a problem greta said i can tell what would it be roper inquired bert fahy the old man i brought in he gave me a good story and im prepared to accept that it was true but only as far as it went it was a bit too pat i didnt quite buy what he said nolan and kelly would be doing really well we cant have that he called up sergeant henderson bring our new guest in mr fahy he was produced within five minutes and the pleasant surprise the comfort of his quarters had given him disappeared rapidly when he found himself in a pool of light looking up to them fahy you lied to me dillon said the idea that nolan and kelly would go to the cinema before visiting us tonight is unbelievable roper broke in which means you were concealing something else they intend to do god help me sir would i lie to mr dillon all right i wont waste time i will issue a warrant for your detention under the antiterrorism act at wormwood scrubs prison fahy almost had a bowel movement at the thought of incarceration in that dread institution no sir have pity on an old man my memory plays tricks on me try again well major theres the bar called gradys close to the pool of london when he was finished henderson took him back to his quarters dillon saidthis could be a real break im going to go and have a look are you busy he asked greta not until tonight molly rashids on a night shift and she asked me to keep sara company the girls having difficulty relating to her father maybe its the other way round well go in your mini cooper ill see you in the car park and you later he shouted to roper he went straight to his room found his favorite walther and went out to greta already at the wheel of the mini cooper i remember all this when i was a kid with my father growing up in london he said as they made their way downriver the pool of london the docks ships crammed in everywhere hundreds of enormous cranes i dont know if it was the biggest port in the world but it should have been but you were irish she said why were you here at all my mother died my father ran out of work in ulster he shrugged the irish always had a big connection with london michael collins was a civil servant in the post office here before he decided to change the course of irish history it seems all changed now she observed thats development for you a lot of the warehouses are apartment blocks like that one of harrys on hangmans wharf but there are still some streets and buildings that havent been touched she had entered canal street into the satellite navigator in the cooper and they soon arrived there there was a section of the docks in decay a canal flowing down quite fast into the river an ironwork footbridge leading across it and decaying workingclass terrace houses mostly boarded up and awaiting demolition and the pub on the corner with a sign that said gradys bar the door was half open and an old lady with very white hair and an apron over a long black dress was polishing a brass knocker over the door was the usual board with the license details of the publican it said margaret grady she was perhaps seventyfive her voice faded as if she wasnt really here the merest hint of an irish accent can i help you i dont open till six oclock were a free house of course dillon said we werent looking for a drink greta joined in we were searching for canal street but weve obviously found the wrong one oh there must be a lot in the telephone directory an interesting place dillon said in the old days it was quite thriving with the ships and so on but when they went the life went out of everything theyve pulled down all the properties up there were like an oasis another six months and thats it we were a lodging house for years im very sorry greta said do you get any customers now and then but there are days when theres nobody still the council have promised me a place in an old folks home there really wasnt much to say we wont hold you up anymore dillon smiled and he and greta went back across the bridge down to the car and drove away back to holland park quick as you like so youre going to trace them are you she asked no greta if things work out i hope to dispose of them a few old ira hands whove met a bad end and scotland yard will close the files with quiet satisfaction but volkov will get the message and the broker which means alqaeda and army of god greta weve gone beyond negotiation in the world of tomorrow thats emerged in the last few years we fight fire with fire or go under you may think that strange coming from a man who was once an ira enforcer but thats the way it is i dont think its strangei think its ironic thats all excellent so keep driving and ill fill roper in by the time they got back to holland park it was just after five oclock roper had called in billy levin and chomsky greta said to roper ive got this thing with the rashids ill call in later dillon said number one i dont want you on board chomsky you did your bit in dublin and proved your worth you go down to the dark man they may need an extra gun youre the boss chomsky shrugged dillon said to roper youve thoroughly briefed them on this absolutely dillon faced levin and billy there are four good men with years of experience with the ira the revolutionary movement that invented revolutionary movements the object is to kill all four to the authorities the explanation will be some sort of ira feud old scores being settled and who gives a damn ive just been to the bar on canal street you go up by the canal cross a victorian iron bridge and the pub is almost the only building standing in a demolition area theyve no idea were on to them and it will be dark when we get there and bleeding raining again billy said are you tooled up igor thanks to sergeant henderson he took a silenced walther from his pocket just like you dillon okay my car lets do it billy said and led the way out when maggie grady unlocked and opened the door at six it was dark but shed switched the light on overhead and kelly and nolan stood there smiling at her mother mary is it yourself patrick and no other he kissed her on the cheek ive brought a pal jimmy nolan we thought wed have a drink with you ive a couple of boys working with me at the moment theyll be along presently the little bar was neat and tidy a coal fire in the grate old victorian iron tables and chairs scattered round the room bottles stood ranged against a mirror behind the bar she got over her shock soon enough even excelled herself by joining them in an irish whiskey just the one in the middle of a story from kelly the outer door opened and burke and cohan entered weve found you at last praise be to god and a grand sight it is with the fire and all the drink flowed and even old maggie was tempted to another burke said so this is the good woman who looked after you when you were on the run a queen among women kelly told him a lodging house as well as a pub it was then sailors ashore from ships in the pool youve never seen anything like it every nationality on gods earth indians blacks lascars and if you dressed the right way you got swallowed up by them he looked at his watch damn me its seven already well have to get moving he gave her a hug and a peck on the cheekgod bless you my darling heres one man wholl never forget you they were laughing as they went out and she closed the door tired and sad and making a sudden decision she shot the bolt crossed the bar turned the light out and went upstairs very slowly for she was old and past things now that was the truth of it outside there was not just darkness in the decaying street for a single lamp hung from a bracket on the far side of the canal the group started down to the bridge and rain was falling glistening in the yellow light dillon and billy came up the steps side by side each with a walther in his hand who the hell are you kelly cried dillons hand swung up he shot kelly between the eyes the sound of his silenced weapon only a dull thud knocking him back against nolan who was struggling to get his gun out and pushed kellys corpse violently away from him so that it went over the rail into the swirling waters of the canal and was instantly swept away nolan almost got his gun out but billy was faster shooting him in the left shoulder turning him round and then shattering his spine with a second nolan fell across the bridge rail and hung there burke went straight down on one knee avoiding a return shot from billy and shot him in the chest behind him cohan turned to run back to the pub and igor levin stood up from behind a pile of bricks and shot him in the head burke with nowhere else to go vaulted over the rail into the canal went under came to the surface and was instantly gripped by the current but levin running fast fired several times driving him under the water when he turned to rejoin the others billy and dillon were carrying cohan between them to throw him in the canal the current swept him away into darkness all the way down to the pool and the thames and maybe even the open sea dillon said billy had opened his raincoat and was feeling inside his shirt are you all right billy levin asked well you heard what ferguson said titanium and nylon waistcoat if youve got one wear it he produced a damaged round that had stuck in the waistcoat levin said im wearing one too general volkov gave it to me as a present for saving him from an assassin lets move it dillon said mission accomplished now back to holland park at the safe house there was roper ferguson levin helping himself to a whiskey from the majors private stock and dillon all four ferguson shook his head remarkable reminds me of ulster in the old days roper said it was exactly like ulster in the old days you did the job like you said you would sean ferguson turned to levin what can i say about you sterling service indeed youve served us well ill see the right kind of whisper gets through to flynn and volkov just so they get the point roper said the thames is a tidal river and bodies dont turn up with great regularity if you look at the statistics what happens now to delaney and flanagan levin asked well i must admit id prefer closure ferguson said well have to see they should be rising to the surface at the dark man soon unless they decide not to arrive at all billy and harry baxter and hall and our new friend sergeant chomsky should be perfectly capable of dealing with them id say so dillon agreed so lets go and watch them do it why not levin said well if you lot are going im going roper announced doyle can fetch the people traveller ill be ten minutes excellent ill travel with you i never have accompanied you in that contraption you have your own automatic lift ive observed well follow in my mini dillon said you can lead the way he and levin hurried out through heavy rain and got in the mini as they waited dillon called billy whats happening the joint as they say is jumping lots of punters no aggravation and so far we havent seen a sign of the two ratbags were looking for okay well see you soon roper ferguson levin and i id say well be about twenty minutes maybe the bastards have run out on us billy said but the story was completely different delaney and flanagan had spent two hours in an establishment called festival where the music rocked and regular visits to the toilet were solely for the purpose of drug taking by six oclock they were out of their heads on cocaine and the amount of vodka theyd taken with it was lethal they both had reached that state where they viewed the world with a false belief that it was theirs and that anything was possible the car they were in was a mercedes stolen earlier that day before their visit to the green tinker and flanagan was driving it with total indifference to everyone else on the road he scraped three cars one after another and narrowly missed a police officer who raised a hand and then had to jump for his life delaney roared with laughter pulled out his silenced pistol and fired into several shop windows as they passed then vanished into a warren of back streets leading down to the thames this is wapping man i know it is delaney said the dark man cable wharf hah you punched it in right man he pointed at the satellite navigator were there the dark man was ablaze with lights there was music on the night air cars parked all along the wharf a few boats tied up and at the end harry salters pride and joy the linda jones down there they swerved into the car park at the side of the wharf just past the pub so this is it flanagan said so what do we do the rain increased suddenly shoot the place up man delaney took a half bottle of vodka from the glove compartment and opened it heres to us he swallowed then passed it to flanagan to take a pull and at that moment the people traveller arrived it stopped and the back opened and ferguson walked round just as roper was delivered in his wheelchair at the same moment the mini arrived with dillon and levin and paused a little distance away christ delaney said the guy standing beside the wheelchair its ferguson he pushed open the passenger door stepped out and fired his silenced pistol wildly at the people traveller but ferguson turned to speak to roper leaning delaneys rounds simply hit the vehicle and ferguson and roper went down together in a tangle levin jumped out of the mini and fired at the mercedes but it was a difficult shot with delaney on the far side of the vehicle hurling himself back inside dillon put his foot down and rammed the other cars rear and flanagan in a blind panic accelerated along the wharf past the linda jones and went straight off the end into the thames they watched the back end as it tilted and went down to the bottom they waited but nobody appeared thats it dillon said its forty feet deep around here put your gun away lets see about ferguson and roper back at the dark man harry billy and chomsky were there with doyle righting the wheelchair and helping ferguson up and roper into the chair were fine ferguson told them whoever it was missed us whats happened to them bottom of the thames im so sorry ferguson said sarcastically chomsky was on the door harry said he was aware of the shooting but with silenced pistols you couldnt hear a thing in the saloon bar just the noise of the cars colliding thats brought a few out behind them some of the punters glasses in hand were watching ruby came out anxiously mary with her and at the same moment not one police car but three pulled in and a young police sergeant came forward oh its you mr salter weve been chasing a mercedes over half of wapping with gunmen shooting at shop windows on the way by disgusting dont know what the worlds coming to harry said collided with my friends vehicle and straight down the wharf and into the thames dillon said we saw it go down and no one came up christ the sergeant said well leave you to it and get the major here inside harry said piously i mean with his war record its disgusting that he should be subject to this kind of treatment in his own city inside baxter and hall had cleared a couple of booths ruby served champagne mary helped her all in all i say more than satisfactory ferguson said i should bleeding think so harry chuckled talk about clearing the decks volkov can chew on that roper nodded as the police sergeant came in what can i do for you sergeant harry said just to let you know a recovery details been booked for tomorrow and a series of reports indicate the people in the mercedes were a couple of hoods with very bad reputations theyd stolen the car spent a few hours at the festival getting coked up on the way here and as i told you shooting half of wapping up on the way i dont know what they intended names of delaney and flanagan never heard of them in my life sergeant a lot of rats around these days the sergeant departed and they all relaxed thats it then all sorted billy said except for the question of hussein rashid ferguson pointed out there was a pause while they thought about it maybe he wont come what do you think roper dillon asked you know what i think now if you dont mind i could do with a return to holland park im bruised all over the following day of course was the day everything came together the day that the trace element roper had inserted in his computers came up trumps and that a citation x chartered by rashid shipping departed under a flight plan taking it to khufra in algeria but where to from there brittany england chapter the lowbudget flight to rennes crammed with passengers had resembled a refugee flight from some war zone the train to saintmalo on the other hand was excellent a taxi from there took them to saintdenis according to the details the broker had given hussein romano lived on a boat the seagull this is the best i can do monsieur the taxi driver said khazid handled it in rapid and fluent french thats okay well find it he overtipped the man who drove off leaving them looking at a halfempty marina lets start searching khazid said in arabic hussein lectured him quietly no arabic just in case you might as well make it english my french is poor at the best of times as you say there was a walkway boats of many kinds moored on each side but they didnt seem to be getting very far so khazid paused and shouted ahoy seagull nothing happened for a while and hussein said you fool a young woman came out of the wheelhouse of a motor cruiser and looked toward them she was pretty enough denims and a black sweater and there was a gypsy look to her she spoke in french what do you want khazid handled her were looking for a man named george romano hes at the bar on the jetty ill show you both her english and french had strong accents as they went back along the walkway khazid said where are you from kosovo so you were in the war little sister hussein managed to kick his ankle for if the girl was a refugee which seemed likely from kosovo she was almost certainly a muslim the war was a long time ago and your name saida which confirmed it at the end of the walkway she paused took a packet of gitanes from her pocket and a lighter she put a cigarette in her mouth and khazid took the lighter from her allow me thank you she took the lighter back and inhaled and said in heavily accented arabic i dont know who you are or what youre doing here but take care with this man hes english royal navy but rotten to the core hussein said gently you are muslim and the war stank allah bless tony blair for sending the british army and raf to kosovo to save us from the serbs it is true he did such a thing khazid said but what of iraq agreed but life is learning to live with the good and the bad what a wise girl hussein commented my father was a teacher of children at the mosque in our small town when the serbs came they hung himthey hung boys too all this was delivered in the most matteroffact way as they came to a café called the belle aurore there was a terrace at the front with tables waiters in white jackets not particularly busy the man they were seeking was at a corner table reading a copy of parissoir he wore a reefer coat and a seamans cap was perhaps sixty with a florid face and a cruel mouth he reached out for a glass and continued to read saida said george these gentlemen are looking for you hussein said mr romano im hugh darcy romano looked him over first of all its commander romano secondly although i must say your guards tie makes a brave show it wont do you know youd better sit down why wont it do commander this is yesterdays paper we always get it late in this neck of the woods lot of people here though who would run a mile and shout for the gendarmes if they knew who you are page four hussein sat down and stared at his photo in that minute everything so carefully contrived turned to ashes saida reading over his shoulder gasped you are him khazid said come brother no need to panic romano said its just a question of being practical about things of course the only problem is i cant contact the brokerhe contacts me can you get in touch with him yes hussein said excellent this drink is marvelous brandy and ginger ale takes me back to my navy days you should try one he laughed but then you canti was forgetting no but hugh darcy could yes by god youre right you dont look like a raghead at all he shouted at the waiter pierre two horses necksno three he glanced up at khazid got to play the game eh if you say so good boy romano slapped saida on the bottom go and get the groceries and divest yourself of those appalling jeans when you get back on board ive told you i like little cotton skirts so a man can have a decent feel nothing like it the waiter had just brought the three drinks he put them on the table and the girl picked one up and threw it in romanos face he wasnt in the least put out and licked his lips delicious he reached for a napkin and wiped his face ill have to chastise you for that but ill have great pleasure in taking care of it on the voyage she was stunned on the voyage youll take me england romano said to hussein people are desperate to get there especially refugees without permission she turned up months ago with an albanian but when push came to shove he dumped her on the waterfront when we left and she was still here when i returned each time he does another english run he promises me a trip she complained to him ill go for the groceries she paused but ive hardly any money she shrugged and walked away hussein nodded to khazid who went after her romano said you dont like me very much do you if i may borrow one of the great humphrey bogarts best lines if i thought about you at all i probably wouldnt he opened his flight bag felt for the brooch in its corner and pressed the button he closed the case now we wait khazid caught up with her dont worry get anything you want ill take care of it your friend she said even i have heard of him the hammer of god a great man and a great soldier khazid said and you also are a soldier in the war of course in iraq its bad believe me i see that on television the americans the british no its more than that its a blackness a disease that touches everyone the brothers are killing each other some weeks more than a thousand women and children die in the crossfire and how does it end maybe never but where are you going the supermarkets over there yes carry on ill join you in a little while they had just passed a cutlery shop and he walked back to inspect the window full of knives of every possible description with his french background he was aware that the authorities were more openminded about certain types of weapons than other countries he entered and found a whitehaired old man behind the counter monsieur what can i show you i seek a folding knife substantial and preferably automatic fifteen minutes later he left after inspecting a hornhandled flick knife and a seveninch razorsharp doubleedged blade that jumped eagerly to his command at the touch of his thumb he crossed to the supermarket and joined her have you got what you wanted oh yes he said theres nothing like being prepared for anything in this life and i dont like the commander does that make me a bad man anything but good then lets make sure youve got all your groceries for once the broker had been badly caught out the unlookedfor appearance of the newspaper in the small french port with husseins photo was unexpected the reaction of commander romano unfortunate for the moment he had to meet romanos price if hussein and khazid were to make the next move in their progress to england that he would be able to punish the man for his blackmail in the near future was certain alqaeda would see to that he guaranteed the substantial additional funding romano demanded to be transferred to switzerland in a matter of hours when he was finished he insisted on speaking to hussein take a walk i dont want that creature to get any hint of what is happening fine our plans havent changed i admit the other side has had some successes harry salter disposed of a substantial outfit produced by the russian mafia a contract on ferguson and salter involving six ira operatives did no better two of them common street gangsters made a feeble attempt at ferguson and roper and now reside at the bottom of the thames awaiting police recovery drugged to the eyeballs they shot up half of wapping he sighed so now its all up to you good luck with your crossing im confident darcus will be helpful and dreq khan use him and his army of god sweepers and the brotherhood in london but remember this is not just a personal crusade concerning the rashids and the girl ferguson must be a target if possible and salter the others are not prime targets he cut off preventing any further discussion and hussein went back to the table khazid and saida had gone back to the boat i think your friend fancies her could be giving her a good shag now well get along to the boat and see if we can catch them you know when i said that if i thought about you at all i probably wouldnt like you well i dont hussein told him oh im a reasonable chap when i want to be ive offered the girl a free trip with you unless you object casting her ashore with no papers and no money they were moving along to the boat if she walks into the nearest police station they arrest her and deliver her to the welfare authorities shell be placed in a reasonable accommodation and given substantial payments to keep her going and its highly unlikely shell be sent back england s like that these days mosques in every city not fair old man try finding a church in mecca or medina and what about iraqi christians chased out of the country in their thousands hussein ignored him when do we leave romano glanced at his watch it was fivethirty i cant see much point in hanging around he had a halfbottle of some wine or other and poured it down i checked on the weather could be rain squalls and therell be fog in the morning they came to the seagull and paused a nice boat hussein said you can say that again thirtyfoot built by akerboom twin screws twentyfive knots automatic steering if you want it and ive got an inflatable with an outboard motor plenty of booze he laughed damn me i was forgetting about you and youll take the girl i suppose so peel island is our destination the dorset coast quite close to portland bill we anchor offshore i take you in using the inflatable ive got a sketch of your route inland theres a cottage by a marsh pond and its called folly way ive never met the guy and with a name like darcus i doubt id want to but enough conversation lets get on board which they did where the bloody hell are you he called to saida im in the galley getting supper ready henri is in the saloon henri my arse make the meal then leave it ready were going she came out of the galley and stood at the bottom of the companionway looking up does that include me yes though i dont know why i bother youve not changed your jeans im really going to have to take you in hand she ducked out of sight khazid brushed past her and came up to join them in the wheelhouse when do we go within half an hour might as well get started how far hussein asked about a couple of hundred miles he checked the instruments and said to hussein i set the course which i know like the back of my hand but i keep admiralty charts out for the whole channel crossing just in case of course you can also switch over to automatic steering he turned to hussein it would be useful if you could take the wheel for a while and spell me do you know much about boats no but im a qualified pilot so im an expert navigator can set a course read charts and so on yes well if you look at the admiralty chart ive marked our course to peel island thats it the red line is there a village there no the village has the name but its a good half a mile inland ive never been ive spoken to this darcus guy many times on the shiptoshore radio the broker got him one the other year when he started doing this as regular work i know his background he sounds like an old fruit to me anyway lets move it he pressed the starter the engine rumbled into life and he called to khazid to cast off which he did they eased away from their mooring and moved slowly out to sea the light beginning to fade as they slipped out of the harbor entrance he switched on the navigation lights and increased the speed wonderfula joy never fails he took the half bottle of brandy out of his reefer coat opened it onehanded with his teeth and took a deep swallow go below enjoy yourself come back later hussein descended below looked in on saida in the galley preparing the food and went into the saloon there was a cabin aft with two bunks and a small toilet and a cramped shower the cabin forward also had two bunks there was a center table and khazid was seated at it with a glass of wine as you can see im acting my role and rather enjoying it do you want one no thanks and not because im becoming pious religion seems to mean much less to me these days hussein told him thats strange no one has done more for the struggle than you but ive been fighting for my country for iraq not so much for islam saida could hear in the galley and without asking she brought him a coffee my parents died in the bombing in the gulf war i didnt like saddam but i didnt welcome invaders either its all a mystery to me hussein turned to saida what about you and religion she shook her head i dont know the serbs who killed my father and most of the men in my village were christian but hardly very good christians i think religious differences that lead to war are just an excuse to kill these days its so barbaric and cruel hussein sighed youve got a point i think ill have that glass of wine after all saida went to a cupboard got a bottle out without comment and filled a glass khazid held out his for a refill and they toasted each other what do we drink to khazid asked to us my friend for in war the only good to come out of it is comradeship he emptied the glass ill go up top and see how things are the boat plowed on the waves increasing somewhat and rain dripped off the stretched awning in the stern and the deck lights were switched on there you are romano said try the wheel he moved out of the way to make room for hussein then took the half bottle of brandy out of his pocket and had a huge swallow jersey to starboard just coming up the good old channel islands guernsey up there in the distance and beyond that alderney and north from there ending up with portland bill the english coast and our destination he swallowed again dammit the bottle is empty ill go and get another he went out and hussein felt the wheel kick with a sense of pleasure the windscreen wipers were on and the radio crackled and occasionally voices came through the static with weather details and sometimes ship movements he felt relaxed comfortable not really thinking of anything in particular and then the sea started becoming very lively waves bursting over the prow and it was exciting romano returned force fivecould make six he took out a fresh bottle and got it open youd better go down and get something to eat i grabbed a sandwich so hussein went below and found khazid and saida eating sandwiches made with unleavened bread and drinking tea he joined in suddenly discovering an appetite i think ill have another theyre good khazid took the flick knife from his pocket sprang the blade leaned over and spiked a sandwich very nice where did you get it hussein asked cutlery store by the marina i felt naked its been a long time since i had a gun in my pocket this makes me feel better ill go and spell him for a while he went up the companionway and a few minutes later romano slipped and fell down the last three or four steps hussein went to help him out and romano struggled and struck out at him thoroughly drunk hussein put his hands up in a placating way get away from me romano said and gave the girl a violent shove go and get me another drink he lurched down onto the bench seat hussein said no booze coffeelots of coffee he went up the companionway and found khazid wrestling with the wheel the boat plunging all over the place ill take over he said and did so just as there was a scream from below and she called out i cant take it anymore the boat was all over the place it was very dark with only white streaks of foam the deck wet and slippery as the girl emerged from the companionway romano behind reaching to grab her come onlets be having you nevernever again she said and tried to get away from him sliding on the wet deck to the stern and he slid after her that drunken laugh again and went straight into her knocking her over the rail in a strange way it was the most shocking thing khazid had ever known in spite of the violent life he had led one second she was there the next gone hussein switched off the engine at once and the boat rolled from side to side khazid managed to throw a life belt over but to what a small pool of light from the deck lights and only darkness beyond romano on his hands and knees shouted silly bitch khazid kicked him as hard as he could in the ribs you murdering bastard romano managed to get up scrambled for the companionway and khazid put a foot in his backside and romano slid down the steps ill turn the engine on again hussein called khazid what forshes gone he moved along the deck to the stern and hussein cried out and there was movement behind and he turned and there was romano swaying drunkenly an old revolver in his hand see this he fired narrowly missing khazid you stinking wog put your hands on me would you he stepped close in an instant khazids hand came out of his pocket the blade of the flick knife jumped and sheared up under romanos chin into the roof of his mouth how does that suit you he swung him round and pushed him over the rail the body was visible for a moment then gone at the same time hussein switched on the engine and the seagull surged forward it was its own world in the wheelhouse rain dashing against the windscreen foul weather indeed and so it had been for an hour since the madness that had cost two lives it was after midnight when khazid came up from the galley with an oldfashioned swinging can the wind howled as the door opened and closed again hanging on to the wheel hussein didnt even turn coffee khazid poured half a cup and hussein managed to grab it for long enough to get it down another i think so khazid poured then took one for himself good he said damn good i needed that you didnt reach for the scotch then yes that too i was in shock ive killed before as nobody knows better than you but not that way no need to feel guilty if you hadnt bought that knife in saintdenis youd have been over the rail yourself with a bullet in you the way he treated that girl was an affront to allah so what do we do why carry on dont worry as i told romano i may know nothing about boats but as an aircraft pilot i can navigate read charts and plot a course soundly enough to find portland bill and peel strand even in this weather ive already checked the weather reports on the radio it will moderate the closer we get there will be fog in the morning but well cope with that as it comes anything else do you want some sandwiches saida left a stockpile in the fridge ill have some when i come down which i will now because i must contact the broker you can take over here for a while they changed places and he went out the broker said for gods sake isnt it possible to control that boy what he did was totally justified hussein told him george romano was a foul man and the world is well rid of him so no apologies are necessary there was not only steel in his voice but a calm indifference that gave the broker pause for thought can you cope with the boat of course i can there will be considerable fog in the vicinity when we get to peel strand ill take advantage of the concealment it offers to sink the seagull is that necessary i would imagine someone informing the coast guard after a while if it was just left there at anchor we have a perfectly good inflatable with an outboard motor so well get inshore no problem have you any idea when youll be in about four oclock something like that dawn will be coming up romano had an admiralty chart of the area in the wheelhouse there is the strand some shingle beach indicated fading into saltings wellington lives in the old marsh wardens cottage good ill contact him tell him to meet you what will you say that there was an accident i think not ill say romano turned back close to shore because he was afraid of running aground in the fog and the inflatable he told me to say that he could keep it im sure darcus will be pleased it would seem the panic button has been of use so it would appear the broker said what about professor khan when can i contact him whenever you consider it appropriate its up to you hussein went back to the wheelhouse khazid seemed happy enough hands still firmly on the wheel how did it go hussein told him what the broker had said and filled him in on what he had been told earlier at the café in saintdenis so not only have the salters dealt with the russian mafia in london but these ira mercenaries have been stamped on six of them taken out this is beginning to sound like serious business khazid commented weve handled serious business before hussein smiled im going to go and lie on a bunk for an hour wake me he went below darcus wellington at folly way on peel strand came awake with an angry moan and scrabbled for the bedside telephone knocking over a halfempty cup of cold coffee he sat up in his tumbled bed and reached for the light who in the hell is it the answer galvanized him into action and he swung his legs to the floor an oldfashioned nightshirt riding over his knees your visitors are arriving soon the broker told him a rotten morning i think youll find it would be a nice thought if you took a walk down to the strand about fourthirty and extended the hand of welcome and remember these are special people with husseins face in all the papers they would be dont start moaning ill be in touch he clicked off and wellington sat there for a moment breathing deeply his head was bald his face sagged but over sixty years in show business had to stand for something he got up and drew the curtains although there were undeniable signs of early dawn the fog crouched at the window as if trying to get in at him dear god almighty he went into the bathroom turned on the shower stood looking at it and changed his mind and returned to the bedroom where he removed his nightshirt and dressed in a denim shirt brown corduroy trousers and buttoned up a sweater with a shawl collar his dressing table provided a plentiful supply of makeup and he sat down rubbing cream into his face a little rouge to his cheeks and lined his eyes it undeniably worked in a theatrical kind of way one had to admit that finally he picked up the auburn wig that curled discreetly and eased it over his bald pate satisfied he stood up and made his way out through a rather charming oldfashioned sitting room to the kitchen like the other rooms it had beamed ceilings but everything else was state of the art a kind of temple to a person who adored cooking he turned on the kettle humming to himself got a bowl of muesli milk from the fridge and ate without any obvious enjoyment and when the kettle boiled he made green tea and went and peered out for another look at the fog he checked his watch and saw it was just after four oh well he said softly i suppose id better make a move he went out to the hall procured a pair of rubber boots from the cloakroom and sat down to pull them on and reached for a heavy anorak with a hood and he left the fog swirled there was a drizzle of fine rain and there was the pond and the special smell you only got from saltings and he followed a track along a dike passing through a bleak landscape of siltedup sea creeks and mudflats climate change the difference in sea levels had each had its effect on what had been a rather special place even the birds seemed to be hiding from it he reached a very ancient decaying seawall of stone beach pilings beyond it the shingle dipping down disappearing into the fog and the noise of the approaching engine was loud helloover here he called hussein had taken advantage of the boats depth sounder as he took the seagull in a hundred feet seemed appropriate he switched off the engine pull the inflatable round from the stern untie her and get in what about you khazid said hussein was removing the engine hatch ill operate the sea cocks he disappeared into the cramped engine room found what he needed almost straightaway did what was necessary and scrambled out he joined khazid in the inflatable and drifted away with a push they continued drifting and sat there watching the boat settling in the water hussein found his cigarettes lit one and passed it to khazid then lit one for himself the sea was swirling across the seagulls deck the boat settled much more and then completely disappeared its supposed to be sad to see a ship of any kind sinking khazid said why would that be hussein pressed the starter button on the outboard and the engine kicked into life its like someone dying is that so a small wind curled across the water not much but enough to stir the fog there was a vague suggestion of land and then the sound of darcus wellington calling to them hussein throttled back the engine they drifted in wheres romano and the seagull darcus asked he didnt fancy his chances much in this fog hussein said its an absolute peasouper all over the bay and he started worrying about the boat in the end he decided we must come in the inflatable he said you could keep it did he now well thats nice of him ill walk along the beach about fifty yards theres whats left of an old stone jetty you can disembark without having to wade pull the thing ashore for me a matter of minutes and it was done the inflatable ashore and the two iraqis standing beside it darcus wellington thats me and youll be the hammer of god according to the newspapers whos your friend my name is henri duval khazid said darling darcus told him cheerfully if youre henri duval im prince charles they had started to climb to the dike and khazid said in his perfect french but i assure you mon ami i am who i say i am darcus was impressed well thats a showstopper i must say you can certainly speak the lingo the rain increased in a sudden rush come on hurry up or well all get soaked he started to jog and the fog was clearing now so that they could see the house before they got there he flung open the front door and led the way in folly way he said thats what they called it when bernard and i bought it he was my partner it was a sea marsh then creeks gurgling with water wonderful plants lots of bird life then a few years ago after bernard died i came back from touring and found it had altered changed a little bit more something to do with sea levels and silting up anyway welcome to the end of the world why do you call it that hussein asked because every time i go away and return i think its died just a little bit more but never mind that take off your coats and come in the kitchen and ill make you a nice breakfast chapter the breakfast was remarkable by any standards darcus poached haddocks scrambled eggs sliced onion found a packet of unleavened bread in his icebox and defrosted it there was yogurt and fruit in plenty and green tea cookings my passion ive worked as a chef in my day but i lost my temper with the staff too easily i expected too much he started to gather in the crockery and put it in the dishwasher ive been in show business all my life since i first saw a circus when i was thirteen theres nothing i havent tried cabaret theater film having a settled home to come back to was always a problem thats why bernard and i bought this place i mean it seemed a good idea at the time we were in summer cabaret at bournemouth thats a seaside town near here we went for a drive one sunday and came across this place a bloody sight different from what it is now i can tell you folly way just about sums it up he talked endlessly much of it amusing and yet there was a certain malice when he touched on people talent love he said to hussein is a curse its something your fellow actors can never forgive of course some things are beyond teaching take you youve got an enormous talent what for hussein asked for killing people i mean its not a very easy thing to do you do it remarkably well youre a true revolutionary dedicated to a cause che guevarathats who you most resemble a romantic hero with balls you even look like che with that beard hey thats good khazid said i mean i actually think there could be some truth in that he said to darcus there are kids in baghdad who are proud to wear tshirts with hammer of god on them but not his face love darcus was aghast i mean we couldnt have that one day khazid said when iraq is free again his face will be known to all men well he wouldnt be the first revolutionary to end up president of his country hey what about george washington exactly khazid said hussein uncomfortable with all this said lets get down to important matters what about the weaponry god knows ive got enough of that not that ive ever fired a gun in my life this way gentlemen he led the way to his study in the center of the house the paneled walls of yew were lined with scores of framed photos of the theater film and television my life in performance and what a performance i deserved an oscar but whats this got to do with weaponry hussein asked wellington smiled and kicked in the bottom of the end paneling producing a sharp click and a hidden door moved a couple of inches so you could get your hand in and open it he pulled it right back and stepped inside and switched on a light revealing guns and accessories of every kind behold my treasures hussein noted several walthers carswell silencers colts machine pistols such as the very latest model of uzi three aks a box of hand grenades and even semtex and a box of pencil fuses neatly numbered my god he said you really are going to war not me love like i told you ive never fired a gun in my life you two have a good look and work out what you want ill be in the kitchen doing my chores take your time walthers silencers colts in ankle holsters the usual khazid said tools of the assassins trade youre being dramatic hussein told him they do the job and in unfortunate circumstances theyre easy to get rid of the jobs ahead of us wont lend themselves to a sniper a grenade perhaps pointless no need for it its two individuals we want not passersby okay if i take an uzi with folding stock if it fits in my flight bag hussein exasperated said have it your way check the weapons here at the study table ammunition of course but you neednt overdo it we could always call on khan in london for more at holland park dillon was finishing an early breakfast when roper called him on the intercom and asked him to come up to the computer room what have you got dillon demanded my contact in the spanish secret service has been in touch a floatplane stolen in khufra has turned up dumped in majorca even more interesting his informant in the police at khufra tells of a citation jet the other night dropping two men and taking off again it seems there was some sort of shootout then they stole the floatplane husseins an expert pilot it has to be him but whos the other man he left baghdad with three men hamid and hassim whom you and billy shot and a man named khazid and before you ask let me put those security photos from kuwait up but theyre not good nothing on khazid have we got anything on this khazid at all husseins third cousin and another rashid a highly experienced foot soldier some sort of cousin to sara i suppose and something in common with her what would that be another halfandhalf his mother was french was got killed in the first gulf war with his father fleeing from kuwait on the highway of death in a car sowhat does it mean dillon said hang on theres more international airport at palma flights to all sorts of destinations the spanish have been rather clever the police checked around the cove where the floatplane came in and it was heard landing if you then calculate how long it would take to make the airport we could say about noon and for men desperate to get the hell out of there that narrows the time of departure which meant the spanish didnt have to painstakingly work their way through the tapes for hours well see for yourself roper brought it up on screen hussein walking through security pausing to take off his sunglasses briefly while his boarding ticket was being checked the man behind him was obviously khazid because they were talking but his face was halfturned away you have the plane it was one of those lowprice efforts crammed with tourists there were some empty seats for what was a return journey theyve gone to rennes in france a staging post to england absolutely brittany means the channel islands and once on jersey its british soil daily planes to britain and the south coast thats only conjecture mind you but id say hes on his way and we know what that means dillon sat there thinking about it right we pass the word round to everybody use all the press contacts to keep his photo going and the line that he could be in the uk yes but the reality is on that word could were at a dead stop here waiting for something to turn up the only thing thats going to turn up is hussein with khazid you know it and i know it and we know what the target is going to be the rashids in gulf road hampstead so what do you suggest its up to ferguson to decide that maybe have them here at the safe house dillon told him dr rashid wont like that it could be she hasnt got much choice in the matter youd better speak to ferguson by the time ferguson had arrived in the daimler roper had called in billy and greta igor levin and chomsky they all listened gravely as roper explained the situation when he was finished there were looks he added of course this is just a maybe situation we cant be sure of anything billy said only of one thing the bastards on his way i know that and i think everybody else here knows that the question is what do we do about it move the rashids from hampstead thats essential right out of town and away from everything while we hunt him down molly wont like that greta said through everything shes stuck to the idea that her work is of prime importance she wont want to leave it i think shell have to ferguson told her there was a silence then greta said one thing i still wonder about what exactly does hussein intend to kidnap the girl and take her back how would he do that levin asked exactly billy said maybe he wants to knock off caspar for his part in saving her which would still leave him with the sara problem roper said perhaps he doesnt know himself we dont need to go into his background you all know it the deaths in his extended family alone would be a sufficient cause for revenge to many people and its certainly enough to make him a driven man and one of the worlds most successful assassins levin put in there was another silence and it was billy a gangster and streetwise since his youth who said it might be a lot simpler than we think maybe hes just striking out hasnt thought it through god help us if thats what it is ferguson said if he doesnt know himself what chance do we have none dillon said and turned to ferguson what did you mean when you said the rashids should be moved from hampstead and away from everything we have a country house called zion house in west sussex and close to the coast and marshland it was donated to the ministry of defence in the second world war and used to train soe agents over the years its been used by the ministry for training purposes but at the moment its in a caretaker situation watched over by half a dozen uniformed security men all exmilitary police run by captain bosey dillon said this marshland what would be the situation there its owned by the national trust the bird life is unique curlew redshank and brant geese from siberia that sort of thing are birdwatchers a problem zion house has unique features highsecurity fencing on top of the wall and if you tried to get over that youd fry sounds a bit harsh warning signs everywhere security cameras we cant do more theres never been a problem with any attempts at unlawful entry in the twenty or more years that ive been responsible for it sounds good to me dillon said anything else theres a concrete airstrip there at the side of the marsh from soe days we could fly the rashids down from farley and any of you lot it would certainly clear the decks dillon said who would you send greta has good contacts with the family if levin and sergeant chomsky went with her for starters that would make it a russian affair there were nods all round sounds good to me dillon said lets get moving and sort it with the rashids you and greta come with me the rest stay roper in charge ferguson led the way out they sat in the sitting room at gulf road with caspar molly and sara and ferguson explained patiently what the situation was greta stood by the window so what is it youre trying to tell us molly rashid demanded that hussein is here in england we believe very strongly that hes on his way ferguson said hazar to algeria stealing the floatplane to majorca then rennes in brittany look at it on the map and it speaks for itself she sounded desperate hed be mad to come and what for sara stood up if youll excuse me ill go into the garden whatever you decide suits me zion house sounds fun this does concern you darling caspar said not really sara said calmly hussein wont do anything to harm me she went out and greta followed molly rashid started again i think you have to realize general were trying to live as normal a life as possible for saras sake dillon got up your decision ill just go out on the terrace for a smoke its up to you general sara was moving slowly around the garden across the road a sweeper in yellow had noted the arrival of ferguson s daimler and its occupants and managed a shot with a special camera donated by khan dillon lit a cigarette and approached sara and greta hello mr dillon what do you want sara asked im interested in what you said about hussein how can you be so certain hes a very violent man i suppose you mean all this hammer of god thing she shrugged in baghdad it was in the papers and on television but not with photos so i didnt know it was hussein he always looked after me made sure people treated me properly did he change then not really at the oasis at fuad in the empty quarter when ali ben levi the bandit manhandled me knocked me down hussein shot him how did you feel about that ben levi was a truly evil man he was whipping a priest for being a christian i told him that so was i thats when he treated me as he did dillon smiled bleakly in those circumstances id probably have shot him myself tell me ive no business asking you this but what about this muslim thing and being promised in marriage when youre of age thats nonsense she said i never took that seriously and i told hussein so and he accepted that he was told i could do no more dillon took a deep breath youre a truly remarkable young lady caspar came out onto the terrace and called come on sara its all decided were going to zion house flying down his wife appeared for a weekseven days only so come and pack the girl joined them and they went inside and she went upstairs ferguson appeared im going back to holland park you two stay while they pack ill send the people traveller to pick you all up and take the rashids to farley ill arrange for levin and chomsky to meet you there he went off and dillon said saras quite a girl what do you expect shes half bedouin greta told him come into the kitchen and well have a coffee in his shop near the corner of gulf road ali hassim was acting as middleman for professor khan overseeing a network of sweepers hospital porters cabdrivers and even young girls office personnel at the local hospitals the sweeper assigned to the rashid house phoned in theyve had visitors two of them were in the photos professor khan showed us the general and the man dillon there was also a woman the general left in a daimler car ive got pictures dillon and the woman are still there any sign of the family only the girl sara she was in the garden talking to dillon im going to send jamal on his motorcycle just in case they go somewhere hell be with you in minutes the sweeper waited and then the people traveller turned up paused at the electronic gates until they opened it moved inside and the sweeper caught a glimpse of the front door caspar rashid with two suitcases emerging his wife behind him then sara greta and dillon at that moment jamal arrived on his motorcycle rode down by the canal and into the trees whats happening he called theyre leaving it looks to me as if theyre all going i saw suitcases you must follow thats what im here for you fool jamal waited his engine turning over the gates opened and the people traveller emerged and turned right and he followed in traffic so heavy it was possible for him to get really close on more than one occasion so that he soon established who was inside at farley field he had to turn into the public car park as the van paused at the security entrance and was admitted but he watched its progress to the terminal building saw them get out and meet with levin and chomsky a sign at the gate said ministry of defence farley field restricted area but in the car park it amused him to see plane spotters probably any kind of security breach would have been classed as a violation of their human rights only the english he said to himself thats why we will win he took out a pair of zeiss glasses and spotted an old hawk although he didnt know it he did get a photo on the airfield dillon waited for the plane to take off then got back in the people traveller and told sergeant doyle to take him to holland park jamal waited until it had gone then mounted his motorcycle there was nothing he could do except return to ali hassim at the shop ali hauled him into the back room youre sure they have gone definitely the suitcases mean for some time and the airplane somewhere far away so no means of finding out the destination no way of getting in ive told you its a restricted area security guards everywhere you wouldnt even get through the gate ali was upset so we really have no idea where theyve gone only that they have gone i saw this with my own eyes and their house is empty tell professor khan that ali sighed he wont like it anyway go and make yourself a coffee in the kitchen while i give him the bad news and leave your camera so i can check the photo for the type of plane it didnt take long and he found it quite quickly in a handbook of small planes a hawk eightseater twin engines he started to go through a number of photos taken by the sweepers watching the comings and goings at the rashids house since their return not that there had been many the most interesting was the man who had turned out to be the archaeologist from hazar professor hal stone friends to the brotherhood academics at london university had confirmed his identity a fellow at corpus christi college in cambridge he had called at the house in gulf road in a taxi which had waited for him and taken him on to kings cross station jamal had followed him and watched him board a train for cambridge obviously returning to his work all in all not good news and he phoned khan and told him so hussein sat in front of the makeup table in darcus wellingtons bedroom naked to the waist the mirror was very bright with all those small bulbs around it and the profusion of makeup itself was something alien to hussein he found the smell of it distasteful khazid was sitting on a settle by the window smoking a cigarette hussein said open it then go and find something to do but i want to watch and i dont want you to go away khazid went reluctantly and darcus put a large towel around husseins shoulders the mark of a true actor love makeup is such a private affair not something to share knowing who you are thats the thing and who am i hussein asked himself hussein rashid or the hammer of god rain fell heavily outside the open window bringing the smell of rotting vegetation and darcus went and closed the window if you dont mind love it smells as if the whole worlds dying perhaps in some ways it is hussein said garish in his auburn wig darcus stood there arms folded chin on one hand and observed him the che guevara look was that a conscious decision on your part not that i know of hussein was beginning to feel uncomfortable a true romantic guevara he really looked the part in a way he gave people what they expected it was all in the look love was that what you tried to dogive the people what they expected where would this be leading its also a question of knowing what you are and still liking yourself most actors of course would rather be someone else i am what i am what i need from you is a new face frankly i have a suspicion that i can achieve that best by removing the mask thats already there hussein said if that means goodbye che guevara so be it and what else must go with that i dont know well have to see the corridor door slightly ajar khazid watched in a kind of horror as the man he had served for so long changed before his eyes darcus worked at the hair cutting thinning particularly shaping into an entirely different style and much much shorter then he lathered the entire face and took a cutthroat razor to it shortened the sideburns thinning the eyebrows and very carefully removing the fringe of beard and the mustache id like you in the bathroom now love dont be alarmed you just need a shampoo khazid dodged into the kitchen and darcus led the way afterward back at the mirror and using a hair dryer he shaped the hair more carefully took the scissors to it again then turned hussein in the swivel chair and did some more work on thinning the eyebrows and used a little dark pencil hussein sat staring at himself yet not himself god almighty you look so young darcus told him how old are you twentyfive and now you look it and thats the difference put your shirt on he scrabbled around in various drawers and finally found what he was looking for a pair of hornrimmed glasses not prescription but clear glass try these hussein did good it gives you a hint of the intellectual you could be a schoolteacher or something not the hammer of god see for yourself darcus opened a copy of the times with the original photo in it who could possibly recognize you as you look now from that even i dont hussein said slowly and walked through to the kitchen khazid was waiting for the kettle to boil standing there looking out at the rain he turned and his sense of shock was obvious merciful heaven where have you gone he shook his head im not sure its you anymore and maybe it isnt there was a strange smile on darcuss face who knows remember pandoras box what do you mean khazid said greek mythology hussein told him when the box was opened it released all sorts of unpleasant things khazid uneasy frowned slightly and darcus said ill make some coffee and ill phone dreq khan hussein said to khazid work out our next stop hampstead khazid asked it would seem obvious after all as no one knows we are here one should seize the moment if you say so but i think we need to talk and privately of course you can use the study darcus said but in the end it was outside on the porch the door open the rain pouring down is there a problem hussein asked hampstead sara her parents surely our primary task the most important to our cause is the assassination of general ferguson and this man salter if possible if we go to london with that in mind we could succeed because as you rightly point out the authorities have no idea that youre in england in light of this im in favor of us going to london but not of a visit to hampstead sara and her parents are a sideshow cousin what would you do shoot her parents i shouldnt imagine shed thank you dont be a fool hussein told him or break in the house kidnap her then how would you smuggle her out of the country professor khan the army of god the brotherhood they all would offer their services between us we would find a way do you honestly think the fate of this young girl is of the slightest importance to these people no but ferguson s head on a platter the british prime ministers most valued security adviser that would be a triumph much of what he said made sense but hussein was unable to let go ill phone khan now and see what the situation is then it will be my decision in answer to ali hassims call khan had gone round to the shop to discuss the latest development and it was there that he received the call that he had if truth be known been dreading for some time he put a hand over his coded mobile and whispered to ali hassim its him hussein rashid himself and hes in england allah be praised ali said khan returned to the phone where are you dorset peel strand with one of the brokers people a cottage called folly way khazid and i landed this morning we intend to come to london can this be wise your faces in so many newspapers thats been taken care of no one will recognize me trust me in this now tell me what the situation is with the rashids we monitored them closely my network of sweepers and informants even used a motorcycle unit so that cars which left their house in hampstead could be followed because of this i have the address of the enemys safe house in holland park we know where ferguson and dillon live which would obviously be of importance to you hussein cut in on him get to the point you appear to have some bad news for me spit it out so khan told him the worst hussein said theyve gone spirited away you dont know where and the circumstances indicate only security classified travel im afraid so you didnt mention the plane ali looked it upa hawk a good old workhorse of a plane i flew one in the badlands in algeria i think if theyd been venturing very far say crosschannel theyd have used more than that i would say the hawk indicates relatively local travel somewhere in the countryside a reasonable distance from london which would be impossible for us to discover khan said so ferguson and dillon visited the house in gulf road anyone else yes professor hal stone the archaeologist from hazar i wonder what he wanted i think he was saying goodbye one of my men jamal followed him to kings cross where he caught a train to cambridge hes a professor at corpus christi college there its now turned out hes ferguson s cousin is he indeed hes been involved in this affair intimately ill bet he possesses all the information we need you could be right i think i am ali hassimtell me about him khan did and when he was finished hussein said is he to be trusted completely few people actually know how important he is then ill have his address he may expect me at any time what is your intention ill visit this hal stone at cambridge university today bournemouth is close by to where i am well go by train to cambridge youd have to change in london is this wise my dear professor even i dont recognize myself ill be in touch he turned and found khazid watching him face troubled ill explain it all later when were on the train he said but i must speak to the broker he lit a cigarette after pressing the panic button and waited calm and in charge of himself again and the broker called him instantly very quickly hussein explained the situation and his intentions do you approve i must say i do i cant access the departures from farley like i used to be able to it has a special security system i can only wish you luck in cambridge are you sure of your safety in traveling is darcus that good yes is the short answer to that goodbye he brushed past khazid and found darcus in the kitchen we need to get to bournemouth i presume theres a reasonable train service from there yes excellent when would you be leaving as soon as you like not me love ive got prostate problems you wouldnt want to hear about our doctor only looks in twice a week thats up in peel strand village its only half a mile so i usually walk he looked at the time ten oclock and he doesnt arrive until after lunch so whats the alternative khazid asked you can take my car leave it in the car park at bournemouth station and leave the key in the glove compartment i cant say fairer than that i think youd have to change in london to get to cambridge though anyway its been great meeting you makes life so much more interesting and lucrative for you hussein said of course love we all need to earn a crust they were fully clothed flight bags in hand and on their way within fifteen minutes an old mini car awaited in the rain by the garage the keys in good luck darcus shouted and closed the door hussein got behind the wheel and khazid slipped off his wristwatch put it in his raincoat pocket and leaned down sorryi left my watch in the bathroom ill just be a minute darcus had told them as part of his goodbye chatter that theyd have to change trains in london for cambridge but the only mention of cambridge had been in husseins supposedly private conversations when he and khazid had been on the porch which meant darcus had been listening khazid stepped onto the porch opened his flight bag took out a walther and screwed on the carswell he also eased open the door to the hall aware of the voice whittering on my goodness charlie darling if you knew what ive been up to khazid whistled softly darcus turned oh my god he put the phone down khazid said naughty darcus very he shot him between the eyes and turned away he threw his flight bag in the back of the mini and got in putting on his watch okay hussein asked never better and they drove away the flight from farley had been placed in the hands of lacey and parry by ferguson s direct order for the obvious reasons that they knew everybody levin and chomsky needed introducing to the rashids and greta took care of that sara responded well to levin and chomsky but the one person who wasnt happy at all was molly rashid molly and caspar were sitting together in the two rear seats and had a conversation at first just a murmur but increasingly fraught where on earth is it getting us all molly asked its for our own good just a week until we see how things develop replied caspar ive my work to consider some of the most important of my life but the colleagues whove stepped in for you are firstclass people that isnt the point the bedford child for example absolutely groundbreaking stuff i should be hovering over her every day of the week and where am i it wont do caspar the bedford child has got good people hovering over her seeing to her every need like were doing with our child sara smiled solemnly at levin and raised her eyes then she turned kneeling on her seat and said is there any way you could treat this like a holiday in the country so that we can all get along together because thats what i intend to do she didnt wait for an answer just swiveled round and said tell me some more about the kremlin igor i think it sounds fascinating her parents embarrassed were reduced to silence and a moment later lacey said our short flight is coming to an end folks thats the sussex coastline over there the north sea youll notice quite extensive salt marshes theres a village of zion but zion house is three miles outside it and close to the marshes were going down now they descended and moved in at five hundred the house looked like everything it should be with gracious gardens and stone walls surrounding it some sort of wire running along the top there was a guardhouse at the gate the marsh was very near to the house huge reeds springing out of the water leading to a dike the landing strip on the other side of it is that what they call a grass runway she asked levin no its concrete have you done this before oh yes in the empty quarter we had to land in the sand at fuad there was an oil seal trouble in the port engine oil was spilling out and burning youve never seen such black smoke it was lucky hussein was doing the flying hes a wonderful pilot he let me do the navigating she leaned back as they touched down im really going to enjoy myself here and to that there was little that anyone could say they bumped down on the concrete runway there was no hangar just a wooden hut the man waiting for them wore a navy blue uniform and a clipped mustache his cap under his left arm all very regimental there was a van beside him as they approached he said captain rodger bosey i run things here youre all very welcome what about you chaps he asked the pilots were at general fergusons command lacey said and he wants a quick return things are a bit fraught so well take off straightaway see you all soon and he and parry got back in the hawk there were introductions then they all got in the van and watched the takeoff here we go then ill take you all up to the house and settle you in they turned along a dike and through a fringe of pine trees the great reeds of the marsh close trembling in the wind a little way off there was a group of people in anoraks sitting on a bank eating sandwiches birdwatchers bosey told them we get a few of those any problem levin said not really sometimes if some rare bird turns up the numbers increase theyre completely harmless from my point of view some do make a bit of a holiday out of it stay at a bedandbreakfast in zion village and theres a place that hires caravans harmless eccentrics in away why do you say that sara demanded well i remember one of them telling me in the pub that the rooks in the village came from saint petersburg in october the winter there for them being too cold starlings too why would that make them eccentric sara asked doesnt seem all that likely the russians ring birds too im sure they could do that in saint petersburg dont you think so igor sara asked ask greta she comes from saint petersburg yes they do ring rooks there and they do fly away to avoid the russian winter i learned this as a little girl well there you are then sara said and they pulled up at the gate a man in a similar uniform to bosey looked out then operated the electronic barrier which rose hello sara called cheerfully and he grinned and saluted wasnt that nice i feel like the queen now you run a good outfit captain bosey her mother muttered for goodness sake sara but bosey totally charmed flushed with pleasure although he couldnt think of a thing to say in a way it was rather like the old days in that kind of house for they were greeted on the wide steps by a middleaged lady whom bosey introduced as mrs bertha tetley the housekeeper who lived in as did her support staff kitty ida and vera if you follow me ill show you all your rooms luncheon will be served soon this way she took them through to the vast hall and led the way upstairs ill see you in a moment and well discuss things levin said to bosey who nodded when levin and chomsky went down they found bosey in the library he offered them a drink and they settled for vodka have you been here long levin asked ten years and not just for general ferguson but ive handled jobs for him on a number of occasions so ive come to know him well you were an army man military police an excellent recommendation what do you know about this business general ferguson told me all i need were providing refuge for the rashid family who are apparently under some terrorist threat a period of one week longer if needed i understand that you gentlemen and miss novikova are members of general fergusons security outfit and thats enough for me we have weaponry on the premises but dont usually carry it good man and its major novikova she outranks us all at that moment she came in just in time for a drink major levin said he winked at bosey who smiled and reached for the vodka bottle thank you captain she toasted them to a pleasant stay and all our troubles over there were voices on the stairs outside saras clear and then caspar and molly followed her into the library sara was in excellent spirits this is nice she said and ran to the window caspar looked hunted and his wife unhappy is lunch ready caspar asked theres something we have to get clear first levin said and this comes directly from general ferguson the house phones are only for use internally you cant call london if we communicate with the outside world it must be through captain bosey and his coded mobile system in the communications room the staff are not allowed personal mobiles on the premises what on earth are you talking about molly asked her husband said warily a call from a mobile phone can be very easily traced what nonsense its preposterous molly told him at the moment no one knows where you are greta said patiently wed prefer to leave it that way so i am not allowed to phone a hospital to check on my patients for gods sake caspar took a mobile phone from his pocket and slammed it down on the table its only for a week molly took a deep breath and seemed about to explode and then the breath went out of her she opened her handbag and took out not one but two phones if you must and saras of course sara said cheer up mummy were going to have a lovely time now lets eat it was after lunch that molly rashid went up to the bedroom and checked the luggage which included her doctors bag she opened it pulled her stethoscope out of the way and revealed the spare mobile and its charger she always kept in there in case of a hospital emergency at least she could still check on the progress of the bedford child but it could wait chapter hal stone had a mews cottage in chapel lane cambridge even though his position at corpus christi entitled him to rooms at the college the cottage was somewhere to hide from the incessant demands of students when he was writing a book it was a victorian cottage consisting of three bedrooms a study a kitchen and a lovely sitting room its oldfashioned french windows opening to a garden that was a great pride to him the garden surrounded by flint walls with a door that led to a back lane he was in the kitchen making tea when his phone rang he answered it declaring hal stone has gone away no he hasnt you daft bastard roper said youve just got back ah roper is that you youre not wanting me for anything active again after hazar i need a rest indiana jones im not dont worry old boy im just bringing you up to speed on whats happened just listen he went through everything husseins departure from hazar with khazid what had taken place in algeria the stolen floatplane to majorca the security film at palma the plane to rennes well i see where youre coming from it looks like a stagebystage progress to england where else could it be no point in bringing the french in because of that plane at rennes he would have been out of france to wherever long ago i still cant see it him coming to england it would be suicide i mean his face has been all over the place somebody somewhere would be bound to recognize him hes hardly had time for plastic surgery god knows its beyond me but at night alone in front of the computers and fighting my own personal pain with more whiskey i look at him on the screen and think hes on his way so what are you doing about it weve persuaded the rashids to vacate the hampstead house and fly down to the depths of west sussex for a week in a safe house zion house now that does sound interesting tell me more roper did everything including the report hed just had in from levin molly rashids a tough one likes her own way too much the business about her mobile all that fuss too damn much shes a truly fine surgeon and people like that are obsessive they think that what they do is more important than anything else unfortunately it often is anyway now you know the present score roper said to a great extent were in husseins hands and i think he wont come at all hal stone laughed after all hes a harvard man hed have more sense try telling them that at yale roper told him i wish you luck my friend take care so long hal stone shook his head crazy the whole business he returned to making his tea at that moment hussein and khazid having arrived without incident on the cambridge train were in a shop specializing in academic gowns college scarves and the like khazid under husseins orders purchased a short gown of the type favored by undergraduates but not a corpus christi scarf i expect the porters pride themselves on knowing their own students khazid went down the list and chose a new hall scarf and a dark beret and they left entrance to the college was no problem students passing in and out through the gates students everywhere or so it seemed they moved up a floor and khazid in his henri duval persona stopped a passing female undergraduate and inquired for professor stone in english heavily laced with french his beret helping establish his nationality she was obviously amused but waved toward the other end of the corridor down there but hes never in then where would he be mademoiselle dont ask me try the phone book she hurried away khazid shrugged and then they reached the end and found a wooden sign hanging on the door saying simply hal stone is not here today khazid tried the door but it was locked now what do we do the obvious hussein told him we do what the girl suggested and look in a phone book and what if hes not in youre a pessimist my friend hes a famous man at one of the great colleges a professor of the university of cambridge of course hell be in the phone book now lets find one at zion place caspar was exploring the garden with his daughter and found some of his cares slipping away the three russians sat on the terrace and watched that girl is really quite amazing greta said she can be a child and adore childish things at one minute and the next shes like a mature woman but then if you consider what shes been through levin said the death the destruction at such a young age chomsky said in chechnya one could see the same look a hundred times on the faces of children that on occasion i have seen on hers the face goes blank to conceal what lies inside god help her survive it all in herself i know ill do everything to help that i can greta said but the mother levin said is something else a brilliant surgeon greta nodded and said the same thing as hal stone an obsessive who is convinced that what she does is more important than anything else in her life good for her ego but lousy from a relationship point of view levin pointed out and upstairs molly rashid was proving him right to a certain extent locking herself in the bathroom and calling the particular hospital where shed operated on the bedford child on the direct mobile number of a dr harry samson who to a great extent had taken over for her she caught him on the ward itself a private one its me molly rashid she said how is she although the news was mixed and there was much to say finally he got personal how are you oh well i think we had a problem with sara but a rest in the country is doing good and ill be back in a week definitely but never mind that its lisa bedford im concerned about can i have the number in case i need to contact you were moving around a bit harry its not my phone no please dont go im really concerned about little lisa bedford you did a wonderful operation and ive got to give this my best shot it would be good for me to be able to check with you if things do take a turn for the worst and in the end she was trapped by both feelings and situation dammit harry when youve taken a call you can call me straight back on a mobile you know that i said it wasnt my phone but it is call me back anytime you want ill switch off the sound and leave it on vibration he was concerned look are you all right oh everythings in a mess she burst out im here with caspar and sara at this sort of country retreat in west sussex zion house instantly regretted but it was too late you mean some sort of clinic oh god i dont know what i mean goodbye harry zion house he murmured put down his mobile on the table and started doing his notes the nurse on duty was a young muslim woman named ayesha who had been ordered by ali hassim to swap shifts to get on the bedford case precisely because of the connection with molly rashid what was that you said doctor he looked up slightly abstracted it was dr rashid wanting to know how the child is getting on said she was somewhere called zion house in west sussex shell be away for a week her daughters had some problem or other the loudspeaker crackled calling him on an emergency and he ran out leaving his mobile she pressed the return call button and copied mollys number and went into an empty room since there was no other nurse there she was able to phone ali hassim on her own mobile when he answered she said dr rashid phoned up to check on the child she said she was in west sussex at somewhere called zion house ive also got her mobile phone number for you excellent girl you have done well i have only done my duty im sure you can find this place on the internet and she was right of course for ali immediately phoned for the assistance of a member of the brotherhood giving him the facts and telling him it was urgent an hour later the man appeared at the shop with his laptop and ali took him in the back room there are several mentions the marshland about the place is national trust the house itself is mentioned a number of times in an official history of the soe which used to train agents there during the second world war since then its been in the hands of the ministry of defence apparently there are various restriction orders in place there is also a concrete runway then ive found mention in general west sussex tourist guides zion village is three miles from the house with a medieval church called saint andrew two pubs several bedandbreakfasts a caravan site brilliant ali said no its really very simple these machines can do anything you want them to you should learn ill go now i must earn a living you know he left and ali sat there trying to think who he should call first they found the cottage in chapel lane easily enough there was another message on a board hanging from the front door students definitely not welcome a humorist khazid said i knew professors just like that its an academic thing however if he means it we dont get in thats a voice box on the door if you touch the button to call it usually puts you on screen look theres a camera up there so what do we do lets explore there was a narrow flagged path down one side of the cottage that turned in behind the back garden wall there was a stout wooden door that was locked and the top of the wall was crowned with ancient victorian spikes what do we do khazid asked try and climb over if hes there in the kitchen or sitting room hed be certain to see us and reach for the nearest phone hussein shook his head that notice probably means what it says there are times when he values his privacy on the other hand a young undergraduate in gown and scarf with a beret on his head and a very french accent seeking advice might interest him go and give it a try at the front door if it works take him prisoner dont harm him in any way and let me in through this door ill give it a try no make it a performance now go hal stone in the sitting room reading a rather indifferent thesis the french windows open to the garden heard the buzz of the entry phone with irritation he put the thesis to one side went into the hall and found khazid on the small screen who on earth are you i am henri duval of new hall college monsieur le professeur i am an archaeology student i seek your assistance well as a student at cambridge you must be able to read english and my notice board is on the door so clear off khazid excelled himself with a stream of very fluent french i beg you with all my heart my firstyear exams are coming up and i have to write a thesis i genuinely need your advice hal stone paused before replying in the same language whats your thesis subject khazid was feeling more into his role and returned to fractured english the influence of spartan mercenaries on the wars in persia hal stone laughed out loud thats a tall order but a glamorous one which i suppose is why you chose it all right ill give you twenty minutes the door clicked open and khazid stepped inside dropping his flight bag and trench coat to one side but still wearing the beret and short undergraduate gown he clutched the silenced walther in his right hand against his leg and opened the inner door into the hall hal stone was waiting a smile on his face which faded instantly as khazid covered him with the walther just do as youre told or ill shoot you in your left kneecap who the hell are you is this some kind of joke we have a debt to settle ive never seen you before in my life but ive seen you khazid was so absorbed hed virtually forgotten about hussein waiting at hazar i used to watch you on the deck of the sultan through zeiss glasses as i stood on the terrace at the great house at kafkar you and your people murdered two of my best friends dear god stone said youre not hussein so you must be the other one khazid he shook his head come for your revenge and i intend to have it khazid told him your world is a world of books professor but in mine one sword is worth ten thousand words so it teaches us in the koran to hell with your damned ideology what do you want with me we intended to call on sara and her parents at their house in hampstead but ferguson has had them spirited away we want to know where and you think i know youve been involved in the whole business since the beginning and youre fergusons cousin im sure you do actually i dont and even if i did i wouldnt oblige you be it on your own head get into the sitting room stone turned opened the door then swung it behind him and ran through the open french windows and made for the garden door khazid fired twice the first shot hit stone below the left shoulder driving him against the door he managed to reach for the large bolt at the top of the door and pull it to one side and khazid shot him again in the lower back hussein waiting impatiently pushed on the door sending stone staggering to fall flat on his face the body twitched and went still what in the hell are you playing at hussein demanded khazid said he tried to make a run for it whywhat did you say to him khazid calmer now was reduced to a certain dishonesty as regards the facts he said i was the other one he knew my name all i did was try to get the information about where the rashids have gone from him he said he had no idea and wouldnt tell me if he could and you threatened him what did you expect me to do pat him on the head i told him id start with his kneecap he slammed a door on me and made a run for it you should have waited for me hussein knelt on one knee hal stones face was turned slightly to one side he looked terrible blood seeping through his shirt hussein felt in the neck he shook his head hes dead are you certain another in the head perhaps i studied medicine fool how many times have you been glad of that in the past two years he stood leave him in place and lets get out of here he pushed khazid before him hurry i tell you straight to the railway station and back to london as you say brother khazid dumped his gown and scarf put on his trench coat again and followed hussein as they left the cottage walked up to the main road and turned to the railway station they got there with fifteen minutes to spare just in time to use their return tickets to board once the train was moving khazid lay back in the seat exhausted now what give me time to think about it hussein turned to stare out the window wondering what was happening his lie to khazid the still beating pulse in hal stones neck that his fingers had felt why had he done that there was no answer and for hal stone life or death was a matter for allah ali hassim had been impressed when khan told him hussein would be in touch with him for any help or aid that ali could offer for him hussein was the great warrior the hammer of god a liberator for the people from allah himself he remembered his shock on first hearing husseins voice on the radio news program from the middle east and then in the middle of his arabic rhetoric hussein describing himself in a simple english phrase hammer of god it was a gesture of contempt for his enemies but that name was now known to millions of arabs in the middle east who were not familiar with the english language at all so thinking over his problem about who to first tell about zion house he realized that he had found a new and worthier allegiance but he needed to make everything perfect so he called in another member of the brotherhood a young accountant in a financial firm in the city a short chat over the phone the suggestion that he could be of great service to the brotherhood produced the man he wanted within an hour and he also sent for his laptop expert and waited sam bolton was actually selim bolton his father english his mother muslim he had been raised in an english culture until his first year at london university studying business and accountancy and then his father had died of cancer an immediate consequence of this was that his mother was restored to islam there were those in the brotherhood who saw great possibilities in individuals with a similar background to his and he joined their ranks as a sleeper a handsome young man in a good suit and a university tie accepted anywhere he turned up at the shop and discovered ali waiting with the laptop expert ali said listen carefully while our brother explains and the laptop man told him everything regarding zion house bolton took it all in finally he said so what you really want to know is the feel of things generally the attitudes of the villagers perhaps to zion house itself exactly whats special about it i think you mean what its purpose is if any he stood up i might as well get on with it i called in at the flat so ive got an overnight bag in the audi so you accept this assignment of course you could not do our cause a greater service ill be in touch the laptop man left and ali nodded to himself he was doing the right thing no phone call to khan he had set things in motion and could afford to wait to hear from hussein hal stones cleaning lady a widow named amy robinson usually only worked mornings but she had her own key and his laundry to deliver so she called in at the cottage and discovered him in the garden she had once been a nurse and was still expert enough to establish that he was alive it was roughly an hour and a half since hussein and khazid had left she dialed and called for ambulance and police stipulating gunshot wounds then she went out with a rug and pillows and tried to make him comfortable she was kneeling beside him stroking his hair when his eyes opened he looked at her bewildered amy dont fuss love lie still theres an ambulance on its way who did this to you my cousin general fergusonyou met him when he visited the other year my address books on the desk his private mobile number call him for me dont upset yourself love im sure hell be contacted in time you dont understand he clutched at her with a bloodstained hand tell him they were here both of them they were here in england the other one shot me he closed his eyes and opened them i didnt mention zion he lost consciousness again and there was a sudden confusion outside as the ambulance arrived she went to the front door and admitted the paramedics who followed her as she showed what waited in the garden and then of course the police came first one car then two she waited bewildered by it all and then a man in civilian clothes arrived who she was told was a chief inspector harper he had a quick look round the cottage and went outside to the wall when he returned a police sergeant was taking a written statement from amy he did say something strange when he came to for a moment she told him what it was harper coming in through the french windows heard did you say general ferguson yes professor stones cousin hes very important in one of the ministries you can say that again if its who i think it is the professor said the generals personal number was in his address book on the desk harper rushed to find it and so it was that ferguson who had just arrived at the holland park safe house to discuss progress heard the dreadful news the train was just twenty minutes out of kings cross when ali received the call from hussein were just arriving from cambridge a waste of time well come round to your shop well need somewhere to stay ive been waiting to hear from you i have discovered where they have taken the rashids but where does such information come from khan i suppose and presumably he would have got it from the broker no neither khan nor the broker know about it it was the action of the rashid woman the doctor which came to our aid she was concerned for the welfare of a child she had operated on and telephoned the surgeon who has taken over the case he wanted to be able to get in touch with her if there was a change in the childs condition one of the nurses a member of my network was on duty and obtained the address for us this is truly unbelievable they are still in england then west sussex a place called zion house not only can i show it to you on a laptop when you get here ive also sent a trusted agent straight down there to scout the place out for you ive impressed on him the urgency of his report it is hard to imagine that ferguson let them make phone calls she probably broke the rules ali said and must pay the price it would suit me very well for the enemy not to know that we are here if you mention your discovery of zion house to dreq khan he will in turn inform the broker and that one you distrust he has had his uses but he has his fingers in too many pies you must not take this as an attack on osama bin laden whom allah protect because on the ground he represents osama in certain matters in those affairs he is simply serving a great mans needs and he must remember his place sometimes such men see themselves as being more important than they are professor khan for example it is difficult for some people to remember that the cause they represent is more important than themselves hussein said ali said calmly khan will not be told of zion from me i look forward to receiving you we shall be seeing you soon hussein told him he turned off his phone khazid said what was all that about brother allah is on our side ali hassim has discovered where the rashids have been taken he proceeded to tell khazid as much as he needed to know perfect khazid said with the professor dead no one in fergusons organization even knows we are here of course hussein said a faint shadow on his face as that wavering pulse came back to haunt him he took a deep breath nothing can go wrong now a few moments later the train arrived at kings cross at holland park ferguson was speaking to harper again chief inspector im invoking the terrorism act to put a blanket on this for the moment some very nasty people are involved we are dealing with terrorists here sir i have a special warrant from downing street on this one i also have an official request to your chief constable that you act as my liaison there harpers spirits lifted very good of you sir happy to be on board ive borrowed a police helicopter from the met thanks to the commissioner theyre lifting me from a school football field just down the road from here stones hanging on by inches general thats what the surgeon in charge informs me the scans show two bullets one under the left shoulder thats apparently fragmented much of the shoulder blade and theres a major artery close by that will give a problem and the other low in the back its done a lot of damage to the pelvic girdle what im telling you is what the scans show i expect the major surgery will reveal much more thanks very much ill see you soon roper said what a bastard dillon and billy looked grim billy said what did he say to the cleaning lady he said to tell me they were here both of them they were here in england the other one shot me i didnt tell them about zion it was them all right dillon said has to be and the other one the bastard who shot him in the back was this khazid guy billy was angry i think thats obvious ferguson said and there was the chatter of the helicopter passing overhead to the football field sean he said to dillon hal is the closest relative i have left would you come with me it was a direct appeal that couldnt be refused of course i will good luck roper called as they went out the door the noise of the helicopter was with them for about ten minutes and then the aircraft lifted and moved away roper reached for the scotch billy said knock it off at a time like this a man needs friends to drink with thats the best idea youve had for some time roper started his wheelchair and billy followed him out on his way to zion sam bolton had stopped in guildford and visited the army and navy store where he purchased an anorak a jumper a waterproof bush hat and trousers to go with it and some boots he then cast around for a pair of binoculars and found something suitable in a camera shop he also purchased a canvas carrying bag from a nearby store then went into a convenient hotel and found the gentlemens toilets he changed clothes in one of the cubicles putting his smart suit tie and shoes into the bag when he emerged he was wearing everything else he had bought and hung the binoculars around his neck nothing like looking the part he said softly examining himself in the mirror but what do you really know about birds except the female variety he returned to the audi drove around looking and found a bookshop within minutes he was emerging with a suitable item covering the coastal areas of england it was a magazine type of book with an illustrated cover good to carry under your arm to let the uninformed know what you were pleased with himself he got back in the audi and continued his drive toward the coast and zion he arrived at zion in the middle of the afternoon put the audis top down and had a look round what he saw was a typical english village one pub called the ploughman and another down the street named the zion arms old cottages a church he parked the audi and went into the zion arms everything you expected from an english country pub was there from logs burning on the hearth of a stone fireplace to the beamed ceiling the mahogany bar the mirrored shelves and the stout latemiddleaged lady behind it with rosy cheeks and wearing a floral dress it seemed too good to be true there werent many people a party of three a young couple talking in low voices a very ancientlooking man on the wooden settle by the fire alone a halfempty pint of beer in front of him selim bolton he might be but it was sam bolton who approached the bar in previous adventures for the brotherhood he had seldom used an alias he was himself a university graduate and a middleranking executive in a private bank in the city of london anyone who wished to query him even the police would discover that quickly enough and look elsewhere he even had a company card with sam bolton engraved on it outside the village he had pulled into a layby and looked up zion in the bird book he had an extremely good memory noted zion marsh the fact that it was national trust and a brief mention that the house was not open to the public ah youd be staying here for the birdwatching she said as he placed the book on the counter plenty of people come here for that hed concocted his story in advance i work in london in finance sometimes you feel trapped you just want to get away for a few days ive got friends further along the coast aldwick bay the other side of bognor regis lovely shingle beaches up there im making my way back to london taking my time and i noticed in the book that zion marshes are a bit special people seem to think so what will you have a pint please the old man by the fire emptied his glass and spoke up i was eightyseven last month and ive lived here all my days mainly working the land farming when i was a lad birds were just birds part of life you took for granted now we have the birdwatchers like you people who take it seriously last year we had people turn up in coaches to try and catch sight of some lapwing in the marsh supposed to be special god knows why i see your point i dont take it seriously i work hard in an office most of the time i like to get out in the fresh air but i like to have a reason so ive started on birds could i buy you a drink i see youve run dry a pint wouldnt be a burden that all right with you annie shame on you seth harker youre an old cadger she pulled the pint and bolton paid her and took the glasses overall right if i join you why not good health bolton drank some of his beer do they cause a problem birdwatchers on this zion marsh national trust that no theyre a harmless lot and its good for the economy these days any kind of tourist is welcome creates jobs for people theres the caravan site bedandbreakfasts all from birds harker chuckled thats a fact when you think about it i passed a stately home when i was approaching the village i checked in my book and it said visitors werent allowed zion house it was oh you cant go there owned by the government and has been as long as i can remember i wasnt allowed to go into the military in the second world war farming you see reserved occupation so i was here right through he nodded his head all sorts of dodgy things went on at zion house planes in and out from the runway a lot of it at night all highly secret is that so seth harker nodded the thing is the ministry of defence still runs it like that high security guards in blue uniforms jobs for the villagers oh no the guards are all outsiders the housekeeper mrs tetley lives in and shes got three young women on staff who help with the catering and other duties looking after guests really kitty ida and vera nice girls but not from around here they keep themselves to themselves you said guests that could mean some kind of hotel where the guests never show themselves harker cackled and dont visit in the village yes but you must see them arrive they must visit the pub the bar had emptied and annie was in the back seth harker was reasonably drunk by now ah but they always come in by airplane theres a concrete runway by the house that was the way it was in the big war and still the way it is today his glass was empty and he looked at boltons youre not drinking well you know how it is ive got the car the driving to think of if i carry on back to london you know what the police are like these days pity to waste it bolton pushed it across and the old man drank deeply my cottage is on a small rise overlooking things fern end its called you get a good view of the runway from there ive watched people come and go for years ive got a pair of old binoculars there was a plane in at round about halfeleven this morning it dropped off two women and a girl and three men they were picked up by captain bosey head of security and taken up to the house he patted the side of his nose with a finger not much i dont know i think i could do with the necessary he took boltons arm to stand and was surprisingly steady as he crossed the bar and went into the lavatory annie came in from the back has he been a nuisance certainly not hes a real character is he fit to get home he told me about his cottage oh hell be fine if he wants a snooze he can use the room in the back when he does that some villager will give him a lift can i get you anything else ill be fine actually ill be off i think well if you decide to stay we do have four rooms for the night and theres always the caravan site i own that as well she went into the back again and seth harker returned ah going are you he eased himself down i must harker really did have drink taken what we were talking about security all balls really theres always a way take zion house walls electric wiring cameras all for nothing if you could go under what on earth do you mean in during the war there was only a grass runway and small planes used it on a nightly basis for flights to france bad weather of any kind rain flooding from the marsh sometimes made it unusable so they dug a tunnel that started in the wood continued it under the wall into the garden what was the idea a network of clay piping under the grass from the runway that would drain into the tunnel by putting the other end in the garden they had the idea of linking it up with ordinary drains from the house who told you about this raf lads based at zion house and they also had some royal engineers it was done on the quiet and then some raf group captain inspected it and said it was a lousy idea and ordered them to just concrete the runway so planes could land even if it had water on it and the tunnel and drainpipes they ordered a stop to that work blocked off the end in the wood with a big manhole cover and used grass turfs to cover it its a creepy sort of place theres a granite pillar there with some lettering that doesnt make sense rubbed away with time did you ever take a look harker smiled course i did over fifty years ago a bit after the war it was there all right iron rungs to help you down and you had to paddle in water then god knows what it would be like now and the garden end there was another manhole cover there too which i couldnt budge so what they covered it with ive no idea i never went down there again but i always thought it a bit of a laugh over the years with all their security improvements and nobody knew about it it was the war you see top secret stamped on everything who on earth cared when it was done and who on earth would care after so many years any mention of it was lost in raf files years ago yes i can see that bolton got up again and held out his hand you are a fascinating man seth and what would your name be boy boltonsam bolton there was a kind of knowing look on harkers face a touch of cunning i hope you got what you came for i met you didnt i he went out and behind him annie came in with a long tray of glasses and put them on the bar hes gone has he what a nice young man a good listener seth said ill have another pint bolton followed the road past zion house noting the electronic gates at the entrance and saw a uniformed security guard outside his hut smoking a cigarette he carried on past came to a large signboard saying zion marshes and wildfowl protection area national trust beyond it was the car park the wood parallel to the wall of the house at that point and stretching toward the marsh and the runway late in the afternoon of a gloomy day the car park was empty and it started to rain but that suited him he hurriedly raised the roof of the audi opened the back found the tool kit and pulled out the steel tire lever the rain increased as he walked along the edge of the wood paused to look at the concrete runway at that point you could see over the wall onto the garden the terrace at the back of the house with binoculars of course through the electric fencing with the warning notices telling the public to keep out he turned and walked into the wood at what seemed to be the point the old man had meant and it was there the granite stone just as he had been told slightly tilted to one side the grass was long all around he started prodding into it with the tire lever bending over moving backward reaching to the left and then the right persevering as the rain increased and then it came the clang of metal on metal he knelt there in the pouring rain secure in his waterproof clothes and hacked away at the grass and soil beneath holding the tire lever in both hands and gradually a patch tore away he scrabbled with his hands and there it was a portion of a castiron manhole cover he managed to reach a part of the circular edge forced the tire lever in hoping to lift it it was hopeless it needed the right tools but that wasnt his problem he looked around him a crowded thicket of bushes and undergrowth pushed in and the trees were close it was certainly private enough he went back through the rain immensely cheered by the way things had turned out and his extraordinary good fortune in meeting seth harker he got in the audi and called ali hassim on his mobile there was an instant answer for ali was entertaining hussein and khazid in the back room of the shop where are you zion of course im coming back ill see you in about three hours but why arent you staying overnight because ive finished the task youve given me zion house has a purpose i believe it to be a highsecurity safe house people only arrive by plane they have their own personal runway they received a plane at eleventhirty this morning with two women passengers a young girl and three men i havent the slightest idea who they are but i suspect you do this is incredible ali told him no but the fact that in spite of all their security ive found a way inthats incredible if that is so truly allah is on our side i thought youd say that bolton drove away fast at the shop ali turned to face hussein and khazid and told them everything chapter at the dark man harry and billy sat in their usual booth roper beside him in his wheelchair joe baxter and sam hall leaning against the wall and talking in low voices sergeant doyle who had brought roper down in the people traveller was sitting in it outside reading a book as usual they all looked troubled harry had just swallowed a large scotch and called to ruby who was tending the bar with mary otoole well have another love me and the major all right harry she poured the drinks ive not seen this before the black rage he frightens me in a way did he know this professor stone well according to billy they worked quite closely with him when the outfit had some sort of bad time in hazar two or three years ago ruby whats keeping you mary picked up the tray ill take it for you harry accepted it in silence staring into space his face like a frozen mask ferguson had phoned billy and told him that the surgeon a professor vaughan at the hospital in cambridge unhappy with hal stones condition was holding back on the operation billy shook his head in a kind of controlled fury i wonder where those bastards are now roper swallowed his scotch well only they would know that harry seemed to come alive yes but they must have some plan i mean this hussein is a clever bugger he wouldnt do anything without backup youre right roper said he wouldnt have dared come to england without knowing there were extremist organizations who would back him to the hilt well we all know that harry said fanatics who get away with preaching terror everywhere from television to the london streets billy said yeah but theres their human rights to consider we know what they are but cant do anything about it well i bloody well can harry turned to roper this guy with the funny name professor dreq khan and his army of god thing hes untouchable covers his back constantly bloody disgraceful harry said its likely greta speaks arabic roper said so she heard enough of the conversation at the hospital to know those two men at caspars house were under orders from khan to get up to no good after things went sour he did a quick flit to brussels in his role as chairman of a committee involved with racial harmony hes just come back then why hasnt he been nicked harry demanded his work with the un gives him diplomatic immunity we know hes guilty as sin but proving it legally is another thing even if ferguson descended it would be laughed out of court and with khans un status hed probably be allowed to do a runner anyway roper told him well im not happy about that and i think id like to discuss it with him i presume youve got an address the army of god is a registered organization roper told him its in the phone book i was thinking of something a little more private than that roper smiled i should say are you sure you want to do this but you know what harry khan is a very bad man like you ive had enough he called holland park gave khans name into the automated connection in his computer a recorded voice gave him an answer in seconds huntley street apartments he said harry started to move and billy stood up this is my gig harry the boys and i will get him youve got to think of your position billy as a member of her majestys secret intelligence services harry i dont give a toss im as pissed off as you two he turned to hall and baxter are you available too bloody true we are baxter told him harry said okay ill see you on the linda jones and you major i think youve got things to attend to at holland park you mean im not up to it i just dont want you involved hes right billy said come on boys baxter and hall followed him out to the alfa romeo parked by the people traveller major ropers coming out billy called to doyle behind the wheel with his book and piled into the alfa with baxter and hall and was away roper emerged in the wheelchair harry following and the rear door of the people traveller came down as the lift descended at doyles touch harry put a hand on ropers shoulder ill be in touch try not to kill him roper said sometimes ive had enough of that too its been a hell of a life harry i know old son ill try and oblige you the lift took roper up and inside doyle drove away ruby appeared everything all right harry just going down to the linda love ive got a bit of business to handle phone calls to make i dont want to be disturbed okay just as you say harry she went back inside and he walked slowly along the wharf khan was at the desk of his study working over some papers when the buzzer sounded from the entry phone in the hall billy had given the matter some thought on the way that khan was involved in the whole affair was obvious which meant he might have seen photos of the salters and dillon so it was baxter who held up billys warrant card when he pressed the buzzer khan looked at him on the entry screen yes professor khan sergeant jones cid paddington green young muslim lady was assaulted a patrol car has brought her in but her english isnt too good she mentioned your name im really asking for assistance here im always happy to help the police khan pressed the button took a few steps to the door which burst open baxter moved fast and punched him in the stomach billy and hall crowded in behind an overcoat was taken down from a hall stand his arms thrust into it a dark trilby hat rammed on his head baxter and hall walked him out to the alfa sat him between them in the back and billy drove away harry was sitting in the stern of the linda jones under an awning light spilling out from the deck lamp into the gathering darkness a glass of scotch in his hand and baxter and hall held khan in front of him billy leaned against the rail watching khan had recovered himself but he did recognize salter and was genuinely terrified yet he tried bluster whats going on here im harry salter you are dreq khan im going to ask you some questions and if you dont answer me ill kill you and well throw you in the river khan felt the bottom fall out of his stomach what is it you want hussein rashid and his chum khazid we know they were on their way to england id like your confirmation that theyve arrived what nonsense is this dont mess me around a good friend of mine in cambridge professor hal stone just back from hazar after helping dillon and my billy here to bring sara rashid home was shot twice today in his garden and left for dead we figure it must have been hussein and khazid what do you think ive no idea what you are talking about khan said desperately hes wasting our time billy try the hoist baxter and hall pulled off khans overcoat and jacket forced him down and billy reached for the hemp line suspended from the hoist and looped it round the ankles baxter and hall heaved on the rope and pulled khan up head down simple question billy said in his ear are they in england and have you heard from them they swung him over and dropped him in the thames he went under crying out as his hands were untied he managed to move his arms about when he stopped struggling harry nodded and they pulled him up he floundered on the deck coughing and spluttering and there was nothing left in him harry said let me make it quite clear if we have to put you over again we leave the river to take you away no for pitys sake khan sat up reaching for a rail they are here i had nothing to do with it it was handled by the broker osamas man and dont ask for his phone number he contacts you when he wants you never contact him because you cant hussein and khazid came in a boat by night from france to england his phone call was a total surprise to me hussein said he was at a cottage called folly way at peel strand in dorset he didnt mention the name of the person he was staying with i swear it go on i tell you the truth when i admit that the army of god has a network of spies who are just small people i had the rashids house watched and one of my men reported they had left the house he followed them to farley field where they flew away to an unknown destination was hussein angry when you told him that yes he said we had to find out where the rashid family had been taken i told him that was an impossibility for us and then what khan lied desperately he said there was one person he could visit because the broker had mentioned that professor stone who had been part of the whole affair in hazar was fergusons cousin hussein said they would pay him a visit in cambridge there was a pause while harry considered the matter billy said bleeding liar harry shook his head the fact that hussein has no idea where the rashids are must be true otherwise why bother to go to cambridge his assumption that hal stone would know something makes sense he got up went into the salon and poured scotch billy followed and closed the door so you believe the bastard harry said remember what hal said that they were here both of them the other one shot me and i didnt tell them about zion thats right billy said ferguson admitted hed told stone about zion the reason they tracked stone down was because they had no idea the rashids had gone they must have told him that was the purpose of the visit his saying he hadnt told them about zion confirms theyve still no idea where the rashids are and stone probably made a run for it and got the two bullets in the back billy said so what about this asshole outside do we finish him harry opened the door and stepped out baxter and hall had seated khan in a chair he looked as if hed come to the end of his tether whats your idea on where hussein would be now i dont know khan said wearilyhes a crazy man with his photo all over the newspapers it was his madness coming to england in the first place thats the strangest part of the whole deal billy said he should have been lifted within hours of arrival and khan suddenly remembered the phone conversation with hussein and came out with the one special piece of information when he was talking to me from peel strand and mentioned going to cambridge i told him that hed have to change trains in london and wasnt that unwise because his face was in so many papers and what did he say harry demanded that it had been taken care of and that no one would recognize him he said trust me in this nothing more billy said rubbish he couldnt have had time for plastic surgery well as he hasnt been lifted something must have happened to him harry turned to khan mr baxter and mr hall are going to take you home where youll get a change of clothes money credit cards passportwhatever they will then escort you to heathrow and see you leave on the first available plane khan was stupefied you mean youre not going to kill me not now but if you ever return to england ill know and youll be dead inside a week get him out of here boys khan was for the moment stunned they got his jacket and overcoat on and marched him along the wharf and it was then that he found he was experiencing the greatest feeling of relief in his life there was also a certain satisfaction in the fact that by crediting the broker for guiding hussein to hal stone at cambridge hed been able to let ali hassim off the hook back on the boat billy said have you turned into a big softy or something roper asked me to go easy on him anyway weve managed to establish without doubt that hussein has no idea where the rashids are so lets go and see roper roper listened to what they had to say harry said you think i did the right thing will he stay away the question is will the people in the larger world hes been involved with allow him to weve known for a long time about the alqaeda influence on the army of god what osama will think of a man whos done a runner is anyones guess the broker wont be too happy either these important men in the world of terror obviously dont like any indication that things are falling apart i dont give a toss about osama and his people harry said weve got to stand up and be counted i agree but alqaeda leaders in iraq would dearly love to have another spectacular in britain big ben would be good or buckingham palace the possibilities are endless that would really be out of order harry said billy put in theyd be happy if the queen was at home when they did it bastards harry said i could show you intelligence reports indicating that at least a couple of hundred britons have served in alqaedas foreign legion in iraq these are the things the public doesnt know about and its not just regular bombs theyd like to set off but dirty bombs several plots involving such weapons in the uk have already been foiled roper noted were at war and thats the fact of it there was a pause and billy said which leaves us with hussein what are his intentions hes never been a bomb man roper said my bet is assassination you mean on the level of the prime minister or someone at that level harry asked lets look at it this way his intentions regarding the rashids have been thwarted at least for now so hes got to find something to do and hes changed his appearance in some waykhan told us that it was worth dumping khan in the thames to learn it his phone went it was ferguson and roper put it on speaker how are things hes out of surgery professor vaughan says it was bad and it will take time but hes going to weather the storm harry and billy cheered and roper said have you managed to speak to him just a few sentences apparently it was khazid who held him at gunpoint and wanted to know where the rashids were hal refused to say made a run for it to the door in the garden khazid shot him in the back as he pulled the bolt he lost it then was vaguely aware of another person rushing through but didnt see him a pity roper told him harry put the screws on khan earlier this evening rather interesting he told of harrys exploit with khan and the results ferguson said christ almighty so we no longer know what the bastard looks like or his intentions or where he is now the only thing we can be certain of is that he doesnt know where the rashids are roper said and thank god for it we do know one thing roper told him when he made that original phone call to khan he said he and khazid had landed by boat and were with one of the brokers people at peel strand in dorset a cottage called folly way right ill contact the chief constable of the dorset constabulary now anything else the rashids at zion they need to be informed of the attempt on hal stones life it will frighten molly rashid to death they cant be reached thats the important thing so we can leave it for the moment and the others ill speak to levin i think he chomsky and greta deserve to know well make a decision later on whether i should fly down tomorrow id prefer to tell the rashids personally dillon and i will leave in the helicopter in thirty minutes see you soon in the back room of the shop hussein and khazid sat at the dining table with bolton and went over the details again and again theyd also had a cd prepared for them by the laptop man covering every possible aspect of the village and the house even a list of useful bird names khazid had found that amusing the most intelligent birds are crows they can communicate with each other and count does that establish my credentials bolton said just be yourself as i did and look the part he turned to ali ill go now and purchase the same garments boots and so on that i used what about a vehicle taken care of by a member of the brotherhood in the motor trade its a caravanette with a bunk on either side in the rear and cooking facilities a family sort of thing popular with campers he will also supply some tools that with luck should meet all our requirements it will be delivered to us in a little while as bolton stood up hussein said one thing i must ask you mentioned from the edge of the wood being able to look over the wall into the garden itself and the rear of the house a terrace and so on did you see anyone no the weather was poor heavy rain and my binoculars were nothing special hussein looked at ali may he remedy that and find me a pair of exceptional zeiss glasses with top magnification of course ali said and nodded to bolton you know who to call ill take care of it bolton glanced at hussein a privilege to serve he went out and hussein said a good man one of the best can i do anything else at the moment i think not if khan phones simply say i havent been in touch with you and you have no idea where i am whatever you say ill deal with the broker as you wish he got up to go and there was a knock on the door he opened it and the girl assistant passed him the evening standard the stop press had a brief report that the police were pursuing inquiries into the shooting of cambridge professor hal stone who was doing as well as could be expected after successful surgery perhaps you should read this he put it on the table without a word and went out khazid read it first and exploded you said there was no pulse you should have let me finish him things happen hussein told him sooner or later hell be able to talk so what he cant report on my new persona because he didnt see me which is one good thing another is that ferguson has no idea we know about zion this will work cousin i feel it our astonishing good luck with selim bolton finding a way in for example can only be looked upon as the will of allah himself be practical cousin we dont even know if our simple tools will move that manhole we dont know whats down there if we can remove it and what about the other end it could be under six feet of earth a garden rockery anything a reconnaissance then hussein said and how many times have we had to do that in the last two years of the war cousin and succeeded in our purpose but what is our objective lets say we can force a way through this tunnel into the garden do we sit in a shrubbery waiting for sara to come out to play and if so what do you do shoot her dont be absurd okay so you hope shes alone knock her out fling her over your shoulder drag her through the tunnel and drive away hussein sat there staring at him and khazid said of course if anyone was with her wed have to shoot them even if it was her parents husseins face was somber i gave saras grandfather my most solemn oath before allah to protect her honor her in every way i failed miserably in all respects death followed at every turn our comrades died at the hands of dillon and salter my unclestruck down with the shame of itwas dead before his true time you are right in everything you say i do not know what to do or even to say if i should look upon her face again allah was the one who chose this path for me i think the truth is you never even knew where everything was leading from the beginning khazid got up if we had only pursued our worthwhile targets ferguson and the others there would have been some point but now there will be a purpose to everything and allah will show what it is i must go to zion i have no choice and neither do i khazid sighed i finally accept that for the past two years as a soldier in the war in iraq ive been commanded by a raving lunatic all of a sudden i dont find any comfort in the idea that im in the hands of allah so you will desert me hussein sat there his face bleak so this is what its come to khazid managed a smile now do i look like that kind of fella cousin no ill go down to hell with you if thats what you want ali returned so now we wait i have arranged for jamal to drive up to the public car park at farley field in a telecom van hell wait there and observe just in case the hawk plane gets some use he is familiar with most of fergusons crowd and will phone me the moment he has something and ill contact you good idea khazid told him and husseins special mobile sounded its me the broker said cambridge didnt go well i hear it was unfortunate and led nowhere we have no idea where ferguson has the rashids forget the girl the broker said turn to more worthy targets have you been in touch with khan no strange i get no response from him however i try i cant help you where are you a safe house that is all i can tell you goodbye hussein looked at ali and khazid so much for the broker can we have some coffee in the library at zion the russians sat having a drink in the corner trying to absorb the bad news about hal stone caspar and molly were watching a film in the television room and sara was playing patience levin said what an absolute bastard two in the back chomsky shook his head a hard thing to cope with even with a great surgeon sara looks lonely greta said ill go and chat with her she sat down on the other side of the table hows it going a bore really hows professor stone greta was shocked how on earth do you know its my guilty secret ive got really good hearing i can hear people speaking two rooms away i can hear the conversation in a cell phone in your hand across the table without putting it to my ear at my school the girls called me gestapo bitch because with me they had no privacy anyway professor stone at least hes come through surgery thats true and it was khazid who shot him it was a statement and not aquery im afraid so where do you think hussein and khazid are now weve no idea but we do know for certain that they dont know that you and your parents are here really the hammer of god seems to be slipping and that would be a first speaking of telephones by the way my mother must have had another mobile ive heard her phoning dr samson at the hospital about the bedford child several times she shook her head very silly greta said gravely ill have to let ferguson know of course sara got up im for bed im not going to tell them i leave that decision to you she went out and greta moved back to the others and told them levin called ferguson at once caught him with roper at holland park and gave him the bad news what a stupid thing to do ferguson said but dont say anything to her ill handle it myself ill fly down in the morning with dillon and billy more bad news that address in dorset at peel strand cottage called folly way the dorset police checked it out found the owner one darcus wellington shot dead good god levin said good god indeed theyve traced his car to bournemouth railway station from where theyve obviously caught a fast train to london our boys have been busy you see igor it all starts to fit at holland park ferguson sat in the computer room with billy and dillon roper had his scotch in his hand well heres to dr molly rashid great surgeon and humanitarian the trouble is her works the most important thing in her life dillon said its so important it sweeps everything else aside what on earth are you implying ferguson demanded of roper that if i was for example alqaeda id let the word go out to sympathizers that any news of even the briefest contact with dr molly rashid and where she was would be welcome stop it major ferguson said bloody nonsense but well fly down from farley at nine sharp the caravanette was packed with everything they needed and ali hussein and khazid sat in the back of the shop for a little while in silence after a while hussein said bed i think well depart at six am with three hours on the road well reach there about nine it should have been a weekend khazid said more birdwatchers the fewer the better hussein told him and stood up you will wake us my friend he asked ali khazid said i had a good friend called hassim they killed him in hazar dillon and salter could he have been kin to you i think not may he rest in peace hussein went upstairs khazid following ali had given them a small bedroom each they stood on the landing looking at each other then parted without a word khazid put his flight bag on the bed took out his silenced walther the clips the uzi machine pistol with its spare magazine he doubled them up with scotch tape so that he could reverse load when under stress everything was ready including the hand grenade hed slipped in without telling hussein he lay on the bed closed his eyes and went to sleep quickly next door hussein checked and loaded his walther put it back in his flight bag lay on the bed and said his prayers as he had done since childhood he closed his eyes he was in the hands of allah now he had never been more certain of anything in his life chapter at holland park roper dozed in his wheelchair in front of the screens as he often did through the night he usually awakened after an hour or so checked the screens then dozed off and usually opened his eyes again when the pain became reasonably unbearable his ravaged body was long past doctors prescriptions but of course the cigarettes and what he called the whiskey sups helped sergeant doyle on night duty had peered through the small window in the door as he did frequently observed the major was awake and went to the canteen and made him the kind of bacon and egg sandwich that roper enjoyed and took it to him it was just before five oclock in the morning and he put it down in front of roper there you go major i didnt bother with tea i knew youd just let it go cold have you had a good night sit down and join me for a while sergeant roper wolfed the sandwich between midnight and dawn is the strangest time of all to be on your own because all youve got is the past and you know you cant alter that would you want to major ive spent twenty years of my life a soldier and ive never known a finer one than you or a braver hunched over all those bombs in good old ireland until i made the one careless mistake over a silly little parked car you were doing your duty getting the job done we all accept what soldiering means it comes with the queens shilling and the first time you put on the uniform lets look at that roper said you did irish time six tours then you know that members of the provisional ira considered themselves soldiers how do you react to that not particularly well doyle said as i was frequently shot at during my tours of duty by bastards who didnt wear a uniform neither did the french resistance in the second world war the guy who made the bomb that got me was called murphy when he ended up in court he refused to recognize it said he was a soldier fighting a war what happened to him three life sentences in the maze and died of cancer doyle thought about it wheres this going major like i said between midnight and dawn the past going through your head i saw some film on television showing a britishborn muslim swearing allegiance to alqaeda he also said he was a soldier fighting a war i saw that doyle said where does it end id say with our present problem hussein rashid put it to him hed say exactly the same thing as all of them then maybe its just an excuse a copout at least you were blown apart wearing a uniform major that bugger murphy wasnt he stood up and shrugged theres no solution to it really im going to make tea now want some actually i would doyle went to the door and paused i didnt tell you its started raining outside and the winds building up you might find the hawk cant get off at farley ill keep an eye on it he checked the weather report on television and it wasnt good then he accepted the mug of tea from doyle and poured a whiskey sup in it when he was alone he pulled husseins photo on screen it stared back at him that che guevara look yes i know that isnt you anymore but where the hell are you and closer than he would ever have dreamed possible at the shop on the edge of west hampstead ali hassim was tapping on husseins door a cup of tea in his hand he put on the light and went in hussein was awake its earlier than you said but the weather is not good he put the green tea down at the side of the bed the window rattled in the wind hussein said my thanks for the tea but i must pray for a while ill be ready to leave at the time agreed if you would turn off the light of course ali went out tapped on khazids door and went downstairs roper dozed again and came awake to find it was just seven oclock at the same time the caravanette pulled in at a little chef outside guildford there was a strong wind and the rain was relentless but hussein and khazid were impervious to it thanks to the outfits bolton had purchased the threequarterlength anoraks in olive green were hooded with capacious pockets large enough for the silenced walthers they carried including spare clips of ammunition waterproof bush hats leggings and heavy boots made short work of the weather there were a dozen or so customers scattered around the café mainly truck drivers from the look of what was in the car park hussein and khazid sat in a corner away from anyone else what do we eat khazid asked look at the menu the popular choice is the full english breakfast with a mug of tea which includes bacon for a start in the circumstances allah will be merciful so go to the counter and in your best broken french give the order to be practical im hungry and we have a long day ahead of us khazid went and spoke to the young girl on duty and returned and sat down what do you think of the caravanette its hardly a getaway car the engine throbbing when you put your foot down it could be argued that it would be perfect for such a purpose what police are usually chasing is the faster traffic not the vehicle in the slow lane a debatable point khazid said the girl brought the breakfasts and teas on a tray put everything on the table and departed my chief instructor in the camp in algeria had a saying walk dont run whenever possible now eat your breakfast little brother and shut up it was eight oclock when dillon and billy joined roper and his news wasnt too good ive had lacey on he and parry have arrived at farley its not too nice he certainly thinks its not on for a nineoclock departure theyll just have to wait for a window of opportunity ive spoken to ferguson hes suggested we have a quick breakfast hell be here for an eightthirty departure thats fine dillon said are you going to join us i dont think so id a bad night and then this weather he shook his head i think ill check with zion while you eat see you later dillon and billy left him for the canteen and roper called levin at the dining room at zion house levin chomsky and greta sat at a corner table and rain rattled against the french windows the terrace outside streaming with it as it fell on the garden extending all the way to the wall the wood beyond there was a certain amount of mist that made everything look a little mysterious various trees masses of rhododendrons willow trees an old summerhouse sheltered pathways running through shrubberies greta who was drinking coffee and looking out said rain bloody rain but it suits the garden sara came up behind i heard that its like something out of jane eyre dark and brooding would you like to join us greta said no id better go and sit in the far corner the parents are coming down ill see you later she moved across waving cheerfully at captain bosey and fletcher and smith two of his guards who were eating together a little later caspar and molly arrived and joined their daughter one of the girls kitty took an order and went off to the kitchen levins phone went and it was roper hows the house party proceeding rain and even a little mist makes the garden look romantic what about the runway i cant see from here hang on and ill go to the terrace which he did going out to the hall and helping himself to an umbrella he found behind the door he opened it and stepped out giving roper a running commentary theres no way this rain is going to stop thats for sure but i can see the runway there is some mist there certainly whats the word from your end well lacey doesnt seem to think nine oclocks likely hell await a window of opportunity was what he said okay ill keep in touch levin turned moved back to the house to report to the others at farley field jamal had set himself up in the public car park he parked in a spot from which he could see the arrivals the hawk was already parked on the other side of the terminal building the yellow van had telecom on the side and he raised the rear door like a flap against the rain and sat there from halfpast seven and waited he was surrounded by coils of wire a large tool box was open and in his yellow oilskins with telecom on the back he looked perfectly acceptable ali hassim who had phoned several times tried again at halfpast eight still nothing im afraid so i will contact you the moment i see anything he opened a lunch box and took out a banana and a carton of yogurt ate it slowly with a spoon then unpeeled the banana watching time ticked by and suddenly the people traveller from holland park the vehicle that he had followed on his motorbike when it had taken the rashids and the three other people to farley arrived he watched it park at the end of the terminal three men hurrying for shelter he knew one was ferguson because hassim had shown him a photo he phoned ali instantly theyve arrived ferguson definitely and two other men they were too fast for me hurrying through the rain allah be praised phone me again the moment they take off it may be a while the weather is not good so wait and watch in the terminal building ferguson talked to lacey what do you think i dont hold out any hope of nine oclock the flight down there takes an hour a little more depending on the wind and whether it changes direction maybe another half hour that would give an estimated time of arrival at about tenthirty well just have to see i suggest coffee general oh very well ferguson wasnt pleased and phoned levin nine oclock and waiting lacey still has hopes ill call you he shrugged and said to dillon and billy cant be helped lets find this coffee at zion the caravanette had arrived twenty minutes earlier and passed through the village as khazid drove following boltons instructions passing the house and the electronic barrier at the estate entrance with the guardhouse beside it farther along they came to the sprawling country car park surrounded with high hedges and the wood on the other side there was one thing that bolton had failed to mention a brick public convenience as for the car park at that moment in time there wasnt a single vehicle parked there khazid got out i have an idea he went to the public convenience looked behind and returned i think i could squeeze the caravanette round the back of it no we wont do that hussein said remember what i said walk dont run we are harmless eccentrics who prefer to be out in the pouring rain watching birds to sitting at home weve nothing to hide just park us there by the wood the gate guard cant see down here anyway his phone went it was ali who described the situation at farley hussein took the news quite calmly call me the moment the hawk leaves where are you where we are supposed to be now dont bother me until you have news khazid said whats happening jamal at farley has seen the hawk waiting and ferguson and two men arrive probably dillon and billy salter he will inform ali the moment the hawk takes off i know that plane ive flown one id say in good weather it would be here at zion in an hour maybe a little more today allah preserve us khazid said in awe ferguson himself on the terrace of that house the british prime ministers head of security a man with huge links to the american president what a target this changes everything our place in heaven is assured it changes nothing hussein told him first we need to get into the grounds fool so orders the large pockets in our anoraks will carry our weapons and additional ammunition with no problem even your uzi with the stock folded we leave the flight bags locked in the caravanette you can carry the canvas bag with the tool kit i will have my zeiss glasses around my neck and then into the wood with us to watch birds khazid answered of course and if any birdwatchers as crazy as us turn up in this weather remember youre french he led the way along the side of the wood toward the runway end checking his watch and finding it was just after nine boltons instructions had really been very good hussein turned into the fringe of pine trees at that point and said stop i want to take a look he focused the zeiss glasses that bolton had procured they were excellent he scanned the garden then checked the terrace extending the whole front of the house the main door in the center at that moment the french window opened and sara came out and held an umbrella overhead caspar stood in the french window obviously urging her to come in out of the rain she stayed for a moment then turned and went in the french window was closed hussein said hoarsely ive just seen sara on the terrace under an umbrella and caspar behind her theyve gone in again have a quick look khazid did handed them back and hussein said lets get to it within a few minutes thanks to boltons briefing they forced their way through the thicket and found the stone excellent he stamped around kicking in the grass and khazid unfolded the canvas tool kit there were two small steel spades and two lengthy crowbars ranged along the bottom of the bag a sledgehammer and a flashlight there was also a dark green waterproof cape to hide an open hole if necessary remembering what bolton had told them he had done hussein tapped around in the turf and heard the clang of metal on metal now the spades he said come on both of us they attacked savagely and the pointed steel blades tore into the turf turning it over soon revealing a circular iron manhole it was worn with the years pitted but it was still possible to read the manufacturers name watson amp company canal street leeds they looked at it in silence amazing khazid said after all these years try moving it hussein told him there was a steel handle in a cup setting in the center khazid pushed one of the crowbars through and heaved nothing much happened and at that moment husseins mobile sounded he answered at once and found ali there jamal has just called me although the weather is still poor here the hawk has just departed its ninethirty does everything go well weve found the entrance but ive no time to talk he slipped the phone into his pocket and took the other crowbar from the bag inserted it and they heaved together without success take some of the smaller tools the screwdrivers and well scrape round the edges of the circle that was ali jamal reports the hawk departing ninethirty he scraped away furiously as did khazid that would mean an eta of tenthirty plus the drive from the runway id say theyll arrive at the house at about ten fortyfive now put your back into it little brother and it moved with a strange kind of groan and tilted and broke free and they carried it farther into the thicket and dumped it in the long grass you first hussein said to khazid and pulled the cape from the tool bag ill pass it to you there seem to be rungs down into this thing khazid did as he was told the flashlight in one hand his voice echoed up its about five foot in diameter drop the bag hussein did so spread the cape on the ground went a few steps down the rungs and reached up to pull the cape over the hole it was green in color and with any luck it would be undetected for a very long time khazid had the flashlight out and it picked out the tunnel ahead its curved sides were concrete and very wet and the drip of water could be heard must be leakage of some kind khazid said he moved ahead bending over slightly oblivious in his stout boots to the sludge under his feet there was a smell but it wasnt unpleasant rather like walking through a wood in the rain earthy and damp in his head hussein moved in slow motion as if in a dream the sight of sara under that umbrella had shocked him it was the reality of her presence after the things that had gone before the journey from hazar so much violence and death now she was near and there was little doubt what khazid would expect to do and khazid was right to expect such a thing they were soldiers fighting in a war one of the worst of modern times that one way or another had cost the lives of many thousands of his fellow iraqis including his parents it would be the worst kind of dishonor to fail them all now even though it would cost him his life he saw all this so clearly he was the hammer of god and he had never failed in his duty there was the same kind of ladder in the brick wall he said to khazid mount a few rungs with a crowbar and see what you can do ill brace you khazid put down the lantern and obeyed and mounted to the right level and got to work as hussein took his weight he was having difficulty but a crack was obvious at the lefthand side of the manhole cover the decay of the years i can get the end of the crowbar in there ill hold it with one hand while you get the hammer and swing it against the end hussein did exactly that and everything happened in a rush two or three bricks tumbling down he jumped out of the way then pushed his hands into khazids back holding him firmly while the manhole cover seemed to slide to one side and a considerable amount of earth showered in hussein shook it off go through see where we are he ordered khazid mounted the rungs farther pushing the lid right to one side and emerged heavy rain pouring down in the middle of a mass of rhododendron bushes surrounded by willow trees and close to a summerhouse styled in the manner of a pagoda he was hidden from any kind of view although a narrow path was near at hand a walkway through the heavy foliage there was the house and the front door the terrace on either side a glimpse of someone passing the french windows although he wasnt to know it was kitty and ida setting the dining room tables for lunch khazid slid down into the tunnel and told hussein what to expect hussein mounted a few rungs paused a moment then came down perfect he glanced at his watch it was tentwenty and the air was filled with the noise of the hawk landing at the runway ten minutes early i got it wrong but we are just in time for ferguson is it not so absolutely hussein took out the silenced walther and checked it khazid did the same to his leaving the uzi in the other capacious pocket already loaded with the taped magazines the hand grenade he had taken from darcus wellingtons collection without telling hussein he left in his breast pocket so sara is no longer a problem he said it will be ferguson hussein nodded slightly yes ferguson because it must be so i see now i was very wrong where sara was concerned my duty lies elsewhere he smiled sometimes you see truth more easily than i do a hard lesson for me to learn he kissed khazid on each cheek i will meet you in paradise little brother and i you tears stained khazids face and he gave his leader a fierce hug go to a good death hussein told him waited for khazid to go up and then followed him captain bosey was by the runway umbrella ready to shield ferguson from the heavy rain dillon and billy followed behind him and ferguson turned as squadron leader lacey peered out of the hatch well certainly be here for a few hours so you and parry might as well come up to the house thats kind of you sir but weve got things to do he turned to bosey could you come back for us in an hour ill see to it bosey held open the land rover door for ferguson and dillon and billy bundled in what a bleeding day billy observed takes you back to belfast on a wet saturday night ferguson added as bosey drove away i must say lacey and parry did a fine job there were times when i flinched he turned to bosey hows everything at the house perfect general no problems the rashids have settled in well and your people seem perfectly happy excellent ferguson told him pity about the weather but im sure you have a nice lunch arranged oh you can rely on mrs tetley for that general bosey drove on the sound of the hawk had touched everybody at zion house with a kind of anticipation especially molly rashid who was feeling even more unhappy than usual thank god theyve got here i thought it might be canceled by this dreadful weather and i need to have words with general ferguson she was sitting on a sofa beside caspar and sara and the three russians were chatting in the corner she stood up im just bobbing upstairs for a moment what for a phone call mummy yes ill only be a few minutes there was instant dismay on her face as she realized her error the russians stopped their conversation and molly horrified at being caught out fled caspar said what on earths going on why dont you ask her sara stood up you know how much i like the rain im going for a walk in the garden youll get soaked he told her no i wont i shall borrow igors trench coat and take an umbrella she turned to the russians as she walked out taking your trench coat igor im just going for a stroll do you want any company greta asked suit yourself sara said ill be right with you a few minutes later they went out the front door greta also in a raincoat linked arms for a moment and paused at the balustrade hidden in the rhododendron bushes by the pagoda hussein and khazid saw them emerge and hussein raised the zeiss glasses its sara and some woman at that same moment the land rover entered the main gate and started along the driveway sara said to greta oh damn here they are im not ready for it yet lets go just for a few minutes at least if you like they hurried down the steps and branched off on a path bringing them through to the end of the garden and paused close to the pagoda they looked back and saw levin and chomsky crowding the front door in welcome as ferguson dillon and billy got out of the back of the land rover there were words exchanged up there ferguson turned to the balustrade and peered down looking for them in the bushes khazid couldnt contain himself its ferguson perfect he stepped out of the bushes and faced sara and greta avoiding husseins quick grab the walther in his hand against his leg sara stared at him its you khazid she was stunned i cant believe it hussein stepped out and took off his bush hat hello sara its a long way from home she stared at him good heavens hussein what have you done to yourself everything changes cousin she said i dont know how you got here but ive no intention of going anywhere with you so the hammer of god has fallen so low and she said the strangest thing oh hussein youre such a good man in spite of yourself enough of this nonsense khazid said took the grenade from his pocket and hurled it up toward the balustrade where it bounced off the steps and rolled backward into a flower bed and exploded there was total confusion everyone ducking weapons appearing in their hands greta who was carrying her own walther in her raincoat pocket drew it khazid grabbed her wrist but she discharged twice slicing his left shoulder the second shot catching hussein in the stomach as he stood to the side khazid shot greta at pointblank range in the body and she was hurled away to fall on her back he went completely berserk pulled out the uzi and ran wildly up through the garden calling out fergusons name at the top of his voice and dillon and billy pumped one round after another into him sara shouted wildly hands up no more stop it now her parents had emerged from the house and molly tried to run forward but ferguson called cease firing sara looked at greta then called come and get major novikova at once but no violence please she turned to face hussein old beyond her years aged by experience what now cousin she said he was leaning against the pagoda and turned inside a hand to his stomach blood oozing how did you know where we were she asked an unwise call to your mothers hospital a nurse sympathetic to our cause who overheard but no matter this is our final meeting sara may allah bless you all your days but go now obey me in my last request no more killing she said it is enough she turned as dillon billy and levin arrived and walked past them as levin knelt over greta she went calmly up the steps and her mother grabbed her are you all right oh yes but no more phone calls mummy they cost too much telling dr samson where you were was a lousy idea it got into the wrong hands she walked into the hall and went upstairs there was a kind of horror on mollys face as she realized the implication caspar said what on earth did she mean that somehow what has happened here was my fault i rang dr samson at the hospital a number of times on an extra mobile i keep in my bag i couldnt help myself how could you do that he shook his head so stupid she turned wearily and went inside he sighed and went after her hussein was still in the pagoda fumbling at his anorak the blood oozing more than ever between his fingers but when he finally stood up and lurched outside the walther was in his right hand mr dillon mr salter they faced him weapons ready his hand swung up and each of them shot twice throwing him backward the walther flying to one side he was instantly dead billy picked up the walther inspected it and turned to dillon as ferguson appeared it was empty dillons face was bleak poor bastard hed nowhere else to go he turned to ferguson greta levin thinks shell be all right ambulance on its way and the bodies the usual disposal team ill send in the order to roper now hussein rashid and this chap khazid cease to exist it never happened dillon nodded do you ever wonder what its all about no ive no bloody time its the world we live in its what we have to do to survive these days with enemies like the broker and osama khan and people like him so lets get back to london and get on with it he turned and walked away as an ambulance drew up on the terrace and three paramedics piled out came down the steps and hurried to where levin crouched over greta dillon turned to billy okay you heard the man and they followed ferguson up to the terrace and into the house
