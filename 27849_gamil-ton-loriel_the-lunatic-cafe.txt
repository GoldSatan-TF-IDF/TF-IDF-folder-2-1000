laurell k hamilton the lunatic cafe book of the anita blake vampire hunter series editors note typos from original manuscript retained it was two weeks before christmas a slow time of year for raising the dead my last client of the night sat across from me there had been no notation by his name no note saying zombie raising or vampire slaying nothing which probably meant whatever he wanted me to do was something i wouldnt or couldnt do prechristmas was a dead time of year no pun intended my boss bert took any job that would have us george smitz was a tall man well over six feet he was broad shouldered and muscular not the muscles you get from lifting weights and running around indoor tracks the muscles you get from hard physical labor i would have bet money that mr smitz was a construction worker farmer or something similar he was shaped large and square with grime embedded under his fingernails that soap would not touch he sat in front of me crushing his toboggan hat kneading it in his big hands the coffee that hed accepted sat cooling on the edge of my desk he hadnt taken so much as a sip i was drinking my coffee out of the christmas mug that bert my boss had insisted everyone bring in a personalized holiday mug to add a personal touch to the office my mug had a reindeer in a bathrobe and slippers with christmas lights laced in its antlers toasting the merry season with champagne and saying bingle jells bert didnt really like my mug but he let it go probably afraid of what else i might bring in hed been very pleased with my outfit for the evening a highcollared blouse so perfectly red id had to wear makeup to keep from looking pale the skirt and matching jacket were a deep forest green i hadnt dressed for bert i had dressed for my date the silver outline of an angel gleamed in my lapel i looked very christmasy the browning hipower mm didnt look christmasy at all but since it was hidden under the jacket that didnt seem to matter it might have bothered mr smitz but he looked worried enough to not care as long as i didnt shoot him personally now mr smitz how may i help you today i asked he was staring at his hands and only his eyes rose to look at me it was a littleboy gesture an uncertain gesture it sat oddly on the big mans face i need help and i dont know who else to go to exactly what kind of help do you need mr smitz its my wife i waited for him to continue but he stared at his hands his hat was wadded into a tight ball you want your wife raised from the dead i asked he looked up at that eyes wide with alarm shes not dead i know that then what can i possibly do for you mr smitz i raise the dead and am a legal vampire executioner what in that job description could help your wife mr vaughn said you knew all about lycanthropy he said that as if it explained everything it didnt my boss makes a lot of claims mr smitz but what does lycanthropy have to do with your wife this was the second time id asked about his wife i seemed to be speaking english but perhaps my questions were really swahili and i just didnt realize it or maybe whatever had happened was too awful for words that happened a lot in my business he leaned forward eyes intense on my face i leaned forward too i couldnt help myself peggy thats my wife shes a lycanthrope i blinked at him and if it came out shed lose her job i didnt argue with him legally you couldnt discriminate against lycanthropes but it happened a lot what sort of work is peggy in shes a butcher a lycanthrope that was a butcher it was too perfect but i could see why shed lose her job food preparation with a potentially fatal disease i dont think so i knew and the health department knew that lycanthropy can only be transferred by an attack in the animal form most people dont believe that cant say i blame them entirely i dont want to be fuzzy either she runs a specialty meat store its a good business she inherited it from her father was he a lycanthrope too i asked he shook his head no peggy was attacked a few years back she survived he shrugged but you know i did know so your wife is a lycanthrope and would lose her business if it came out i understand that but how can i help you i fought the urge to glance at my watch i had the tickets richard couldnt go in without me peggys missing ah i am not a private detective mr smitz i dont do missing persons but i cant go to the police they might find out how long has she been missing two days my advice is to go to the police he shook his head stubbornly no i sighed i dont know anything about finding a missing person i raise the dead slay vampires thats it mr vaughn said you could help me did you tell him your problem he nodded shit bert and i were going to have a long talk the police are good at their job mr smitz just tell them your wife is missing dont mention the lycanthropy see what they turn up i didnt like telling a client to withhold information from the police but it beat the heck out of not going at all ms blake please im worried weve got two kids i started to say all the reasons i couldnt help him then stopped i had an idea animators inc has a private investigator on retainer veronica sims has been involved in a lot of preternatural cases she might be able to help you can i trust her i do he stared at me for a long moment then nodded all right how do i get in touch with her let me give her a call see if she can see you that would be great thank you i want to help you mr smitz hunting missing spouses just isnt my specialty i dialed the phone as i talked i knew ronnies number by heart we exercised at least twice a week together not to mention an occasional movie dinner whatever best friends a concept that most women never outgrow ask a man who his best friend is and hell have to think about it he wont know right off the top of his head a woman would a man might not even be able to think of a name not for his best friend women keep track of these things men dont dont ask me why ronnies answering machine clicked in ronnie if youre there its anita pick up the phone clicked and a second later i was talking to the genuine article hi anita i thought you had a date with richard tonight something wrong see best friends not with the date ive got a client here who i think is more up your alley than mine tell me she said i did did you recommend he go to the police yep he wont go nope she sighed well ive done missing persons before but usually after the police have done everything they can they have resources i cant touch im aware of that i said he wont budge i dont think so so its me or bert took the job knowing it was a missing person he might try giving it to jamison jamison doesnt know his butt from a hole in the ground on anything but raising the dead yeah but hes always eager to expand his repertoire ask him if he can be at my office she paused while she leafed through her appointment book business must be good at nine tomorrow morning jesus you always were an early riser one of my few faults she said i asked george smitz if nine oclock tomorrow was all right couldnt she see me tonight he wants to see you tonight she thought about that for a minute why not its not like i have a hot date unlike some people i could mention sure send him over ill wait friday with a client is better than friday night alone i guess youve just hit a dry spell i said and youve hit a wet spell very funny she laughed ill look forward to mr smitzs arrival enjoy guys and dolls i will see you tomorrow morning for our run you sure you want me over there that early in case dream boat wants to stay over you know me better than that i said yeah i do just kidding see you tomorrow we hung up i gave mr smitz ronnies business card directions to her office and sent him on his way ronnie was the best i could do for him it still bothered me that he wouldnt go to the police but hey it wasnt my wife ive got two kids hed said not my problem really craig our nighttime secretary was at the desk which meant it was after six i was running late there really wasnt time to argue with bert about mr smitz but i glanced at berts office it was dark boss man gone home craig glanced up from his computer keyboard he has short babyfine brown hair round glasses to match a round face hes slender and taller than i am but then who isnt hes in his twenties with a wife and two babies mr vaughn left about thirty minutes ago it figures i said something wrong i shook my head schedule me some time to talk to the boss tomorrow i dont know anita hes booked pretty solid find some time craig or ill barge in on one of the other appointments youre mad he said you bet find the time if he yells about it tell him i pulled a gun on you anita he said with a grin as if i were teasing i left him riffling through the appointment book trying to squeeze me somewhere i meant it bert would talk to me tomorrow december was our slowest season for raising zombies people seemed to think you couldnt do it close to christmas as if it were black magic or something so bert scheduled other things to take up the slack i was getting tired of clients with problems i could do nothing about smitz wasnt the first this month but he was going to be the last with that cheerful thought i bundled into my coat and left richard was waiting if traffic cooperated i might just make it before the opening number traffic on a friday night surely not the nova that id been driving had died a sad and tragic death i was now driving a jeep cherokee country it was a deep deep green that looked black at night but it had fourwheel drive for winter and enough room to carry goats in the back chickens were what i used for zombie raising most of the time but occasionally you needed something bigger carrying goats in the nova had been a bitch i pulled the cherokee into the last parking space in the lot on grant my long black winter coat billowed around me because i had only buttoned the bottom two buttons if i buttoned all the buttons i couldnt get to my gun my hands were shoved into the coat pockets arms huddling the cloth around me i didnt wear gloves ive never been comfortable shooting with gloves on the gun is a part of my hand cloth shouldnt interfere i ran across the street in my highheeled pumps careful on the frosty pavement the sidewalk was cracked with huge sections broken out of it as if someone had taken a sledgehammer to it the boardedup buildings were as dilapidated as the sidewalk id missed the crowd being nearly late so i had the shattered street to myself it was a short but lonely walk on a december night broken glass littered the ground and in heels i had to be very careful where i stepped an alley cut the buildings it looked like the natural habitat of muggerus americanus i watched the darkness carefully nothing moved with the browning i wasnt too worried but still you didnt have to be a genius to shoot someone in the back the wind gusted cold enough to take my breath away as i neared the corner and relative safety i wore a lot of sweaters in the winter but tonight id wanted something dressier and i was freezing my patooties off but i was hoping that richard would like the red blouse at the corner there were lights cars and a policeman directing traffic in the middle of the street you never saw this many police in this section of st louis unless the fox was on a lot of wealthy people came down here in their furs diamonds rolex watches wouldnt do for a friend of the city council to get mugged when topol came to reprise his role in fiddler on the roof the audience was very crиme de la crиme and the place crawled with cops tonight there was just the usual mostly in front of the theater mostly doing traffic but also taking peeks at the seedy backs of buildings in case someone with money wondered away from the light i went through the glass doors into the long narrow entryway it was brightly lit shiny somehow theres a little room to the right where you can pick up your tickets people streamed out of it hurrying to the inner glass doors i wasnt as late as i thought if there were this many people still getting tickets or maybe everyone else was as late as i was i caught a glimpse of richard standing in the far right corner at six foot one he is easier to spot across a crowded room than i am at my own five foot three he stood quietly eyes following the crowds movement he didnt seem bored or impatient he seemed to be having a good time watching the people his eyes followed an elderly couple as they walked through the glass doors the woman used a cane their progress was painfully slow his head turned slowly with them i scanned the crowd everyone else was younger moving with confident or hurried stride was richard looking for victims prey he was after all a werewolf hed gotten a bad batch of lycanthropy vaccine one of the reasons i never get the shots if my flu shot accidentally backfires thats one thing but being furry once a month no thanks did he realize he was standing there searching the crowd like a lion staring at a bunch of gazelles or maybe the elderly couple had reminded him of his grandparents hell maybe i was giving him motives that were only in my suspicious little brain i hoped so his hair was brown in sunlight it gleamed with strands of gold hints of copper i knew the hair was shoulder length nearly my length but hed done something to it pulled it back somehow so it gave the illusion of being very short and close to his head not easy with hair as wavy as his his suit was some rich shade of green most men would have looked like peter pan in a green suit but on him it looked just right as i walked closer i could see his shirt was a pale almost gold tie a darker green than the suit with tiny christmas trees done in red i would have made a smart remark about the tie but dressed in red and green with a christmas angel on my lapel who was i to complain he saw me and smiled the smile was very bright against his permanently tanned skin his last name zeeman is dutch but somewhere back in his ancestry was something not european not blond not fair not cold his eyes were a perfect chocolate brown he reached out and took my hands gently drawing me to him his lips were soft against my mouth a brief nearly chaste kiss i stepped back taking a breath he kept hold of my hand and i let him his skin was very warm against my cold hand i thought about asking him if hed been thinking about eating that elderly couple but didnt accusing him of murderous intent might spoil the evening besides most lycanthropes werent aware of doing nonhuman things when you pointed it out it always seemed to hurt their feelings i didnt want to hurt richards feelings as we went through the inner doors into the crowded lobby i asked wheres your coat in the car didnt want to carry it so i made a dash for it i nodded it was typical richard or maybe lycanthropes didnt get cold from the back i could see hed braided his hair tight to his scalp the tip of the braid trailed over his collar i couldnt even figure out how hed done it my idea of fixing my hair is to wash smear a little hair goop through it then let it dry i was not into hightech hair design though it might be fun to figure out the knots in a leisurely fashion after the show i was always willing to learn a new skill the main lobby of the fox is a cross between a really nice chinese restaurant and a hindu temple with a little art deco thrown in for flavor the colors are so dazzling it looks like the painter ground up stained glass with bits of light trapped in them pit bullsize chinese lions with glowing red eyes guard a sweep of stairs that lead up to the fox club balcony where for fifteen thousand dollars a year you can eat wonderful meals and have a private box the rest of us peons mingled nearly shoulder to shoulder in the carpeted lobby with offerings of popcorn pretzels pepsi and on some nights hot dogs a far cry from chicken cordon bleu or whatever they were serving up above the fox treads that wonderfully thin line between gaudiness and the fantastic ive loved the building since i first saw it every time i come there is some new wonder some color or carving or statue that i didnt notice before when you realize that it was originally built to be a movie theater you realize how much things have changed movie theaters now have the souls of unwashed socks the fox is alive as only the best buildings are alive i had to let go of richards hand to unbutton my coat the rest of the way but hey we werent attached at the hip i stood close to him in the crowd without touching but i could feel him like a line of warmth against my body were going to look like the bobsey twins when i take my coat off i said he raised his eyebrows i spread the coat like a flasher and he laughed it was a good laugh warm and thick like christmas pudding tis the season he said he gave me a onearmed hug quick like youd give a friend but his arm stayed over my shoulders it was still early enough in our dating that touching each other was new unexpected exhilarating we kept looking for excuses to touch each other trying to be nonchalant about it not fooling each other not sure we cared i slipped my arm around his waist and leaned just a bit it was my right arm if we were attacked now id never draw my gun in time i stayed there for a minute thinking it just might be worth it i moved around him offering my left hand to him i dont know if he caught a glimpse of the gun or just figured it out but his eyes widened he leaned close to me whispering against my hair a gun here at the fox you think the ushers will let you in they did last time he got a strange look on his face you always go armed i shrugged after dark yes his eyes were puzzled but he let it go before this year id sometimes gone out after dark unarmed but it had been a rough year a lot of different people had tried to kill me i was small even for a woman i jogged lifted weights had a black belt in judo but i was still outclassed by most professional bad guys they tended to also lift weights know martial arts and outweigh me by a hundred pounds or more i couldnt armwrestle them but i could shoot them also a lot of this year id been up against vampires and other preternatural creepiecrawlies they could lift large trucks with a single hand or worse silver bullets might not kill a vampire but it certainly slowed them down enough for me to run like hell to get away to survive richard knew what i did for a living hed even seen some of the messy parts but i still expected him to blow it to start playing the male protector and bitch about the gun or something it was almost a permanent tightness in my gut waiting for this man to say something awful something that would ruin it destroy it hurt so far so good the crowd started flowing towards the stairs parting on either side to the corridors leading into the main theater we shufflestepped with the crowd holding hands to keep from being separated sure once free of the lobby the crowd flowed towards the different aisles like water searching for the quickest route downstream the quickest route was still pretty slow i dug the tickets out of the pocket of my suit jacket i didnt have a purse there was a small brush a lipstick lipliner eye shadow id and my car keys stuffed in my coat pockets my beeper was tucked in the front of my skirt discreetly to one side when not dressed up i wore a fanny pack the usher an older woman with glasses shone a tiny flashlight on our tickets she took us to our seats motioned us in and went back up to assist the next group of helpless people the seats were good near the middle sort of close to the stage close enough richard had scooted in to sit on my left without being asked hes a quick study its one of the reasons were still going out that and the fact that i lust after his body something terrible i spread my coat over the seat spreading it out so it wouldnt be bulky his arm snaked across my chair fingers touching my shoulder i fought the urge to lay my head on his shoulder too hokey then thought what the hell i snuggled into the bend of his neck just breathing in the scent of his skin his aftershave was clean and sweet but underneath was the smell of his skin his flesh it made it so the aftershave would never smell the same on anyone else frankly without a drop of aftershave i loved the smell of richards neck i straightened up pulling just a little away from him he looked at me questioningly something wrong nice aftershave i said no need to confess that id had an almost irresistible urge to nibble his neck it was too embarrassing the lights dimmed and the music began id never actually seen guys and dolls except in the movies the one with marlon brando and jean simmons richards idea of a date was caving hiking things that required your oldest clothes and a pair of good walking shoes nothing wrong with that i like the outdoors but i wanted to try a dressup date i wanted to see richard in a suit and let him see me in something frillier than jeans i was after all a girl whether i liked to admit it or not but having proposed the date i didnt want to do the usual dipsyduo of dinner and a movie so id called up the fox to see what was playing and asked richard if he liked musicals he did another point in his favor since it was my idea i bought the tickets richard had not argued not even to pay half after all i hadnt offered to pay for our last dinner it hadnt occurred to me i was betting paying for the tickets occurred to richard but hed let it go good man the curtain came up and the opening street scene paraded before us bright colors stylized perfect and cheerful and just what i needed the fugue for tinhorns filled the bright stage and flowed out into the happy dark good music humor soon to be dancers richards body next to mine a gun under my arm what more could a girl ask for a trickle of people had slipped out before the end of the musical to beat the crowd i always stayed until the very end it seemed unfair to slink away before you could applaud besides i hated missing the end of anything i was always convinced that the bit id miss would be the best part we joined in enthusiastically with a standing ovation ive never lived in any city that gives so many standing os admittedly sometimes like tonight the show was wonderful but ive seen people stand on productions that didnt deserve it i dont stand unless i mean it richard sat back down after the lights came up id rather wait until the crowd thins out if you dont mind there was a look in his brown eyes that said he didnt think i would i didnt wed driven separate cars when we left the fox the evening was over apparently neither of us wanted to leave i knew i didnt i leaned on the seats in front of us gazing down at him he smiled up at me eyes gleaming with lust if not love i was smiling too couldnt seem to help myself you know this is a very sexist musical he said i thought about that a moment then nodded yep but you like it i nodded his eyes narrowed a bit i thought you might be offended i have better things to worry about than whether guys and dolls reflects a balanced worldview he laugheda short happy sound good for a minute there i thought id have to get rid of my rodgers and hammerstein collection i studied his face trying to decide if he was teasing me i didnt think so you really collect rodgers and hammerstein sound tracks he nodded eyes bright with laughter just rodgers and hammerstein or all musicals i dont have them all but all i shook my head whats wrong youre a romantic you make it sound like a bad thing that happyeverafter shit is fine on stage but it doesnt have a lot to do with life it was his turn to study my face evidently he didnt like what he saw because he frowned this date was your idea if you dont approve of all this happy stuff whyd you bring me i shrugged after i asked you on a dressup date i didnt know where to take you i didnt want to do the usual besides i like musicals i just dont think they reflect reality youre not as tough as you pretend to be yes i said i am i dont believe that i think you like that happyeverafter shit as much as i do youre just afraid to believe in it anymore not afraid just cautious been disappointed too many times he made it a question maybe i crossed my arms on my stomach a psychologist would have said i was closed off uncommunicative fuck them what are you thinking i shrugged tell me please i stared into his sincere brown eyes and wanted to go home alone instead happy ever after is just a lie richard and has been since i was eight your mothers death he said i just looked at him i was twentyfour years old and the pain of that first loss was still raw you could deal with it endure it but never escape it never truly believe in the great good place never truly believe that the bad thing wasnt going to come swooping down and take it all away id rather fight a dozen vampires than one senseless accident he pried my hand from its grip on my arm i wont die on you anita i promise someone laughed a low chuckle that brushed the skin like fingertips only one person had that nearly touchable laughjeanclaude i turned and there he was standing in the middle of the aisle i hadnt heard him come hadnt sensed any movement he was just there like magic dont make promises you cant keep richard i pushed away from the seats taking a step forward to give richard room to stand i felt him at my back a comforting presence if i hadnt been more worried about his safety than my own jeanclaude was dressed in a shiny black tux complete with tails a white vest with minute black dots bordered the gleaming whiteness of his shirt the collar was high and stiff with a cravat of soft black cloth tied around it and tucked into the vest as if ties had never been invented the stickpin in his vest was made of silverandblack onyx his shoes had spats on them like the ones fred astaire used to wear though i suspected the entire outfit was of a much older style his hair was fashionably long the nearly black curls edging the white collar i knew what color his eyes were but i didnt look at them now they were midnight blue the color of a really good sapphire never look a vampire in the eyes its a rule with the master vampire of the city standing there waiting i realized how empty the theater was wed waited out the crowd all right we were alone in the echoing silence the distant murmur of the departing crowd was like white noise it meant nothing to us i stared at the shiny motherofpearl buttons on jeanclaudes vest it was hard to be tough when you couldnt meet someones eyes but id manage god jeanclaude dont you ever wear anything but black and white dont you like it ma petite he gave a little spin so i could get the whole effect the outfit suited him beautifully of course everything he wore seemed made to order perfect lovely just like him somehow i didnt think guys and dolls would be your cup of tea jeanclaude or yours ma petite the voice was rich like cream with a warmth that only two things could give it anger or lust i was betting it wasnt lust i had the gun and silver bullets would slow him down but it wouldnt kill him of course jeanclaude wouldnt jump us in public he was much too civilized for that he was a business vampire an entrepreneur entrepreneurs dead or alive didnt go around tearing peoples throats out normally richard youre unusually quiet he stared past me i didnt glance back to see what richard was doing never take your eyes off the vampire in front of you to glance at the werewolf in back of you one problem at a time anita can speak for herself richard said jeanclaudes attention flicked back to me that is certainly true but i came to see how the two of you enjoyed the play and pigs fly i said you dont believe me not hardly i said come richard how did you enjoy your evening there was an edge of laughter to his voice but under that was still the anger master vampires are not good to be around when theyre angry it was wonderful until you showed up there was a note of warmth to richards voice the beginnings of anger id never seen him angry how could my mere presence spoil your date the last was spit out scalding hot why are you so pissed tonight jeanclaude i asked why ma petite i never get pissed bullshit hes jealous of you and me richard said i am not jealous youre always telling anita how you can smell her desire for you well i can smell yours you want her so bad you can richard gave an almost bitter soundtaste it and you monsieur zeeman you dont lust after her stop talking like im not here i said anita asked me out on a date i said yes is this true ma petite his voice had gone very quiet scarier than anger that quietness i wanted to say no but hed smell a lie its true what of it silence he just stood there utterly still if i hadnt been looking right at him i wouldnt have known he was there the dead make no noise my beeper went off richard and i jumped as if wed been shot jeanclaude was motionless as if he hadnt heard it i hit the button and the number that flashed made me groan what is it richard asked he laid his hand on my shoulder the police ive got to find a phone i leaned back against richards chest his hand squeezed my shoulder i stared at the vampire in front of me would jeanclaude hurt him after id gone i wasnt sure you got a cross on you i didnt bother to whisper jeanclaude would have heard me anyway no i half turned no youre out after dark without a cross he shrugged im a shapeshifter i can take care of myself i shook my head getting your throat ripped out once wasnt enough im still alive he said i know you heal from almost anything but for gods sake richard you dont heal from everything i started pulling the silver chain of my crucifix out of my blouse you can borrow mine is that real silver richard asked yes i cant im allergic to silver remember ah stupid me some preternatural expert offering silver to a lycanthrope i tucked the chain back in my blouse hes no more human than i am ma petite at least im not dead that can be remedied stop it both of you have you seen her bedroom richard her collection of toy penguins i took a deep breath and let it out i was not going to stand here and explain how jeanclaude had managed to see my bedroom did i really have to say out loud that i didnt sleep with the walking dead youre trying to make me jealous and it wont work richard said but there is that worm of doubt in you richard i know it you are my creature to call my wolf and i know you doubt her i dont doubt anita but there was a defensiveness in his voice that i didnt like at all i dont belong to you jeanclaude richard said im second in line to lead the pack i come and go where i please the alpha rescinded his orders about obeying you after you nearly got me killed your pack leader was most upset that you survived jeanclaude said sweetly why would the pack leader want richard dead i asked jeanclaude looked past me at richard you havent told her that youre in a battle of succession i will not fight marcus then you will die jeanclaude made it sound very simple my beeper sounded again same number im coming dolph i muttered i glanced at richard anger glittered in his eyes his hands were balled into fists i was standing close enough to feel the tension coming off him like waves whats going on richard he gave a quick shake of his head my business not yours if someones threatening you it is my business he stared down at me no you arent one of us i wont involve you i can handle myself richard he just shook his head marcus wants to involve you ma petite richard refuses it is a bone of contention between them one of many how do you know so much about it i asked we leaders of the preternatural community must deal with each other for everyones safety richard just stood staring at him it occurred to me for the first time that he seemed to look jeanclaude in the eyes with no ill effects richard can you meet his eyes richards eyes flicked down to me then back to jeanclaude yes im a monster too i can took him in the eyes i shook my head irving cant look him in the eyes its not just being a werewolf as i am a master vampire so our handsome friend here is a master werewolf though they do not call them that alpha males is it not pack leaders i prefer pack leader ill just bet you do i said richard looked hurt his face crumbling like a childs youre angry with me why youve got all this heavy shit going on with your pack leader and you dont tell me jeanclaude keeps hinting your leader wants you dead that true marcus wont kill me richard said jeanclaude laughed the sound had a bitter undertaste to it as if it hadnt been laughter at all you are a fool richard my beeper went off again i checked the number and turned it off it wasnt like dolph to call this many times this close together something bad was happening i needed to go but i dont have time to get the full story right this second i poked a finger into the middle of richards chest i gave jeanclaude my back hed already done the damage hed intended you are going to tell me every last bit of whats going on i dont save it you either share this problem or we dont date anymore he looked shocked why either you kept me out to protect me which im going to hate or you have some other reason it better be a damn good reason and not just some male ego shit jeanclaude laughed again this time the sound wrapped me around like flannel warm and comforting thick and soft next to naked skin i shook my head just jeanclaudes laughter was an invasion of privacy i turned to him and there must have been something in my face because the laughter died as if it had never been as for you you can get the hell out of here youve had your fun for the night whatever do you mean ma petite his beautiful face was as pure and blank as a mask i shook my head and stepped forward i was leaving i had work to do richards hand gripped my shoulder let me go richard im mad at you right now i didnt look at him i didnt want to see his face i was afraid if he looked hurt id forgive him anything you heard her richard she doesnt want you touching her jeanclaude had taken a gliding step closer leave it alone jeanclaude richards hand squeezed gently she doesnt want you jeanclaude there was anger in his voice more anger than should have been there as if he were trying to convince himself more than jeanclaude i stepped forward shaking his hand off i wanted to reach for it but didnt hed been keeping major shit from me dangerous shit it wasnt allowed worse yet he thought in some dark corner of his soul that i might have given in to jeanclaude what a mess fuck you both i said so you have not had that pleasure jeanclaude said thats anitas question to answer not mine richard said i would know it if you had liar i said no ma petite i would smell him on your skin i wanted to slug him the desire to smash that beautiful face was physical it tightened my shoulders made my arms ache but i knew better you dont volunteer for slugfests with vampires it shortens your life expectancy i walked up very close to jeanclaude bodies nearly touching i stared him in the nose which ruined some of the effect but his eyes were drowning pools and i knew better i hate you my voice was flat with the effort not to scream in that moment i meant it and i knew jeanclaude would sense it i wanted him to know ma petite no youve done enough talking its my turn if you harm richard zeeman ill kill you he means that much to you there was surprise in his voice great no you mean that little i stepped away from him around him gave him my back and walked away let him sink his fangs into that bit of truth tonight i meant every word the number on my beeper was the car phone of detective sergeant rudolf storr a christmas present from his wife last year id sent her a thankyou note police radio made everything sound like a foreign language dolph picked up on the fifth ring i knew hed get to it eventually anita what if id been your wife i asked shed know i was working i let it go not every wife would appreciate her husband answering the phone with another womans name maybe lucille was different whats up dolph this was supposed to be my night off sorry the murderer didnt know that if youre too busy well muddle through without you whats got your panties in a twist i was rewarded with a small sound that might have been a laugh not your fault were out towards six flags on fortyfour where exactly on fortyfour out near the audubon nature center how soon can you get here problem i dont know where the hell you are how do i get to the nature center its across the road from the st ambrose monastery dont know it i said he sighed hell were out in the middle of fucking nowhere those are the only landmarks just give me directions ill find it he gave me directions there were too many of them and i didnt have pen and paper hold on ive got to get something to write with i laid the phone down and snatched a napkin from the concession area i begged a pen from an older couple the man was wearing a cashmere overcoat the woman wore real diamonds the pen was engraved and might have been real gold he did not make me promise to bring it back trusting or above such petty concerns i was going to have to start stocking my own writing materials it was getting embarrassing im back dolph go ahead he didnt ask what took so long dolph isnt big on extraneous questions he gave the directions again i read them back to him to be sure i had them right i did dolph this is at least a fortyfive minute drive im usually the last expert to be called in after the victim has been photographed videotaped poked prodded etc after i come everyone gets to go home or at least leave the murder scene people were not going to like cooling their heels for two hours i called you as soon as i figured out nothing human did it itll take us at least fortyfive minutes to finish up and be ready for you i should have known dolph would have planned ahead okay ill be there as soon as i can he hung up i hung up dolph never said goodbye i gave the man back his pen he accepted it graciously as if hed never doubted its return good breeding i went for the doors neither jeanclaude nor richard had made it to the lobby they were in public so i didnt really think theyd have a fistfight angry words but not violence so the vampire and the werewolf could take care of themselves besides if richard wasnt allowed to worry about me when i was off on my own the least i could do was return the favor i didnt think jeanclaude really wanted to push me that far not really one of us would die and i was beginning to think just maybe it wouldnt be me the cold wrapped around me outside the doors i hunched my shoulders tucking my chin inside my collar a laughing foursome walked a few yards ahead of me they hung on each other huddling against the cold the womens high heels made a sharp theatrical clatter their laughter was too high too shrill a first double date that had gone well so far or maybe they were all deeply in love and i was feeling bitchy maybe the foursome parted like water around a stone revealing a woman the couples came back together on the other side of her laughing as if they hadnt seen her which they probably hadnt i felt it now a faint stirring in the cold air a sensation that had nothing to do with the wind she was pretending to be unseen until the couples had noticed her by not noticing her i hadnt noticed her either which meant she was good very very good she stood under the last streetlight her hair was butter yellow and thick with waves longer than mine nearly to her waist the coat she wore buttoned all the way up was black the color was too harsh for her it bleached the color from her skin even with makeup she stood in the center of the sidewalk arrogant she was about my size not physically imposing so why did she stand there as if nothing in the world could hurt her only three things give you that kind of confidence a machine gun stupidity or being a vampire i didnt see a machine gun and she didnt look stupid she did look like a vampire now that i realized what i was looking at the makeup was good it made her look almost alive almost she caught me staring at her she stared back trying to catch my eyes with her own but i was an old hand at this little dance staring at someones face while not staring at their eyes is a trick that gets easier with practice she frowned at me didnt like the eyes not working i stood about two yards from her feet apart as balanced as i was going to get in high heels my hands were already out in the cold ready to go for my gun if i had to her power crept over my skin like fingers touching here and there trying to find a weakness she was very good but she was also only a little over a hundred a hundred years wasnt old enough to cloud my mind all animators had a partial natural immunity to vampires mine seemed to be higher than most her pretty face was blank with concentration like a china dolls she flung a hand outward as if throwing something at me i flinched and her power caught me like an invisible wave slamming into my body it staggered me i pulled my gun she didnt try and jump me she tried to concentrate me out of it she was at least two hundred years old id underestimated her age by a century i didnt make mistakes like that often her power beat along my skin like tiny clubs but it never came close to touching my mind i was almost as surprised as she looked when i pointed the gun at her it had been too easy hey came a voice from behind us put the gun down now a policeman just when i needed one i pointed the gun at the sidewalk put the gun on the sidewalk right now his voice growled out and without turning around i knew his own gun was out cops take guns very seriously i held the browning out to my right onehanded left hand in the air and squatted to lay the gun gently on the sidewalk i do not need this interruption the vampire said i glanced up at her as i stood slowly putting my hands atop my head fingers laced maybe id get points for knowing the drill she was staring past me at the approaching cop it wasnt a friendly look dont hurt him i said her eyes flicked back to me we are not allowed to attack the police her voice was thick with scorn i know the rules i wanted to say what rules but didnt it was a good rule the policeman could live with a rule like that of course i wasnt a cop and i was betting the rules didnt apply to me the cop came into view out of the comer of my eye his gun was pointing at me he kicked my gun out of reach i saw it hit the building a hand shoved into my back getting my attention you dont need to know where the gun went he was right for now he frisked me onehanded it wasnt very thorough and i wondered where his partner was enough the vampire said i felt the cop step back from me whats going on here her power slithered past me like a great beast had brushed me in the dark i heard the policeman gasp nothing is happening here the vampire said there was a flavoring of accent in her voice german or austrian maybe i heard his voice say nothing is happening here now go back to directing traffic she said i turned slowly hands still on my head the cop was standing there face empty eyes wide his gun was pointed at the ground as if hed forgotten he was holding it go away she said he stood there frozen he was wearing his cross tie tack he was wearing his blessed cross just like he was supposed to and it wasnt doing much good i backed away from both of them if she stopped paying attention to the cop i wanted to be armed i lowered my arms slowly watching the cop if she took her control off suddenly and i wasnt where i was supposed to be he might shoot me probably not but maybe if he saw me with the gun in my hand a second time almost certainly i dont suppose you would remove his cross so i could order him about my eyes flicked to the vampire she was looking at me the cop stirred struggling like a dreamer in the grip of a nightmare she turned her eyes back to him and the struggles ceased i dont think so i said i knelt trying to keep my attention on both of them i touched the browning and wrapped cold fingers around it my hands were stiff from being exposed to the cold for so long i wasnt sure how fast i could draw right at that moment maybe i should look into some gloves maybe ones with the fingertips cut out i shoved the browning in my coat pocket hand still gripping it my hand would warm up and i could shoot through my coat if i had to without the cross i could make him go away why cant i control you like that just lucky i guess her eyes flicked to me again he stirred she had to stare at him while she talked to me it was interesting to see how much concentration it took she was powerful but it had its limits you are the executioner she said what of it i didnt believe the stories now i believe some of the stories bully for you now what do you want a slight smile curled her lipsticked mouth i want you to leave jeanclaude alone i blinked not sure id heard right what do you mean leave him alone dont date him dont flirt with him dont talk to him leave him alone glad to i said she turned to me startled you dont get to surprise a twohundredyearold vamp often her face looked very human with its wide eyes and little o of surprise the cop gave a snort and looked around wildly what the hell he looked at both of us we looked like two petite women out for the evening he glanced down at his gun and seemed embarrassed he didnt remember why it was out he put the gun away muttering apologies and backing away from us the vampire let him go youd leave jeanclaude alone just like that she asked you bet she shook her head i do not believe you look i dont care what you believe if you have the hots for jeanclaude more power to you ive been trying to get him off my back for years again that shake of the head sending her yellow hair flying about her face it was a very girlish gesture it would have been cute if she hadnt been a corpse you are lying you desire him anyone would i couldnt argue that you got a name i am gretchen well gretchen i wish you joy of the master if you need any help sinking your fangs into him let me know i would love for him to find a nice little vampire to settle down with you mock me i shrugged a little but its habit nothing personal i mean what i said i dont want jeanclaude you dont think hes beautiful her voice was soft with surprise well yeah but i think tigers are beautiful i still dont want to sleep with one no mortal could resist him this one can i said stay away from him or ill kill you she said gretchen wasnt listening to me not really she heard the words but the meaning didnt sink in reminded me of jeanclaude look he chases me ill stay away from him if hell let me but dont threaten me hes mine anita blake come against me at your peril it was my turn to shake my head maybe she didnt know i had a gun pointed at her maybe she didnt know it had silverplated bullets in it maybe she had lived for a couple of centuries and had grown arrogant yeah that was probably it look i dont have time for this right now jeanclaude is yours great fine im thrilled to hear it keep him away from me and i will be the happiest woman alive or dead i didnt want to turn my back on her but i had to go if she wasnt going to jump me here and now dolph was waiting at a murder scene i had to go gretchen what are you and anita talking about jeanclaude stalked towards us he was wearing i kid you not a black cape it was a victorian style with a collar a top hat with a white silk band completed the look gretchen gazed at him it was the only word for it the naked adoration in her face was sickening and very human i wanted to meet my rival i wasnt her rival but i didnt think shed believe that i told you to wait outside so you would not meet her you knew that the last three words were spat out thrown at her like rocks she flinched i meant no harm this night that was almost a lie but i didnt say anything i could have told him that shed threatened me but somehow it seemed like tattling shed gone to a lot of trouble to get me alone to warn me off her love for him was so naked i could not enlist his help against her foolish but true besides i didnt like owing jeanclaude favors ill leave you two lovebirds alone what lies did you tell her about us his words scalded the air i could feel myself choking on his rage jesus she fell to her knees hands held upward not to avoid a blow but beseeching reaching for him please i only wanted to meet her to see the mortal that would steal you from me i did not want to see this but it was like a car crash i couldnt quite bring myself to leave she steals nothing i have never loved you the pain was raw on her face and even under the makeup she looked less human her face was thinning out bones growing more apparent as if her skin were shrinking he grabbed her arm and pulled her roughly to her feet his whitegloved fingers dug into her arm if shed been human there would have been bruises get hold of yourself woman you are losing control her thinning lips drew back from fangs she hissed at him jerking free of his hand she covered her face with hands that were almost claws id seen vampires show their true form but never by accident never in the open where anyone might see i love you the words came out muffled and twisted but the feeling in those three words was very real very human get out of sight before you disgrace us all jeanclaude said she raised a face to the light that was no longer human the pale skin glowed with an inner light the makeup sat on that glowing surface the blush eye shadow lipstick seemed to float above the light as if her skin would no longer absorb them when she turned her head i could see the bones in her jaws like shadows inside her skin this is not over between us anita blake the words fell out from between fangs and teeth leave us jeanclaudes words were an echoing hiss she launched herself skyward not a leap not levitation just upward she vanished into the darkness with a backwash of wind sweet jesus i whispered it i am sorry ma petite i sent her out here so this would not happen he walked towards me in his elegant cape a gust of icy wind whistled around the corner and he had to make a grab for the top hat it was nice to know that at least his clothing didnt obey his every whim ive got to go jeanclaude the police are waiting for me i did not mean for this to happen tonight you never mean for anything to happen jeanclaude but it happens anyway i put a hand up to stop his words i didnt want to hear any more of them ive got to go i turned and walked towards my car i transferred my gun back to its holster when i was safely across the icy street i am sorry ma petite i whirled to tell him to get the hell away from me he wasnt there the streetlight glowed down on empty sidewalk i guess he and gretchen hadnt needed a car there is a glimpse of stately old homes to the right just before you turn onto highway the houses hide behind a wroughtiron fence and a security gate when the homes were built they were the height of elegance and so was the neighborhood now the town houses are an island in a rising flood of project housing and deadeyed children who shoot each other over a scuffed sneaker but the old money stayed determined to be elegant even if it kills them in fenton the chrysler plant is still the largest employer a side road runs past fastfood restaurants and local businesses but the highway bypasses them all a straight line going onward and not looking back the maritz building spans the highway with a covered crosswalk that looks big enough to hold offices it gets your attention like an overly aggressive date but i know the name of the business and i cant say that about many other buildings along sometimes aggressive works the ozark mountains rise on either side of the road they are soft and rounded gentle mountains on a sunny autumn day with the trees blazing color the mountains are startling in their beauty on a cold december night with only my own headlights for company the mountains sat like sleeping giants pressing close to the road there was just enough snow to gleam white through the naked trees the black shapes of evergreens were permanent shadows in the moonlight a limestone cliff shone white where the mountains had been cracked open for a gravel pit houses huddled at the base of the mountains neat farmhouses with front porches just made for sitting on notsoneat houses made of unpainted wood with rusty tin roofs corrals sat in empty fields without a farmhouse near a single horse stood in the icy cold head down searching the tops of the winterkilled grass a lot of people kept horses out past eurekapeople who couldnt afford to live in ladue or chesterfield where houses cost over half a mil a piece but you did get barns exercising pens and a corral in your backyard here all you got was a shed a corral and miles to drive to visit your horse but at least you had one a lot of trouble to go to for a horse the white head of a road sign flashed in the headlights i slowed down a car had run into the pole and crumbled it like a broken flower stem the sign was hard to read from a sixtydegree angle which was probably why dolph had told me to look for the smashed sign rather than the street name i pulled onto the narrow road in st louis wed gotten about a threeinch snowfall here it looked more like six the road hadnt been plowed it angled sharply upward climbing into the hills tire tracks like wagon wheels made two lines through the snow the police cars had gotten up the hill so could my jeep in my old nova i might have been wading fresh snow in high heels though i did have a pair of nikes in the trunk still jogging shoes werent a big improvement maybe i should buy a pair of boots it just didnt snow that much in st louis this was one of the deepest snowfalls id seen in four years boots seemed sort of unnecessary the trees curled over the road naked branches bouncing in the headlights wet icy trunks bent towards the road in summertime the road would be a leafy tunnel now it was just black bones erupting from the white snow at the crest of the hill there was a heavy stone wall it had to be ten feet tall and effectively hid anything on the lefthand side of the road it had to be the monastery about a hundred yards further there was a plaque set in the wall next to a spiked gate st ambrose monastery was done in raised letters metal on metal a driveway curved up and out of sight around a curve of hill and just across from the entrance was a smaller gravel road the car tracks climbed into the darkness ahead of me and vanished over the next hill if the gate hadnt been there for a landmark i might have missed it it was only when i turned the jeep to an angle that my lights caught the tire tracks leading off to the right i wondered what all the heavy traffic was up ahead not my problem i eased onto the smaller road branches scraped at the jeep scratching down the gleaming paint job like fingernails on a chalkboard great just great id never had a brandnew car before that first ding where id run over a snowcovered tombstone had been the hardest after the first damage the rest was easy to take riiight the land opened up to either side of the narrow road a large meadow with winterkilled weeds waist high weighted down with snow lightning flashes of red and blue strobed over the snow chasing back the darkness the meadow stopped abruptly in a perfect straight line where the mower had cut it a white farmhouse complete with screenedin porch sat at the end of the road cars were everywhere like a childs spilled toys i hoped the road formed a turn around under the snow if not the cars were parked all over the grass my grandmother blake had hated it when people parked on the grass a lot of the cars had their motors running including the ambulance there were people sitting in the cars waiting but for what by the time i got to a crime scene all the work was usually done someone would be waiting to take the body away after id finished looking at it but the crimescene people should have been done and gone something was up i pulled in next to a st gerard county sheriff car one policeman was standing in the drivers side door leaning on the roof hed been staring at the knot of men near the farmhouse but he turned to stare at me he didnt look happy with what he saw his smokey bear hat shielded his face but left his ears and the back of his head open to the cold he was pale and freckled and at least six foot two his shoulders were very broad in his dark winter jacket he looked like a large man who had always been large and thought that made him tough his hair was some pale shade that absorbed the colors of flashing lights so his hair looked alternately blue and red as did his face and the snow and everything else i got out of the car very carefully snow spilled in around my foot soaking my hose filling the leather pump it was cold and wet and i kept a death grip on the car door high heels and snow do not mix the last thing i wanted to do was fall on my ass in front of the st gerard county sheriff department i should have just grabbed my nikes from the back of the jeep and put them on in the car it was too late now the deputy sheriff was walking very purposefully towards me he had boots on and was having no trouble with the snow he stopped within reach of me i didnt let strange men get that close to me normally but to back up id have to let go of the car door besides he was the police i wasnt supposed to be afraid of the police right this is police business maam ill have to ask you to leave im anita blake i work with sergeant rudolf storr youre not a cop he seemed very certain of that i sort of resented his tone no im not then youre going to have to leave can you tell sergeant storr that im here please never hurts to be polite ive asked you real nice twice now to leave dont make me ask a third time all he had to do was reach out and grab my arm shove me into the jeep and away we went i certainly wasnt going to draw my gun on a cop with a lot of other cops within shouting distance i didnt want to get shot tonight what could i do i shut the car door very carefully and leaned against it if i was careful and didnt move around too much i might not fall down if i did maybe i could claim police brutality now why did you do that i drove fortyfive minutes and left a date to get here try to appeal to his better nature let me talk to sergeant storr and if he says i need to leave ill leave i dont care if you flew in from outta state i say you leave right now he didnt have a better nature he reached for me i stepped back out of reach my left foot found a patch of ice and i ended up on my ass in the snow the deputy looked sort of startled he offered me a hand up without thinking about it i climbed to my feet using the jeeps bumper moving farther away from deputy sullen at the same time he figured this out the frown lines on his forehead deepened snow clung in wet clumps to my coat and glided in melting runnels down my legs i was getting pissed off he strode around the jeep i backpedaled using my hands on the car as traction we can play ringaroundtherosie if you want to deputy but im not leaving until ive talked to dolph your sergeant isnt in charge here he stepped a little closer i backed away then find someone who is you dont need to talk to anyone but me he said he took three rapid steps towards me i backed up faster if we kept this up wed be running around the car like a marx brothers movie or would that be the keystone kops youre running from me in these shoes youve got to be kidding i was almost around the back of the jeep wed be back where we started soon over the crackle of police radios you could hear angry voices one of them sounded like dolph i wasnt the only one having trouble with the local cops though i seemed to be the only one being chased around a car stop right where you are he said if i dont he unclicked the flap on his holster his hand rested on the butt of his gun no words necessary this guy was crazy i might be able to get to my gun before he could draw his but he was a cop he was supposed to be one of the good guys i try not to shoot the good guys besides try explaining to other cops why you shot a cop they get testy as hell about stuff like that i couldnt draw my gun i couldnt outrun him arm wrestling seemed to be out i did the only thing i could think of i yelled dolph zerbrowski get your butts over here the shouting stopped as if someone had clicked a switch silence and the crackle of radios were the only sounds i glanced towards the men dolph was glancing my way at six foot eight inches dolph towered over everyone else i waved a hand at him not frantically but i wanted to be sure he saw me the deputy drew his gun it took everything i had not to go for mine but this bugnut was looking for an excuse i wasnt going to give it to him if he shot me anyway i was going to be pissed his gun was a magnum great for whale hunting it was overkill for anything on two legs that was human i felt very human staring down that gun barrel my eyes flicked up to his face he wasnt frowning anymore he looked very determined and very sure of himself as if he could pull the trigger and not get caught i wanted to yell for dolph again but didnt the fool might pull the trigger at this distance with that caliber of weapon i was dead meat all i could do was stand there in the snow my feet going slowly numb hands gripping the car at least he hadnt asked me to put my hands up guess he didnt want me to fall down again until he splattered my brains all over the new paint job it was detective clive perry who walked towards us his dark face reflected the lights like ebony he was tall though not as tall as the deputy from hell his slender frame was enclosed in a pale camelshair coat a hat that matched it perfectly sat atop his head it was a nice hat and couldnt be pulled low enough to cover his ears most nice hats couldnt be you had to get a toboggan hat something knit that would ruin your hair to keep your ears warm not stylish of course i wasnt wearing a hat at all didnt want to muss my hair dolph had gone back to yelling at someone i couldnt tell exactly what color uniform he was yelling at there were at least two flavors to choose from i caught a glimpse of a wildly gesturing arm the rest of the man lost behind the small crowd id never seen anybody wave their fists in dolphs face when youre six foot eight and built like a wrestler most people are a little afraid of you probably wise ms blake were not quite ready for you perry said he always called everyone by title and last name he was one of the most polite people id ever met softspoken hardworking courteous so what had he done to end up on the spook squad the squads full title was the regional preternatural investigation team they handled all preternaturalrelated crime in the area a sort of permanent floating special task force i dont think anyone planned on the squad actually solving cases their success rate was high enough that dolph had been invited to lecture at quantico lecturing to the fbis preternatural research branch was not shabby i kept staring at the deputy and his gun i wasnt going to glance away a second time i didnt really believe hed shoot me but i wasnt sure there was something in his face that said hed do it that maybe he wanted to do it you give some people a gun and they turn into bullies legally armed bullies hello detective perry the deputy here and i seem to have a problem deputy aikensen do you have your gun out perrys voice was soft calm a voice to talk jumpers off of ledges or madmen out of hostages aikensen turned his head glancing back at perry no civilians allowed at a murder scene sheriffs orders i dont think sheriff titus meant for you to shoot the civilians deputy he glanced back at perry you making fun of me there was enough time i could have pulled my gun i wanted to shove it in his ribs i wanted him disarmed but i behaved myself it took more willpower than was pretty but i didnt draw my gun i wasnt ready to kill the son of a bitch if you draw guns there is always the chance someone will end up dead unless you want someone dead you dont draw simple as that but it hurt something deep down inside when the deputy turned back to me with his gun still out so far my ego was taking a lot of bruising but i could live with that and so could deputy aikensen sheriff said i wasnt to let anybody but police into the perimeter perimeter was a pretty fancy word for someone this stupid of course it was a military term hed probably been dying to use it in conversation for years deputy aikensen this is our preternatural expert anita blake he shook his head no civvies unless the sheriff okays it perry glanced back towards dolph and what i now assumed was the sheriff hes not even allowing us near the body deputy what do you think the chances are of sheriff titus saying a civilian can see the body aikensen grinned then most unpleasant slim and none he still held the gun very steady on the middle of my body he was enjoying himself put the gun away and ms blake will leave perry said i opened my mouth to say the hell i will but perry gave a small shake of his head i kept quiet he had a plan better than what i had i dont take orders from no nigger detective jealous i said what that hes a big city detective and youre not i dont have to take crap from you either bitch ms blake please let me handle this you cant handle shit aikensen said youve been totally uncooperative and rude you and your sheriff you can call me all the names you like if that makes you feel better but i cant let you point a gun at one of our people a look passed over aikensens face i could see the thought flicker into life perry was a cop too he probably had a gun and aikensen had his back to him the deputy whirled bringing the gun up as he moved his hand flexed i went for my gun perrys empty hands were held out from his body showing he was unarmed aikensen was breathing hard he raised the gun to head level twohanded steady no hurry someone noticed us and yelled what the fuck indeed i pointed the browning at aikensens back freeze aikensen or i will blow you away youre not armed i clicked the hammer back on a doubleaction you dont need to do that before you fire but it makes a nice dramatic sound you didnt frisk me asshole people were running towards us shouting but they wouldnt get here in time it was just the three of us in the psychedelic snow waiting put the gun down aikensen now no put it down or ill kill you anita you dont need to shoot hes not going to hurt me perry said it was the only time hed ever used my first name i dont need no nigger protecting me his shoulders tensed i couldnt see his hands well enough to be sure but i thought he was pulling the trigger i started to squeeze the trigger a bellowing voice yelled aikensen put that damn gun down aikensen pointed the gun skyward just like that he hadnt been pulling the trigger at all he was just jumpy i felt a giggle at the back of my throat id almost shot him for being twitchy i swallowed the laugh and eased off the trigger did deputy numbnuts know how close hed come the only thing that had saved him was the brownings trigger it was stiff there were a lot of guns out there where a tiny squeeze was all you needed he turned towards me gun still out but not pointed mine was still pointed he started to lower his weapon to point it back at me if that barrel drops another inch im going to shoot you aikensen i said put the damn gun up before you get somebody killed the man that went with the voice was about five foot six and must have weighed over two hundred pounds he looked perfectly round like a sausage with arms and legs his winter jacket strained over his round little tummy a clear grey stubble decorated his double chins his eyes were small nearly lost in the doughiness of his face his badge glittered on his jacket front he hadnt left it inside on his shirt hed pinned it outside where the big city detectives couldnt miss it sort of like unzipping your fly so company could see you were wellendowed this nigger we dont hold with talk like that deputy you know that from the look on aikensens face youd have thought the sheriff had told him there was no santa claus i was betting the sheriff was a good ol boy in the worst sense of the word but there was intelligence in those beady little eyes more than you could say for aikensen put it away boy thats an order his southern accent was getting thicker either for show or because he was getting teed off at aikensen a lot of peoples accents got stronger under stress it wasnt a missouri accent something further south aikensen finally reluctantly put up the gun he didnt snap the holster closed though he was cruising for a bruising i was just glad i hadnt been the one to give it to him of course if id pulled the trigger before aikensen had raised his gun skyward id never have known he wasnt pulling his trigger too if wed all been cops with aikensen as a criminal it would have gone down as a clean shoot jesus sheriff titus put his hands in the pockets of his jacket and looked at me now miss you can put your gun away too aikensen here isnt going to shoot nobody i just stared at him gun pointed skyward held loose i had been ready to put the gun away until he told me to do it im not big on being told anything i just stared at him his face still looked friendly but his eyes lost their shine angry he didnt like being defied great made my night three other deputies gathered at tituss back they all looked sullen and ready to do anything their sheriff asked them to do aikensen stepped over to them hand hovering near his freshly bolstered gun some people never learn anita put the gun away dolphs usual pleasant tenor was harsh with anger like what he wanted to say was shoot the son of a bitch but it would be hard to explain to his superiors though not officially my boss i listened to dolph hed earned it i put the gun away dolph was made up of blunt angles his black hair was cut very short leaving his ears naked to the cold his hands were plunged into the pockets of a long black trench coat the coat looked too thin for the weather but maybe it was lined though he was a little too bulky to leave room for him and a lining in the same coat he beckoned perry and me to one side and said softly tell me what happened we did you really think he was going to shoot you perry stared down at the trampled snow for a moment then looked up im not sure sergeant anita i thought he was dolph you dont sound sure now the only thing im sure of is that i was going to shoot him i was squeezing down on him dolph what the hell is going on if i end up killing a cop tonight id like to know why i didnt think anybody was stupid enough to pull a weapon dolph said his shoulders hunched the cloth of his coat straining to hold the movement well dont look now i said but deputy aikensen has still got his hand right over his weapon hes just aching to draw it again dolph drew a large breath in through his nose and let it out in a white whoosh of breath from his mouth lets go talk to sheriff titus weve been talking to the sheriff for over an hour perry said he isnt listening i know detective i know dolph kept walking towards the waiting sheriff and his deputies perry and i followed what else could we do besides i wanted to know why an entire crimescene unit was standing around twiddling their thumbs perry and i took a post to either side of dolph like sentries without thinking about it we were both a step back from him he was after all our leader but the automatic staging irked me made me want to step forward be an equal but i was a civvie i wasnt equal no matter how much i hung around or did i wasnt a cop it made a difference aikensens hand was gripping the butt of his gun tight would he actually draw down on all of us surely even he wasnt that stupid he was glaring at me nothing but anger showed in his eyes maybe he was that stupid titus tell your man there to get his hand away from his gun dolph said titus glanced at aikensen he sighed aikensen get your damned hand away from your damn gun shes a civilian she drew on a policeman youre lucky she didnt shoot your ass titus said now fasten the holster and tone it down a notch or im going to make you go home aikensens face looked even more sullen but he fastened his holster and plunged his hands into the pockets of his coat unless he had a derringer in his pocket we were safe of course he was just the sort of yahoo that would carry a backup weapon truthfully sometimes so did i but only when the alligator factor was high neck deep instead of ass deep footsteps crunched through the snow behind us i turned halfway so i could keep an eye on aikensen and see the new arrivals three people in navy blue uniforms came to stand on the other side of us the tall man in front had a badge on his hat that said police chief one of his deputies was tall so thin he looked gaunt and too young to shave the second deputy was a woman surprise surprise im usually the only female at a crime scene she was small only a little taller than i thin with closecropped hair hidden under her smokey bear hat the only thing i could tell in the flashing lights was that everything on her was pale from her eyes to her hair she was pretty in a pixielike way cute she stood with her feet apart hands on her sam brown belt she was carrying a gun that was a little too big for her hands i was betting she wouldnt like being called cute she was either going to be another pain in the ass like aikensen or a kindred spirit the police chief was at least twenty years older than either deputy he was tall not as tall as dolph but then who was he had a saltandpepper mustache pale eyes and was ruggedly handsome one of those men who might not have been very attractive as a young man but age had given his face character depth like sean connery who was better looking at sixty than he had been at twenty titus why dont you let these good people get on with their work were all cold and tired and want to go home tituss small eyes flared to life a lot of anger there this is county business garroway not city business you and your people are out of your jurisdiction holmes and lind were on their way into work when the call came over the radio that somebody had found a body your man aikensen here said he was tied up and couldnt get to the body for at least an hour holmes offered to sit with the body and make sure the crime scene stayed pure my deputies didnt touch anything or do anything they were just babysitting the crime scene for your people what is wrong with that garroway said garroway the murder was found on our turf it was our body to take care of we didnt need any help and you had no right to call in the spook squad without clearing it with me first titus said police chief garroway spread his hands in a pushaway gesture holmes saw the body she made the call she thought the man hadnt been killed by anything human protocol is we call in the regional preternatural investigation team anytime we suspect supernatural activity well aikensen and troy here dont think it was anything supernatural a hunter gets eaten up by a bear and your little lady there jumps the gun holmes opened her mouth but the chief held up a hand its all right holmes she settled back down but she didnt like it why dont we ask sergeant storr here what he thinks killed the man garroway said i was close enough to hear dolph sigh she had no right to let people near the body without us there to supervise titus said dolph said gentlemen we have a dead body in the woods the crime scene is not getting any younger valuable evidence is being lost while we stand here and argue a bear attack is not a crime scene sergeant titus said ms blake is our preternatural expert if she says it was a bear attack well all go home if she says it was preternatural you let us do our job and treat it as a crime scene agreed ms blake ms anita blake dolph nodded titus squinted at me as if trying to bring me into focus youre the executioner some people call me that yeah this little bit of a girl has over a dozen vampire kills under her belt there was laughter in his voice disbelief i shrugged it was actually higher than that now but a lot of them were unsanctioned kills not something i wanted the police to know about vampires have rights and killing them without a warrant is murder im the legal vampire executioner for the area you got a problem with that anita dolph said i glanced at him then back at the sheriff i wasnt going to say anything more honest but he did i just dont believe a little thing like yourself coulda done all the things ive heard look its cold its late let me see the body and we can all go home i dont need a civilian woman to tell me my job thats it i said anita dolph said that one word told me not to say it not to do it whatever it was we have licked enough jurisdictional butt for one night dolph a man appeared offering us steaming mugs on a tray the smell of coffee mingled with the scent of snow the man was tall there was a lot of that going around tonight a lock of whiteblond hair obscured one eye he wore round metalframed glasses that made his face look even younger than it was a dark toboggan hat was pulled low over his ears thick gloves a multicolored parka jeans and hiking boots completed his outfit he didnt look fashionable but he was dressed for the weather my feet had gone numb in the snow i took a mug of coffee gratefully if we were going to stand out here and argue hot anything sounded like a great idea thanks the man smiled youre welcome everybody was taking a mug but not everybody was saying thank you where were their manners ive been sheriff of this county since before you were born ms blake its my county i dont need any help from the likes of you he sipped his coffee he had said thank you the likes of me whats that supposed to mean let it go anita i looked up at dolph i didnt want to let it go i sipped at the coffee the smell alone made me feel less angry more relaxed i stared into tituss little piggy eyes and smiled whats so funny he asked i opened my mouth to say you but the coffee man interrupted im samuel williams im the caretaker here i live in the little house behind the nature center i found the body he held his nowempty tray down at his side im sergeant storr mr williams these are my associates detective perry and ms blake williams dunked his head in acknowledgment you know all of us samuel titus said yes i do williams said he didnt seem too excited about knowing them all he nodded at chief garroway and his deputies i told deputy holmes that i didnt think it was a natural animal i still dont but if it is a bear it slaughtered that man any animal thatll do that once will do it again he looked down at the snow then up like a man rising from deep water it ate parts of that man it stalked him and treated him like a prey animal if it really is a bear it needs to be caught before it kills somebody else samuel here has a degree in biology titus said so do i i said of course my degree was in preternatural biology but hey biology is biology right im working on my doctorate williams said yeah studying owl shit aikensen said it was hard to tell but i think williams blushed im studying the feeding habits of the barred owl i had a degree in biology i knew what that meant he was collecting owl shit and regurgitated pellets to dissect so aikensen was right sort of will your doctorate be in ornithology or strigiology i asked i was proud of myself for remembering the latin name for owls williams looked at me with a sense of kinship in his eyes ornithology titus looked like hed swallowed a worm i dont need no college degree to know a bear attack when i see it the last reported bear sighting in st gerard county was in williams said i dont think theres ever been a bear attack reported the implication just sat there how did titus know a bear attack from beans if hed never seen one titus threw his coffee out on the snow listen here college boy maybe it is a bear dolph said we all looked at him titus nodded thats what ive been saying then you better order up a helicopter and get some dogs out here what are you talking about an animal thatd slice up a man and eat him might break into houses no telling how many people the bear might kill dolphs face was unreadable just as serious as if he believed what he was saying now i dont want to get dogs down here start a panic if people thought there was a mad bear loose remember how crazy everyone got when that pet cougar got loose about five years ago people were shooting at shadows dolph just looked at him we all looked at him if it was a bear he needed to treat it like a bear if it wasnt titus shifted uncomfortably in his heavy boots in the snow maybe ms blake ought to have a look he rubbed the cold tip of his nose wouldnt want to start a panic for the wrong reasons he didnt want people to think there was a rampaging bear on the loose but he didnt mind people thinking there was a monster on the loose or maybe sheriff titus didnt believe in monsters maybe whatever we were on our way to the murder scene possible murder scene i made everyone wait while i put on my nikes and the coveralls that i kept for crime scenes and vampire stakings hated getting blood on my clothes besides tonight the coveralls were warmer than hose titus made aikensen stay with the cars hoped he didnt shoot anybody while we were gone i didnt see the body at first all i saw was the snow it had pooled into a deep drift in one of those hollows that you find in the woods in spring the holes fill with rain and mud in fall they pile deep with leaves in winter they hold the deepest snow the moonlight carved each footprint every scuff mark into high relief every print filled like a cup with blue shadows i stood at the edge of the clearing staring down at the mishmash of tracks somewhere in all this were the murderers tracks or a bears tracks but unless it was an animal i didnt know how anyone was going to figure out which tracks were significant maybe all crime scenes were tracked up this much the snow just made it obvious or maybe this scene had been screwed over yeah every track cop or not led to one thingthe body dolph had said the man had been sliced up eaten i didnt want to see it id been having a very good time with richard a pleasant evening it wasnt fair to end the night by looking at partially eaten bodies of course the dead man probably thought being eaten hadnt been much fun either i took a deep breath of the cold air my breath fogged as i exhaled i couldnt smell the body if itd been summer the dead man would have been ripe hurrah for the cold you planning to look at the body from here titus said no i said looks like your expert is losing her nerve sergeant i turned to titus his round doublechinned face was smug pleased with itself i didnt want to see the body but losing my nerve never you better hope this isnt a murder scene sheriff because it has been fucked twenty ways to sunday youre not helping anything anita dolph said softly he was right but i wasnt sure i cared you got any suggestions for preserving the crime scene or can i just march straight in like the fifty billion people before me there were only four sets of footprints when i was ordered to leave the scene officer holmes said titus frowned at her when i determined it was an animal attack there was no reason to keep it secure his southern accent was getting thicker again yeah right i said i glanced at dolph any suggestions just walk in i dont think theres much to preserve now you criticizing my men titus said no dolph said im criticizing you i turned away so titus wouldnt see me smile dolph doesnt suffer fools gladly hell put up with them a little longer than i will but once youve reached his limit run for cover no bureaucratic ass will be spared i stepped into the hollow dolph didnt need my help to hand titus his head on a platter the snow collapsed at the edge of the hole my feet slid on the leaves underfoot i ended on my butt for the second time tonight but i was on a slope now i slid almost all the way to the body laughter bubbled up behind me i sat on my ass in the snow and stared at the body they could laugh all they wanted it was funny the dead man wasnt he lay on his back in the snow the moonlight shone down on the body reflecting on the snow and giving the luster of midday to objects below i had a penlight in one of the coveralls pockets but i didnt need it or maybe didnt want it i could see enough for now ragged furrows ran down the right side of his face one claw had sliced over the eye spilling blood and thick globs of eyeball down his cheek the lower jaw was crushed as if some great hand had grabbed it and squeezed it made the face look unfinished only half there it must have hurt like hell but it hadnt killed him mores the pity his throat had been torn out that had probably killed him the flesh was just gone his spine shone a dull white like hed swallowed a ghost and it hadnt gotten away his camouflage coveralls were ripped away from his stomach some trick of the moonlight threw a thick shadow inside that ripped cloth i couldnt see the damage inside i needed to i prefer night kills darkness steals the color somehow it just isnt as real at night shine some light on it and the colors explode the blood is crimson the bone sparkles fluids are not just dark but green yellow brown light lets you differentiate a mixed blessing at best i slipped the surgical gloves on they were a cool second skin even riding in my inner pocket the gloves were cooler than my skin the penlight snapped on its tiny yellowish beam was dimmed by the bright moonlight but cut through the shadows like a knife the mans clothing had been peeled away like the layers of an onion coveralls pants and shirt thermal underwear the flesh was torn the light glinted on frozen blood and gobbets of icy flesh most of the internal organs were gone i shone the light on the surrounding snow but there was nothing to see the flesh organs were gone the intestine had leaked dark fluid all over the cavity but it was frozen solid i smelled no odor as i leaned over cold was a wonderful thing the edges of the wound were ragged no knife had done this or if it had it was like no blade id ever seen the medical examiner could tell for sure a rib had been broken it pointed upward like an exclamation mark i shone the light on the bone it was chipped but not claws not hands teeth i would have bet a weeks pay that i was looking at tooth marks the throat wound was crusted with frozen snow reddish ice crystals had frozen to his face the remaining eye was frozen shut with bloody ice there were tooth marks at each side of the throat wound not claws the crushed jaw bore clear imprint of teeth it certainly wasnt human teeth which meant it wasnt ghouls vampires zombies or any other human undead i had to hike my coat up to fish the tape measure out of the coverall pocket it would have looked better if id taken the time to unbutton my coat but hey it was cold the claw marks on the face were wide ripping things wider than a bears claws wider than anything natural monstrously large there was a nearly perfect imprint of teeth on either side of the jaw as if the creature had bitten down hard but not tried to tear biting to crush biting to stop the screaming cant make a lot of noise with the entire bottom half of your mouth crushed there was something very deliberate about that one bite the throat was torn away but again not as bad as it could be just enough to kill it was only when you got to the stomach that the creature had lost control the man was dead before the stomach was opened id have bet on that but the creature took the time to eat the stomach to feed why there was an imprint in the snow near the body the imprint showed where people had knelt in it me included but the light picked up blood drained into the snow hed been facedown when someone rolled him over the footprints had tracked through nearly every inch of snow except for the blood splatters given a choice people wont walk through blood crime scene or not there wasnt nearly as much blood as youd expect slicing a throat is messy business but of course this throat hadnt been sliced it had been ripped out by teeth the blood had gone into the mouth not onto the snow the blood had soaked into the clothing if we could find our creature it would be covered in blood too the snow was surprisingly clean for the amount of carnage there was a thick pool of blood to one side at least a yard from the body but right next to the bodysize impression the dead man had lain by that stain long enough to bleed quite a bit then been rolled over on its stomach where it had lain long enough for the skin to freeze to the snow more blood had pooled underneath the body while it lay facedown now here the body lay faceup but no fresh blood the body hadnt been turned over the last time until after he was very dead i called up who rolled the body over it was just like that when i came on the scene titus said holmes chief garroway made her name a question he was faceup when we got here did williams move the body i didnt ask she said great someone moved him itd be good to know if it was williams ill go ask him holmes said patterson you go with her titus said i dont need holmes just go garroway said the two deputies left i went back to looking at the body had to think of it as a body couldnt call it a him if i did that id begin to wonder if he had a wife kids i didnt want to know it was just a body so much meat dont i wish i shone the penlight on the mishmashed snow i stayed on my knees nearly crawling on the snow me and sherlock holmes if the creature had come up behind the man there should have been some mark in the snow maybe not a whole print but something every print i found wore shoes whatever had done this hadnt worn shoes even with a herd of squabbling cops trampling through there should have been some imprint of claws and animal tracks i couldnt find any maybe the crime techs would have better luck i hoped so if there were no prints could it have flown in a gargoyle maybe it was the only large winged predator that attacked man except for dragons but they werent native to this country and it would have been a hell of a lot messier or maybe a lot neater a dragon would simply have swallowed the man whole gargoyles will attack and kill a man but its rare besides the nearest pack was in kelly kentucky the kelly gargoyles were a small subspecies that had attacked people but never killed they were mostly carrion eaters in france there were three species of gargoyles that were mansized or better theyd eat you but thered never been anything that large in america what else could it be there were a few lesser eastern trolls in the ozarks but not this close to st louis besides id seen pictures of troll kills and this wasnt it the claws were too curved too long the stomach looked like it had been cleaned out by something with a muzzle trolls looked frightfully human but then they were primates a lesser troll wouldnt attack a human if it had a choice a greater mountain troll might have but they had been extinct for more than twenty years also they had a tendency to snap off trees and whap people to death then eat them i didnt think it was anything as exotic as trolls or gargoyles if thered been tracks leading up to the body id have been sure it was a lycanthrope kill trolls had been known to wear castoff clothing so a troll could have tramped through the snow or a gargoyle could have flown up but a lycanthrope they had to walk on naked feet that wouldnt fit any human shoe so how i would have slapped my forehead but didnt if you do that at murder scenes you got blood in your hair i looked up humans almost never look up millions of years of evolution had conditioned us to ignore the sky nothing was big enough to take us from above but that didnt mean something couldnt jump on us a tree branch snaked out over the hollow the penlight picked out fresh white scars against the black limb a shapeshifter had crouched on the bark waiting for the man to walk underneath ambush premeditation murder dolph could you come down here a minute dolph walked carefully down the snowcovered slope didnt want to repeat my performance i guess you know what it is shapeshifter i said explain he had his trusty notebook out pen poised i explained what id found what i thought we havent had a rogue lycanthrope since the squad was formed are you sure about this im sure its a shapeshifter but i didnt say it was a lycanthrope explain all lycanthropes are shapeshifters by definition but not all shapeshifters are lycanthropes lycanthropy is a disease that you catch from surviving an attack or getting a bad batch of lycanthropy vaccine he looked at me you can get it from the vaccine it happens good to know he said how can you be a shapeshifter and not a lycanthrope most often an inherited condition the family guardian dog beast giant cat mostly european one person a generation has the genes and changes is that tied to the moon like normal lycanthropy no a family guardian comes out when the family needs it war or some kind of physical danger there are swanmanes they are tied to the moon but its still an inherited condition that it you can be cursed but thats really rare why i shrugged youve got to find a witch or something with magic powerful enough to curse somebody with shapeshifting ive read spells for personal shapeshifting the potions are so full of narcotics that you might believe you were an animal you might also believe you were the chrysler building or you might just die real spells for it are a lot more complex and usually require a human sacrifice a curse is a step up from a spell its not really a spell at all i tried to think how to explain it in this area dolph was the civvie he didnt know the lingo a curse is like the ultimate act of will you just gather all your power magic whatever and focus it on one person you will them to be cursed you always do it in person so they know its been done some theories think it takes the victims belief to make a curse work im not sure i buy that are witches the only people that can curse people occasionally somebody will run afoul of a fairy one of the old daoine sidhe but youd have to be in europe for that england ireland parts of scotland in this country itd be a witch so a shapeshifter but we dont know what kind or even how they got to be a shapeshifter not from a few marks and tracks no if you saw the shifter facetoface could you tell what kind they were what animal i asked yeah nope could you tell if theyd been cursed or if it was a disease nope he just looked at me youre usually better than this im better with the dead dolph give me a vamp or a zombie and ill tell you their social security number some of that is natural talent but a lot of it is practice i havent had as much experience with shapeshifters what questions can you answer ask and find out i said you think this is a brandnew shapeshifter dolph asked nope why not the first time you change on the night of the full moon its too early for a brandnew shifter but it could be a second or third month but but what if this is still a lycanthrope that cant control itself that kills indiscriminately it should still be here hunting us dolph glanced out into the darkness he held his notebook and pen in one hand right hand free for his gun the movement was automatic dont sweat it dolph if it was going to eat more people it would have taken williams or the deputies his gaze searched the darkness then came back to me so the shapeshifter could control itself i think so then why kill the man i shrugged why does anyone kill lust greed rage the animal form used as a murder weapon then dolph said yeah is it still in animal form this was done by a halfandhalf form sort of a wolfman a werewolf i shook my head i cant tell what sort of animal it is the wolfman was just an example it could be any sort of mammal just a mammal these wounds yeah i know there are avian weres but they dont do this sort of damage so werebirds yeah but thats not what did this any guesses i squatted beside the body stared at it willed it to tell me its secrets three nights from hence when the soul had finally flown far away i might have tried to raise the man and ask what did this but his throat was gone even the dead cant talk without the proper equipment why did titus think it was a bear kill i asked dolph thought about that for a minute i dont know lets ask him dolph nodded be my guest he sounded just a wee bit sarcastic if id been arguing with the sheriff for hours id have been a large chunk o sarcastic come on dolph we cant know less than we do right now if titus has any say in it we might do you want me to ask him or not ask i called up to the waiting men sheriff titus he looked down at me hed gotten out a cigarette but hadnt lit it yet he paused with a lighter halfway to his mouth you want something ms blake the cigarette bobbed in his lips as he spoke why do you think this is a bear attack he snapped the lid on his lighter and took the unlit cig out of his mouth with the same hand why do you want to know i wanted to say just answer the damn question but i didnt brownie point for me just curious it wasnt a mountain lion a cat would have used its claws more scratched him up some why not a wolf pack animal looks like only one animal to me i had to agree with all the above i think youve been holding out on us sheriff you seem to know a lot about animals that arent native to this area i go hunting now and then ms blake need to know the habits of your prey if you want to bag one so a bear by process of elimination i asked you might say that he put the cig back in his mouth flame flared pulsing against his face when he flipped the lighter closed the darkness seemed thicker what do you think it was ms expert the smell of his cigarette carried on the cold air shapeshifter even in the darkness i could feel the weight of his eyes he blew a ghostly cloud of smoke moonward you think so i know so i said he gave a sharp hmph sound awful sure of yourself aint ya you want to come down here sheriff ill show you what ive found he hesitated then shrugged why not he came down the slope like a bulldozer heavy boots forming snowy wakes okay ms expert dazzle me you are a pain in the ass titus dolph sighed a white cloud of breath titus thought that was real funny laughed doubled over slapping his leg you are just a laugh a minute ms blake now tell me what you got i did he took a long drag on his cig the end flared bright in the darkness guess it wasnt a bear after all he wasnt going to argue bliss no it wasnt cougar he said sort of hopefully i stood carefully you know it wasnt shapeshifter he said yeah there hasnt been a rogue shapeshifter in this county for ten years how many did it kill i asked he took in a lungful of smoke and blew it out slowly five i nodded i missed that case it was before my time youda been in junior high when it happened yeah he threw his cigarette in the snow and ground it out with his boot i wanted it to be a bear me too i said the night was a hard cold darkness two oclock is a forsaken time of night no matter what the season in middecember two oclock is the frozen heart of eternal night or maybe i was just discouraged the light over the stairs leading up to my apartment shone like a captured moon all the lights had a frosted swimming quality slightly unreal there was a haze in the air like an infant fog titus had asked me to stick around in case they found someone in the area i was their best bet for figuring out if the person was a lycanthrope or some innocent schmuck beat the heck out of cutting off a hand to see if there was fur on the inside of the body if you were wrong what did you do apologize there had been some lycanthrope tracks leading up to the murder scene plaster casts had been made and at my suggestion copies were being sent to the biology department at washington university i had almost addressed it to dr louis fane he taught biology at wash u he was one of richards best friends a nice guy a wererat a deep dark secret that might be jeopardized if i started addressing lycanthrope paw prints to him addressing it to the entire department pretty much guaranteed louie would see it that had been my greatest contribution of the night they were still searching when i drove off i had my beeper on if they found a naked human in the snow they could call though if my beeper went off before i got some sleep i was going to be pissed when i shut my car door there was an echo a second car door slammed shut i was tired but it was automatic to search the small parking lot for that second car irving griswold stood four cars down bundled in a dayglo orange parka with a striped muffler trailing around his neck his brown hair formed a frizzy halo to his bald spot tiny round glasses perched on a button nose he looked jolly and harmless and was a werewolf too seemed to be my night for it irving was a reporter on the st louis postdispatch any story about me and animators inc usually had his byline on it he smiled as he walked towards me just your friendly neighborhood reporter yeah right what do you want irving is that any way to greet someone who has spent the last three hours in his car waiting for you what do you want irving maybe if i just kept repeating the question over and over id wear him down the smile faded from his round little face he looked solemn and worried weve got to talk anita will this be a long story he seemed to think about that for a moment then nodded could be then come upstairs ill fix us both some real coffee real coffee as opposed to fake coffee he asked i started for the stairs ill fix you a cup of java thatll put hair on your chest he laughed i realized id made a pun and hadnt meant to i know irving is a shapeshifter ive even seen his wolf form but i forget hes a friend and doesnt seem the least preternatural in human form we sat at the small kitchenette table sipping vanilla nut creme coffee my suit jacket was draped over the back of the kitchen chair it left my gun and shoulder holster exposed i thought you were on a date tonight blake i was some date a girl can never be too careful irving blew on his cup sipping it delicately his eyes had flicked from side to side taking in everything days from now hed be able to describe the room completely down to the nike airs and jogging socks in front of the couch whats up irving great coffee he wouldnt meet my eyes it was a bad sign whats wrong has richard told you anything about marcus your pack leader right irving looked surprised he told you i found out tonight that your alpha is named marcus theres a battle of succession going on marcus wants richard dead richard says he wont fight him oh he fought him all right irving said it was my turn to be surprised then why isnt richard pack leader richard got squeamish he had him blake claws at marcuss throat irving shook his head he thought when marcus recovered they could talk compromise he made a rude sound your boyfriend is an idealist idealist it was almost the same thing as fool jeanclaude and irving agreed they didnt agree on much explain you can move up in the pack hierarchy by fighting you win you go up a notch you lose you stay where you are he took a long sip of coffee eyes closed as if drinking in the warmth until you fight for pack leader let me guess its a fight to the death no killie no new leader he said i shook my head coffee sitting untouched in front of me why are you telling me all this irving why now marcus wants to meet you why didnt richard tell me that himself richard doesnt want you involved why not irving kept answering my questions but the answers werent helping much irving shrugged richard wont give marcus a freaking inch if marcus said black richard would say white why does marcus want to see me i dont know irving said yeah right honest blake i dont know whats going on something big is up and no ones talking to me why not youre a shapeshifter im also a reporter i made the mistake years back of printing an article the lycanthrope i talked to lied said he never gave me permission to quote him he lost his job some of the others wanted to out me too let me lose my job he huddled around his coffee mug eyes distant with remembering marcus said no said i was more valuable to them as a reporter no ones really trusted me since not a forgiving bunch i said i sipped my coffee and found it cooling if i drank it fast enough it would be drinkable barely they never forgive and they never forget irving said sounds like a bad character trait but its one of my founding principles so i couldnt complain much so marcus sent you out here to talk to me about what he wants to meet you to talk some kind of business i got up and refilled my mug a little less sugar this time i was beginning to wake up just from frustration let him make an appointment to come to my office irving shook his head marcus is some hotshot surgeon you know what would happen if even a hint of what he is got out i could understand that you might get away with being a shapeshifter on some jobs doctor was not one of them there was still the dentist in texas that was being sued by a patient said she contracted lycanthropy from him nonsense you didnt get it from having human hands in your mouth but the case hadnt been thrown out people didnt have a lot of sympathy for fur balls treating their kids sparkling teeth okay send someone else to the office surely marcus must trust someone richard has forbidden anyone to contact you i just looked at him forbidden irving nodded anyone lower in the pack order contacts you at their peril i started to smile and stopped he was serious youre not kidding he raised a threefingered salute scouts honor so how come youre here you looking to move up in the pack he paled honest to god he paled me fight richard hell no then richard wont mind you talking to me oh hell mind i frowned is marcus going to protect you richard gave a specific order marcus cant interfere but he ordered you to come see me i said yep whats to stop richard from busting your chops about this irving grinned i thought youd protect me i laughed you son of a bitch maybe but i know you blake you wont like that richards been keeping things from you you certainly wont like him protecting you besides ive been your friend for years i dont think youll stand by while your boyfriend beats the hell out of me irving knew me better than richard did it was not a comforting thought had i been fooled by a handsome face a nice sense of humor had i not seen the real richard i shook my head could i be fooled that completely i hoped not do i have your protection he was still smiling but there was something in his eyes fear maybe you need me to say it out loud for it to be official yeah that a rule in the lycanthrope underground one of them he said you have my protection but i want information in return i told you i dont know anything blake tell me what its like to be a lycanthrope irving richard seems determined to keep me in the dark i dont like being in the dark irving smiled i heard that you be my guide to the world of the furry and ill keep richard off your back agreed when does marcus want to meet tonight irving had the grace to look embarrassed i shook my head no way im going to bed ill meet with marcus tomorrow but not tonight he looked down into his coffee fingertips touching the mug he wants it to be tonight he looked up at me why do you think ive been camped out in my car i am not at the beck and call of every monster in town i dont even know what fur face wants to meet about i leaned back in the chair and crossed my arms no way am i going out tonight to play with shapeshifters irving squirmed in his chair rotating the coffee cup slowly on the table he wouldnt meet my eyes again whats wrong now marcus told me to set up a meeting with you if i refused hed have me punished if i come here richard gets pissed im trapped between two alpha males and i aint up to it are you asking me to protect you from marcus as well as richard no he said shaking his head no youre good blake but you arent in marcuss league glad to hear it i said will you meet with marcus tonight if i say no do you get in trouble he stared into his coffee would you believe no nope he looked at me brown eyes very serious hell get mad but ill live but hell make you hurt it wasnt a question yeah that one word so soft so tentative it wasnt like irving ill see him on one condition that youre present at the meeting his face bloomed into a grin that spread from pole to pole you are a true friend blake all the sadness was gone washed away in the rosy glow of finding out what the hell was going on even ass deep in alligators irving was a reporter it was who and what he was more than the lycanthropy the smile alone was worth a meeting besides i wanted to know if richard was really in danger meeting the man who was threatening him was the only real way to find out also i didnt really care for someone threatening one of my friends silverplated bullets only slowed down a vampire unless you can take out the head and heart silver bullets will kill a werewolf no second chances no healing just dead marcus might remember that if he pushed it i might even remind him irving had called marcus from my apartment again irving didnt know why all he did know was marcus said to call before we came i went into the bedroom hung up my drycleanonly suit and changed clothes black jeans red polo shirt black nikes with a blue swoosh and real socks i abandoned jogging socks for everyday wear once winter set in i reached for the bulky green sweater i had laid out on the bed i hesitated it wasnt the fact that the sweater had stylized christmas trees on it and it might not be the coolest thing to wear i didnt give a damn about that i was debating on whether to carry a second gun a fashion accessory nearer and dearer to my heart than any piece of clothing no lycanthrope had threatened me yet but ol gretchen the vamp had she might not be a master vampire but she was close besides the memory of the cop taking the browning away was still fresh i had too many preternatural enemies to go unarmed i got out my uncle mikes sidekick innerpants holster a comfy fit that didnt ruin the line of your jeans unless someone was really looking my main backup gun is a firestar mm small light pretty to look at and i could wear it at my waist and still be able to sit down the sweater hung to midthigh the gun was invisible unless you frisked me the gun was set in front ready for a crossdraw probably wouldnt need it probably the sweater bulked up around the straps of the shoulder holster ive seen people wear shoulder rigs underneath bulky sweaters or sweatshirts but you lose a few seconds groping under the cloth id rather look less than fashion perfect and live the sweater was too long for my leather jacket so i was back in my black trench coat me and phillip marlowe i didnt take any extra ammo i figured twentyone rounds was enough for one night i even left my knives at home i almost talked myself out of the firestar i usually didnt start carrying two guns until after people had tried to kill me i shrugged why wait if i didnt need it id feel silly tomorrow if i did need it i wouldnt feel silly at all irving was waiting for me sitting on the couch like a good little boy he looked like a schoolboy whom the teacher had made stand in the corner whats wrong marcus wanted me to just give you directions he doesnt want me at the meeting i said you wouldnt come without me that you didnt trust him he looked up at me hes pretty pissed but you stood your ground i said yeah why dont you sound happier about that he shrugged marcus in a bad mood is not a pleasant experience blake ill drive you give directions marcus said we both should drive he said that id need to stay after the meeting for a little talk come on irving im driving youre giving directions and when i leave you leave i appreciate the offer blake but you dont want marcus mad at you if im protecting you from richard i might as well throw in marcus he shook his head no you follow my car he held up a hand no more arguing blake i am a werewolf i have to live in the community i cant afford to make a stand against marcus not over one little talk i wanted to argue some more but i didnt irving knew his problems better than i did if fighting marcus over this would make things worse then id let it go but i didnt like it the lunatic cafe was located in university city its sign was a glowing crescent moon with the restaurant name done in soft blue neon except for the name and the nifty sign the place didnt look much different from all the other shops and restaurants in the college district it was friday night and there was no parking i was beginning to think marcus would have to come out to my car when a wine dark impala pulled out of the two spaces it had been hogging my jeep slipped in with room for a second car on one side irving waited in front of the restaurant his hands were shoved deep into his pockets the ridiculous muffler trailed nearly to the ground he looked distracted and not a bit happy i walked towards him with the trench coat flapping around me like a cape even like this most people wouldnt see the gun theyd see a small woman with a bright christmas sweater people see what they expect to see most of the time the people that i was wearing the gun for would notice and know i was armed irving pushed the door in without a word irving quiet i didnt like seeing him subdued almost beaten like a kicked dog it made me not like marcus and i hadnt even met him noise poured around us just inside the door a murmur of voices so thick it was like ocean noise silverware clinked someone laughed high and bright like a hand rising from the noise to be swallowed back again and lost there was a bar along one wall polished dark wood old and lovingly cared for the rest of the room held small round tables that could comfortably seat about four every seat was full and then some three doorways opened up one beside the bar one to the right one in the middle more tables were shoved into the smaller rooms the cafe had started life as someones home we were standing in the living room through the doorways leading to the other rooms were open archways as if someone had knocked down a few walls even with that the place was claustrophobic people were three deep at the bar waiting for a table the place was jammed to bursting with happy smiling people one of the women behind the bar came around wiping her hands on a towel tucked into the tie of her apron she gave a wide welcoming smile she had a pair of menus in her one hand i started to say but we dont need when irving gripped my arm tension vibrated through his hand hed grabbed my right arm i turned to tell him not to do that but the look on his face stopped me he was staring at the smiling woman as if she had sprouted a second head i turned back to the woman and looked at her really looked at her she was tall slender with long straight hair it was a rich reddish auburn that gleamed under the lights her face was a soft triangle chin maybe a little too pointed but overall she was lovely her eyes were a strange amberbrown that matched her hair perfectly her smile widened just a lift of lips i knew what i was looking at lycanthrope one that could pass for human like richard i looked out over the room and realized why it felt so tight it wasnt just the crowd a majority of the happy smiling people were shapeshifters their energy burned in the air like the weight of a thunderstorm i had thought the crowd was boisterous too loud but it was the shapeshifters their energy boiled and filled the room masquerading as the energy of any crowd as i stood there at the door a face lifted here and there human eyes looked at me but the glance wasnt human the glance was considering testing how tough was i how good would i taste it reminded me of the way richard had been watching the crowd at the fox i felt like a chicken at a coyote convention i was suddenly glad of the second gun welcome to the lunatic cafe ms blake the woman said im raina wallis proprietor if youll follow me your party is waiting for you she said it all with a smile and a warm glow in her eyes irvings grip on my arm was nearly painful i leaned into him and whispered thats my right arm he blinked at me his eyes flicked to the browning and he let go muttering sorry raina leaned closer irving flinched i wont bite irving not yet she gave a low laugh that was rich and bubbling the kind of laugh that was meant for bedrooms and private jokes the laugh gave her eyes and body a different look she suddenly seemed more voluptuous more sensual than just a second ago nicely weird mustnt keep marcus waiting she turned and began threading her way through the tables i glanced at irving something you want to tell me rainas our alpha female if the punishments going to be really bad she does it shes a lot more creative than marcus raina was motioning to us by the archway near the bar her lovely face was frowning looking a little less lovely and a lot more bitchy i patted his shoulder i wont let her hurt you you cant stop it well see i said he nodded but not as if he believed me he started between the tables i followed a woman touched his hand as he walked past gave him a smile she was about my size and dainty with straight black hair cut short that framed her face like black lace irving squeezed her fingers and kept walking her large dark eyes met mine the eyes told me nothing they had smiled at irving for me they were neutral like the eyes of a wolf id seen once in california id walked around a tree and there it had stood i had never really understood what neutral meant until that moment those pale eyes stared at me waiting if i threatened it it would attack if i left it alone it would run my choice the wolf hadnt given a damn which way it turned out i kept walking but the space between my shoulder blades was itching i knew if i turned around that nearly every eye would be on me on us the weight of their gaze was physical i had an urge to whirl and say boo but fought it off i had a feeling they were all staring at me with neutral inhuman eyes and i didnt want to see it raina led us to a closed door at the back of the dining room she pushed it open and motioned us through with a theatrical wave of her arm irving just walked through i walked through but kept my eyes on her i was nearly close enough for her to have hugged me close enough that with her reflexes she could probably take me lycanthropes are just faster than a normal human it isnt mind tricks like with vampires they are just flat out better i wasnt sure how much better in human form though staring up into rainas smiling face i wasnt sure i wanted to find out we stood in a narrow hallway there was a door at either end one showing the cold night through its glass window the other closed a question mark raina closed the door behind us leaning on it she seemed to collapse against it head hanging down hair spilling forward are you all right i asked she took a deep shuddering breath and looked up at me i gasped i couldnt help myself she was gorgeous her cheekbones were high and sculpted her eyes wider and more centered in her face she looked like what might have been her sister a family resemblance but not the same person what did you just do she gave that rich bedroom laugh again i am alpha ms blake i can do a great many things that most shifters cannot i was willing to bet that you moved your bones around on purpose like doityourself cosmetic surgery very good ms blake very good her amberbrown eyes flashed to irving the smile left her face do you still insist on this one being at the meeting yes i do her lips pursed as though shed tasted something sour marcus said to ask then to bring you she shrugged and stood away from the door she was taller by about three inches i wished id paid more attention to her hands had they changed too why the body sculpting i asked the other form is my day form this is real why the disguise in case i have to do something nefarious she said nefarious she stalked down the hall towards the other closed door her walk was a gliding athletic movement like a big cats or would that be big wolfs she knocked on the door i heard nothing but she opened the door she stood there arms crossed over her stomach cradling her breasts smiling at us i was beginning not to like rainas smiles the room was a banquet hall with clothcovered tables grouped in a horseshoe a raised platform with four chairs and a lectern closed the mouth of the horseshoe two men stood on the platform one was at least six feet tall slender but muscled like a basketball player his hair was black cut short with a matching fingerthin mustache and goatee beard he stood with one hand gripping his opposite wrist a jock pose a bodyguard pose he wore a skintight pair of black jeans and a sweater with a blackonblack design clung to wide shoulders there was a fringe of dark chest hair just above the scooped neckline black tooled cowboy boots and a large blocky watch completed the badass look the other man was no more than five foot seven his hair was that funny shade of blond that has brown highlights in it but still manages to be blond the hair was short but styled and blowdried and would have been lovely to look at if it had been a little longer his face was cleanshaven square jawed with a dimple in his chin the dimple should have made the face look fun but it didnt it was a face for rules those thin lips were built for saying my way or else he wore a pale blue linen suit jacket over black pants a pale blue turtleneck that matched the jacket to perfection completed the outfit his shoes were black and polished to a shine it had to be marcus alfred one word but it was an order the bigger man steppedleaped off the platform it was a graceful bounding movement he moved in a cloud of his own vitality it rolled and boiled around him almost like heat rising off pavement you couldnt see it with the naked eye but you could sure as hell feel it alfred came at me as though he had a purpose i put my back to the wall keeping raina in sight along with everybody else irving moved back with me he stood a little away from all of us but closer to me than anyone i put the trench coat back so the gun showed plainly your intentions better be friendly alfred alfred the other man said one word even the tone sounded the same but this time alfie stopped in his tracks he stood staring at me his eyes werent neutral they were hostile people dont usually dislike me on sight but hey i wasnt too thrilled with him either we have not offered you violence ms blake marcus said yeah right alfie there is contained violence in motion i want to know what his intentions are before he comes closer marcus looked at me as if id done something interesting a very apt description ms blake you can see our auras then if thats what you want to call it i said alfreds intentions are not hostile he will merely search you for weapons it is standard procedure for nonshifters it is nothing personal i assure you the very fact that they didnt want me armed made me want to keep my weapons stubbornness or a strong survival instinct maybe id agree to being searched if you explained why im here first stall until i could decide what to do we dont discuss business in front of the press ms blake well im not talking to you without him i will not jeopardize all of us to satisfy idle curiosity he was still standing on the platform like a general surveying his troops the only reason im here at all is because irving is a friend insulting him isnt going to endear you to me i do not wish to endear myself to you ms blake i wish your aid you want my help i didnt try to keep the surprise out of my voice he gave a brief nod what kind of help he must leave no i said raina pushed away from the wall and stalked around us just out of reach but circling like a shark irvings punishment could begin now her voice was low and puffing around the edges i didnt know wolves purred i said she laughed wolves do a lot of things as im sure youre aware i dont know what you mean oh come now woman to woman she leaned one shoulder against the wall arms crossed face friendly i was betting she could bite my finger off and smile just like that the entire time she bent close as if we were sharing secrets richard is as good as he looks isnt he i stared into her amused eyes i dont kiss and tell ill tell you my juicy tidbit if youll tell me yours raina enough marcus had moved forward to the edge of the stage he didnt look happy she gave him a lazy smile she was baiting him more than me and enjoying it very much irving must leave and alfred must search you for weapons there is no negotiating those two points ill make you a deal i said irving leaves now but he goes home no punishment marcus shook his head i have decreed he will be punished my word is law who died and made you king simon raina said i blinked at her he fought and killed simon thats who died and made him pack leader ask a silly question you want my help irving goes free and untouched no punishment dont do this anita irving said youll just make things worse raina stayed leaning beside me just a little girl talk hes right you know right now hes mine to play with but if you make marcus really angry hell give him to alfred ill torture his mind and body alfred will break him irving goes free no punishment i stay and let alfred search me for weapons otherwise we walk not we ms blake you are free to go but irving is mine he will stay and with or without you he will be taught his lesson what did he do wrong i asked that is our business not yours im not going to help you do shit then go he leaped gracefully off the stage walking towards us as he spoke but irving stays you are only among us for this one night he must live with us ms blake he cannot afford your bravado the last sentence brought him just a little behind alfred close up there were fine lines around his eyes and mouth a slackness to the skin of his neck and jaws i added ten years to his age fifties i cant leave irving here knowing what youll do to him oh you have no idea what well do to him raina said we heal so well she pushed away from the wall and walked to irving she paced round him in a tight circle shoulder hip brushing against him here and there as she moved even the weakest of us can take so very much damage what do you want to guarantee irvings safety i asked marcus looked at me face careful neutral you promise to aid us and let alfred frisk you he is my bodyguard you must let him do his job i cant promise to help you without knowing what it is then we have no bargain anita i can take it whatever they dish out i can take it ive done it before you asked for my protection from richard just call it a package deal i said you asked her for her protection raina stepped away from him surprise plain on her pretty face just against richard irving said its clever raina said but it does have certain implications shes not a pack member it only works on richard because theyre dating irving said he looked a little worried what implications i asked marcus answered to ask pack members for their protection is to acknowledge they are of higher rank without having to fight them if they give their protection then you have agreed to help them fight their battles if they are challenged you are honor bound to aid them i glanced at irving he looked ill shes not one of us you cant hold her to the law what law i asked pack law marcus said i forfeit her protection irving said too late raina said you place us in a quandary ms blake a pack member has acknowledged you as higher rank than he is acknowledged you as dominant by our laws we must accept that as binding i cant be a pack member i said no but you can be dominant i knew what the word meant in the real world marcus was using it as if it meant more what does it mean to be dominant it means you can stand as irvings protector against all comers no irving said he brushed past raina and stood in front of marcus he stood tall and stared him in the eye it was not a submissive display i wont let you use me like this its what you intended all along you knew id ask her protection from richard you counted on it didnt you you smug bastard a low growl trickled out from between marcuss perfect white teeth i would watch my tongue if i were you youngling if it offends you i will cut it out alfreds first words were not comforting this was getting out of hand irving is under my protection alfred if i understand the law you have to go through me to hurt irving is that right alfred turned cold dark eyes to me he nodded if you kill me then i cant help marcus this seemed to puzzle the big fella great confusion to my enemies marcus smiled you have found a flaw in my logic ms blake if you truly intend to protect irving to the letter of the law then you would indeed die no mere human could withstand one of us even the lowliest would kill you i let that comment go why argue when i was winning anyway since you cannot accept challenges and you wont let us harm irving he is safe great now what irving can go and he will not be harmed you stay and hear our plea you may decide to aid us or not irving will not suffer for your choice thats mighty generous of you yes ms blake it is there was a look in his eyes that was very serious raina might play sadistic games alfred might hurt you in an eager rush but marcus it was just business he was a mob boss with fur leave us irving i wont leave her marcus turned on him with a snarl my patience is not endless irving dropped to his knees head bowed spine bent low it was a submissive display i grabbed irvings arm and lifted him to his feet get up irving the nice werewolf isnt going to hurt you and why is that ms blake because irvings under my protection if alfred cant fight me then you sure as hell cant marcus threw back his head and gave a sharp barking laugh you are clever and brave traits we admire the laughter died from his face lingering in his eyes like a pleasant dream do not challenge me too openly ms blake it wouldnt be healthy the last of the laughter died out of his eyes i was left staring into human eyes but there was no one home to talk to it looked like a human being talked like a human being but it wasnt one i dug my fingers into irvings parkaclad shoulder go on irving get out of here he touched my arm i would never leave you in a tough spot im safe tonight youre not now go please irving i watched the struggle on his face but finally after another dirty look from marcus he left the door closed and i was alone with three werewolves down from four the night was looking up alfred must search you now so much for the night looking up then do it i said i just stood there i didnt put my arms out i didnt lean against the wall i wasnt going to help him not unless he asked he took the browning then patted down my arms legs even the small of my back he didnt pat down the front center of my body maybe he was being a gentleman or maybe he was just careless whatever he missed the firestar i had eight silver bullets and they didnt know it the night was looking up marcus took a seat on the platform alfred stood just behind him like a good bodyguard join us ms blake it may be a long meeting to stand through i didnt want to sit with alfred at my back so i moved to the last chair the empty chair between us looked unsociable but i was out of alfreds reach safety before good manners raina sat on marcuss right hand on his knee marcus sat in the same manner he did everythingrigid posture that would have made my aunt mattie proud but he didnt move rainas hand in fact he laid his hand over hers love solidarity they didnt strike me as a really compatible couple a woman came through the door short blond hair styled and held in place with gel her business skirt suit was red with pinkish undertones like a rose petal her white blouse had one of those blousy ties that made the suit seem feminine and a little silly christine its good of you to come marcus said the woman nodded and took the seat at the end of the horseshoe of tables nearest the stage what choice did i have what choice did you give any of us she asked we must have a united front on this christine as long as youre in charge right marcus started to say more but the crowd was growing people drifted through the door in ones twos threes he let the argument go they could argue later and i was betting they would the womans complaint sounded like an old one i recognized one person rafael the rat king he was tall dark and handsome with shortcut black hair strong mexican features and an arrogant expression he would have looked as stern as marcus except for his lips they were soft and sensuous and ruined some of the effect rafael nodded at me i nodded back he had two wererats with him in human form i didnt recognize either of them there were about a dozen people sitting along the tables when marcus stood and walked to the podium my friends i have asked you here tonight to meet anita blake the vampires call her the executioner i believe she can help us what can a vampire hunter do for us this from a tall man who sat alone chairs on either side acting as walls he had short white hair cut in a strange mia farrow sixties cut but gentler he wore a white dress shirt pale pink tie white sport jacket and creamcolored pants he looked like the good humor man with money but he had a point we dont need a human to help us this from a man who sat with one other he had hair cut just above his collar so curly it looked like fur or maybe naw he had thick eyebrows over dark eyes with heavy sensual features the rat kings lips may have seemed kissable but this man seemed made for nefarious deeds done in dark places his clothing matched his face the boots that he had propped on the table were of soft velvety leather his pants were of shiny black leather the shirt he was almost wearing was a muscle tank top that left most of his upper body bare his right arm was covered from elbow to fingers in leather straps the knuckles had spikes coming out of them the hair on his chest was as curly and dark as the hair on his head a black duster coat was thrown across the table beside him the woman on his right rubbed her cheek along his shoulder as if it were a cat scent marking long dark hair formed waves around her shoulders what i could see of her outfit looked tight black and mostly of leather we are human here gabriel marcus said gabriel made a rude noise you believe what you want to marcus but we know what we are and what she isnt he pointed at me with his gauntleted fist it didnt seem a particularly friendly gesture rafael stood the gesture stopped the argument there was something about the way he stood there in his ordinary street clothes that made you stare at him as if he were wearing a crown his presence was more commanding than that of a ton of black leather marcus made the lowest of growls too many kings in this room does marcus speak for anita blake as he speaks for the wolves yes marcus said i speak for ms blake i stood up i dont know whats going on but i can speak for myself marcus turned like a small blond storm i am pack leader i am law alfred moved to face me big hands flexing chill out fur face youre not my leader and im not a pack member alfred stalked forward i hopped off the stage i had the gun but i might need it more later if i drew it now i might not have it later he leaped off the stage a high bounding as if hed had a trampoline to jump from i dropped to the ground and rolled i felt the air of his passage i ended up against the stage i went for the firestar and he was on me faster than a speeding bullet faster than anything id ever seen his hand gripped my throat and squeezed his lips drew back from his teeth and made a low rolling growl like the sound a rottweiler would make my hand was on the firestar but i still had to lift up point it and pull the trigger id never make it hed rip my throat out long before i could manage it he drew me to my feet using my throat as a handle his fingers dug in just enough to let me feel the strength in his hands all he had to do was clench his fist and the front of my throat would come with it i kept my hand on the firestar id be clinging to it when i died does alfred fight your battles for you now it was christine of the blousy tie pack leaders must fight all challenges to their dominance personally or forfeit leadership its one of your own laws marcus do not quote my laws back to me woman she challenged your authority over her not alfreds if he kills her is he the new pack leader there was soft derision in her voice release her alfred alfreds eyes flicked to marcus then back to me his fingers tensed digging in and raising me to my tiptoes i said let her go he dropped me i staggered back against the stage and aimed firestar in one movement it wasnt pretty but the gun was out and pointed at alfred if he tried me again i was going to kill him and id enjoy it i thought you checked her for weapons marcus said i did alfred was backing away hands held in front of him as if to ward off a blow i scooted along the stage so i could keep an eye on marcus i caught sight of raina still sitting looking amused i backed away from everyone working to put a wall at my back if marcus was faster than alfred i needed distance like a hundred miles but id have to settle for the far wall have him disarm her raina said she sat there legs crossed hands resting on her knee smiling it was alfreds oversight let him correct it marcus nodded alfred turned his eyes back to me i pressed my back more solidly into the wall as if i could make a door if i pressed hard enough alfred stalked towards me slow like a movie maniac i pointed the gun at his chest i will kill him i said your little bullets cannot hurt me alfred said silverplated glaser safety rounds i said itll blow a hole in your chest big enough to put a fist through he hesitated i can heal any wound even silver not if its a killing blow i said i take out your heart and youre dead he glanced back at marcus marcuss face was all squeezed down with anger you let her bring a gun among us if youre afraid of the gun marcus take it away from her yourself christine again this time i wasnt sure she was helping me we intend you no harm ms blake but i promised the others you would bring no weapons among us i gave my word if you will give alfred your gun this can end no way you are defying me ms blake i cannot let anyone contest my authority he had come to stand at the end of the stage closest to me he was closer to me than alfred i wasnt sure it was an improvement you step off that stage and ill shoot alfred just the name again but it was enough alfred moved up beside him eyes on marcuss face master take it from her alfred she cannot defy us youre going to get him killed marcus i dont think so alfred took a step forward in front of marcus his face was neutral eyes unreadable this is a stupid thing to die over alfie he gives orders i obey it is the way of things dont do this i said alfred took a step forward i took a slow steadying breath i had a peripheral sense of everyone else but i was looking only at alfred at a spot in the center of his chest i am not bluffing i felt him tense knew he was going to do it he was confident that he could move faster than i could pull the trigger nothing was that fast i hoped he leaped in that wide arching roll that hed used earlier i dropped to one knee aiming as i moved the bullet hit him in midair he jerked and crumbled to the floor the gunshot echoed into silence i got to my feet the gun still pointed at him i eased forward he never moved if he was breathing i couldnt see it i knelt until the gun was shoved into the back of his spine no movement i felt for a pulse in his neck nothing i pulled the browning out of his waistband left handed i kept the firestar pointed at everybody i wasnt as good left handed and i didnt want to take the time to switch hands marcus stepped off the stage dont i said he froze staring at me he looked shocked as if he hadnt thought id do it rafael came up through the tables may i look at him sure but i backed away theoretically out of reach rafael turned him over blood had pooled on the floor from the hole in his chest bright crimson rivulets trailed down his lips to mingle with his beard not faster than a speeding bullet after all marcus looked at me over the body i had expected to see anger but all i saw was pain he mourned alfreds passing i may have pulled the trigger but he had pushed alfred into it he knew it i knew it we all knew it you didnt have to kill him he said softly you gave me no choice i said he glanced down at alfreds body then back to me no i suppose i didnt we killed him together you and i for future reference so there will never be another misunderstanding between us marcus i never bluff so you said but you didnt believe me he watched the blood spread across the floor i believe you now we had a body on the ground the ageold question remained what do you do with a dead body there was the traditional approach ill call the cops i said no marcus said that one word had more force in it than anything hed said since alfred hit the ground hes dead folks if id hit him with a regular bullet hed heal but it was silver weve got to call the cops are you so eager to go to jail this from rafael i dont want to go to jail but i killed him i think you had a little help on that christine had moved up beside us she stood there in her rosepetal suit with her sensible black pumps staring down at the body a line of blood trickled towards her shoes she had to see it snaking its way towards her she didnt move out of the way the blood seeped around the toe of her shoe and kept going raina came up behind marcus she put her arms around his shoulders leaning her face against his neck close enough to whisper in his ear those lips did not move but it had been her one needling comment that had pushed things over the edge one little remark marcus rubbed his hand along her arm lowering his face to kiss her wrist i looked around at them rafael was still kneeling by the body a line of blood was making for the knee of his slacks he stood up quickly fingertips brushing the bloody floor he raised the fingers to his mouth i wanted to say dont but didnt he stuck the fingers in his mouth and sucked them clean his dark eyes flicked to me he lowered his hand as if he were embarrassed as if id caught him in an intimate bodily function maybe i had the two leatherclad shapeshifters drifted up behind the tables as if theyd circle me i backed away i still had the guns naked in my hands the one with the spiked glove looked at me a smile playing at the edge of his mouth his eyes were a strange liquid grey his curly black hair had fallen in a tangle over his eyes they bore a startling luminosity peering from behind that black hair he made no move to push his hair from his eyes it would have driven me nuts but then maybe i wasnt accustomed to staring out through fur he stepped closer to the body which was closer to me i raised the guns at this range you didnt really have to aim i did not feel more confident with a gun in each hand fact was i felt silly but i didnt want to lose the time to holster one of them to holster the firestar i had to scoot my sweater up and shove the gun in the innerpants holster i could probably do it without glancing down but i wasnt sure habit might take over like driving a car you dont realize how long you glanced down until that semi truck looms into view if gabriel was as fast as alfred a fraction of a second would be enough his smile widened the tip of his tongue traced his full lips his gaze had heat in it nothing magical just the heat that any man could put into his eyes that look that said they were wondering what you looked like naked and if youd give a good blow job crude but accurate that look was not wanting to make love to anyone the look was pure fucking even sex was too mild a term i fought the urge to turn away i didnt dare take my eyes off of him but i wanted to my skin crawled under his gaze i felt heat creeping up my face i couldnt meet his eyes and not blush my daddyd raised me better than that he took a step forward a small movement but it put him almost in arms reach with alfreds body still warm he was playing with me i raised the guns a little more firmly pointed at him lets not do this again i said gabriel leave her alone christine said he glanced back at her tyger tyger burning bright in the forests of the night what immortal hand or eye could frame thy fearful symmetry stop it gabriel she said she was blushing one stanza of blake and she was embarrassed why that poem a weretiger maybe but who was the kitty cat maybe both he turned back to me i watched something slide behind his eyes some streak of perversity that made him want to take that next step try me tonight and youre going to join your friend on the floor he laughed mouth wide exposing pointed canines top and bottom like a cat not fangs but not human either ms blake is under my protection marcus said you will not harm her you let alfred nearly throttle me then you goad him into attacking me i dont think much of your protection marcus i think i do just fine on my own without those little guns you wouldnt be so tough this from the brunette biker chick brave words but she was standing on the other side of the little crowd im not going to offer to arm wrestle you i know im outclassed without a gun thats why ive got them you refuse my protection marcus asked yeah i said you are a fool raina said maybe but im still the one with the guns gabriel laughed again she doesnt believe you can protect her marcus and shes right you question my dominance gabriel turned giving me his back staring at marcus always marcus moved forward but raina tightened her grip on him weve aired enough dirty laundry in front of ms blake for one night dont you think he hesitated gabriel just stared at him finally marcus nodded gabriel gave a purring laugh and knelt down by the body he smeared his fingers through the blood it cools so fast he wiped his hand on alfreds sweater and touched the open chest wound he ran his hand around the edge as though he were scooping icing from a bowl his hand came out crimson he raised it to his mouth blood dripping down his arm his tongue licked along his bloody fingers stop it marcus said the woman knelt on the other side of the body she knelt lowering her torso butt in the air like lions drinking at watering holes she lapped up the blood from the floor with quick sure movements of her tongue jesus i whispered there was movement in the room like a wind over a field of wheat they were all out of their seats they were all moving towards the body i stepped back put the wall at my back and began working my way towards the door if there was going to be a feeding frenzy i didnt want to be the only nonshapeshifter in the room didnt seem healthy no marcuss voice roared through the room he stalked to the body pushing everyone back without a gesture even gabriel rolled back onto his left side propped up sitting in the blood the woman crawled back out of reach gabriel stayed within touching distance of the master werewolf he gazed up at marcus but there was no fear on his face we are not animals to feed on our dead we are animals gabriel said he raised his bloody hand towards marcus smell the blood and tell me you dont want it marcus jerked his head away swallowing hard enough for me to hear it gabriel rose to his knees pressing the blood close to marcuss face he slapped the hand away but stepped away from the body too i smell the blood his voice was very harsh when he said it every word squeezed out through a low growl but i am a human being that means i do not have to give in to my urges he turned his back on the body pushed his way through the crowd having to step up on the stage to find a clear place to stand his breathing was hard and fast as if hed been running as fast as he could i was about halfway behind the podium i could see his face beads of sweat touched his skin i had to get out of here the whitehaired man who had spoken first wondering what good a vampire executioner would be to them was standing apart from the others he was leaning against a table arms crossed he was watching me from across the room he could watch all he wanted to i had the guns out and pointed at everybody there wasnt anyone in this room that i wanted to be around unarmed i was almost at the door i needed a free hand for the door i was nearly the length of the room away from them it was as far away as i could get without opening the door i holstered the firestar transferred the browning to my right hand i slid my left hand behind me along the wall until i touched the doorknob i turned the knob and opened the door a crack i was far enough away from all of them that i gave the room my back and opened the door wide and stopped the hallway was four deep with lycanthropes they were all staring at me with wide haunted eyes i pressed the browning into the chest of the nearest one back up he just stared at me as if he didnt understand what id said his eyes were brown and perfectly human but it reminded me of the look a dog gets when its trying to understand english it wants to understand but just doesnt quite get it there was movement behind me i slammed my back against the door pressing it flat to the wall gun scanning the room if the shapeshifters in the hallway surged forward i was gone i could shoot some of them but not all of them it was the man whod been leaning against the table he put his hands up to show himself unarmed but that didnt really help what helped was there was no sweat on his face he didnt look glassy eyed like the ones in the hall he looked very human my name is kaspar gunderson do you need a little help i glanced at the waiting horde and back to him sure kaspar smiled youll take my help but not marcuss he seemed amused marcus doesnt offer help he gives orders too true rafael moved up beside him none of us takes orders from marcus though he would like us to a sound somewhere between a moan and a howl broke from the crowd in the hall i scooted a little farther down the wall pointing the gun at the crowd there were too many possible dangers i had to pick someone to trust rafael and the other man seemed a better choice than the crowd a high ragged scream broke from inside the room i shoved my back into the wall and turned back to the room what now i caught a glimpse of thrashing limbs through the huddled lycanthropes the darkhaired woman threw back her head and shrieked shes fighting it the pale man said yes but she will not win unless a dominant steps in to help her rafael said gabriel wont help no rafael said he enjoys the show its not full moon yet what the hells happening i said the scent of blood started it gabriel fed it he and elizabeth now unless marcus can control them they may all turn and feed rafael said and this is a bad thing i asked rafael just looked at me his hands gripped his forearms so tightly the skin paled his shortclipped fingernails bit into the skin and tiny little half circles of blood formed under his hands he took a deep cleansing breath and nodded he removed his fingers from his arms the cuts filled with blood but only a few trickled minor cuts minor pain pain sometimes helped keep a vamp from controlling your mind his voice came out strained but clear each word pronounced with great care as if it took great effort just to speak one of the old wives tales that is true is that a lycanthrope has to feed after shapeshifting his eyes stared at me drowning deep the black had eaten all the white his eyes sparkled like jet buttons are you about to go all furry on me he shook his head the beast does not control me i control myself the other man stood there calmly why arent you having problems im not a predator blood doesnt bother me a whimper came in from the hallway a young man who couldnt have been more than twenty was crawling on hands and knees into the room a low whimper was rising from his throat like a mantra he raised his head sniffing the air his head turned with a jerk eyes staring at me he crawled towards me his eyes were the color of spring skies innocent as an april morning the look in them was not he looked at me as if he were wondering what i tasted like in a human id have thought he was thinking of sex now maybe he was just thinking of food i pointed the gun at his forehead his eyes looked past the gun at me i wasnt even sure he saw the gun he touched my leg i didnt shoot him he hadnt offered to hurt me i wasnt sure what the hell was going on but i couldnt shoot him for touching me not just for that he had to do something to deserve a bullet in the brain even from me i moved the gun slightly from side to side in front of his eyes they didnt track his hands gripped my jeans pulling him to his knees his head was a little above my waist blue eyes staring up at my face his arms wrapped around my waist he buried his face in my stomach sort of nuzzling i tapped his head with the barrel of the gun i dont know you well enough for you to nuzzle me fella get up his head buried under my sweater his mouth bit gently into my side he stiffened arms rigid his breathing was suddenly ragged and i was suddenly afraid one mans foreplay was another mans appetizer get him off of me before i hurt him rafael yelled voice roaring over the mounting chaos marcus that one word rang out and silence fell faces turned to him faces smeared with blood elizabeth the darkhaired woman was nowhere in sight only marcus remained clean he stood on the stage rigid but there was a vibration to him like a struck tuning fork his face was gaunt with some great effort he looked at us with the eyes of a drowning man who was determined not to scream on the last trip down jason is having some difficulty controlling himself rafael said he is your wolf call him off gabriel stood up his face coated in blood he bared his flashing teeth with a laugh im surprised ms blake hasnt killed him yet raina stood from the kill a patch of blood on her chin ms blake refused marcuss protection she is dominant let her discover what it means to refuse our help jason was still rigid against me his arms locked tight face pressed against my stomach i could feel his breath through my shirt hot and too heavy for what was happening you asked me here for my help marcus your hospitality sucks he glared at me but even from across the room i could see a nervous tic jumping in his face a twitching as though something alive were trying to come out it is too late for business tonight ms blake things are out of hand no joke get him off of me marcus one dead tonight is enough raina went to him holding up a bloody hand to him let her acknowledge your dominance over her acknowledge that she needs your help marcus stared at me acknowledge my dominance and i will call jason off if he starts to shapeshift ill kill him you know ill do it marcus call him off if i am to give you my protection you must acknowledge me fuck you marcus im not asking you to save me im asking you to save him or dont you care about your pack members rafael is a king raina said let him save you a shudder ran through the man his grip tightened painfully he stood arms still locked behind my back if hed held me any closer id have come out the other side he was about my height which put our faces very close his eyes were full of a great hunger a need he bent his head as if to kiss me but another shudder ran through him he buried his face in my hair lips touching my neck i pressed the barrel of the browning into his chest if he tried to take a bite out of me he was dead but where alfred had been a bully this one jason seemed unable to help himself like a compulsion if i waited too long id be just as dead but until he hurt me it made me not want to hurt him besides i was feeling a wee bit gun happy for killing alfred not a lot but a little it cut jason some slack his teeth brushed along my neck drawing an edge of skin into his mouth he had just about reached the end of my patience even if he didnt turn furry a low rumbling growl vibrated along my skin my pulse thudded into my throat i squeezed down on the trigger i couldnt wait for him to bite my throat out i heard kaspar say rafael no jasons head jerked up eyes wild rafael stood beside us holding his arm in front of jasons face blood ran down it from deep scratches fresh blood my wolf rafael said jason jerked away from me so fast he threw me into the wall my head smacked the wall after my shoulders made impact which was the only thing that saved me from passing out i ended up with my butt on the floor gun in my hand only by instinct the strength in that one movement left my gut hollow with fear i had let him nuzzle my neck as if he were human he could have torn me apart with his human hands i might have killed him first but id have been just as dead jason crouched in front of rafael a ripple ran through his back like a wave of water driven by wind jason fell into a little ball his back pulsing under his shirt rafael stood over him blood dripping onto the floor i hope you understand what i have done for you he said i had enough air back to speak you want me to shoot him a strange look came over his face leaving his black button eyes dead you offer your protection protection smetection you helped me ill help you thank you but i have started it and i must finish it but i think you must go before you run out of silver bullets kaspar offered me a hand up i took it his skin was unusually warm but that was all he didnt seem to have the urge to touch me or eat me a nice change the crowd was coming in the door in twos and threes and tens some moved like sleepwalkers towards the body at the far side of the room that was dandy some went for rafael and the writhing jason hed said he could handle himself but about six of them turned to me and kaspar they stared at us with hungry eyes one a girl dropped to her knees and began to crawl towards me can you do anything about this i asked im a swan they consider me food it took every ounce of selfcontrol not to glance at him i stared at the crawling lycanthrope and said a swan great you got any suggestions wound one of them they respect pain the girl was reaching out for me i stared at her slender arm and didnt fire glazer safety rounds could take off an arm i wasnt sure lycanthropes could heal amputations i pointed over her head at the large male behind her i gutshot him he fell screaming to the floor blood pouring between his fingers the girl turned on him burying her face in his stomach he slapped her away the others surged forward lets get out while we can kaspar said he motioned for the door didnt have to ask me twice marcus was suddenly there i hadnt seen him come too busy concentrating on the immediate threat he pulled two men off the wounded one tossing them like toys he drew a manila file folder from under his blue linen jacket and handed it to me in a voice that was more growl than anything he said kaspar can answer your questions he turned with a snarl tearing into the lycanthropes protecting the one id wounded kaspar pushed me out the door and i let him i had one last glimpse of jason he was a mass of flowing fur and naked dripping bones rafael was once again the slick black ratman id met months ago the crownshaped burn in his forearm the mark of kingship for the rats showed clean he was no longer bleeding the change had healed him the door slammed shut i wasnt sure who had done it kaspar and i stood in the hallway alone there were no sounds from behind the door the silence was so heavy it thrummed in my head i cant hear them soundproof room he said logical i stared down at the file folder there was a bloody handprint on it i held it gingerly at the edge waiting for the blood to dry are we supposed to sit down and have a business meeting knowing marcus the information will be complete hes a very good bureaucrat but not a very good pack leader he glanced at the door id say that somewhere else if i were you he had a point i stared up at him his babyfine hair was nearly white almost feathery i shook my head it couldnt be he grinned at me go ahead touch it i did i brushed fingers through his hair and it was soft and downy like the under feathers on a bird heat rose from his scalp like fever jesus something heavy smacked into the door i felt the vibrations through the floor i backed away hesitating about putting the browning away i compromised and put my hand in the pocket of my trench coat it was the only coat i owned with pockets deep enough to swallow the browning kaspar opened the door to the dining rooms there were still people eating humans out for a night on the town carving their steaks eating their veggies oblivious to the potential destruction just two doors away i had a horrible urge to yell flee flee for your lives but they wouldnt have understood besides the lunatic cafe had been here for years id never heard of an incident here of course id killed one man werewolf whatever i didnt think there was going to be enough evidence to turn over to the cops maybe a few wellgnawed bones who knew what disasters had been covered up here kaspar handed me a business card it was white and shiny with gothic script that said kaspar gunderson antiques and collectibles if you have any questions i will try to answer them even if the questions are about what the hell you are even that he said we were walking as we talked he offered me his hand beside the bar in the outer dining room the outside door was in sight fun almost over for the night thank god my smile froze on my face i knew one of the men at the bar edward was sitting there sipping a tall cold drink he never glanced at me but i knew he saw me kaspar cocked his head to one side is anything wrong no i said no my words were too fast even i didnt believe myself i tried my best professional smile its just been a long night he didnt believe me and i didnt care i wasnt good at spurofthemoment lying kaspar let it go but his eyes scanned the crowd as he walked out looking for whatever or whoever had bothered me edward looked like a nice ordinary man he was five foot eight of slender build with short blond hair he had on a nondescript black winter jacket jeans and softsoled shoes he looked a little like marcus and in his own way was just as dangerous he was ignoring me effortlessly which meant he might not want to be noticed i walked past him wanting to ask what the hell he was doing here but not wanting to blow his cover edward was an assassin who specialized in vampires lycanthropes and other preternatural humanoids hed started out killing humans but it had been too easy edward did love a challenge i stood in the cold dark wondering what to do i had the bloody file folder in one hand the other was still gripping the browning now that the adrenaline was seeping away my hand was cramping around the gun id held it too long without firing it i tucked the folder under my arm and put the gun away all the shapeshifters were busy eating each other i could probably walk to my car without having a gun naked in my hands edward didnt come out i had half expected him to he was hunting someone but who after what id seen tonight i wasnt sure hunting them was such a bad idea of course richard was one of them i didnt want anyone hunting him i would have to ask edward what he was doing but not tonight richard wasnt inside the rest of them could take their chances i had a momentary thought about rafael but let it go he knew what edward looked like if not exactly what he did for a living i stopped halfway down the sidewalk should i warn edward that rafael might recognize him and tell the others my head hurt for this one night let death take care of himself the vampires called me the executioner but they called edward death after all id never used a flamethrower on them i kept walking edward was a big scary boy he could take care of himself and everyone else in the back room certainly didnt need my help even if they did i wasnt sure i wanted to give it to them which brought me back to the file folder what could they need my help for what could i do that they couldnt i almost didnt want to know but i didnt throw the folder in the nearest trash can truth was if i didnt read it it would bug me curiosity killed the cat here was hoping it didnt do the same for animators at that morning i was tucked in bed with the file folder my favorite stuffed toy penguin sigmund was sitting next to me it used to be that i used sigmund only when people were trying to kill me lately id been sleeping with him most of the time itd been a rough year the browning hipower was in its second home a holster on the headboard of the bed i sometimes slept without the penguin but never without the gun the folder consisted of a half dozen sheets of paper all neatly typed double spaced the first was a list of eight names with an animal designation beside them the last two pages were an explanation of the names eight lycanthropes had gone missing vanished no bodies no signs of violence nothing their families knew nothing none of the lycanthropes knew anything i went back over the names margaret smitz was number seven designation wolf could it be george smitzs wife peggy was a nickname for margaret dont ask me how you get peggy from margaret but you do the last few pages were suggestions about who marcus thought i should talk to controlling little bastard he did offer an explanation for why he asked me for help he thought that the other shapeshifters would talk more freely to me than to him or any of his wolves no joke i was sort of a compromise they didnt trust the police and who else do the lunarly disadvantaged go to for help why your friendly neighborhood animator i wasnt sure what i could do for them i had sent george smitz to ronnie for a reason i was not a detective id never handled a missingperson case in my life when i met ronnie the next day cancel that that morning id fill her in georges wife missing was one thing but eight lycanthropes missing was a pattern they needed to go to the police but they didnt trust human law as late as the s lycanthropes were still being mobbed and burned at the stake couldnt blame them for being leery i put the folder in the drawer of the nightstand i got a plain white business card out of the drawer the only thing on it was a phone number edward had given me the card only two months ago it was the first time id ever been able to contact him before hed just shown up usually when i didnt want him to the number was a twentyfourhour phone message service a mechanized voice said at the tone leave your message a long low beep sounded this is anita what the hell are you doing in town call me soon i wasnt usually that blunt on a phone message but hey it was edward he knew me besides he didnt appreciate social niceties i set the alarm turned off the light and cuddled into the blankets my faithful penguin at my side the phone rang before id gotten warm i waited for the machine to pick up after the eighth ring i gave up id forgotten to turn on the machine great this better be important i said you said to call soon it was edward i pulled the receiver under the blankets with me hi edward hi why are you in town and why were you at the lunatic cafe why were you it is nearly six in the freaking morning i havent been to sleep yet i dont have time for games what was in the folder you had there was fresh blood on it whose blood was it i sighed i wasnt sure what to tell him he might be a great deal of help or he could kill people that i was supposed to be helping choices choices i cant tell you shit until i know if im endangering people i never hunt people you know that so you are on a hunt yes what this time shapeshifters figures who i dont have any names yet then how do you know who to kill ive got film film come to my hotel room tomorrow and ill show you the film ill tell you everything i know youre not usually this obliging whats the catch no catch you might be able to identify them thats all i dont know a lot of shapeshifters i said fine just come see what i have he sounded so sure of himself but then he always did okay where are you staying adams mark do you need directions no i can get there when do you work tomorrow yeah then at your convenience of course he was being too damn polite how long will your little presentation take two hours maybe less i shook my head realized he couldnt see it and said itll have to be after my last zombie appointment im booked until then name the time i can be there between twelvethirty and one even saying it made me tired i wasnt going to get any sleep again ill be waiting wait what name are you registered under room just knock you do have a last name dont you of course good night anita the phone line went dead buzzing in my hand like an unquiet spirit i fumbled the receiver into its cradle and switched on the answering machine i turned the sound down as low as it would go and snuggled back under the covers edward never shared information unless forced to he was being too helpful something was up knowing edward it was something unpleasant lycanthropes disappearing without a trace it sounded like a game that edward would enjoy but somehow i didnt think it was him he liked taking credit for his kills as long as the police couldnt tie him to them directly but somebody was doing it there were bounty hunters who specialized in rogue lycanthropes edward might know who they were and if theyd condone murder because if all eight were dead then it was murder none of them was wanted as far as i knew the police would know but i wasnt going to involve the police dolph should know if lycanthropes were disappearing in his territory i felt sleep sucking at the edges of the world i flashed on the murder victim i saw his face frozen in the snow one eye ripped open like a grape the crushed jaw tried to move to speak one word hissed out of his ruined mouth anita my name over and over i woke up enough to roll over and sleep washed over me in a heavy black wave if i dreamed again i never remembered every year i wondered what to buy judith my stepmother for christmas youd think after fourteen years id get better of course youd think shed get better at buying for me judith and i always end up staring at each other across this chasm of misunderstanding she wants me to be this perfect feminine daughter and i want her to be my dead mother since i cant have what i want ive made sure judith doesnt get her wish either besides shes got andria who is perfect one perfect kid in the family is enough ronnie and i were christmas shopping we had jogged on the slick wintery streets at nine that morning id managed about three hours of sleep the running helped the freezing wind slapping my face helped even more i was wide awake and temporarily energized when we hit the mall hair still damp from the shower ronnie is five foot nine her short blond hair is cut in a sort of pageboy its the same haircut shes had since i met her but then my hairstyle hasnt changed either she was wearing jeans cowboy boots with purple tooling a short winter coat over a lilac crewneck sweater she was not wearing a gun didnt think the mall elves would get that out of hand i was dressed for the office because id need to go straight there from shopping the skirt was a standard navy blue with a black belt for my shoulder holster to slip through the skirt was about two inches higher than i was comfortable with but ronnie had insisted shes a tad more fashion conscious than i am then who isnt the jacket was a rich midnight blue the color of jeanclaudes eyes darker blue designs nearly black traced it in a vaguely oriental pattern the opennecked blouse was a blue that matched the jacket with black highheel pumps i looked pretty snazzy ronnie had picked out the jacket too its only fault was that it didnt hide the browning as well you got little flashes of it as i moved so far no one had run screaming to the mall cops if theyd had known i was wearing a knife on each forearm under the pretty jacket maybe they would have ronnie was staring into a jewelry case at krigles and i was staring at her eyes they were grey the same color that gabriels eyes had been last night but there was something different her eyes were human even in human form gabriels eyes werent human whats wrong i shook my head thinking about last night how do you feel about loverboy after last night the jewelry store was three deep in people wed forced our way to the case but i knew i wasnt buying anything here so i sort of stood beside ronnie scanning the crowd all the faces looked hostile but it was nothing personal they were christmas shopping with two weeks to the big day ho ho ho the store was a mass of shoving jostling people i was getting claustrophobic are you going to buy something ronnie looked up at me you never answered my question get me out of this mess and maybe i will she stood up and motioned me forward i cleared us a path to the open mall im small and was dressed too pretty to be intimidating but people cleared a path maybe they saw the gun when we were in the main open space i took a deep breath it was crowded but nothing like the stores at least here people werent actually brushing against me if they did it out here i could yell at them you want to sit down there were miraculously two seats open on a bench ronnie had made the offer because i was dressed for work which meant heels in her comfy jogging shoes she didnt need to sit my feet didnt hurt yet maybe i was getting used to wearing heels eeek i shook my head lets hit the nature company maybe ill find josh something there how old is he now thirteen ronnie asked fifteen i said my baby brother was my height last year hell be gigantic this year judith says hes outgrowing his jeans faster than she can buy them a hint to buy him jeans ronnie said if it is im ignoring it im buying josh something fun not clothes a lot of teenagers would rather have clothes ronnie said not josh not yet anyway he seems to have taken after me what are you going to do about richard she asked me youre not going to let it go are you not a chance i dont know what im going do after what i saw last night after what jeanclaude told me i just dont know you know that jeanclaude did it deliberately she said to try and drive a wedge between you i know and it worked i feel like i dont know richard like ive been kissing a stranger dont let fangface break you up i smiled at that jeanclaude would love being referred to as fangface i wont she punched my shoulder softly i dont believe you it wont be jeanclaude that breaks us up ronnie if richards been lying to me for months i didnt finish the sentence i didnt have to we were outside the nature company it was crawling with people like a jar of lightning bugs abuzz with activity but not half as bright what exactly has richard lied about he didnt tell me about this battle hes got going with marcus and you tell him everything she said well no he hasnt lied to you anita he just didnt tell you let him explain maybe hes got a good reason i turned and looked full at her her face was all soft with concern it made me look away hes been in danger for months and didnt tell me i needed to know maybe he couldnt tell you you wont know until you ask him i saw lycanthropes last night ronnie i shook my head what i saw last night wasnt human it wasnt even close so hes not human no ones perfect i looked at her then she was smiling at me i had to smile back ill talk to him call him before we leave the mall and set up a dinner for today you are so pushy i said she shrugged ive learned from the best thanks i said what have you learned from george smitz nothing new to add to the folder you showed me except he doesnt seem to know that his wife is one of eight missing shapeshifters he thinks shes the only one i got a picture of her you need pictures of the others first thing you need in a missingperson case is a picture without a picture you could pass them on the street and not know it ill ask kaspar about pictures not richard im sort of mad at him i dont want to ask him for help youre being petty its one of my best traits ill check out the usual channels for a missing person but if theyre all lycanthropes i bet it isnt a missing person you think theyre dead dont you yeah but what could take out eight shapeshifters without a trace she asked thats got me worried too i touched her arm you wear your gun from now on she smiled i promise mommy i shook my head shall we brave one more store if i can get joshs gift ill be halfway done youll have to buy richard a present you know what you have to buy your steady a gift its traditional shit i was halfway mad at him but she was right fighting or not i had to buy him something what if he bought me something and i didnt id feel guilty if i bought something and he didnt then i could feel superior or angry i was almost hoping he wouldnt buy me anything was i looking for an excuse to dump richard maybe of course maybe after we talked hed give me a good excuse on a silver excuse me golden platter i was ready for a knockdown dragout fight it did not bode well my one oclock appointment was with elvira drew she sipped her coffee elegant fingernails curled around the mug her nail polish was clear making her fingertips glint like abalone shell colorless until the light hit it the rest of her was just as tasteful her dress was that interesting color that looked blue one minute and green the next bluegreen they called it but it wasnt accurate the dress was almost green for cloth to have that shimmer almost a life of its own like fur it had to be expensive the dress was probably worth more than my entire wardrobe her long yellow hair spilled down her back in an elegant line it was the only thing that didnt match that dress the manicure the dyedtomatch shoes the nearly invisible makeup should have gone with a tasteful but complicated hairdo i liked her better for the hair being free and nearly untouched when she raised her eyes to meet mine i knew why shed spent so much on the dress her eyes were the same startling bluegreen the combination was breathtaking i sat across from her sipping my coffee happy id dressed up most days shed have made me feel like a country cousin today i could hold my own what can i do for you today ms drew she smiled and the smile was all it should have been she smiled like she knew the effect it had on most people i was almost afraid to see her near a man if she lit up this much for me the thought of what shed do around jamison or manny was kind of frightening im a writer im working on a book about shapeshifters my smile wilted around the edges really and what brings you to the offices of animators inc the book is set up with each chapter being a different animal form i give history any wellknown shapeshifters of that form from history then a personal profile of a presentday shapeshifter my face was beginning to hurt and i knew my smile was more a baring of teeth than anything else sounds like an interesting book now how can i help you she blinked gorgeous eyes at me and looked puzzled she was good at looking puzzled id seen the intelligence in her eyes a moment ago the dumbblonde routine was an act would it have worked if i were a man i hoped not im missing one interview i need to find a wererat the interview can be strictly confidential the dumb blonde was gone as quickly as it had come shed seen i wasnt buying it the interview can benot wouldbe confidential i sighed and gave up on the smile what made you think i could find you a wererat mr vaughn assured me that if anyone in this area could help me it would be you did he really she smiled eyes glittering he seemed very sure you could help me my boss promises a lot of things ms drew most of which he doesnt have to deliver i stood if you could wait here for just a moment i want to confer with mr vaughn ill wait right here for you her smile was just as sweet but something in her eyes let me know she knew exactly what kind of conferring i had in mind the outer office was done in pale greens from the wallpaper with its thin oriental designs to the foamy carpet plants flourished in every unoccupied niche bert thought the plants gave the office a homey touch i thought it looked like a cheap jungle set mary our daytime secretary glanced up from her computer keyboard with a smile mary was over fifty with blond hair that was a little too yellow to be natural you need something anita her smile was pleasant id almost never seen her in a bad mood it was a good personality trait for a receptionist yeah to see the boss she cocked her head to one side eyes suddenly wary why i should have an appointment to see bert today anyway i told craig to schedule it she glanced through the appointment book craig did and bert canceled it the smile was gone he really is very busy today that was it i went for berts door hes with a client right now mary said peachy i said i knocked on the door and opened it without waiting for permission berts desk took up most of the pale blue office it was the smallest of the three offices but it was permanently his the rest of us had to rotate hed played football in college and it still showed broad shoulders strong hands six feet four inches tall and aware of every inch his boaters tan had washed away with the winter weather his white crew cut seemed a little less dramatic against the paler skin his eyes are the color of dirty window glass sort of grey those eyes glared at me now im with a client anita i spared a glance for the man sitting across from him it was kaspar gunderson he was dressed all in white today and it emphasized everything how i could have ever looked at him and thought him human was beyond me he smiled ms blake i presume he put out a hand i shook it if you could wait outside for just a few moments mr gunderson he said mr gunderson i need to speak with mr vaughn i think it can wait anita bert said no i said it cant yes he said it can do you want to have this particular talk in front of a client bert he stared at me his small grey eyes looking even smaller as he squinted at me it was his mean look it had never worked on me he gave a tight smile are you insisting you got it he took a long deep breath and let it out slowly as if he were counting to ten his flashed his best professional smile on kaspar if you will excuse us for a few minutes mr gunderson this wont take long kaspar stood nodded at me and left i closed the door behind him what the hell are you doing coming in here while im talking to a client he stood up and his broad shoulders nearly touched from wall to wall he should have known better than to try and intimidate me with size ive been the smallest kid on the block for as long as i can remember size hadnt been impressive for a very long time i told you no more clients that are outside my job description your job description is anything i say it is im your boss remember he leaned over his desk palms flat i leaned into the desk on the other side you sent me a missing persons case last night what the fuck do i know about missing persons his wifes a lycanthrope and that means we should take his money if you can help him yes well i gave it to ronnie bert leaned back see you did help him he would never have found ms sims without your help he was looking all reasonable again i didnt want him reasonable ive got elvira drew in my office right now what the hell am i supposed to do with her do you know any wererats he had sat down hands crossed over his slightly bulging middle thats beside the point you do dont you and if i say yes set up an interview surely one of them wants to be famous most lycanthropes go to a lot of trouble to hide what they are being outed endangers their jobs marriages there was that case in indiana last year where a father lost his kids to his exwife after five years because she found out he was a shapeshifter no one wants to risk that kind of exposure ive seen shifters interviewed on live television he said theyre the exceptions bert not the rule so you wont help ms drew no i wont i wont try and appeal to your sense of greed though she has offered us a lot of money but think what a positive book on lycanthropy would do to help your shapeshifting friends good press is always welcome before you turn her down talk to your friends see what they say you dont give a damn about good exposure for the lycanthrope community youre just excited about the money true bert was an unscrupulous bastard and didnt care who knew it it was hard to win a fight when you couldnt insult someone i sat down across from him he looked pleased with himself like he knew hed won he should have known better i dont like sitting down across from clients and not knowing what the hell they want no more surprises you clear clients with me first anything you say youre being reasonable whats wrong his smile widened setting his little eyes sparkling mr gunderson has offered us a lot of money for your services twice the normal fee thats a lot of money what does he want me to do raise an ancestor from the dead hes under a family curse a witch told him if he could talk to the ancestor that the curse originated with she might be able to lift it why double the fee the curse started with one of two brothers he doesnt know which one so i have to raise them both if were lucky only one but you keep the second fee anyway i said bert nodded vigorously happy as a greedy clam its even your job description and besides even you wouldnt let a fellow go through his life with feathers on his head if you could help him now would you you smug bastard i said but my voice sounded tired even to me bert just smiled he knew hed won youll clear clients with me that arent zombie raisings or vampire slayings i said if you have the time to read up on every client i see then i certainly have time to write up a report i dont need to read about every client just the ones youre sending my way but anita you know its just luck of the draw which of you is on duty on any given day damn you bert youve kept ms drew waiting long enough dont you think i stood up it was no use i was outmaneuvered he knew it i knew it the only thing left was a graceful retreat your two oclock canceled ill have mary send gunderson in is there anything you wouldnt schedule in as a client bert he seemed to think about that for a minute then shook his head if they could pay the fee no you are a greedy son of a bitch i know it was no use i wasnt winning this one i went for the door youre wearing a gun he sounded outraged yeah what of it i think you can meet clients in broad daylight at our offices without being armed i dont think so just put the gun in the desk drawer like you used to nope i opened the door i dont want you meeting clients armed anita your problem not mine i could make it yours he said his face was flushed voice tight with anger maybe we were going to get to fight after all i closed the door you mean fire me i am your boss we can argue about clients but the gun is not negotiable the gun frightens clients send the squeamish ones to jamison i said anita he stood up like an angry stormi dont want you wearing the gun in the office i smiled sweetly fuck you bert so much for a graceful exit i closed the door and realized i had accomplished nothing but pissing bert off not a bad hours work but not a great accomplishment i was going to tell ms drew that i might be able to help her bert was right about good press i nodded at gunderson as i passed him he smiled back somehow i didnt think he really wanted me to raise the dead id find out soon enough ms drew was sitting legs crossed hands folded in her lap the picture of elegant patience i may be able to help you ms drew im not sure but i may know someone who can help you she stood up offering me a manicured hand that would be wonderful ms blake i certainly appreciate your help does mary have a number where i can reach you yes she smiled i smiled i opened the door and she walked past me in a cloud of expensive perfume mr gunderson i can see you now he stood laying the magazine hed been leafing through on the small table beside the ficus benjium he didnt move with that dancelike grace that the other shapeshifters had but then swans werent particularly graceful on land have a seat mr gunderson please kaspar i leaned on the edge of the desk staring down at him what are you doing here kaspar he smiled marcus wants to apologize for last night then he should have come in person his smiled widened he thought that offering a sizable monetary reward might make up for our lack of hospitality last night he was wrong you arent going to give an inch are you nope are you not going to help us i sighed im working on it but im not sure what i can do what or who could take out eight shapeshifters without a struggle i have no idea none of us do that is why we have come to you great they knew less than i did not comforting marcus gave me a list of people to question i handed it to him any thoughts or additions he frowned eyebrows arching together the white eyebrows were not hair i blinked trying to concentrate the fact that he was feathery seemed to bother me a lot more than it should have these are all rivals for marcuss power you met most of them at the cafe do you really think he suspects them or is he just making trouble for his rivals i asked i dont know marcus said you could answer my questions do you actually know anything that i dont i would say that i know a great deal more about the shapeshifting community than you do he said he sounded a trifle offended sorry i think its just wishful thinking on marcuss part that his rivals are the bad guys not your fault hes playing games marcus often tries to manage things you saw that last night his management skills havent impressed me so far he believes that if there were one ruler for all shapeshifters we would be a force to rival the vampires he might be right on that he wants to be that ruler i said of course the intercom buzzed excuse me a minute i hit the button what is it mary richard zeeman on line two he says hes returning your message i hesitated then said ill take it i picked up the phone very aware that kaspar was sitting there listening i could have asked him to step outside but i was getting tired of playing musical clients hi richard i got your message on my answering machine he said his voice was very careful as if he were balancing a glass of water filled to the very brim i think we need to talk i said i agree my werent we being cautious this afternoon im supposed to be the one thats mad why does your voice sound so funny i heard about last night i waited for him to say more but the silence just stretched to infinity i filled it look i have a client with me right now you want to meet and talk very much he said it as though he werent really looking forward to it i have a dinner break around six you want to meet at the chinese place on olive doesnt sound very private what did you have in mind my place i only get an hour richard i dont have time to drive that far your place then no why not just no what we need to say to each other isnt going to go over well in public you know that i did dammit all right well meet at my place a little after six do you want me to pick up something youre at work itll be easier for me to pick up something you want mooshu pork and crab ragoon yeah wed dated enough that he could order food for me without asking but he asked anyway brownie point for him ill see you at about sixfifteen then he said see you bye anita bye we hung up my stomach was one hard knot of dread if we were going to have the fight the breakup fight i didnt want to have it at my apartment but richard was right we didnt want to be screaming about lycanthropes and killing people in a public restaurant still it was not going to be a good time is richard angry about last night kaspar asked yeah is there anything i can do to help i need the complete stories about the disappearances struggles who last saw them that sort of thing marcus said all questions directly about the disappearances should be answered only by him you always do what he says not always but hes quite adamant about this anita i am not a predator i cannot defend myself against marcus at his worst would he really kill you for going against his wishes perhaps not kill me but i would be hurting for a very very long time i shook my head he doesnt sound any better than most master vampires i know i dont personally know any master vampires i am forced to take your word for that i had to smile i knew more monsters than the monsters did would richard know perhaps and if not he could help you find out i wanted to ask him if richard was as bad as marcus i wanted to know if my sweetie was really a beast at heart i didnt ask if i wanted to know about richard i should ask richard unless you have more information kaspar i have work to do it sounded grumpy even to me i smiled to try to soften it but didnt take it back i wanted this whole mess to go away and he was a reminder of it he stood if you need any assistance please call youll only be able to give me the assistance marcus okays right a slight flush colored his pale skin a pink glow like colored sugar i am afraid so i dont think ill be calling i said you dont trust marcus i laughed but it was harsh not amused do you he smiled and gave a slight nod of his head i suppose not he moved for the door i had my hand on the doorknob when i turned and asked is it really a family curse my affliction yeah not a family one but a curse yes like in the fairy tale i said fairy tale sounds like such a gentle thing the original stories are often quite gruesome ive read some of them have you read the swan princess in its original norse cant say i have its even worse in the original language sorry to hear that i said so am i he stepped closer to the door and i had to open it to let him go i dearly wanted to hear the story from his own lips but there was a pain in his eyes that was raw enough to cut skin i couldnt press against that much pain he stepped past me i let him go i was really going to have to find my textbook on fairy tales as truth from that comparative literature class it had been a long time since id read the swan princess it was more like sixthirty by the time i walked down the hallway to my apartment i had half expected to see richard sitting in the hall but it was empty the tightness in my stomach eased just a bit a reprieve even of a few minutes was still a reprieve i had my keys in the door when the door behind me opened i dropped the keys leaving them dangling my right hand went for the browning it was instinct not something i thought about my hand was on the butt but i hadnt drawn it when mrs pringle appeared in the door i eased my hand away from the gun and smiled i dont think she realized what i was doing because her smile never faltered she was tall and thin with age her white hair was wrapped in a bun at the nape of her neck mrs pringle never wore makeup and never apologized for being over sixty she seemed to enjoy being old anita youre running a little late tonight she said custard her pomeranian yapped in the background like a stuck record i frowned at her sixthirty was early for me to get home before i could say anything richard appeared behind her in the doorway his hair fell around his face in a mass of rich brown waves he was wearing one of my favorite sweaters it was solid forest green and squishy soft to the touch custard was barking at him inches away from his leg as if working up courage for a quick nip custard stop that mrs pringle said she looked up at richard ive never seen him behave like this around anyone anita can tell you that he likes almost everyone she looked to me for support embarrassed about her dog being rude to a guest i nodded youre right ive never seen him act like this before i was looking at richard his face was as closed and careful as id ever seen it he acts like this around other dogs sometimes tries to boss them she said do you have a dog mr zeeman maybe custard smells him on you no richard said i dont have a dog i found your beau sitting in the hall with his sack of food i thought he might like to wait inside im sorry that custard has made the visit so unpleasant i always enjoy talking shop with another teacher he said so polite she said her face had broken into a wonderful smile shed only met richard once or twice in the hall but she liked him even before she found out he was a teacher snap judgment richard stepped around her into the hall custard followed him yipping furiously the dog looked like an overly ambitious dandelion but it was a pissed dandelion the dog bounced forward on tiny feet giving a little hop with each bark custard get back in here i held the door open for richard he had a white takeout sack and a coat in his arms the dog gave a running bound darting in to nip his ankle richard looked down at the dog custard stopped a nose away from his pants leg he rolled eyes upward a look in his doggy eyes that id never seen before a considering look as if he wondered if richard really would eat him richard slipped through the door custard just stood there in the hallway as subdued as id ever seen him thanks for looking after richard mrs pringle my pleasure hes a nice young man she said her tone of voice said more than the words nice young man meant marry him my stepmother judith would agree with her except that judith would have said it out loud no hinting i smiled and closed the door custard started yapping at the door i locked the door out of habit and turned to face the music richard had draped his leather coat across the back of the couch the takeout sack was sitting on the small kitchenette table he lifted out cartons of food i put my coat on the back of the couch by his and slipped off the high heels i lost about two inches of height and felt much better nice jacket he said his voice was still neutral thanks i had been going to take the jacket off but he liked it so i kept it on silly but true we were both being so careful the tension in the room was choking i got plates out of the cabinet i got a cold coke from the fridge for me and poured a glass of water for richard he didnt like carbonated beverages id taken to keeping a jug of cold water in the fridge just for him my throat felt tight as i set the drinks on the table he set out silverware we moved around my minuscule kitchen like dancers knowing where each would be never bumping unless it was on purpose tonight there was no touching we left the lights off the only light was from the living room leaving the kitchen in semidarkness like a cave it was almost as if neither one of us wanted to see clearly we sat down at last we stared at each other over the food on the plates mooshu pork for me cashew chicken for richard the smell of hot chinese food filled the apartment warm and comforting on most occasions tonight it nauseated me a double order of crab ragoon sat on a plate between us he had filled a saucer with sweetandsour sauce it was the way we always ate chinese sharing a bowl of sauce damn his chocolate brown eyes stared at me i was the one who looked away first i didnt want to do this so do all dogs react like that to you no just the dominant ones i looked up at that custard is dominant to you he thinks so unhealthy i said he smiled i dont eat dogs i didnt mean oh shit if we were going to do this might as well do it right why didnt you tell me about marcus i didnt want to involve you why not jeanclaude involved you with nikolaos you told me how much you hated that resented it if i brought you in to help me with marcus what would be the difference its not the same i said how i wont use you like jeanclaude did i wont do it if i volunteer youre not using me what are you going to do kill him there was a bitterness in his voice anger whats that supposed to mean you might as well take your jacket off i saw the gun i opened my mouth to protest and closed it explaining in the middle of a fight that i wanted to look good for him sounded silly i stood up and took the jacket off i draped it carefully over the back of the chair taking a lot of time with it there happy is that gun your answer to everything why do you suddenly have a problem with me carrying a gun alfred was my friend that stopped me it hadnt even occurred to me that richard might like alfred i didnt know he was your friend would it have made a difference i thought about that maybe you didnt have to kill him i had this conversation with marcus last night they left me no choice richard i warned him more than once i heard all about it the packs buzzing with it how you wouldnt back down you rejected marcuss protection you shot another one of us he shook his head oh everyones real impressed i didnt do it to impress them he took a deep breath i know thats what scares me youre scared of me for you he said the anger was seeping out of his eyes what was replacing it was fear i can handle myself richard you dont understand what you did last night i am sorry if alfred was your friend frankly he didnt strike me as someone youd hang out with i know he was a bully and marcuss dog to call but he was mine to protect marcus wasnt doing a lot of protecting last night richard he was more interested in his little power struggle than in keeping alfred safe i stopped by irvings place this morning he let the statement hang there in the air between us it was my turn to get angry did you hurt him if i did it was my right as beta male i stood up hands pressed on the tabletop if you hurt him we are going to have more than just words are you going to shoot me too i looked at him with his wonderful hair looking scrumptious in his sweater and nodded if i had to you could kill me just like that no not kill but wound yeah to keep irving safe youd pull a gun on me he was leaning back in the chair arms crossed on his chest his expression was amazed and angry irving asked for my protection i gave it so he told me this morning did you hurt him he stared at me for a long time then finally said no i didnt hurt him i let out a breath i hadnt known i was holding and eased back into my chair youd really pit yourself against me to protect him you really would dont sound so amazed irving was caught in the middle of the two of you marcus would have hurt him if he didnt contact me and you said youd hurt him if he did didnt seem very fair a lot of things in the pack arent fair anita so is life richard what of it when irving told me that he was under your protection i didnt hurt him but i didnt really believe youd hurt me ive known irving a lot longer than ive known you he leaned forward hands on the tabletop but hes not dating you i shrugged i didnt know what else to say nothing seemed like a safe bet am i still your sweetie or did your baptism by fire last night make you not want to date me anymore youre in a lifeordeath struggle and you didnt tell me if you hide things like that from me how can we have a relationship marcus wont kill me he said i just stared at him he seemed sincere shit you really believe that dont you yes i wanted to call him a fool but i closed my mouth and tried to think of something else to say nothing came to mind ive met marcus ive met raina i shook my head if you really believe that marcus doesnt want you dead youre wrong one night and youre an expert he said yeah on this i am thats why i didnt tell you youd kill him wouldnt you youd just kill him if he was trying to kill me yeah i have to handle this myself anita then handle it richard kill his ass or youll do it for me i sat back in my chair shit richard what do you want from me i want to know if you think im a monster the conversation was moving too fast for me youre accusing me of being a murderer shouldnt that be my question i knew what you were when we first met you thought i was human do you still think im human i stared at him he looked so uncertain in my head i knew he wasnt human but id still never seen him do any of the otherworldly stuff looking at him here in my kitchen brown eyes brimming with sincerity he just didnt seem very dangerous he believed that marcus wouldnt kill him it was too naive for words i wanted to protect him to keep him safe somehow youre not a monster richard then why havent you touched me tonight not even a hello kiss i thought we were mad at each other i said i dont kiss people that im mad at are we mad at each other his voice was soft hesitant i dont know promise me something what no more hiding no more lying not even by omission you tell me the truth and ill tell you the truth agreed if you promise not to kill marcus i stared across at him how could anybody be a master werewolf and be so goodytwoshoes it was both charming and liable to get him killed i cant promise that anita i held up a hand i can promise not to kill him unless he attacks me or you or a civilian it was richards turn to stare at me you could kill him just like that just like that he shook his head i dont understand that how can you be a lycanthrope and never have killed anybody im careful and im not youre almost casual about it you killed alfred last night and you dont seem sorry should i be i would be i shrugged truth was it did bother me a little there might have been a way out without alfred ending up in a body bag or in the stomachs of his friends but id killed him there it was no going back no changing it no apologizing its the way i am richard live with it or get out im not going to change one of the reasons i wanted to date you to begin with was i thought you could take care of yourself youve seen them now i think i can get out of it alive but a regular personan ordinary human beingwhat chance would they have i just looked at him i flashed on him with his throat torn out dead but he hadnt been dead hed healed hed lived thered been another man another human being that hadnt healed i never wanted to love anyone and lose them like that ever so you got what was advertised whats the problem i still want you i still want to hold you touch you can you stand to touch me after what you saw last night he wouldnt meet my eyes his hair fell forward hiding his face i stood up and took the step that left me looking down at him he raised his face to me his eyes glittered with unshed tears the fear in his face was raw i had thought that what i saw last night would make a difference between us i flashed on jasons unnatural strength the sweat on marcuss face gabriel with his bloodcoated mouth but staring into richards face with him close enough to touch none of that was real i trusted richard besides i was armed i leaned over him bending down to kiss his lips the first kiss was gentle chaste he made no move to touch me hands in his lap i kissed his forehead hands combing through his long hair so i could feel the warmth of him against my fingers i kissed his eyebrows the tip of his nose each cheek finally his lips again he sighed the breath pouring into my mouth and i pressed my lips against his like id eat him from the mouth down his arms wrapped around my back hands hesitating at my waist fingers slightly lower his hands jumped to my thighs skipping all those questionable areas i put one leg on either side of his knees and found the short skirt did have its uses i straddled his lap didnt have to raise the skirt an inch richard made a small sound of surprise he stared at me and his eyes were drowning deep i raised his sweater off his stomach running hands against his bare flesh off i said he raised the sweater over his head in one movement dropping it to the floor i sat in his lap staring at his bare chest i should have stopped right there but i didnt want to i pressed my face in the bend of his neck breathing in the smell of his skin his hair covering my face like a veil i ran just the tip of my tongue in a thin line of wetness down his neck across his collarbone his hands kneaded the small of my back sliding downward his fingers danced over my buttocks then up to my back point for him he hadnt groped me the gun can you take it off he asked with his face buried in my hair i nodded slipping out of the shoulder straps i couldnt get the rest off without removing the skirts belt my hands didnt seem to want to work richard took my hands and placed them gently to either side he undid the buckle and began to slide the belt out a loop at a time each pull made me move just a little i held the holstered gun while he drew the belt free he let the belt drop to the floor i folded the shoulder holster carefully and laid it on the table behind us i turned back to him his face was startlingly close his lips were soft full i licked the edges of his mouth the kiss was quick and messy i wanted to run my mouth over other things down his chest wed never let it go this far not even close he pulled my blouse out of the skirt running hands over my bare back the feel of his naked skin on places hed never touched before made me shudder we have to stop now i whispered it into his neck so it wasnt completely convincing what stop i pushed a little back from him enough to see his face enough to breathe just a little my hands were still playing with his hair touching his shoulders i dropped my hands made myself stop he was so warm i raised my hands to my face and could smell him on my skin i did not want to stop from the look on his face the feel of his body neither did he we should stop now why his voice was almost a whisper because if we dont stop now we might not stop at all would that be such a bad thing staring into his lovely eyes from inches away i almost said no maybe yes why because one night is never enough you either have a regular diet of it or you go cold turkey you can have this every night he said is that a proposal i asked he blinked at me trying to draw himself back up to think i watched the effort and struggled with it myself it was hard to think sitting in his lap i stood up his hands were still under my shirt on my bare back anita whats wrong i stood looking down at him hands on his shoulders for balance still too close for clear thinking i backed away and he let me go i leaned my hands against the kitchen counter trying to think enough to make sense i tried to think how to say a couple of years worth of pain in one mouthful i was always a good girl i didnt sleep around in college i met someone we got engaged we set a date we made love he dumped me hed done all that just to get you in bed i shook my head and turned to look at him he was still sitting there with his shirt off looking scrumptious his family disapproved of me why his mother didnt like my mother being mexican i leaned my back against the cabinets arms crossed hugging myself he didnt love me enough to go against his family i missed him in a lot of ways but my body missed him too i promised myself id never let that happen again so youre waiting for marriage he said i nodded i want you richard badly but i cant i promised id never let myself get hurt like that again he stood up and came to stand in front of me he stood close but didnt try to touch me then marry me i looked up at him yeah right no i mean it he put his hands on my shoulders gently ive thought about asking before but i was afraid you hadnt seen what a lycanthrope could do what we could be i knew you needed to see that before i could ask but i was afraid for you to see it i still havent seen you change i said do you need to standing here like this i say no but realistically if were serious probably now i stared up at him in the near dark and hugged him i folded against him and shook my head cheek sliding along his naked chest no not now he kissed the top of my head is that a yes i raised my head to look at him i should say no why because life is too complicated for this life is always complicated anita say yes yes the minute i said it i wanted it back i lusted after him a lot i even loved him maybe more than a little did i suspect him of eating little red riding hood hell he couldnt even bring himself to kill the big bad wolf of the two of us i was the more likely to slaughter people he kissed me his hands pressing against my back i drew back enough to breathe and said no sex tonight the rule still stands he lowered his mouth and spoke with our lips almost touching i know i was late to my first zombie appointment surprise surprise being late to the first meeting made me late to the other two it was by the time i got to edwards room i knocked he opened the door and stepped to one side youre late yeah i said the room was nice but standard a single kingsized bed nightstand two lamps a desk against the far wall the drapes were closed over the nearly walltowall windows the bathroom light was on door open the closet door was halfopen showing that hed hung up his clothes he planned to stay for a while the television was on sound turned off i was surprised edward didnt watch television a vcr sat on top of the tv that was not standard hotel issue you want something from room service before we get started a coke would be great he smiled you always did have champagne tastes anita he went to the phone and ordered he asked for a steak rare with a bottle of burgundy i took off my coat and laid it on the desk chair i dont drink i said i know he said you want to freshen up while we wait for the food i glanced up and caught a distant look at myself in the bathroom mirror chicken blood had dried to a sticky brick color on my face i see your point i shut the bathroom door and looked at myself in the mirror the lighting was that harsh glaring white that so many hotel bathrooms seem to have its so unflattering that even ms america wouldnt look good in it the blood stood out like reddish chalk against my pale skin i was wearing a white christmas sweatshirt that had maxine from the shoebox hallmark commercials on it she was drinking coffee with a candy cane in hand saying this is as jolly as i get bert had asked us to wear christmasytype things for the month maybe the sweatshirt wasnt exactly what he had in mind but hey it was better than some of the ones i had at home there was blood on the white cloth figures i took the sweatshirt off draping it on the bathtub there was blood smeared over my heart id even gotten a little on my silver cross id put the blood there along with the stuff on my face and hands id killed three chickens tonight raising zombies was a messy job i got one of the white washrags from the little towel rack i wondered how edward would explain the bloodstains to the maid not my problem but sort of amusing anyway i ran water into the sink and started scrubbing i caught a glimpse of myself with blood running down my face in watery rivulets i stood up and stared my face looked fresh scrubbed and sort of surprised had richard really proposed had i really said yes surely not i had said yes shit i wiped at the blood on my chest i played with monsters all the time so i was engaged to one that stopped me i sat down on the closed lid of the stool bloody washrag gripped in my hands i was engaged again the first time hed been so white bread that even judith had liked him hed been mr allamerican and i hadnt been good enough for him according to his family what had hurt most was that he hadnt loved me enough not nearly as much as id loved him id have given up everything for him not a mistake to make twice richard wasnt like that i knew that yet there was that worm of doubt fear that hed blow it fear he wouldnt blow it damned if you do damned if you dont i looked down and realized i was dripping bloody water on the linoleum i knelt and wiped it up i was scrubbed as clean as i was going to get until i showered at home if id brought clean clothes i might have done it here but i hadnt thought of it edward knocked on the door foods here i got dressed put the rag in the sink and ran cold water over it i made sure the cloth wasnt blocking the drain and opened the door the smell of steak hit me it smelled wonderful i hadnt eaten for more than eight hours and truthfully i hadnt eaten all that much then richard had distracted me do you think room service would shoot us if we asked for another order he made a small hand motion at the roomservice cart there were two orders on the cart how did you know id be hungry you always forget to eat he said my arent we being mother of the year the least i can do is feed you i looked at him whats up edward youre being awfully considerate i know you well enough to know you wont like this call the meal a peace offering wont like what lets eat watch the movie and all will be revealed he was being cagey it wasnt like him hed shoot you but he wouldnt be cute about it what are you up to edward no questions until after the movie why not because youll have better questions with that inscrutable answer he sat down on the edge of the bed and poured a glass of red wine he cut his meat which was raw enough to bleed in the center please tell me my steak isnt bloody it isnt bloody you like your meat well dead ha ha but i sat down it seemed odd sharing a meal in edwards hotel room like we were two business people traveling together just a working dinner the steak was well done thick house fries suitably spiced took up almost as much room as the steak there was a side order of broccoli which could be slid to one side and ignored the coke came in a chilled wineglass which seemed a little excessive but it looked nice the movies going to start near the end i dont think youll have any trouble picking up the plot he hit the remote control and the tv screen flickered jumping from a game show to a bedroom a woman with long brown hair lay on her back in a round bed she was nude or at least what i could see of her was nude below the waist she was hidden behind the furiously pumping buttocks of a darkhaired man this is pornography i didnt even try to keep the disbelief from my voice it certainly is i glanced at edward he was cutting his steak with neat precise hand movements he chewed a bite of steak sipped his wine and watched the screen i glanced back at the movie a second man had joined the couple on the bed he was taller than the first man with shorter hair but beyond that it was a little hard to tell mainly because i was trying not to look i sat on the edge of edwards bed with our nice steak dinners and for the first time felt awkward around edward there had never been any sexual tension between us we might kill each other someday but wed never kiss but i was still in a mans hotel room watching a porno movie and good girls just didnt do that edward what the hell is going on he hit the remote control here a face shot i turned back to the screen the frozen image stared out at me it was the second man it was alfred oh my god i said you know him edward asked yeah no sense denying it alfred was dead edward couldnt hurt him anymore name alfred i dont know the last name he hit fast forward the images on the screen moved at a furious pace doing intimate things that would have been obscene at any speed at fast forward it seemed sadder ridiculous as well as degrading he hit the pause again the woman was full face to the camera mouth open eyes heavy lidded with sexual languor her hair was spread artfully over the silken pillow it should have been provocative it managed not to be do you know her i shook my head no he hit the button again were near the end what about the other man he wears a face mask throughout the masked man had mounted the woman from behind his hips cupped her butt the line of his thigh matching hers he leaned his upper body over her nude torso hands massaging the flesh of her upper arms he seemed to be draping himself on top of her more than anything else there seemed to be very little sex going on she was supporting his full weight on her hands and knees her breath came in pants a low growl trickled through the room the camera did a closeup of the mans back the skin was rippled as if a hand had rubbed the under surface of his skin then vanished more ripples as if something small were trying to punch its way out a widerangle shot showed him still draped over the woman the ripples on his back were growing you could see things pushing against his skin movements large enough you could have seen them even if hed been dressed like those i had seen on jason last night i had to admit this part was fascinating id seen people shapeshift but never like this not in minute detail not with the loving eye of a camera on it the skin split along his back and he reared upward hands hugging her waist screaming clear liquid flowed down his back in a wash that soaked the bed and the woman underneath him the woman gave a little encouragement moving her buttocks against him thrusting against him head bowed to the bed black fur flowed outward from his back his hands shot to his sides spasming he leaned over her again hands digging into the bed the hands were just hands then those human fingers sliced into the bed ripping white stuffing from great clawed furrows the man seemed to shrink the fur flowed faster and faster almost liquid in its speed the mask dropped away the face was the wrong shape for it now the camera did a close shot of the fallen mask a bit of art in all this oh hell i didnt have a word for it the man was gone a black leopard mounted the woman and seemed very happy with the arrangement the leopard bent over the woman lips spread to reveal glistening teeth the leopard nipped her back drawing a small amount of blood she gave a low moan a shudder sweeping her body alfred came back into view he was still in human form he crawled up to the bed and kissed the woman it was a long complete kiss full of probing tongues he rose on his knees still kissing her rocking his body with the movements he seemed very excited to see her his back rippled and he tore away from her hands clutching the sheets the change seemed to go a lot faster for him the camera did a closeup of one of his hands bones slid out of the skin with wet sucking noises muscles and ligaments crawled and rearranged the skin tore and that same clear liquid poured out the hand changed into a naked claw before the dark fur flowed over it he stood on bent legs half wolf half man but all male he threw back his head and howled the sound had a deep resonating quality that filled the room the woman looked up at him eyes wide the leopard jumped off her rolling on the bed for all the world like a big kitten it rolled itself in the silken sheet until only its blackfurred face peeked out the woman lay on her back legs spreadeagled she held out her hands to the wolfman tongue flicking out along her lips as if she were really enjoying herself maybe she was the werewolf thrust into her and it wasnt gentle she gave a gasping moan as if it were the best thing shed ever felt the woman was making noises either she was a very good actor or she was coming close to climax i wasnt sure which i preferred good acting i think she came with a sound between a scream and a shout of joy she lay back gasping on the bed body liquid the werewolf gave one last shuddering thrust and drew claws down the length of her naked body she screamed then no acting required blood poured down her body in scarlet rivulets the leopard gave a startled scream and jumped off the bed the woman put her hands up in front of her face and the claws smashed her arms to one side blood poured and there was a glimpse of bone in one arm where the claws had torn all the flesh away her screams were high and continuous one loud ragged shriek after another as fast as she could draw air the werewolfs pointed muzzle lowered towards her face i had an image of the murder victims crushed jaw but he went for her throat he bit her throat out spraying a great gout of blood her eyes stared sightless at the camera wide and shiny dull with death the blood had somehow left her face untouched the werewolf reared back blood dripping from its jaws a gob of blood fell on her staring face running between her eyes the leopard leaped back onto the bed it licked her face clean with long sure strokes of its tongue the werewolf licked its way down her body stopping over her stomach it hesitated one yellow eye staring at the camera it began to feed the leopard joined the feast i closed my eyes but the sounds were enough heavy wet tearing sounds filled the room i heard myself say turn it off the sounds stopped and i assumed that edward had turned the tape off but i didnt look up to see i didnt look up until i heard the whir of the tape rewinding edward cut a bite of steak if you eat that right now i will throw up on you he smiled but he put down his silverware he looked at me his expression was neutral as it was most of the time i couldnt tell if hed enjoyed the film or been disgusted by it now you can ask me questions he said his voice was like it always was pleasant unaffected by external stimuli jesus where did you get that thing a client why give it to you the woman was his daughter oh god please tell me he didnt watch this you know he saw it you know he watched it to the end or why hire me most men dont hire people to kill their daughters lovers he hired you to kill the two men edward nodded why did you show this to me because i knew youd help me im not an assassin edward just help me identify them ill do the rest is it all right if i drink some wine i nodded he sipped his wine the dark liquid rolled around the glass looking a lot redder than it had before the movie i swallowed hard and looked away i would not throw up i would not throw up where can i find alfred nowhere i said he set his wineglass carefully on the tray anita you disappoint me i thought youd help me after seeing what they did to the girl im not being uncooperative that film is one of the worst things ive ever seen and ive seen a hell of a lot youre too late to find alfred how too late i killed him last night a smile spread across his face beautiful to behold you always make my job easier not on purpose he shrugged do you want half the fee you did do half the work i shook my head i didnt do it for money tell me what happened no why not i looked at him because you hunt lycanthropes and i dont want to give someone to you by accident the wereleopard deserves to die anita im not arguing that though technically he didnt kill the girl the father wants them both do you blame him no i guess i dont then youll help me identify the other man maybe i stood up i need to call someone i need for someone else to see this film he might be able to help you more than i could who i shook my head let me see if hell come first edward gave a long nod almost a bow with just his neck as you like i dialed richards number by heart i got his machine this is anita pick up if youre there richard pick up this is important no one picked up the phone damn i said not home edward asked do you have the number for the lunatic cafe yes give it to me he repeated the number slowly and i dialed it a woman picked up the phone it wasnt raina i was thankful for that lunatic cafe polly here how may i help you i need to speak with richard im sorry we dont have any waiters by that name look i was a guest of marcuss last night i need to speak with richard its an emergency i dont know i mean like theyre all busy in the back room look get richard on the phone now marcus doesnt like to be disturbed polly is it i have been on my feet for over thirteen hours if you do not put richard on the phone right now i am going to come down there personally and bust your ass am i making myself clear who is this she sounded a little miffed and not in the least afraid anita blake oh she said ill get richard for you right away anita right away there was an edge of panic to her voice that hadnt been there before she put me on hold someone with a sick sense of humor had compiled the muzak moonlight and roses blue moon moonlight sonata every song was a moon theme we were halfway through moon over miami when the phone clicked back to life anita its me whats wrong im all right but ive got something you need to see can you tell me what it is i know this sounds corny but not over the phone you sure youre not just looking for an excuse to see me again there was a note of teasing in his voice it had been too long a night can you meet me of course whats wrong your voice sounds awful i need a hug and to erase the last hour of my life the first you can take care of when you get here the second ill just have to live with are you home no i glanced at edward putting my hand over the mouthpiece can i give him the hotel room he nodded i gave richard the hotel room and directions ill be there as soon as i can he hesitated then said what did you say to polly shes nearly hysterical she wouldnt put you on the phone you threatened her he said yeah was it an idle threat pretty much dominant pack members dont make idle threats to subordinates im not a pack member after last night youre a dominant theyre treating you like a rogue dominant lycanthrope what does that mean it means when you say youre going to bust someones ass they believe you oh sorry dont apologize to me apologize to polly ill be there before you get her calmed down dont put her on richard thats what you get for being trigger happy people get scared of you richard a sobbing female voice came on the line i spent the next fifteen minutes convincing a crying werewolf that i wasnt going to hurt her my life was getting too strange even for me richard was wrong he didnt knock on the door while i was on the phone calming polly down she was so grateful that i had forgiven her for her rudeness that it was embarrassing waves of submissiveness poured out of the phone i hung up edward was grinning at me he had moved to one of the soft chairs did you just spend nearly twenty minutes convincing a werewolf that you werent going hurt her yes he laughed a wide abrupt sound the smile vanished leaving a sort of shimmering glow to his face his eyes glittered with something darker than humor i wasnt sure what he was thinking but it wasnt pleasant he slid down in the chair base of his skull resting on the back hands clasped over his stomach ankles crossed he looked utterly comfortable how did you come to be the terror of good little werewolves everywhere i dont think theyre used to people shooting and killing them at least not on first acquaintance his eyes simmered with some dark joke you went in there and killed someone your first night hell anita ive been down three times and havent killed anyone yet how long have you been in town he looked at me for a long moment is that an idle question or do you need to know it had occurred to me that edward could take out eight lycanthropes and leave no trace if any human could do it it was him i need to know i said a week tomorrow his eyes had gone empty they were as cool and distant as any of the shapeshifters last night theres more than one way to become a predator of course youll have to take my word for it you can check with registration but i could have changed hotels why would you lie to me because i enjoy it he said its not the lie you enjoy what do i enjoy knowing something i dont he gave a small shrug not easy for him slid down in the chair as he was he made it look graceful egotistical of you its not just from me you like keeping secrets for the pure hell of it he smiled then a slow lazy smile you do know me well i started to say were friends but the look in his eyes stopped me his stare was a little too intense he seemed to be studying me as if hed never really seen me before what are you thinking edward that you might be able to give me a run for my money whats that supposed to mean you know how i like a challenge i stared at him youre talking about coming against me seeing whos better i made it a question he didnt give me the answer i wanted yes why i wont do it you know meno money no killingbut it would be interesting dont go all spooky on me edward its just for the very first time im wondering if you would win he was scaring me i was armed and he didnt seem to be but edward was always armed dont do this edward he sat up in one liquid movement my hand jumped to my gun the gun was halfway out of its holster when i realized he hadnt done anything but sit up i let out a shaky breath and eased the gun back into the holster dont play with me edward one of us will get hurt if you do he spread his hands wide no more games i would like to know which of us was best anita but not enough to kill you i let my hand relax if edward said he would kill me tonight he meant it if we ever did do this for real hed tell me first edward liked to be sporting about these things surprising your victim made things too easy there was a knock on the door i jumped nervouswho me edward sat there as though he hadnt heard still staring at me with his spooky eyes i went to the door it was richard he put his arms around me and i let him i folded against his chest and was very aware that i couldnt pull a gun very fast clasped to richards body i drew back first and pulled him into the room he looked questioningly at me i shook my head you remember edward anita you didnt tell me you were still dating richard edwards voice was pleasant normal as if he hadnt been wondering what it would be like to kill me his face was open friendly he walked across the room with his hand outstretched he was a superb actor richard shook his hand looking a little puzzled he glanced at me whats happening anita can you set up the movie if youll let me eat during it my steak is getting ice cold edward said i swallowed hard youve seen the movie before and you still ordered steaks why maybe to see if you could eat after watching it you competitive bastard he just smiled what movie richard asked eat your steak edward well watch after youre done it bothered you that much shut up and eat he sat down on the edge of the bed and started cutting meat the meat was red blood oozed out of it i walked towards the bathroom i wasnt going to be sick but if i watched him eat that piece of meat i would be im going to hide in the bathroom you want an explanation come join me i said richard glanced at edward then back to me what is going on i pulled him into the bathroom and shut the door behind us i ran cold water in the sink and splashed it on my face he gripped my shoulders massaging are you all right i shook my head water dripping down my face i fumbled a towel and pressed it to my face holding it there a minute edward hadnt warned me because he liked to shock people and a warning would have lessened the impact how much impact did i want richard to endure i turned to him towel still clutched in my hands he looked worried all tender concern i didnt want him to look like that had i really said yes just eight hours ago it seemed less and less real the movie is a porno flick i said he looked startled good porno are you serious deadly i said why do i need to see it a thought seemed to occur to him why did you watch it with him there was the tiniest bit of anger in his voice i laughed then i laughed until tears ran down my face and i was too breathless to speak whats so funny he sounded a little indignant when i could speak without gasping i said be afraid of edward but never be jealous of him the laughter had helped i felt better less dirty less embarrassed even a little less horrified i stared up at him he was still wearing the green sweater that had ended up on my kitchen floor earlier he looked wonderful i realized i didnt in my oversize sweatshirt complete with bloodstain jeans and sneakers i had lost several notches in the cuteness game i shook my head did it matter no i was delaying i didnt want to go back out there i didnt want to watch the movie again i certainly didnt want to sit in the same room with the man i might marry and watch him watch a porno film should i spoil the ending would it excite him before it went wrong i looked at his very human face and wondered its lycanthropes and a human in the film theyre already for sale he said it was my turn to look surprised you know about the film you said they there are more of them unfortunately he said he leaned against the door sliding down to sit indian fashion on the floor if hed stretched his legs out there wouldnt have been room for both of us explain this richard it was rainas idea he said she convinced marcus to order some of us to participate did you i couldnt even say it he shook his head something tight in my chest eased raina tried to get me in front of the cameras for those that need to hide their identity they use masks i wouldnt do it did marcus order you to yes these damn films are one of the main reasons i started rising in the pack everyone higher in the structure could order me around if marcus okays it they can order you to do almost anything as long as its not illegal wait the films arent illegal bestiality is against the law in some states but we sort of slip through the cracks on the law nothing else illegal goes on in these films i asked he stared up at me whats on that film that makes you look so scared its a snuff film he just stared at me no change of expression as if waiting for me to say more when i didnt he said you cannot be serious i wish i wasnt he shook his head even raina wouldnt do that raina wasnt in the film as far as i saw but marcus wouldnt approve of that not that he stood up using only his legs and the wall he paced to the edge of the bathtub and back he brushed past me slamming his hand into the wall it gave a resounding thunk he turned and id never seen him so angry there are other packs around the country it doesnt have to be us alfred was in it he leaned his back against the far wall and slammed his palms into the wall again i cant believe it edward knocked on the door the films ready richard yanked the door open and poured into the other room like a crackling storm for the first time i felt some of that otherworldly energy radiating from him edwards eyes widened you gave him a preview i nodded the room was in darkness except for the television ill give you two love birds the bed ill sit over here he sat down in the chair again upright watching us dont mind me if the mood strikes you shut up and start the movie i said richard had sat down on the edge of the bed the roomservice cart was gone along with its offending meat great one less reason to upchuck richard seemed to have calmed down he seemed normal enough sitting there that wash of energy was gone so cleanly that i wondered if id imagined it i glanced at edwards face he was watching richard as if he had done something interesting i hadnt imagined it i thought about turning on the lights but didnt darkness seemed better for this edward showtime he said he hit the button and it began again richard stiffened at the first image did he recognize the other man i didnt ask not yet let him see it then questions i didnt want to sit on the bed with my sweetie while this filth played maybe i hadnt really thought about what sex might mean to richard did it mean shapeshifting bestiality i hoped not and wasnt sure how to find out without asking and i didnt want to ask if the answer was yes to the bestiality the wedding was off i finally walked across the screen and sat down in the other chair beside edward i didnt want to see the film again apparently neither did edward we both watched richard watch the film i wasnt sure what i expected to see or even what i wanted to see edwards face gave nothing away his eyes closed about halfway through hed slid down in the chair again he looked asleep but i knew better he was aware of everything in the room i wasnt sure edward ever really slept richard watched alone he sat on the very edge of the bed hands clasped together shoulders hunched his eyes were bright reflecting the light of the television set i could almost watch the action playing over his face sweat glistened on his upper lip he wiped it away catching me looking at him he looked embarrassed then angry dont watch me anita his voice was choked tight with something more than emotion or less i couldnt pretend sleep like edward what the hell was i supposed to do i got up and walked towards the bathroom i studiously did not look at the screen but i had to cross in front of it i felt richard track me as i moved his eyes on my back made my skin itch i wiped suddenly sweating palms on my jeans i turned slowly to look at him he was looking at me not the movie there was rage on his faceanger was too mild a wordand hatred i didnt think it was me he was angry with that left who raina marcus himself the womans scream jerked his head around to the film i watched his face while his friend killed her the rage blossomed on his face spilling out his mouth in an inarticulate cry he slid off the bed to his knees covering his face with his hands edward was standing i caught the movement on the edge of my vision and found him holding a gun that had magically appeared i was holding the browning we stared at each other over richards kneeling body richard had rolled into an almost fetal position rocking slowly back and forth on his knees the sounds of tearing flesh came from the screen he raised a shocked face caught one glimpse of the screen and scrambled towards me i stepped out of the way and he let me he was going for the bathroom the door slammed shut and a few seconds later the sound of his retching came through the door edward and i stood out in the room looking at each other we still had our guns out you go for your gun as quickly as i do that wasnt true two years ago its been a rough two years i said he smiled most people wouldnt have seen me move in the dark my night vision is excellent i said ill remember that lets call a truce tonight edward im too tired to screw with it tonight he gave one nod and tucked the gun at the small of his back that wasnt where the gun started out i said no he said it wasnt i holstered the browning and knocked on the bathroom door admittedly i didnt turn completely around i just wasnt easy with edward at my back right that moment richard are you all right no his voice sounded deeper hoarse can i come in there was a long pause then maybe you better i pushed the door open carefully didnt want to smack him with it he was still kneeling over the toilet head down long hair hiding his face he had a bunch of toilet paper crumbled in one hand the sharp sweet smell of vomit hung in the air i closed the door and leaned against it can i help he shook his head i smoothed his hair back on one side he jerked away from me as if id burned him he ended up huddled in the corner trapped between the wall and the bathtub the look on his face was wild panicked i knelt in front of him dont touch me please okay i wont touch you now whats wrong he wouldnt look at me his eyes wandered the room not settling on anything but definitely avoiding me talk to me richard i cant believe marcus knows he cant know he wouldnt allow it could raina do it without his knowing he nodded shes a real bitch i noticed i have to tell marcus he wont believe it he might need to see the film his words were almost normal but his voice was still breathy thin panicked if he kept this up he was going to hyperventilate take a slow deep breath richard its all right he shook his head but it isnt i thought youd seen us at our worst he gave a loud spitting laugh oh god now you really have i reached for him to comfort to do something dont touch me he screamed it at me i backed up and ended sitting with my back pressed against the far wall it was as far away as i could get without leaving the room what the hell is wrong with you i want you right now here after seeing that it excited you i made it a question god help me he said is that what sex means to you not the killing but before it can but it isnt safe in animal form were contagious you know that but its a temptation i said yes he crawled towards me and i felt myself recoil he sat back on his knees and just looked at me i am not just a man anita i am what i am i dont ask you to literally embrace the other half but you have to look at it you have to know what it is or its not going to work between us he studied my face or have you changed your mind i didnt know what to say his eyes didnt look wild anymore they had gone dark and deep there was a heat to his gaze to his face that had nothing to do with horror he rose on all fours the movement was enough to bring him close to me i stared at his face from inches away he gave a long shuddering sigh and energy prickled along my skin i was left gasping his otherness beat against my skin like a crashing wave the wash of it pressed me against the wall like an invisible hand he leaned into me lips almost touching then moved past his breath was hot against the side of my face think how it could be making love like this feeling the power crawl over your skin while i was inside you i wanted to touch him and i was afraid to touch him he drew back enough to look me in the face close enough to kiss it would be so good his lips brushed mine he whispered the next words into my mouth like a secret and all this lust comes from me seeing blood and death and imagining her fear he was standing as if someone had pulled him upright with strings it was magically quick it made alfred last night look slow this is what i am anita i can pretend to be human im better at it than marcus but its just a game no but my voice was just a whisper he swallowed hard enough for me to hear it ive got to go he offered me his hand i realized he couldnt open the door with me sitting there not without banging me with it i knew if i refused his hand that that would be it he would never ask again and i would never say yes i took his hand he let out a long breath his skin was hot to the touch almost burning hot his skin sent little shock waves through my arm touching him with all his power loose in the room was too amazing for words he raised my hand to his mouth he didnt so much kiss my hand as nuzzle it rub it along his cheek trace his tongue over my wrist he dropped it so abruptly i stumbled back i have to get out of here now there was sweat on his face again he stepped out into the room the lights were on this time edward was sitting in the chair hands loose in his lap no weapon in sight i stood in the bathroom door feeling richards power swirl out and fill the outer room like water too long imprisoned edward showed great restraint not going for a gun richard stalked to the door and you could almost feel the waves of his passing in the air he stopped with his hand on the doorknob ill tell marcus if i can get him alone if raina interferes well have to think of something else he gave one last glance at me then he was gone i almost expected him to run down the hallway but he didnt selfrestraint at its best edward and i stood in the doorway and watched him vanish around the corner he turned to me youre dating that minutes ago i would have been insulted but my skin was vibrating with the backwash of richards power i couldnt pretend anymore hed asked me to marry him and id said yes but i hadnt understood not really he wasnt human he really truly wasnt the question was how big a difference did that make answer i hadnt the foggiest i slept sunday morning and missed church i hadnt gotten home until nearly seven oclock in the morning there was no way to make a ten oclock service surely god understood the need for sleep even if he didnt have to do it himself late afternoon found me at washington university i was in the office of dr louis fane louie to his friends the earlywinter evening was filling the sky with soft purple clouds strips of sky like a lighted backdrop for the clouds showed through his single office window he rated a window most doctorates didnt doctorates are cheap on a college campus louie sat with his back to the window he had turned on the desk lamp it made a pool of golden warmth against the coming night we sat in that last pool of light and it seemed more private than it should have a last stand against the dark god i was melancholy today louies office was suitably cluttered one wall was ceilingtofloor bookshelves filled with biology textbooks nature essays and a complete set of james herriot books the skeleton of a little brown bat was laid behind glass and hung on his wall by his diploma there was a bat identification poster on his door like the ones you buy for bird feeders you know common birds of eastern missouri louies doctoral thesis had been on the adaptation of the little brown bat to human habitation his shelves were lined with souvenirs seashells a piece of petrified wood pinecones bark with dried lichen on it all the bits and pieces that biology majors are always picking up louie was about five foot six with eyes as black as my own his hair was straight and fine growing a little below his shoulders it wasnt a fashion statement as it was with richard it sort of looked as though louie had just not gotten around to cutting his hair in a while he had a square face a slender build and looked sort of inoffensive but muscles worked in his forearms as he tented his fingers and looked at me even if he hadnt been a wererat i might not have offered to armwrestle him he had come in specially to talk to me on a sunday it was my day off too it was the first sunday that richard and i hadnt at least talked to each other in months richard had called and canceled saying it was pack business i hadnt been able to ask questions because you cant argue with your answering machine i didnt call him back i wasnt ready to talk to him not after last night i felt like a fool this morning id said yes to a proposal from someone i didnt know i knew what richard had shown me his outward face but inside was a whole new world that i had just begun to visit what did you and the rest of the professors think of the footprints the police sent over we think its a wolf a wolf why its certainly a big canine it isnt a dog and other than wolves thats about it even allowing for the fact that the canine foot is mixed with human even allowing could it be peggy smitz peggy could control herself really well why would she kill someone i dont know why wouldnt she kill someone he leaned back in his chair it squeaked under his weight fair question peggy was as much a pacifist as the pack would let her be she didnt fight not unless forced into it was she high in the pack structure shouldnt you be asking richard these questions he is next in line to the throne so to speak i just looked at him i wouldnt look away as if i were guilty of something i smell trouble in paradise he said i ignored the hint business we had business to discuss peggys husband came to see me he wanted me to look for her he didnt know about the other missing lycanthropes why wouldnt peggy have told him a lot of us survive in relationships by pretending as hard as we can that we arent what we are i bet peggy didnt talk pack business with her husband how hard is it to pretend the better you control the easier it is to pretend so it can be done would you want to go through your life pretending you didnt raise zombies never talking about it never sharing it having your husband embarrassed by it or sickened by it i felt my face burn i wanted to deny it i wasnt embarrassed by richard or sickened but i wasnt comfortable either not comfortable enough to protest it doesnt sound like a very good way to live i said it isnt there was a very heavy silence in the room if he thought i was going to spill the beans he was wrong when all else goes to hell concentrate on business the police were all over the area where the body was found today sergeant storr said they didnt find anything but a few more footprints a little blood truth was they had found some fresh rifle slugs in the trees near the kill area but i wasnt sure i was free to share that with the lycanthrope community it was police business i was lying to both sides it didnt seem like a good way to run a murder investigation or a missingperson case if the police and the pack would share information we might be able to solve this case he shrugged its not my call anita im just an indian not a chief richards a chief i said not as long as marcus and raina are alive i didnt think richard had to fight her for pack dominance i thought it was marcuss fight louie laughed if you think raina would let marcus lose without helping him you havent met the woman i have met her i just thought her helping marcus was against pack law he shrugged again i dont know about pack law but i know raina if richard would play footsie with her she might even help him defeat marcus but hes made it very clear that he doesnt like her richard said she had this idea about lycanthrope porno movies louies eyes widened richard told you about that i nodded im surprised he was embarrassed about the whole idea raina was hot and heavy to have him be her costar i think she was trying to seduce him but she misjudged her boy richard is too private to ever have sex for a camera rainas starred in some of the movies so im told have any of the wererats appeared in the flicks he shook his head rafael forbid it were one of the few groups that refused it flat rafaels a good man and a good rat louie said i smiled yeah whats up with you and richard what do you mean he left a message on my answering machine said he had big news concerning you when i saw him in person he said it was nothing what happened i didnt know what to say not a new event lately i think it has to be richards news he said something about it being your choice and he couldnt talk about it you say its his business and you cant talk about it i wish one of you would talk to me i opened my mouth closed it and sighed i had questions that i needed answers to but louie was richards friend before he was mine loyalty and all that but who the hell else could i ask irving he was in enough trouble with richard ive heard richard and rafael talk about controlling their beasts does that mean the change he nodded yes he looked at me eyes narrowing if youve heard richard talk about his beast you must have seen him close to changing what happened last night if richard didnt tell you louie i dont think i can the grapevine says you killed alfred is that true yes he looked at me as if waiting for more then shrugged raina wont like that marcus didnt seem too pleased either but he wont jump you in a dark alley she will why didnt richard tell me that richard is one of the best friends i have hes loyal honest caring sort of the worlds furriest boy scout if he has a flaw its that he expects other people to be loyal honest and caring surely after what hes seen from marcus and raina he doesnt still think theyre nice people he knows they arent nice but he has trouble seeing them as evil when all is said and done anita marcus is his alpha male richard respects authority hes been trying to work out some sort of compromise with marcus for months he doesnt want to kill him marcus doesnt have the same qualms about richard irving told me richard defeated marcus could have killed him and didnt is that true fraid so shit yeah i told richard he should have done it but hes never killed anyone he believes all life is precious all life is precious i said some life is just more precious than others louie said i nodded yeah did richard change for you last night god you are relentless you said it was one of my better qualities it is normally it was like being picked at by ronnie she never gave up either did he change for you sort of i said and you couldnt handle it it was a flat statement im not sure louie im just not sure better to find out now he said i guess so do you love him none of your damn business i love richard like a brother if youre going to slice his heart up and serve it on a platter id like to know now if you leave ill be the one helping him pick up the pieces i dont want to hurt richard i said i believe you he just looked at me there was a great peacefulness to his expression as if he could wait all night for me to answer the question louie had more patience than i would ever have yes i love him happy do you love him enough to embrace his furry side his eyes were staring at me as if theyd burn a hole through my heart i dont know if he were human shit if he were human youd marry him maybe he was kind enough to make it a question maybe i said but it wasnt a maybe if richard had been human id be a very happily engaged woman right now of course there was another male that wasnt human that had been trying to get me to date him for a while jeanclaude had said that richard wasnt any more human than he was i hadnt believed him i was beginning to it looked like i owed jeanclaude an apology not that i would ever admit it to him a writer came to my office yesterday elvira drew shes doing a book on shapeshifters it sounds legit and could be good press i explained the format of the book sounds good actually he said where do i come in guess shes missing a wererat interview bingo i cant afford to be exposed anita you know that it doesnt have to be you is there anyone among you that would be willing to meet with her ill ask around he said thanks louie i stood he stood and offered me his hand his grip was firm but not too strong just right i wondered how fast he really was and how easy it would be for him to crush my hand into pulp it must have shown on my face because he said you might want to stop dating richard until you get this sorted out i nodded yeah maybe we stood there in silence for a moment there didnt seem to be anything left to say so i left i was all out of clever repartee or even a good joke it was barely dark and i was tired tired enough to go home and crawl into bed and hide instead i was on my way to the lunatic cafe i was going to try and convince marcus to let me talk to the police eight missing one dead human it didnt have to be connected but if it was a werewolf then marcus would know who did the killing or raina would know would they tell me maybe maybe not but i had to ask theyd come closer to telling me the truth than they would to the police funny how all the monsters talked to me and not to the police you had to begin to wonder why the monsters were so damn comfortable around me i raised zombies and slew vampires who was i to throw stones i walked along the campus sidewalk towards my car i walked from one pool of light to the next my breath fogged in the glow of the streetlights it was my night off so i was dressed all in black bert wouldnt let me wear black to work said it gave the wrong impressiontoo harshassociated with evil magic if hed done any research hed have found that red white and a host of other colors are used in evil rituals it depends on the religion it was very anglosaxon of him to outlaw only black black jeans black nike airs with a blue swoosh a black sweater and a black trench coat even my guns and holsters were black i was just monochrome as hell tonight i was wearing silver but it was hidden under the sweater a cross and a knife on each forearm i was headed for the lunatic cafe i was going to try to persuade marcus to let me share information with the police the missing lycanthropes even the ones like peggy smitz who didnt want their secret known were safe from bad publicity now they were dead they had to be there is no way to hold eight shapeshifters against their will for this long not alive it couldnt hurt them to tell the cops and it might save any other shapeshifters from going missing i had to talk to the people who had last seen the missing ones why had none of them put up a fight that had to be a clue ronnie was better at this sort of thing than i was maybe we could go out detecting tomorrow would richard be there if so what was i supposed to say to him it made me stop walking i stood in the cold dark trapped between streetlights i wasnt ready to see richard again but we had a dead body maybe more i couldnt chicken out just because i didnt want to see richard it would be pure cowardice truth was i would rather have faced down a herd of vampires than one wouldbe fiancй the wind whistled at my back as if a blizzard were moving up behind me my hair streamed around my face the trees were icy still no wind i whirled browning in my hand something slammed into my back sending me smashing into the sidewalk i tried to save myself arms slamming into the concrete first my arms went numb and tingling i couldnt feel my hands my head snapped downward there is that moment after a really good head blow that you cant react a frozen moment when you wonder if youll ever be able to move again someone was sitting on my back hands jerked my coat on the left side i heard the cloth rip the feeling was coming back in my arms id lost the browning i tried to roll over on my side to go for the firestar a hand slammed my head into the sidewalk again light exploded inside my head my vision went dark and when i could see again i caught gretchens face rearing above me she had a handful of my hair pulled painfully to one side my sweater was ripped away from my shoulder gretchens mouth was stretched wide fangs shimmering in the dark i screamed the firestar was trapped under my body i went for one of the knives but it was under the sleeve of my coat the sleeve of my sweater i wasnt going to get there in time there was a high scream and it wasnt me a woman was standing at the end of the sidewalk screaming gretchen raised her head and hissed at them the man with her grabbed her shoulders and pushed her off the path they ran wise i plunged the knife into her throat it wasnt a killing blow and i knew it but i thought shed rear give me a chance at the firestar she didnt i shoved the knife in to its hilt blood poured down my hand splattered my face she darted downward going for my throat the knife had done as much damage as it could there was no time to go for the second blade i was still pinned over the gun i had forever to watch her mouth coming for me to know i was going to die something dark smashed into her rolling her off me with the impact i was left gasping on the sidewalk blinking i had the firestar in my hand i didnt remember getting it out practice practice practice there was a wererat on top of gretchen the dark muzzle darted downward teeth glimmering gretchen grabbed his muzzle holding those snapping teeth from her throat a furred claw slashed her pale face blood flowed she screamed punching one hand into his stomach it raised him in the air just enough for her to get her legs under him she lifted with her legs and shoved him into the air the wererat went tumbling like a thrown ball gretchen was on her feet like magic i sighted down the barrel of the gun still on the ground but she was gone into the bushes after the wererat id missed my chance snarls and snapping branches came from the darkness it had to be louie i didnt know that many wererats that would come to my rescue i stood up and the world swam i stumbled and it took everything i had to stay standing for the first time i wondered how badly i was hurt i knew i was scraped up some because i could feel that sharp stinging pain that taking off the first layer of skin will get you i raised a hand to my head and it came away with blood some of it was mine i tried another step and i could do it maybe id just tried to stand too fast i hoped so i didnt know if a wererat could take a vampire or not but i wasnt standing out here in the clear and waiting to find out i was at the edge of the trees when they rolled out of the darkness and over me i lay on the pavement for the second time but there was no time to get my wind back i rolled onto my right side sighting down my arm towards the noise the movement was too sudden my vision swam when i could focus again gretchen had sunk fangs into louies neck he gave a high wild squeal i couldnt shoot her lying down all i could see from here was the rats body her arms and legs riding him but the only shot i had that might kill her was a line of her blond head i didnt dare try it i might kill louie too even clearheaded it would have been an iffy shot i got to my knees the world shifted and nausea rolled at the back of my throat when the world was still again there was still nothing to shoot at some trick of a distant streetlight flashed on the blood pouring from his throat if shed had the teeth louie had hed be dead i fired into the ground near them hoping it would scare her off it didnt i aimed at a tree just above her head it was as close to louie as i dared get the bullet exploded in the tree one blue eye looked at me while she fed off of him she was going to kill him while i watched shoot her it was louies voice twisted around furry jaws but his voice his eyes glazed and closed while i watched last words i took a deep steadying breath and aimed twohanded one hand cupping the other in a teacup grip i sighted on that one pale eye darkness swam over my vision i waited on my knees blind for my vision to clear and me to pull that trigger if my vision went while i was firing id hit louie i was out of options or maybe not richard asked me to marry him and i said yes you can smell a lie i said yes to marrying someone else we dont have to do this she hesitated i stared into her eye my vision was clear arm steady i pressed on the trigger she released his throat sliding her head into his neck fur hiding her voice came muffled but clear enough put down your little gun and i will let him go i took a breath and raised the gun skyward let him go the gun first she said i didnt want to give up my only gun that seemed like a really bad idea but what choice did i have if i were gretchen i wouldnt want me armed i did still have the second knife but from this distance it was useless even if i could throw well enough to put it through her heart it would have to be a very solid blow she was too old for a glancing blow to do much good id shoved a knife hiltdeep into her throat and it hadnt slowed her down it had impressed me i laid the firestar on the sidewalk and raised my hands to show myself unarmed gretchen rose slowly from behind louies limp body without her propping him up his body rolled onto its back there was a looseness to the movement that unnerved me was it too late could a vampires bite kill like silver the vampire and i stared at each other my knife was sticking out of her throat like an exclamation mark she hadnt even bothered to take it out jesus i must have missed the voice box or she wouldnt have been able to talk even vampirism has its limits i was meeting her eyes nothing was happening it was like looking into anyones eyes that shouldnt have been maybe she was holding her power in check naw is he still alive come closer and see for yourself no thanks if louie was dead my being dead wouldnt help that she smiled tell me again this news of yours richard asked me to marry him and i said yes you love this richard yes this was no time for hesitation she accepted it with a nod i guess it was true surprise surprise tell jeanclaude and i will be content i plan on telling him tonight fine tonight lie when i leave you will tend your wounds and his and not tell jeanclaude i couldnt even get away with a little white lie shit what do you want he is at guilty pleasures tonight go there and tell him i will be waiting for you i have to tend to his wounds before i do anything i said tend his wounds but come to guilty pleasures before dawn or our truce is over why not tell jeanclaude yourself he would not believe me he could tell you were telling the truth i said just because i believed it was truth would not make it so but he will smell the truth on you if i am not there wait for me i want to be there when you tell him you love another i want to see his face fall fine ill be there before dawn she stepped over louies body she had the browning in her right hand held palm over the barrel and grip not to fire but to keep me from it she stalked to me and picked up the firestar eyes never leaving me blood dripped down the knife hilt in her throat the blood fell in a heavy wet splat she smiled as my eyes widened i knew it didnt kill them but id thought it hurt maybe they only took the blades out from habit it certainly didnt seem to bother gretchen you can have these back after you tell him she said youre hoping he kills me i said i would shed no tears great gretchen took a step backwards then another she stopped at the edge of the trees a pale form in the dark i await you anita blake do not disappoint me this night ill be there i said she smiled flashing bloody teeth stepped back again and was gone i thought it was a mind trick but there was a backwash of air the trees shook as if a storm were passing i looked up and caught a glimpse of something not wings not a bat but something something my eyes couldnt or wouldnt make sense of the wind died and the winter dark was as still and quiet as a tomb sirens wailed in the distance i guess the coeds had called the cops couldnt say i blamed them i stood carefully the world didnt spin great i walked to louie his ratman form lay very still and dark on the grass i knelt and another wave of dizziness took me i waited on all fours for it to pass when the world was steady once more i put my hand on his furcovered chest i let out a sigh when his chest rose and fell under my palm alive breathing fantastic if hed been in human form id have checked his neck wound i was pretty sure that just touching his blood in animal form wouldnt give me lycanthropy but i wasnt one hundred percent i had enough problems without turning furry once a month besides if i had to pick an animal a rat wouldnt be it the sirens were getting closer i wasnt sure what to do he was badly hurt but id seen richard worse off and he had healed but had he needed some medical attention to get healed i didnt know i could hide louie in the bushes but would i be leaving him to die if the cops saw him like this his secret was out his life would be in a shambles around him just because hed helped me it didnt seem fair a long sigh rose from his pointed muzzle a shudder ran through his body the fur began to recede like the tide pulling back the awkward ratlike limbs began to straighten his bent legs straightened i watched his human form rise from the fur like a shape caught in ice louie lay there on the dark grass pale and naked and very human id never seen the process in reverse before it was just as spectacular as the change to animal form but it wasnt as frightening maybe because of the end product the wound on his neck was more like an animal bite than a vampire skin torn but two of the marks were deeper fangs there was no blood on the wound now as i watched blood started to flow i couldnt tell for sure in the dark but it looked like the wound was already beginning to heal i checked his pulse it was steady strong but what did i know i wasnt a doctor the siren was silent but lights strobed the darkness just over the trees like colored lightning the cops were coming and i had to decide what to do my head was feeling better my vision was clear the dizziness seemed to be gone of course i hadnt tried to stand again i could carry him in a firemans carry not too fast and not too far but i could do it the bite marks were shrinking hell hed be healed by morning i couldnt let the cops see him and i couldnt leave him here i didnt know if lycanthropes could freeze to death but i didnt feel lucky tonight i covered him with my coat wrapping it around him as i lifted wouldnt do for him to get frostbite on certain delicate places you lose a toe and there you are i took a deep breath and stood with him across my shoulders my knees didnt like lifting him but i got to my feet and my vision wavered i stood there bracing against a suddenly moving world i fell to my knees the extra weight made it hurt the police were coming if i didnt get out of here right now i might as well give it up giving up wasnt one of my better things i got to one knee and gave that last push my knees screamed at me but i was standing black waves passed over my eyes i just stood there letting it sway over me the dizziness wasnt as bad this time the nausea was worse id throw up later i stayed on the sidewalk i didnt trust myself in the snow besides even city cops could follow prints in the snow a planting of trees hid me from the direction of the flashing lights the sidewalk led around a building once around that i could backtrack to my car the thought of driving while my vision kept sweeping in and out was a bad idea but if i didnt get some distance between me and the cops all this effort would be wasted i had to get to the car i had to get louie out of sight i didnt look back to see if there were flashlights sweeping the area looking back wouldnt help and with louie on my shoulders it was a lot of effort to turn i put one foot in front of the other and the edge of the building curved around us we were out of sight even if they cleared the trees progress great the side of the building stretched like some dark monolith to my left the distance around the building seemed to be growing i put one foot in front of the other if i just concentrated on walking i could do this louie seemed to be getting lighter that wasnt right was i about to pass out and just didnt know it yet i looked up and found the edge of the building right beside me id lost some time there it was a bad sign i was betting i had a concussion it couldnt be too bad or id pass out right why didnt i believe that i peered around the corner concentrating on not whacking louies legs into the building it took a lot more concentration than it should have the police lights strobed the darkness the car was parked on the edge of the lot with one door open the radio filled the night with garbled squawking the car looked empty squinting at something that far away brought a wave of blackness across my eyes how the hell was i going to drive one problem at a time right now just get louie to the jeep out of sight i stepped away from the sheltering building it was my last refuge if the cops came now with me walking across the parking lot it was over on a sunday night there werent a lot of cars in the visitors parking lot my jeep sat under one of the streetlights i always parked under a light if i could safety rule number one for women traveling alone after dark the jeep looked like it was in a spotlight the light was probably not that bright it just looked that way because i was trying to be sneaky somewhere about halfway to the jeep i realized that the head injury wasnt the only problem sure i could lift this much weight even walk with it but not forever my knees were trembling every step was getting slower and took more effort if i fell down again i wasnt going to be able to pick louie back up i wasnt even sure id be able to get me back up one foot in front of the other just one foot in front of the other i concentrated on my feet until the jeeps tires came into view there that wasnt so hard the car keys were of course in the coat pocket i hit the button on the key chain that unlocked the doors the highpitched beeping noise that signaled them open only sounded loud enough to wake the dead i opened the middle doors balancing louie one handed i let him fall into the backseat the coat fell open revealing a naked line of body i must have been feeling better than i thought because i took the time to fling the coat over his groin and lower chest it left one arm flung outward limp and awkward but that was all right my sense of propriety could live with a naked arm i closed the door and caught a glimpse of myself in the sideview mirror one side of my face was a bloody mask the clean parts had bloody scrapes i slid into the jeep and got a box of aloe and lanolin baby wipes from the floorboard id started carrying the wipes to help with the blood from zombie raisings it worked better than the plain soap and water that i had been carrying i wiped enough blood off that i wouldnt get stopped by the first cop that drove by then slid behind the wheel i glanced in the rearview mirror the police car still stood there alone like a dog waiting for its master the motor kicked i put the car in gear and hit the gas the jeep weaved towards a streetlight as if it were a magnet i slammed the brakes on and was glad id worn my seat belt okay so i was just a bit disoriented i hit the light on my sunshade thats supposed to let you check your makeup and checked my eyes instead the pupils were even if one pupil had been blown that might have meant i was bleeding inside my head people died from things like that id have turned us in to the cops and gotten a ride to the hospital but it wasnt that bad i hoped i clicked the light off and eased the jeep forward if i drove very slowly the car wouldnt want to kiss the streetlight great i inched out of the parking lot expecting to hear shouts behind me nothing the street was dark and lined with cars on either side i crawled down the street at about ten miles per hour afraid to go faster it looked like i was driving through cars on one side illusion but unnerving as hell a bigger street and headlights stabbed at my eyes i put my hand up to shield my eyes and nearly ran into a parked car shit i had to pull over before i hit something four more blocks before i found a gas station with pay phones outside i wasnt sure how rough i looked i didnt want some overzealous clerk to call the police after id gone to all the trouble of getting away undetected i eased the jeep into the parking lot if i overcorrected and took out the gas pumps they might call the cops anyway i pulled the jeep in front of the phone bank i put it in park and was very relieved to be standing still i fumbled a quarter out of the ashtray it had never held anything but change when i left the car for the first time i was aware of how cold it was without my coat there was a line of cold going down my back where the sweater had been ripped away i dialed richards number without thinking about it who else could i call the answering machine kicked in dammit be home richard be home the beep sounded richard this is anita louies hurt pick up if youre there richard richard dammit richard pick up i leaned my forehead against the cool metal of the phone booth pick up pick up pick up richard dammit he picked up sounding out of breath anita its me whats wrong louie got hurt his wounds healing how do you explain that to a hospital emergency room you dont he said we have doctors that can tend him ill give you an address to go to i cant drive are you hurt yeah how bad bad enough that i dont want to drive what happened to the two of you i gave him a very abbreviated version of the nights events just a vampire attack no specific motive i wasnt ready to tell him i had to tell jeanclaude about our engagement because i wasnt sure we still had one hed asked i said yes but now i wasnt sure i wasnt even sure richard was sure anymore give me the address i did i know the gas station youre talking about i stop there when i visit louie sometimes great when can you be here are you going to be all right until i can get there sure because if youre not call the police dont risk your life just to keep louies secret he wouldnt want that ill keep that in mind dont get macho on me anita i dont want anything to happen to you i smiled with my forehead pressed against the phone machos the only way i got this far just get here richard ill be waiting i hung up before he could get mushy on me i was feeling too pitiful to withstand much sympathy i got back into the jeep it was cold inside the car id forgotten to turn on the heater i turned the heater on full blast i knelt on the seat and checked on louie he hadnt moved i touched the skin of his wrist checking for the pulse it was strong and steady for the heck of it i lifted his hand and let it flop back no reaction i hadnt really expected one usually a lycanthrope stayed in animal form for eight or ten hours changing back early took a lot of energy even if he hadnt been hurt louie would be asleep for the rest of the night though sleep was too mild a word for it you couldnt wake them from it it wasnt a great survival method just like sleeping during the day didnt help vampires much evolutions way of helping us puny humans out i slid down in my seat i wasnt sure how long it would take for richard to get here i glanced at the station building the man behind the counter was reading a magazine he wasnt taking any notice of us at the moment if hed been watching i would have moved out of the lights didnt want him wondering why i was sitting here but if he wasnt paying attention wed just sit here i leaned back putting my head against the headrest i wanted to close my eyes but didnt i was pretty sure i had a concussion going to sleep wasnt a good idea id had one head injury worse than this but jeanclaude had cured it but a vampire mark was a little harsh for a mild concussion this was the first time id been badly hurt since i lost jeanclaudes marks they had made me harder to hurt faster to heal not a bad side effect one of the other effects had been an ability to meet a vampires eyes without them being able to bespell me like i had met gretchens eyes how had i met her eyes with impunity had jeanclaude lied to me was there some lingering mark another question to ask him when i saw him of course after i told him the news bulletin all hell would break loose and there would be no more questions well maybe one question would jeanclaude try to kill richard probably i sighed closing my eyes i was suddenly tired so tired i didnt want to open my eyes sleep sucked at me i opened my eyes and slid up in the seat maybe it was just tension adrenaline draining away or maybe it was a concussion i clicked on the overhead light and checked on louie again breathing and pulse were steady his head was to one side neck stretched in a long line that showed the wound the bite marks were healing i couldnt see it happening but every time i looked it was better like trying to watch a flower bloom you see the effect but you never actually see it happening louie was going to be all right would richard be all right id said yes because in the heat of the moment i meant it i could see spending my life with him before bert found me and showed me how to use my talent for money id had a life id gone hiking camping id been a biology major and thought id go on for my masters and doctorate and study preternatural creatures for the rest of my life sort of the preternatural jane goodall richard had reminded me of all that of what id originally thought my life would be like i hadnt planned on spending my life ass deep in blood and death really if i gave in to jeanclaude it would be admitting that there was nothing but death nothing but violence sexy attractive but death all the same id thought with richard i had a chance at life something better after last night i wasnt even sure of that was it too much to ask for someone who was human hell i knew a lot of women in my age bracket that couldnt get a date at all id been one of them until richard all right jeanclaude would have taken me out but i was avoiding him i couldnt imagine dating jeanclaude as if he were an ordinary guy i could imagine having sex with him but not dating the thought of him picking me up at eight dropping me off and being satisfied with a goodnight kiss seemed ridiculous i stayed kneeling in the seat staring down at louie i was afraid to turn around and get comfortable afraid id fall asleep and not wake up i wasnt really afraid but i was worried a trip to the hospital might not be a bad idea but first i had to tell jeanclaude about richard and keep him from killing him i laid my face on my arms and a deep throbbing pain started behind my forehead good my head should hurt after the beating it had taken the fact that it hadnt been hurting had worried me a good headache i could live with how was i going to keep richard alive i smiled richard was an alpha wolf what made me think he couldnt take care of himself id seen what jeanclaude could do id seen him when he wasnt human at all maybe after i saw richard change id feel differently about him maybe i wouldnt feel so protective maybe hell would freeze over i did love richard i really did id meant that yes id meant it before last night before i felt his power creep over my skin jeanclaude had been right about one thing richard wasnt human the snuff film had excited him was jeanclaudes idea of sex any stranger than that id never let myself find out someone knocked on the window i jumped and whirled my vision swam in black streamers when i could see again richards face was outside the window i unlocked the doors and richard opened one he started to reach for me and stopped the hesitation on his face was painful he wasnt sure id let him touch me i turned away from the hurt on his face i loved him but love isnt enough all the fairy tales the romance novels the soap operas theyre all lies love does not conquer all he was very careful not to touch me his voice was neutral anita are you all right you look awful nice to know i look like i feel i said he touched my cheek fingers sliding just over the skin a ghost of a touch that made me shiver he traced the edge of the scrape it hurt and i jerked away a spot of blood decorated his fingertips gleaming in the dome light i watched his eyes stare at the blood i saw the thought trail behind his true brown eyes he almost licked his fingers clean as rafael had done he wiped his fingers on his coat but id seen the hesitation he knew id seen it anita the back door opened and i whirled going for the last knife i had on me the world swam in waves of blackness and nausea the movement had been too abrupt stephen the werewolf stood in the halfopen door staring at me he was sort of frozen there blue eyes wide he was looking at the silver knife in my hand the fact that id been blind and too sick to use it seemed to have escaped him it might have been that i was kneeling moving towards him id been willing to strike blind as a bat not considering that whoever it was had a right to be there you didnt tell me you brought someone with you i said i should have mentioned that richard said i relaxed easing back to kneel in the seat yeah you should have mentioned that the knife gleamed in the dome light it looked razor sharp and well tended it was i was just going to check on louie stephen said he sounded a little shaky he had a black leather jacket with silver studding snapped tight around his throat his long curling blond hair fell forward over the jacket he looked like an effeminate biker fine i said stephen looked past me to richard i felt more than saw richard nod its okay stephen there was something in his voice that made me turn slowly to look at him he had a strange look on his face maybe you are as dangerous as you pretend to be i dont pretend richard he nodded maybe you dont is that a problem as long as you dont shoot me or my pack members i guess not i cant promise about your pack theyre mine to protect he said then make sure they leave me the hell alone would you fight me over that he asked would you fight me he smiled but it wasnt happy i couldnt fight you anita i could never hurt you thats where were different richard he leaned in as if to kiss me something on my face stopped him i believe you good i said i slipped the knife back in its sheath i stared at his face while i did it i didnt need to look to put the knife away never underestimate me richard and what im willing to do to stay alive to keep others alive i never want us to fight not like that but if you dont control your pack then i will he moved away from me his face looked almost angry is that a threat its out of control and you know it i cant promise not to hurt them unless you can guarantee that theyll behave and you cant do that no i cant guarantee that he didnt like saying it then dont ask me to promise not to hurt them can you at least try not to kill them as a first option i thought about that i dont know maybe you cant just say yes richard i wont kill your friends it would be a lie he nodded i suppose so i heard the rustle of leather from the backseat as stephen moved around louies out of it but hell be okay how did you get him into the jeep richard asked i just stared at him he had the grace to look embarrassed you carried him i knew that he touched the cut on my forehead gently it still hurt even with this you carried him it was either that or let the cops have him what would have happened if theyd piled him into an ambulance and hed started healing like that theyd have known what he was richard said stephen was leaning on the back of the seat chin resting on his forearms he seemed to have forgotten that id nearly stabbed him or maybe he was used to being threatened maybe up close his eyes were the startled blue of cornflowers with his blond hair spitting around his face he looked like one of those china dolls that you buy in exclusive shops that you never let children play with i can take louie to my place he said no i said they both looked at me surprised i wasnt sure what to say but i knew that richard could not come with me to guilty pleasures if i had any hope of keeping us all alive richard could not be on the spot when i broke the news i thought id drive you home richard said or to the nearest hospital whichever you need it would have been my preference to but not tonight louies your best friend i thought you might want to take care of him he was staring at me lovely brown eyes narrowed into suspicious squints youre trying to get rid of me why my head hurt i couldnt think of a good lie i didnt think hed buy a bad one how much do you trust stephen the question seemed to throw him off balance i trust him his first reaction was to say yes i trust him but he hadnt thought about it first no richard i mean do you trust him not to talk to jeanclaude or marcus i wouldnt tell marcus anything you didnt want me to stephen said and jeanclaude i asked stephen looked uncomfortable but said if he asked a direct question id have to give a direct answer how can you owe more allegiance to the master of the city than to your own pack leader i follow richard not marcus i glanced at richard a little palace revolt raina wanted him in the movies i stepped in and stopped it marcus must really hate you i said he fears me richard said even worse i said richard didnt say anything he knew the situation better than i did even if he wasnt willing to do the ultimate deeds fine id planned to tell jeanclaude that you proposed you proposed stephen said his voice held a lilt of surprise did she say yes richard nodded a took of delight swept over stephens face way to go his face fell into sadness it was like watching wind over a grassy field everything visible on the surface jeanclaude is going to go apeshit i couldnt have said it better myself then why tell him tonight richard asked why not wait youre not sure about marrying me anymore are you no i said i hated saying it but it was the truth i loved him already but if it went much further it would be too late if i had any doubts i needed to work them out now staring into his face smelling the warm scent of his aftershave i wished i could have thrown caution to the wind falling into his arms but i couldnt i just couldnt not unless i was sure then why tell him at all unless youre planning to elope and didnt tell me we have some time i sighed i told him why it had to be tonight you cant go with me i wont let you go alone he said richard if you are johnnyonthespot when he finds out hell try to kill you and ill try to kill him to protect you i shook my head if the shit hits the fan this could end up like hamlet how like hamlet stephen asked everybody dead i said oh he said youd kill jeanclaude to protect me even after what you saw last night i stared at him i tried to read behind his eyeballs to know if there was anybody home i could really talk to he was still richard with his love of the outdoors any activity that would get you messy and a smile that warmed me to my toes i wasnt sure i could marry him but i was positive i couldnt let anybody kill him yes you wont marry me but youll kill for me i dont understand that ask me if i still love you richard that answers still yes how can i let you face him alone ive been doing just fine without you he touched my forehead and i winced you dont took fine jeanclaude wont hurt me you dont know that for sure he said he had a point there you cant protect me richard your being there will get us both killed i cant let you go alone dont go all manly on me richard its a luxury that we cant afford if saying yes to marriage is going to make you behave like an idiot it can be changed you took back your yes its not a definite no either i said just trying to protect you would make you say no i dont need your protection richard i dont even want it he leaned his head against the headrest and closed his eyes if i play the white knight youll leave me if you think you need to play the white knight then you dont know me at all he opened his eyes and turned his head to look at me maybe i want to be your white knight thats your problem he smiled i guess so if you can drive the jeep back to my apartment ill take a cab stephen can drive you he said he volunteered him without even wondering what stephen would say about it it was arrogant no ill take a cab i dont mind stephen said im due back at guilty pleasures tonight anyway i glanced at him what do you do for a living stephen he laid his cheek on his forearm and smiled at me he managed to look winsome and sexy at the same time im a stripper he said of course he was i wanted to point out that hed refused to be in a pornographic movie but he still stripped but taking your clothes off down to tasteful undies was not the same thing as having sex on screen not even close lillian was a small woman in her midfifties her saltandpepper hair was cut short and neat in a nononsense style her fingers were as quick and sure as the rest of her the last time shed treated my wounds shed had claws and greying fur i was sitting on an examining table in the basement of an apartment building a building that housed lycanthropes and was owned by a shapeshifter the basement was the makeshift clinic for the lycanthropes in the area i was the first human theyd ever allowed to see the place i should have been flattered but managed not to be well according to x rays you dont have a skull fracture glad to hear it i said you may have a mild concussion but a mild one wont show up on tests at least nothing we have the equipment for here so i can go i started to hop down she stopped me with a hand on my arm i didnt say that i eased back on the table im listening grudgingly she said smiling if you want grace under pressure lillian im not your girl oh i dont know about that she said ive cleaned the scrapes and taped up your forehead you were very lucky not to need stitches i didnt like stitches so i agreed with her i want you to wake up every hour for twentyfour hours i must not have looked happy because she said i know its awkward and probably unnecessary but humor me if you go to sleep and are injured more severely than i think you are you might not wake up so humor an old rat lady set the alarm or have someone wake you every hour for twentyfour hours twentyfour hours from the injury i asked hopefully she laughed normally id say from now but you can do it from the time of the injury were just being cautious i like being cautious richard pushed away from the wall he came to stand with us under the lights i volunteer to wake you every hour you cant go with me i said ill wait for you at your apartment oh no driving for the night lillian said just as a precaution richards fingertips touched the back of my hand he didnt try to hold my hand just that touch comforting i didnt know what to do if i was going to say no eventually it didnt seem fair to flirt just the weight of his fingers was a line of warmth all the way up my arm lust just lust dont i wish ill drive your jeep to your apartment if you agree stephen can drive you to guilty pleasures i can take a cab id feel better if stephen took you please he said the please made me smile all right stephen can drive me thank you richard said youre welcome i would recommend you go straight home and rest lillian said i cant i said she frowned at me very well but rest as soon as you can if this is a mild concussion and you abuse yourself it could worsen and even if it isnt a concussion rest will do you more good than gallivanting around i smiled yes doctor she made a small umph sound i know how much attention youre going to pay to my orders but go along with you both of you if you wont listen to good sense then be gone i slid off the table and richard did not offer to help me there were reasons why we had been dating this long a moment of dizziness and i was fine lillian didnt look happy you promise me that this dizziness is less than it was scouts honor she nodded ill take your word for it she didnt look really pleased about it but she patted my shoulder and walked out she had made no notes there was no chart to check nothing to prove id ever been here except for some bloody cotton swabs it was a nice setup i had gotten to lie back and relax in the car on the way here just not having to tote around naked men or drive helped a lot i really was feeling better which was great since i had to see jeanclaude tonight regardless of how i felt i wondered whether gretchen would have given me a night of grace if she had put me in the hospital probably not i couldnt put it off any longer it was time to go ive got to go richard he put his hands on my shoulders i didnt pull away he turned me to look at him and i let him his face was very solemn i wish i could go with you weve been over this i said he looked away from my eyes i know i touched his chin and raised his eyes to mine no heroics richard promise me his eyes were too innocent i dont know what you mean bullshit you cant be waiting outside you have to stay here promise me that he dropped his arms and stalked away from me he leaned against the other examining table palms flat all his weight on his arms i hate you doing this alone promise me you will wait here or wait at my apartment those are the only choices richard he wouldnt look at me i walked over to him and touched his arm tension sang through it there was none of that otherworldly energy yet but it was there below the surface waiting richard look at me he stayed with his head bent hair falling like a curtain between us i ran my hand through that wavy hair grabbing a handful close to the warmth of his skull i used the hair like a handle and turned his face to me his eyes were dark with more than just their color something was home in his eyes that id seen only last night the beast was rising through his eyes like a sea monster swimming upward through dark water i tightened my grip on his hair not to hurt but to get his attention a small sound escaped his throat if you fuck this up through some misguided male ego thing youre going to get me killed i drew his face towards me hand tangled in his hair when his face was only inches from mine almost close enough to kiss i said if you interfere you will get me killed do you understand the darkness in his eyes wanted to say no i watched the struggle on his face finally he said i understand youll be waiting for me at home he nodded pulling his hair against my grip i wanted to pull his face to me to kiss him we stood there frozen hesitating he moved to me our lips touched it was a soft gentle brush of lips we stared at each other from an inch away his eyes were drowning deep and i could suddenly feel his body like an electric shock through my gut i jerked away from him no not yet i dont know how i feel about you anymore your body knows he said if lust was everything id be with jeanclaude his face crumbled as if id slapped him if you really arent going to date me anymore then dont tell jeanclaude its not worth it he looked so hurt that was one thing id never meant to do i laid my hand on his arm the skin was smooth warm real if i can get out of telling him i will but i dont think gretchen will make that one of my choices besides jeanclaude can smell a lie you did propose and i said yes tell him you changed your mind anita tell him why hell love it that im not human enough for you he pulled away from my hand jeanclaude will just eat that up his voice was bitter angry the bitterness was strong enough to walk on id never heard him like that i couldnt stand it i came up behind him and wrapped my arms around his waist i buried my face in the line of his spine cheek cradled between the swell of his shoulders he started to turn but i held tighter he stood very still in my arms his hands touched my arms tentatively at first then he hugged them to him a shudder ran through his back his breath came in a long gasp i turned him around to face me tears glistened on his cheeks jesus id never been good around tears my first instinct was to promise them anything if they would only stop crying dont i said i touched a fingertip to one tear it clung to my skin trembling dont let this tear you up richard please i cant be human again anita his voice sounded very normal if i hadnt seen the tears i wouldnt have known he was crying id be human for you if i could maybe human isnt what i want richard i dont know give me a little time if i cant handle you being furry better to find out now i felt awful mean and petty he was gorgeous i loved him he wanted to marry me he taught junior high science he loved hiking camping caving he collected sound tracks of musicals for gods sake and he was next in line to rule the pack an alpha werewolf shit i need time richard i am so sorry but i do i sounded like a chump id never sounded so indecisive in my life he nodded but didnt look convinced you may end up turning me down but youre going to risk your life confronting jeanclaude it doesnt make sense i had to agree i have to talk to him tonight richard i dont want another runin with gretchen not if i can avoid it richard wiped the palms of his hands over his face he ran his hands through his hair dont get yourself killed i wont i said promise he said i wanted to say promise but i didnt i dont make promises i cant keep couldnt you be comforting and lie to me i shook my head no he sighed talk about painful honesty ive got to go i walked away before he could distract me again i was beginning to think he was doing it on purpose to delay me of course i was letting him do it anita i was almost to the door i turned back he stood there under the harsh lights hands at his sides looking helpless weve kissed goodbye youve told me to be careful ive warned you not to play hero thats it richard there is no more he said i love you okay so there was more i love you too it was the truth damn it if i could just get over his being furry i would marry him how would jeanclaude take the news as the old saying goes only one way to find out guilty pleasures is in the heart of the vampire district its glowing neon sign bled into the night sky giving the blackness a crimson tint like a distant house fire i hadnt come to the district unarmed after dark for a very long time okay i had the knife and it was better than arm wrestling but against a vampire not much better stephen was beside me a werewolf wasnt a bad bodyguard but somehow stephen didnt look scary enough he was only an inch or two taller than me slender as a willow with just enough shoulder definition to make him look masculine to say his pants were tight wasnt enough they were leather and looked painted on like a second skin it was hard not to notice that his derriere was tight and firm the leather jacket cut him off at the waist so the view was unobstructed i was wearing my black trench coat again it had a little bit of blood on it but if i cleaned it it would be wet wet would not keep me warm my sweater one of my favorite sweaters was torn off one shoulder down to the line of my bra too cold without a coat gretchen owed me a sweater maybe after i got my guns back wed talk about that three broad steps led up to closed doors buzz the vampire was guarding them it was the worst vampire name id ever heard it wasnt great if you were human but buzz seemed all wrong for a vampire it was a great name for a bouncer he was tall and musclebound with a black crew cut he seemed to be wearing the same black tshirt hed worn in july i knew vampires couldnt freeze to death but i hadnt known they didnt get cold most vampires tried to play human they wore coats in the winter maybe they didnt need them the same way gretchen hadnt needed to take the knife from her throat maybe it was all pretend he smiled flashing fangs my reaction seemed to disappoint him you missed a set stephen the boss is pissed stephen sort of shrank in on himself buzz seemed to get larger pleased with himself stephen was helping me i dont think jeanclaude will mind buzz squinted at me really seeing my face for the first time shit what happened to you if jeanclaude wants you to know hell tell you i said i walked past him there was a large sign on the door no crosses crucifixes or other holy items allowed inside i pushed the doors open and kept walking my cross securely around my neck they could pry it from my cold dead hands if they wanted it tonight stephen stayed at my heels almost as if he were afraid of buzz buzz wasnt that old a vampire less than twenty years he still had a sense of aliveness to him that utter stillness that the old ones have hadnt touched the bouncer yet so why was a werewolf afraid of a new vampire good question it was sunday night and the place was packed didnt anyone have work tomorrow the noise washed over us like a wave of nearly solid sound that rich murmurous sound of many people in a small space determined to have a good time the lights were as bright as they ever got the small stage empty we were between shows a blond woman greeted us at the door do you have any holy items to declare she smiled when she said it the holyitem check girl i smiled when i said nope she didnt question me just smiled and walked away a male voice said just a moment shelia the tall vampire that strode towards us was lovely to look at he had high sculpted cheekbones and short blond hair styled to perfection he was too masculine to be beautiful and too perfect to be real robert had been a stripper last time i was here it looked as though hed moved up into management shelia waited looking from robert to me she lied to me robert nodded hello anita hello are you the manager here now he nodded i didnt like it him being manager hed failed me once or rather failed jeanclaudes orders failed to keep someone safe that someone had died robert hadnt even gotten bloody trying to stop the monsters he should at least have gotten hurt trying i didnt insist he die to keep people safe but he should have tried harder id never completely trust him or forgive him you are wearing a holy item anita unless on police business you must give it to shelia i glanced up at him his eyes were blue i glanced down then up and realized i could meet his eyes he was over a hundred years old not nearly as powerful as gretchen but i shouldnt have been able to meet his eyes his eyes widened you have to give it up those are the rules maybe being able to look him in the eyes had given me courage or maybe i had had enough for one night is gretchen here he looked surprised yes shes in the back room with jeanclaude then you cant have the cross i cant let you in then jeanclaude is very clear on that there was a hint of unease in his voice almost fear good take a good look at my face bobbyboy gretchen did it if shes here i keep the cross frown lines formed between his perfect brows jeanclaude said no exceptions he stepped closer and i let him he lowered his voice as much as he could and be heard above the noise he said if i ever fail him again in anything large or small hell punish me normally i thought statements like that were pitiful or cruel i agreed with this one go ask jeanclaude i said he shook his head i cannot trust you to stay here if you get past me with the cross i will have failed this was getting tiresome can stephen go ask robert nodded stephen sort of hung by me he hadnt recovered from buzzs remarks is jeanclaude mad at me for missing my set you should have called if you couldnt make your set robert said i had to go on in your place good to be useful i said robert frowned at me stephen should have called he was taking me to a doctor you got a problem with that jeanclaude may then bring the great man out and lets ask him im tired of standing in the door anita how good of you to grace us with your presence gretchen was practically purring with anticipation robert wont let me pass she turned her eyes to the vampire he took a step back she hadnt even unleashed any of that impressive magic yet robert scared easy for a centuryold corpse we have been awaiting her robert jeanclaude is most anxious to see her he swallowed hard i was told that no one came inside with a holy item other than the police no exceptions were to be made not even for the masters sweetheart she put a lot of irony in that last part robert either didnt get it or ignored it until jeanclaude tells me differently she doesnt go through with a cross gretchen stalked around us all i wasnt sure who looked more worried take off the little cross and let us get this over with i shook my head nope it didnt do you a lot of good earlier tonight she said she had a point for the first time i realized i hadnt even thought of bringing out my cross earlier id gone for my weapons but not my faith pretty damn sad i fingered the cool silver of the chain the cross stays you are both spoiling my fun she said the way she said it made that sound like a very bad thing ill give you one of your weapons back a moment before id have agreed but not now i was embarrassed that i had not gone for my cross earlier it wouldnt have kept her from jumping me at the beginning she was too powerful for that but it might have chased her off louie i was going to have to stop skipping church even if i didnt get to sleep at all no is this your way of getting out of our bargain her voice was low and warm with the first stirrings of anger i keep my word i said i will escort her through robert she raised a hand to stop his complaining if jeanclaude blames you tell him i was going to tear your throat out she stepped into him until only a breath separated their bodies it was only standing that close that you realized that robert was taller by a head and a half gretchen seemed bigger than that it isnt a lie robert i think youre weak a liability i would kill you now if our master did not need us both if you still fear jeanclaude remember that he wants you alive i do not robert swallowed hard enough that it had to hurt he didnt back up brownie point for him she moved that fraction closer and he jumped back as if hed been shot fine fine take her through gretchens lip curled in disgust one thing we agreed on we didnt like robert if we had one thing in common maybe thered be more maybe we could be girlfriends yeah right the noise level had dropped to a background murmur we had everybodys attention nothing like a floor show is there supposed to be an act on stage right now i asked robert nodded yes i need to introduce him go do your job robert the words were thick with scorn gretchen gave good scorn robert left us obviously relieved wimp i said softly come anita jeanclaude is waiting for us she stalked away long pale coat swinging out behind her stephen and i exchanged glances he shrugged i followed her and he trailed behind as if he were afraid of losing me jeanclaudes office was like being inside a domino stark white walls white carpet black lacquer desk black office chair black leather couch against one wall and two straightbacked chairs sat in front of the desk the desk and chairs were oriental set with enamel pictures of cranes and oriental women in flowing robes id always liked the desk not that i would admit it out loud there was a black lacquer screen in one corner id never seen it before it was large hiding one entire corner a dragon curled across the screen in oranges and reds with huge bulbous eyes it was a nice addition to the room it was not a comfortable room but it was stylish like jeanclaude he sat on the leather couch dressed all in black the shirt had a high stiff collar that framed his face it was hard to tell where his hair left off and the shirt began the collar was pinned at his throat with a thumbsize ruby pendant the shirt was open down to his belt leaving a triangle of pale pale skin showing only the pendant kept the shirt from opening completely the cuffs were as wide and stiff as the collar nearly hiding his hands he raised one hand and i could see the cuffs were open on one side so he could still use his hands black jeans and velvet black boots completed the outfit id seen the pendant before but the shirt was certainly new spiffy i said he smiled do you like it he straightened the cuffs as if they needed it its a nice change from white i said stephen we were expecting you earlier his voice was mild enough but there was an undertaste of something dark and unpleasant stephen took me to the doctor his midnight blue eyes turned back to me is your latest police investigation getting rough no i said i glanced at gretchen she was looking at jeanclaude tell him she said i didnt think she was referring to my accusing her of trying to kill me it was time for a little honesty or at least a little drama i was sure jeanclaude wouldnt disappoint us stephen needs to leave now i said i didnt want him getting killed trying to protect me he wasnt up to being anything but cannon fodder not against jeanclaude why he asked he sounded suspicious get on with it gretchen said i shook my head stephen doesnt need to be here get out stephen jeanclaude said i am not angry with you for missing your set anita is more important to me than your being on time to your job that was nice to know stephen gave a sort of bob almost a bow to jeanclaude flashed a look at me and hesitated go on stephen ill be all right i didnt have to reassure him twice he fled what have you been up to ma petite i glanced at gretchen she had eyes only for him her face looked hungry as if shed waited for this a long time i stared into his dark blue eyes and realized that i could without vampire marks i could meet his eyes jeanclaude noticed it too his eyes widened just a bit ma petite you are full of surprises tonight you aint seen nothing yet i said by all means continue i do love a surprise i doubted hed like this one i took a deep breath and said it fast as if that would make it go down better like a spoonful of sugar richard asked me to marry him and i said yes i could have added but im not sure anymore but i didnt i was too confused to offer up anything but the bare facts if he tried to kill me maybe id add details until then wed wait it out jeanclaude just sat there he didnt move at all the heater clicked on and i jumped the vent was above the couch the air played along his hair the cloth of his shirt but it was like watching a mannequin the hair and clothes worked but the rest was stone the silence stretched and filled the room the heater died and the quiet was so profound i could hear the blood rushing in my ears it was like the stillness before creation you knew something big was coming you just didnt know quite what i let the silence flow around me i wouldnt be the one to break it because i was afraid of what came next this utter calmness was more unnerving than anger would have been i didnt know what to do with it so i did nothing a course of action i seldom regret it was gretchen who broke first did you hear her jeanclaude she is to wed another she loves another he blinked once a long graceful sweep of lashes ask her now if she loves me gretchen gretchen stepped in front of me blocking jeanclaude from view what does it matter shes going to marry someone else ask her it was a command gretchen whirled to face me the bones in her face stood out under the skin lips thin with rage you dont love him it wasnt exactly a question so i didnt answer it jeanclaudes voice came lazy and full of some dark meaning that i didnt understand do you love me ma petite i stared into gretchens ragefilled face and said i dont suppose youd believe me if i said no can you not simply say yes yes in some dark twisted part of my soul i love you happy he smiled how can you marry him if you love me i love him too jeanclaude in the same way no i said how do you love us differently the questions were getting trickier how am i supposed to explain something to you that i dont even understand myself try youre like great shakespearean tragedy if romeo and juliet hadnt committed suicide theyd have hated each other in a year passion is a form of love but it isnt real it doesnt last and how do you feel about richard his voice was full of some strong emotion it should have been anger but it felt different from that almost as if it were an emotion i didnt have a word for i dont just love richard i like him i enjoy his company i i hated explaining myself oh hell jeanclaude i cant put it into words i can see spending my life with richard and i cant see it with you have you set a date no i said he cocked his head to one side studying me it is the truth but there is some bit of lie to it what are you holding back ma petite i frowned at him ive told you the truth but not all of it i didnt want to tell him hed enjoy it too much i felt vaguely disloyal to richard im not completely sure about marrying richard why not there was something in his face that was almost hopeful i couldnt let him get the wrong idea i saw him go all spooky i felt his power and and now im not sure i said hes not human enough for you either he threw back his head and laughed a joyous outpouring of sound that coated me like chocolate heavy and sweet and annoying she loves another gretchen said does it matter if she doubts him she doubts you she rejects you jeanclaude isnt that enough did you do all that to her face she stalked a tight circle like a tiger in a cage she does not love you as i do she knelt in front of him hands touching his legs face staring up into his please i love you ive always loved you kill her or let her marry this man she doesnt deserve your adoration he ignored her are you all right ma petite im fine gretchen dug fingers into his jeans grabbing at him please please i didnt like her but the pain the hopeless pain in her voice was horrible to hear shed tried to kill me and i still felt sorry for her leave us gretchen no she clutched at him i forbade you to harm her you disobeyed me i should kill you she just stayed kneeling gazing up at him i couldnt see her expression and was glad of it i wasnt big on adoration jeanclaude please please i only did it for you she doesnt love you his hand was suddenly around her neck i hadnt seen him move it was magic whatever was letting me look him in the eyes it didnt stop him playing with my mind or maybe he was just that fast naw she tried to talk his fingers closed and the words came out as small choked sounds he stood drawing her to her feet her hands wrapped around his wrist trying to keep him from hanging her he kept lifting until her feet dangled in the air i knew she could fight him id felt the strength in those delicateseeming hands except for her hand on his wrist she didnt even struggle would she let him kill her would he do it could i stand here and just watch he stood there in his wonderful black shirt looking elegant and scrumptious and holding gretchen with one arm straight up he walked towards his desk still holding her he kept his balance effortlessly even a lycanthrope couldnt have done it not like that i watched his slender body walk across the carpet and knew he could pretend all he wanted to but it wasnt human he wasnt human he set her feet on the carpet on the far side of the desk he relaxed his grip on her throat but didnt let her go jeanclaude please who is she that the master of the city should beg for her attention he kept his hand resting on her throat not squeezing now he pushed the screen back with his free hand it folded back to reveal a coffin it sat up off the ground on a clothdraped pedestal the wood was nearly black and polished to a mirrorlike shine gretchens eyes widened jeanclaude jeanclaude im sorry i didnt kill her i could have ask her i could have killed her but i didnt ask her ask her her voice was pure panic anita that one word slithered across my skin thick and full of forboding i was very glad that that voice was not angry with me she could have killed me with the first rush i said why do you think she did not do it i think she got distracted trying to draw it out to enjoy it more no no i was just threatening her trying to frighten her away i knew you wouldnt want me to kill her i knew that or shed be dead you were always a bad liar gretel gretel he raised the lid on the coffin with one hand drawing her nearer to it she jerked away from him his fingernails drew bloody furrows on her throat she stood behind the office chair putting it between her and him as if it would help blood trickled down her throat do not make me force you gretel my name is gretchen and has been for over a hundred years it was the first real spirit id seen in her against jeanclaude anyway i fought the urge to applaud it wasnt hard you were gretel when i found you and you are gretel still do not force me to remind you of what you are gretel i will not go into that cursed box willingly i wont do it do you really want anita to see you at your worst i thought i already had i will not go her voice was firm not confident but stubborn she meant it jeanclaude stood very still he raised one hand in a languid gesture there was no other word for it the movement was almost dancelike gretchen staggered grabbing at the chair for support her face seemed to have shrunk it wasnt the drawing down of power that i had seen on her earlier not the ethereal corpse that would tear your throat out and dance in the blood the flesh squeezed down wrapping tight on the bones she was withering not aging dying she opened her mouth and screamed my god whats happening to her gretchen stood clutching birdthin hands on the chair back she looked like a mummified corpse her bright lipstick was a gruesome slash across her face even her yellow hair had thinned dry and brittle as straw jeanclaude walked towards her still graceful still lovely still monstrous i gave you eternal life and i can take it back never forget that she made a low mewling sound in her throat she held out one feeble hand to him beseeching into the box he said his voice made that last word dark and terrible as if hed said hell and meant it he had beaten the fight out of her or maybe stolen was the word id never seen anything like this a new vampire power that id never even heard whispered in folklore shit gretchen took a trembling step towards the coffin two painful dragging steps and she lost her grip on the chair she fell bonethin arms catching her full weight the way youre not supposed to a good way to get your arm broken gretchen didnt seem to be worried about broken bones couldnt blame her she knelt on the floor head hanging as if she didnt have the strength to rise jeanclaude just stood there staring at her he made no move to help her if it had been anyone but gretchen i might have helped her myself i must have made some movement towards her because jeanclaude made a backaway gesture to me if she fed on a human at this moment all her strength would return she is very frightened i would not tempt her right now ma petite i stayed where i was i hadnt planned on helping her but i didnt like watching it crawl he said she started to crawl id had enough youve made your point jeanclaude if you want her in the coffin just pick her up and put her there he looked at me there was something almost amused in his face you feel pity for her ma petite she meant to kill you you know that id have no problem shooting her but this i didnt have a word for it he wasnt just humiliating her he was stripping her of herself i shook my head youre tormenting her if its for my benefit ive seen enough if its for your benefit then stop it it is for her benefit ma petite she has forgotten who her master is a month or two in a coffin will remind her of that gretchen had reached the foot of the pedestal she had grabbed handfuls of the cloth but couldnt drag herself to her feet i think shes been reminded enough you are so harsh ma petite so pragmatic yet suddenly something will move you to pity and your pity is as strong as your hate but not nearly as fun i said he smiled and lifted the lid of the coffin the inside was white silk of course he knelt and lifted gretchen her limbs lay awkwardly in his arms as if they didnt quite work as he lifted her over the lip of the coffin her long coat dragged against the wood something in her pocket clunked solid and heavy i almost hated to askalmost if thats my gun in her pocket i need it back he laid her almost gently in the silk lining then rifled her pockets he held the browning in one hand and began to lower the lid her skeletal hands raised trying to stop its descent watching those thin hands beat at the air i almost let it go there should be another gun and a knife he widened his eyes at me but nodded he held the browning out to me i walked forward and took it i was standing close enough to see her eyes they were pale and cloudy like the eyes of the very old but there was enough expression left for terror her eyes rolled wildly staring at me there was a mute appeal in that look desperation was too mild a word for it she looked at me not jeanclaude as if she knew that i was the only person in the room that gave a damn if it bothered jeanclaude you couldnt tell it by his face i tucked the browning under my arm it felt good to have it back he held the firestar out to me i cannot find the knife if you want to search her yourself feel free i stared down at the dry wrinkled skin the lipless face her neck was as skinny as a chickens i shook my head i dont want it that bad he laughed and even now the sound curled along my skin like velvet a joyous sociopath he closed the lid and she made horrible sounds as though she were trying to scream and had no voice to do it with her thin hands beat against the lid jeanclaude snapped the locks in place and leaned over the closed coffin he whispered sleep almost immediately the sounds slowed he repeated the word once more and the sounds ceased how did you do that quiet her i shook my head all of it i am her master no nikolaos was your master but she couldnt do that shed have done it to you if she could have perceptive of you and very true i made gretchen nikolaos did not make me being the master vampire that brings someone over gives you certain powers over them as you saw nikolaos had made most of the vampires in her little entourage right he nodded if she could have done what you just did id have seen it shed have shown it off he gave a small smile again perceptive there are a variety of powers that a master vampire can possess calling an animal levitation resistance to silver is that why my knife didnt seem to hurt gretchen yes but each master has a different arsenal of gifts arsenal it is an appropriate word now where were we ma petite ah yes i could kill richard here we go again did you hear me ma petite i could kill your richard he pulled the screen back into place the coffin and its terrible contents gone just like that you dont want to do that oh but i do ma petite i would love to tear out his heart and watch him die he walked past me the black shirt fanned around him exposing his stomach as he moved i told you im not sure im going to marry him im not even sure im going to be dating him anymore isnt that enough no ma petite you love him i can smell his scent on your skin you have kissed him tonight with all your doubts you have held him close hurt him and ill kill you simple as that my voice was very matteroffact you would try to kill me but i am not so easily killed he sat down on the couch again shirt spreading out around him leaving most of his upper body exposed the crossshaped burn scar was a shiny imperfection on his flawless skin i stayed standing he hadnt offered me a seat anyway maybe wed kill each other its your choice of music jeanclaude but once we start this dance it doesnt stop until one of us is dead i am not allowed to harm richard is he allowed to harm me good question i dont think itll come up you have dated him for months and i have said little before you marry him i want equal time i looked at him what do you mean equal time date me anita give me a chance to woo you woo me yes he said i just stared at him i didnt know what to say ive been trying to avoid you for months im not just going to give in now then i will start the music and we will dance even if i die and you die richard will die first that i can promise you surely dating me is not a fate worse than that he had a point and yet i dont give in to threats then i appeal to your sense of fair play ma petite you have allowed richard to win your heart if you had dated me first would it be my heart you hold so dear if you had not fought our mutual attraction would you even have given richard a second glance i couldnt say yes and be honest i wasnt sure i had refused jeanclaude because he wasnt human he was a monster and i didnt date monsters but last night id had a glimpse of what richard might be id felt a power that rivaled jeanclaudes creep along my skin it was getting harder to tell the humans from the monsters i was even beginning to wonder about myself there are more roads to monsterdom than most people realize i dont believe in casual sex i havent slept with richard either i am not blackmailing you into sex ma petite i am trying to get equal time if i agree then what why i pick you up on friday night like a datedate he nodded we might even discover how you are meeting my eyes with impunity lets just stick to as normal a date as we can as you like i stared at him he looked at me he would pick me up on friday we had a date i wondered how richard would feel about that i cant date both of you indefinitely allow me a few months as you have given richard if i cannot win you from him then i will retire from the field youll leave me alone and you wont harm richard he nodded you give me your word my word of honor i took it it was the best offer i was going to get i wasnt sure how much his word of honor was worth but it gave us time time to work something else out i didnt know what else but there had to be something something besides dating the freaking master of the city there was a knock on the door it opened without jeanclaudes giving permission somebody was pushy raina stalked in through the door pushy was one word for it she was wearing a rustcollared trench coat with the belt tied very tight at her waist the buckle flopped loosely as she glided into the room she undid a multicolored scarf and shook her auburn hair it shimmered in the light gabriel followed at her back in a black trench coat hisandher outfits his hair and strange grey eyes looked as good with his coat as rainas did with hers earrings glittered from the earlobe to the curl at the top of his ear every piece of metal was silver kaspar gunderson followed at their heels he was wearing a pale tweed coat and one of those hats with a little feather in the band he looked like an elegant version of everybodys s dream dad he didnt look happy to be here robert stood sort of hovering in the doorway i told them you were busy jeanclaude i told them you didnt want to be disturbed he was practically wringing his hands with anxiety after what id seen done to gretchen i didnt blame him for being afraid come in robert and close the door behind you jeanclaude said i really need to oversee the next act i come in and close the door robert the centuryold vampire did as he was told he closed the door and leaned against it one hand on the doorknob as if that would keep him safe the right sleeve of his white shirt was sliced up and blood trickled out of fresh claw marks his throat showed more blood as if a clawed hand had lifted him by the throat like jeanclaude had done to gretchen but with talons i told you what would happen if you failed me again robert in anything large or small jeanclaudes voice was a whisper that filled the room like wind robert dropped to his knees on the white carpet please master please he extended his hands towards jeanclaude a thick drop of blood plopped from his arm to the carpet the blood seemed very red against the white white carpet raina smiled i was betting i knew whose claw marks robert was sporting kaspar went to sit on the couch distancing himself from the show gabriel was looking at me nice coat he said we were both wearing black trench coats great thanks i said he grinned flashing pointy teeth i wanted to ask him if the silver earrings hurt but robert made a low whimpering noise and i turned back to the main show come to me robert jeanclaudes voice had heat to it enough to scald robert went nearly prone on the carpet abasing himself please master please dont jeanclaude stalked towards him fast enough to have his black shirt sweeping behind him like a miniature cape his pale skin flashed against the black cloth he stopped beside the cowering vampire jeanclaudes shirt swirled around the suddenly quiet body jeanclaude stood utterly still the cloth had more life to it than he did jesus he tried jeanclaude i said leave him alone jeanclaude stared at me his eyes a bottomless blue i looked away from those eyes maybe i could meet his gaze with impunity but then again he was always full of surprises i was under the impression ma petite that you did not like robert i dont but ive seen enough punishment for one night they bloodied him just because he wouldnt let them in your office a few minutes early why arent you mad about that raina walked over to jeanclaude the spiked heels of her metallic copper pumps made indents in the carpet a trail of stab wounds jeanclaude watched her come his face was neutral but there was something about the way he held himself was he afraid of her maybe but there was a wariness to his body as she moved closer he wasnt happy more and more curious we had an appointment with jeanclaude it would have hurt my feelings to be turned away at the door she stepped over robert flashing a lot of leg i wasnt sure she was wearing anything under the trench coat robert did not try to sneak a peek he froze flinching as her coat brushed his back raina stood with her shapely calves nearly touching robert he didnt move away from her he seemed to just freeze as if he could pretend he wasnt there and everyone would forget about him he wished she was standing so close to jeanclaude that the length of their bodies touched she was sort of wedged between the two vampires i expected jeanclaude to step back give her a little room he didnt she ran her fingers under his shirt laying her hands on either side of his naked waist her lipsticked mouth parted and she leaned into him she kissed him and he stood like a statue under her hands but he didnt tell her to go to hell what the hell was going on raina raised her face enough to speak jeanclaude doesnt wish to offend marcus he needs the packs backing to hold the city dont you love he put his hands on her slender waist and stepped back her hands trailed along his skin until he was completely out of reach she watched him the way snakes watch small birds hungry you didnt have to be a vampire to feel her lust obvious was putting it kindly marcus and i have an arrangement jeanclaude said what sort of arrangement i asked why do you care ma petite you are going to be seeing monsieur zeeman am i not allowed to see other people i have offered you monogamy and you have turned me down i hadnt thought about it it did bother me damn its not the sharing that bothers me jeanclaude raina walked up behind him long painted nails tracing his skin hands curling up his chest until her chin rested on his shoulder jeanclaude relaxed in her arms this time he leaned his back against her pale hands caressing her arms he stared at me while he did it what does bother you ma petite your choice of playmates jealous raina asked no liar she said what was i supposed to say that it bothered me to see her hanging all over him it did which bothered me more than her groping him i shook my head just wondering how far youll go to secure the packs favor oh all the way raina said she moved around to stand in front of him she was taller than he was in her heels you are going to come play with me she kissed him one quick movement she dropped to her knees in front of him gazing upward jeanclaude stroked her hair his pale graceful hands raising her face upward he bent towards her as if to kiss her but he stared at me while he did it was he waiting for me to say no dont hed seemed almost afraid of her at first now he was utterly comfortable i knew he was taunting me trying to make me jealous it was sort of working he kissed her long and lingering he looked up from it with her lipstick smeared on his lips what are you thinking ma petite he couldnt read my mind anymore one point for not having vampire marks that i think less of you for having sex with raina gabriel gave a warm rolling laugh oh he hasnt had sex with her not yet he walked towards me in a long gliding stride i flashed the trench coat showing the browning lets not get crazed he undid the trench coats belt and raised his hands in surrender he wasnt wearing a shirt he had a silver ring through his left nipple and the edge of his belly button it made me wince just to see it i thought silver hurt a lycanthrope like an allergy it burns he said his voice had a soft huskiness to it and this is a good thing i asked gabriel put his hands down slowly and shrugged the coat off his shoulders he turned slowly as the cloth fell like a striptease i didnt see any other silver rings he whirled as it came off his arms and at the apex of the turn he flung it on me i batted at the coat knocking it away from me that was the mistake he was on me body flattening me to the floor my arms ended up pinned to my chest trapped under his coat his waist had the firestar trapped i went for the browning and his hand tore through the coat like paper ripped the gun out from under my arm he damn near took the holster and my arm with it for a second my left arm was just one raw pain when i could feel my arm again the browning was gone and i was staring up into gabriels face from three inches away he wriggled his hips grinding the firestar into both of us it had to hurt him more than it hurt me doesnt that hurt i asked my voice was surprisingly calm i like pain he said he put the tip of his tongue on my chin and licked across my mouth he laughed struggle harder push those little hands you like pain i said yeah youre gonna love this i shoved the knife into his upper stomach he gave a small sound between a grunt and a sigh a shudder ran the length of his body he reared up over me still pinning me from the waist down like he was doing girls pushups i raised myself up with him shoving the knife in deeper drawing the blade upward through the meat of his body gabriel ripped the coat into pieces but didnt try to grab the knife he braced an arm on either side of me staring downward at the knife and my bloody hands he rested his face in my hair slumping just a little i thought hed pass out he whispered deeper oh jesus the blade was almost at the bottom of his sternum when i got to it one upward thrust would give me his heart i lay back on the floor to get a better angle for the killing blow dont kill him raina said we need him we the knife was on its way to his heart when he rolled off me in a blinding blur of speed he ended up lying on his back not too far away he was breathing very fast his chest rising and falling blood poured down his naked skin his eyes were closed lips curled in a half smile if hed been human he might have died later tonight instead he lay on the carpet smiling he rolled his head to one side and opened his eyes his strange grey eyes looked at me that was wonderful jesus h christ i said i got to my feet using the couch for support i was covered in gabriels blood the knife was thick with it kaspar was sitting on the corner of the couch staring at me he huddled in his coat eyes wide i didnt blame him i wiped my hands and blade on the black couch thanks for the help jeanclaude i was told that you are a dominant now ma petite struggles of internal dominance are not to be interfered with he smiled besides you did not need my help raina knelt beside gabriel she lowered her face to his bleeding stomach and began to lick it long slow movements of her tongue her throat convulsed as she swallowed i would not be sick i would not be sick i looked at kaspar what are you doing with these two raina raised a blood coated face kaspar is our sample whats that supposed to mean he can shapeshift back and forth as often as he wants to he doesnt pass out we use him to test potential stars of our movie productions to see how they react to somebody changing shape in the middle of things i was going to be sick please tell me you dont mean he changes in the middle of sex as a sort of screen test raina cocked her head to one side her tongue rolled around her mouth licking the blood clean you know about our little films yeah im surprised richard told you he doesnt approve of our fun are you in the movies kaspar wont play on film raina said she stood up and walked towards the couch marcus wont force anybody to be on film but kaspar helps us audition people dont you kaspar he nodded he was staring at the carpet working very hard at not looking at her why are you all here tonight i asked jeanclaude promised us some vampires for our next movie that true i asked jeanclaudes face was blank lovely but unreadable robert needs to be punished i frowned at the change of subject the coffins full there are always more coffins anita robert crawled forward im sorry master im sorry he didnt touch jeanclaude but he crept close to him i cant bear the box again master please youre afraid of raina jeanclaude what do you expect robert to do with her i am not afraid of raina fine but robert was overmatched you know he was perhaps you are right ma petite robert looked up a moment of hope flashed across his handsome face thank you master he looked at me thank you anita i shrugged you can have robert for your next film jeanclaude said robert grabbed his leg master i oh come on jeanclaude dont give him to her raina plopped down on the couch between kaspar and me i stood up she put an arm over kaspars shoulders he flinched hes handsome enough any vampire can take a great deal of punishment most acceptable she said you saw them here tonight i said do you really want to do that to one of your own people let robert decide jeanclaude said the box or raina robert looked up at the lycanthrope she smiled at him with her bloody mouth robert lowered his head so he could see her then nodded not the box anything is better than that im out of here i said id had all the interpreternatural politics that i could stand for one night dont you want to see the show raina said i thought id seen the show i said she tossed kaspars hat across the room strip she said id sheathed the knife and retrieved the browning from the carpet where gabriel had thrown it i was armed for what good it did me kaspar sat there on the couch there was a pink flush to his white skin his eyes glittered angry embarrassed i was a prince before your ancestors discovered this country raina propped her chin on his shoulder still hugging his shoulders we know how blue your pedigree is you were a prince and you were such a big bad hunter such a wicked boy that a witch cursed you she turned you into something beautiful and harmless she hoped youd learn how to be gentle and kind she licked his ear running her hands through his feathery hair but you arent gentle or kind your heart is just as cold and your pride just as impervious as it was centuries ago now take off your clothes and turn into a swan for us you dont need me to do it for the vampire he said no do it for me do it so anita can see do it so gabriel and i dont hurt you her voice was going lower each word more measured you cant kill me not even with silver he said but we can make you wish you could die kaspar he screamed a low ragged cry of frustration he stood up abruptly and pulled on his coat the buttons snapped and fell to the carpet he flung the coat into rainas face she laughed i started for the door oh dont leave yet anita kaspar may be a pain in the ass but hes really quite beautiful i glanced back kaspars sport jacket and tie lay on the carpet he unbuttoned his white dress shirt with quick angry movements there was a line of white feathers down the middle of his chest soft and downy as an easter duck i shook my head and kept going for the door i did not run i did not walk faster than normal it was the bravest thing id done all night i took a taxi home stephen stayed behind to strip or just to lick jeanclaudes boots i wasnt sure which and i wasnt sure i cared id made sure stephen wasnt in trouble it was the best i could do he was jeanclaudes creature and id had about enough of the master of the city for one night killing gretchen was one thing tormenting her was another i kept flashing on the sound of her frantically beating hands id like to believe that jeanclaude would keep her asleep but i knew better he was a master vampire they ruled in part through fear gretchen seemed like a real good threat displease me and ill do that to you worked for me i was standing outside my apartment when i realized i didnt have a key to it id given richard my car keys which had my house keys on the ring it felt silly standing out in the hallway about to knock on my own front door the door opened without me touching it richard stood in the doorway he smiled hi he said i found myself smiling back hi yourself he stepped back to one side giving me room he hadnt tried to kiss me in the door like ozzie meeting harriet after work i was glad it was too intimate a ritual if we ever did this for real he could molest me at the door but not tonight he closed the door behind me and i half expected him to take my coat wisely he did not i took off my own coat and laid it across the couch where all good coats go the warm smell of cooking food filled the apartment youve been cooking i said not entirely pleased i thought you might be hungry besides all i had to do was wait i cooked it filled the time i could understand that though cooking would never have occurred to me unless forced the only lights were in the kitchen it looked like a lighted cave from the darkened living room if i wasnt mistaken there were candles on the table are those candles he laughed it had an embarrassed edge to it too hokey its a twoseater breakfast table you cant possibly serve a fancy dinner on it i thought wed use the divider as a buffet and just have plates on the table theres room if were careful where we put our elbows he walked past me into the light he started puttering with a saucepan sloshing something around in it i stood there staring at my kitchen watching my possible fiancй cooking my dinner my skin felt tight and itchy i couldnt draw a complete breath i wanted to go right back out the door this was more intimate than a kiss at the door hed moved in made himself at home i didnt leave it was the bravest thing id done all night i checked the lock on the door automatically hed left it unlocked careless i didnt know what to do next my apartment was my refuge i could come here and just kick back i could be alone i liked being alone i needed some time to unwind regroup think how to tell him jeanclaude and i had a date will dinner be spoiled if i clean up first i can reheat everything when youre ready i planned the meal so it wouldnt ruin no matter how late you were great im going to go clean up then he turned to me framed by the light hed tied his hair back but it was coming loose in long curling strands his sweater was a burnt orange that made his skin look golden highlighted he was wearing an apron that said mrs lovetts meatpies on it i didnt own an apron and i certainly wouldnt have chosen one with a logo from sweeney todd a musical about cannibalism seemed inappropriate for an apron delightfully so but still im going to go clean up you said that i turned on my heel and walked to the bedroom i did not run though the temptation was great i closed the door to my bedroom and leaned against it my bedroom was untouched no signs of invasion there was a love seat under the rooms only window stuffed toy penguins sit on the love seat and spill down onto the floor the collection was threatening to take over half the floor like a creeping tide i grabbed the nearest one and sat on the corner of the bed i hugged it tight burying the upper half of my face in its fuzzy head id said i would marry richard so why was i so bugged about his sudden domestic turn we downgraded the yes to a maybe but even if it had still been a yes it would have bugged me marriage the implications of that hadnt really sunk in it wasnt fair to ask questions like that when he was halfnaked and looking yummy if hed dropped to one knee over a fancy restaurant dinner would my answer have been different maybe but wed never know would we if id been alone i wouldnt have eaten at all id have taken a shower thrown on an oversize tshirt and gone to bed surrounded by a few select penguins now i had a fancy dinner to eat by candlelight nonetheless if i said i wasnt hungry would he be insulted would he pout would he yell about all the work going to waste and tell me about starving kids in southeast asia shit i said softly and with feeling well hell if we ever were going to cohabitate hed have to know the truth i was unsociable and food was something you ate so you wouldnt die i decided to do what id have done if he hadnt been here sort of i really disliked feeling uncomfortable in my own home if id known it was going to feel like this id have called ronnie to wake me every hour i was fine i didnt need the help but ronnie would have been more comfy less threatening of course if gretchen got out of her box i trusted richard would survive an attack but wasnt so sure about ronnie one good point in richards favor he was damn hard to kill i put the browning in the holster built into the bed i stripped off the sweater and let it fall to the floor it was ruined and sweaters didnt wrinkle anyway i laid the firestar on the back of the toilet then i stripped off and got in the shower i didnt lock the bedroom door it would seem insulting as if if i didnt lock the door hed be naked in the bed with a rose in his teeth when i came out i locked the bathroom door id done it when i was home with my father now i did it so if someone busted down the door id have time to grab the firestar off the toilet i turned the shower on as hot as it would go and stayed under it until my fingers started to prune i was scrubbed clean and had delayed as long as i could i wiped the steam from the mirror with a towel the top layer of skin was gone from my right cheek it would heal just fine but a scrape looks like hell until it heals there was a small scrape on my chin and the side of my nose a knot was blossoming into brilliant color on my forehead i looked as though id been hit by a train it was amazing that anyone wanted to kiss me i peeked out the door into the bedroom no one was waiting for me the room was empty and full of the whir of the heater it was quiet peaceful and i couldnt hear any noises from the kitchen i let out a long sigh alone for a little while i was vain enough that i didnt want richard to see me in my usual nighttime attire i had had a nice black robe that matched a tiny black teddy an overly optimistic date had given it to me he never got to see me wear it fancy that the robe had died a sad death covered in blood and other bodily fluids wearing the teddy seemed cruel since i didnt plan on having sex with him i stood in front of my closet and didnt have a thing to wear since i consider clothes something you wear so you wont be naked that was pretty sad i put on an oversize tshirt with a caricature of mary shelley on it a pair of grey sweatpantsnot the fancy ones either the kind with a drawstring in them the way god intended sweatpants to be a pair of white jogging socks the closest thing i owned to slippers and i was ready to go i looked at myself in the mirror and wasnt happy i was comfortable but it wasnt very flattering but it was honest ive never understood those women who wear makeup do their hair and dress wonderfully until after theyre married suddenly they forget what makeup is and lose all their thin clothes if we did marry he should see what hed be sleeping beside every night i shrugged and walked out hed combed his hair out it foamed around his face soft and inviting the candles were gone so was the apron he stood in the entryway between kitchen and living room his arms were crossed over his chest shoulder leaning against the doorjamb he smiled he looked so scrumptious i wanted to go back in and change but i didnt im sorry he said what about im not completely sure but i think for presuming i could take over your kitchen i think its the first meal thats ever been cooked in it his smile widened and he pushed away from the door he walked towards me he moved in the circle of his own energy not that otherworldly power but just richard or was it maybe a lot of his drive was from his beast he stood staring down at me close enough to touch but not doing it i was going crazy waiting for you i got this idea to cook a fancy meal it was stupid you dont have to eat it but it kept me from running down to guilty pleasures and defending your honor it made me smile damn you i cant even pout around you you always jolly me out of it and this is a bad thing i laughed yes i enjoy my bad moods thank you very much he traced fingers down my shoulders kneading the muscles in my upper arms i pulled away from him please dont just like that the cozy domestic scene was ruined all my fault his hands dropped to his sides im sorry i didnt think he meant the meal he took a deep breath and nodded you dont have to eat a bite i guess we were going to pretend he had meant the meal fine with me if i said i wasnt hungry at all you wouldnt be mad at me i fixed the meal to make me feel better if it bothers you dont eat it ill drink a cup of coffee and watch you eat he smiled its a deal he stayed standing looking down at me he looked sad lost if you love someone you shouldnt make them miserable its a rule somewhere or should be you combed your hair out you like it loose just like this is one of my favorite sweaters i said is it his voice held a teasing edge to it i could have the lightness back we could have a nice relaxing evening it was up to me i looked up into his big brown eyes and wanted it but i couldnt lie to him that would be worse than cruel this is awkward i know im sorry stop apologizing its not your fault its mine he shook his head you cant help how you feel my first instinct is to cut and run richard stop seeing you no more long conversations no touching nothing if thats what you want his voice sounded sort of strangled as if it cost him dearly to say those words what i want is you i just dont know if i can handle all of you i shouldnt have proposed until youd seen what i really was i saw marcus and the gang its not the same as seeing me go beastly on you is it i took a deep breath and let it out slowly no i said it isnt if you have someone else you can call to wait with you tonight ill go you said you needed time and i practically move in im pushing yeah you are im scared that im losing you he said pushing wont help i said i guess not i stood there staring at him the apartment was dark the only light from the kitchen it could have been should have been very intimate i told everybody that lycanthropy was just a disease it was illegal and immoral to discriminate i didnt have a prejudiced bone in my body or so i told myself staring up into richards handsome face i knew it wasnt true i was prejudiced i was prejudiced against monsters oh they were good enough to be my friends but even my closest friends ronnie and catherine were human good enough to be friends but not good enough to love not good enough to share my bed is that really what i thought was that who i was it wasnt who i wanted to be i raised zombies and slew vampires i wasnt clean enough to throw stones i moved closer to him hold me richard just hold me his arms enfolded me i wrapped my arms around his waist pressing my face against his chest i could hear his heartbeat fast and strong i held him listening to the beat of his heart breathing his warmth for just an instant i felt safe it was the way id felt before my mother died that childish belief that nothing can hurt you while mommy and daddy hold you tight that utter faith that they can make everything all right in richards arms for brief moments i had that again even though i knew it was a lie hell it had been a lie the first time my mothers death had proven that i pulled away first he didnt try and hold on he didnt say anything if hed said anything remotely sympathetic i might have cried couldnt have that down to business you havent asked how it went with jeanclaude you were almost mad at me when you came through the door i thought if i started questioning you right off the bat you might yell at me hed made coffee all on his own that earned him at least two brownie points i wasnt mad at you i poured coffee into my baby penguin mug regardless of what i take to work it is my favorite mug yes you were he said you want some coffee you know i dont like it how do you trust a man that doesnt like coffee i keep hoping youll come to your senses he started dishing out his meal sure you dont want some no thanks it was some small brown meat in a brown sauce looking at it made me nauseous id eaten later than this with edward but tonight food just didnt sound good maybe getting my head bashed into concrete had something to do with that i sat down in one of the chairs one knee drawn up to my chest the coffee was viennese cinnamon one of my favorites sugar real cream and it was perfect richard sat down opposite me he bowed his head and said grace over his meal hes episcopalian did i mention that except for the furry part he really is perfect for me tell me what happened with jeanclaude please he asked i sipped my coffee and tried to think of a short version okay a short version richard wouldnt mind hearing okay maybe just the truth he took the news better than i thought he would actually richard looked up from his meal silverware poised he took it well i didnt say that he didnt burst through a wall and try to kill you immediately he took it better than i expected richard nodded he took a sip of water and said did he threaten to kill me oh yeah but it was almost like he saw this coming he didnt like it but it didnt catch him by complete surprise is he going to try and kill me he asked it very calmly eating his meat and brown sauce no he isnt why not it was a good question i wondered what hed think of the answer he wants to date me richard stopped eating he just looked at me when he could speak he said he what he wants a chance to woo me he says that if he cant win me from you in a few months hell give up hell let us go our merry way and he wont interfere richard sat back in his chair and you believe him yeah jeanclaude thinks hes irresistible i think he believes that if i let him use all his charms on me ill reconsider will you his voice was very quiet when he asked no i dont think so it wasnt a rousing endorsement i know you lust after him anita do you love him the conversation was becoming dйjаvuish in some dark twisted part of my heart yeah but not the way i love you how is it different look i just had this conversation with jeanclaude i love you can you see me setting up house with the master of the city can you see setting up house with an alpha werewolf shit i stared across the table at him and sighed he was pushing but i didnt blame him if id been him id have dumped me if i didnt love him enough to accept all of him then who the hell needed me i didnt want him to dump me i wanted to be indecisive but i didnt want to lose him talk about having your cake and eating it too i leaned across the table and held my hand out to him after a moment he took it i dont want to lose you you wont lose me you are a hell of a lot more tolerant than i would be he didnt smile i know i am i would have liked to argue but truth is truth id be bigger about this if i could i understand your having reservations about marrying a werewolf who wouldnt but jeanclaude he shook his head i squeezed his hand come on richard this is the best we can do right now jeanclaude wont try and kill either of us we still get to date and see each other i dont like you being forced into dating him he rubbed his fingers across my knuckles caressing i like it even less that i think youll enjoy it in that small dark part of yourself youll be having a very good time i wanted to deny it but it would be a total lie you can smell it if i lie yep he said then its intriguing and terrifying i want you safe so the terrifying part bothers me but the intriguing part bothers me more jealous worried what could i say so was i the phone rang i groped for it and found nothing i raised my head and found the nightstand empty the phone was gone it had even stopped ringing the radio clock was still there glowing red it read i stayed propped on my elbow blinking at the empty space was i dreaming why would i dream that someone had stolen my phone the bedroom door opened richard stood framed in the light beyond ah now i remembered hed taken the phone into the living room so it wouldnt wake me since he was having to wake me every hour id let him do it when youre only sleeping an hour even a short phone call can screw things up who is it its sergeant rudolf storr i asked him to wait until i had to wake you but he was pretty insistent i could imagine its all right would fifteen minutes have killed him richard asked i swung my legs out from under the covers dolphs in the middle of a murder investigation richard patience isnt his strong suit richard crossed his arms over his chest leaning against the doorjamb the light from the living room made strong shadows on his face the shadows cut huge square shapes on his orange sweater he radiated displeasure it made me smile i patted his arm as i went past i seemed to have inherited a watchwolf the phone was sitting just inside the front door where the other phone jack was i sat down on the floor putting my back to the wall and picked up the phone dolph its me whats up whos this richard zeeman thats answering your phone in the middle of the night i closed my eyes my head hurt my face hurt i hadnt had a hell of a lot of sleep youre not my father dolph whats up a moment of silence defensive arent we yeah want to make something of it no he said you call just to catch up on my personal life or is there a reason you woke me up i knew it wasnt another murder he was being too cheerful for that which made me wonder if it couldnt have waited a few hours we found something what exactly id rather you just come and see it for yourself dont do this to me dolph just tell me what the fuck it is another silence if he was waiting for me to apologize he was in for a long wait finally we found a skin what kind of skin if we knew what the hell it was would i be calling you at one oclock in the freaking morning he sounded angry i guess i couldnt blame him im sorry dolph im sorry i snapped at you fine he hadnt exactly accepted my apology fine is it connected to the murder i dont think so but im not some hotshot preternatural expert he still sounded pissed maybe he wasnt getting much sleep either of course i bet no one had smashed his head into a sidewalk where are you he gave me the address it was down in jefferson county far away from the murder scene when can you be here i cant drive i said what doctors orders im not to get behind the wheel of a car tonight how bad are you hurt not too bad but the doctor wanted me woken up every hour and no driving thats why mr zeeman is there yeah if youre too hurt to come tonight it can wait is the skin where it was found nothing disturbed yeah ill come who knows there might be a clue he let that go how are you going to get here i glanced at richard he could drive me but somehow i didnt think it was a good idea he was a civvie for one thing he was a lycanthrope for another he answered to marcus and to a degree to jeanclaude not a good person to bring into a preternatural murder investigation besides if hed been human the answer would have been the same no deal unless you can send a squad car i guess ill take a taxi zerbrowski didnt answer his first page he lives in st peters hell have to come right by you he can pick you up is that okay with him it will be dolph said great trapped in a car with zerbrowski fine ill be dressed and waiting dressed dont even start dolph touchy very touchy stop it he laughed it was good to hear him laugh it meant not many people had died this time dolph didnt laugh much during serialkiller cases he hung up so did i you have to go out richard asked yeah do you feel well enough to go yes anita i leaned my head against the wall and closed my eyes dont richard im going no debate allowed no debate i said i opened my eyes and looked at him he was staring down at me arms crossed what i said he shook his head if i told you that i was going to do something no debate youd be mad no i wouldnt anita he said my name the way my father use to say it i wouldnt not if your reasons were valid anita youd be pissed and you know it i wanted to deny it but couldnt all right youre right i wouldnt like it i stared up at him i was going to have to give him reasons why i was going to go out and do my job it wasnt a pretty sight i stood i wanted to say i didnt have to explain myself to anyone but if i meant this marriage thing it wasnt true anymore i didnt like that much his being a werewolf was not the only hurdle to domestic bliss this is police business richard people die when i dont do my job i thought your job was raising zombies and executing vampires you sound like bert youve told me enough about bert that i know that is an insult if you dont want to be compared then stop saying one of his favorite things i walked past him towards the bedroom ive got to get dressed he followed me i know that helping the police is very important to you i turned on him i dont just help the police richard the spook squad is just over two years old the cops on it didnt know shit about preternatural creatures it was a garbage detail do something to piss off your superiors and you get transferred the newspapers and tv said it was an independent task force like the major task force thats an honor oh yeah right the squad gets almost no extra funding no special training in preternatural creatures or events dolph sergeant storr saw me in the paper and contacted bert there was no training in preternatural crime for law officers in this country dolph thought i could be an adviser youre a heck of a lot more than an adviser yes i am i could have told him that earlier in the summer dolph had tried not calling me in right away it had seemed like a clearcut case of ghouls in a cemetery getting a little ambitious and attacking a necking couple ghouls were cowards and didnt attack ablebodied people but exceptions to the rule and all that by the time dolph called me in six people were dead it hadnt been ghouls so lately dolph had started calling me at the beginning before things got too messy sometimes i could diagnose a problem before it got out of hand but i couldnt tell richard that there might have been a lower kill count if id been called in this summer but that was no ones business but dolphs and mine wed spoken of it only once and that was enough richard was a civvie werewolf or not it wasnt any of his business look i dont know if i can explain this so youll understand but i have to go it may head off a larger problem it may keep me from having to go to a murder scene later on can you understand that he looked perplexed but what came out of his mouth wasnt not really but maybe i dont have to maybe seeing its important to you is enough i let out a deep breath great now ive got to get ready zerbrowski will be here any time hes the detective giving me a ride richard just nodded wise of him i went into the bedroom and closed the door gratefully would this be a regular occurrence if we married would i be forever explaining myself god i hoped not another pair of black jeans a red sweater with a cowl neck so soft and fuzzy that it made me feel better just to wear it the brownings shoulder holster looked very dark and dramatic against the crimson of the sweater the red sweater also brought out the rawmeat color of the scrapes on my face i might have changed it but the doorbell rang zerbrowski richard was answering the door while i stared at myself in the mirror that thought alone was enough i went for the door zerbrowski was standing just inside the door hands in the pockets of his overcoat his curly black hair with its touches of grey was freshly cut there was even hairgoop in it zerbrowski was usually lucky if he remembered to comb his hair the suit that showed from his open coat was black and formal his tie was tasteful and neatly knotted i glanced down and yes indeed his shoes were shined id never seen him when he didnt have food stains on him somewhere where were you all dressed up i asked where were you all undressed he asked he smiled when he said it i felt heat rush up my face and hated it a lot i hadnt done anything worth blushing for fine lets go i grabbed my trench coat from the back of the couch and touched dried blood shit ive got to get a clean coat ill be right back ill just talk to mr zeeman here zerbrowski said i was afraid of that but i went for my leather jacket anyway if we ended up engaged richard would have to meet zerbrowski sooner or later later would have been my preference what do you do for a living mr zeeman im a schoolteacher oh really i lost the conversation then i grabbed the jacket from the closet and walked back out they were chatting along like old buddies yes anita is our preternatural expert wouldnt know what to do without her im ready lets go i walked past them and opened the door i held the door for zerbrowski he smiled at me how long have you two been dating richard looked at me he was pretty good at picking up when i wasnt comfortable he was going to let me answer the question good of him too good if he would only be completely unreasonable and give me an excuse to say no this isnt worth it but damn if he didnt work really hard at keeping me happy not an easy task since november i said two months not bad katie and i were engaged two months after our first date his eyes sparkled his grin was mocking he was pulling my leg he didnt know it was coming off in his hands richard looked at me the look was long and serious two months isnt very long really hed given me an out i didnt deserve him long enough if its the right one zerbrowski said i tried to get zerbrowski through the door he was grinning he had no intention of being hurried my only hope was for dolph to page him again thatd light a fire under his butt dolph didnt call zerbrowski grinned at me richard looked at me his big brown eyes were deep and wounded i wanted to take his face in my hands and wipe that hurt from his eyes oh hell he was the right oneprobably ive got to go i know he said i glanced at zerbrowski he was grinning at us enjoying the show was i supposed to kiss him goodbye we werent engaged anymore quickest engagement in history but we were still dating i still loved him that deserved a kiss if nothing else i grabbed the front of his sweater and pulled him down to me he looked surprised you dont have to do this for show he whispered shut up and kiss me that earned me a smile every kiss was still a pleasant shock no ones lips were this soft no one else tasted this good his hair fell forward and i grabbed a handful of it pressing his face to mine his hands slid around my back underneath the leather jacket hands kneading the sweater i pushed away from him breathless i didnt want to go now with him staying overnight maybe it was a good thing i had to leave for a while i meant it about no premarital sex even if he hadnt been a lycanthrope but the flesh was more than willing i wasnt sure the spirit was up to the fight the look in richards eyes was drowning deep and worth anything in the world i tried to hide a rather sappy smile but knew it was too late i knew i would pay for this in the car with zerbrowski i would never hear the end of it staring up into richards face i didnt care wed work out everything eventually surely to god we could work it out wait til i tell dolph we were late because you were smooching with some guy i didnt rise to bait i may not be home for hours you might want to go home instead of waiting here i drove your jeep here remember i dont have a ride home oh fine ill be back when i can he nodded ill be here i walked out into the hallway not smiling anymore i wasnt sure how i felt about coming home to richard how was i ever going to come to a real decision if he kept hanging around making my hormones run amok zerbrowski chuckled blake i have seen everything now the heapbig vampire slayer in luuv i shook my head i dont suppose it would help to ask you to keep this to yourself he grinned makes the teasing more fun damn you zerbrowski loverboy seemed sort of tense so i didnt say anything before but now that were alone what the hell happened to you you look like someone took a meat cleaver to your face actually i didnt id seen that done once and it was a lot messier long story you know my secret where were you tonight all dressed up married ten years tonight he said youre kidding he shook his head big congrats i said we clattered down the stairs thanks we hired a babysitter and everything she made me leave my beeper home the cold bit into the sores on my face and made my head ache worse doors not locked zerbrowski said youre a cop how can you leave your car unlocked i opened the door and stopped the passenger seat and floorboard were full mcdonalds takeout sacks and newspapers filled the seat and flowed onto the floorboards a piece of petrified pizza and a herd of pop cans filled the rest of the floorboard jesus zerbrowski does the epa know youre driving a toxic waste dump through populated areas see why i leave it unlocked who would steal it he knelt in the seat and began shoveling armfuls of garbage into the backseat it looked like this wasnt the first time hed cleaned out the front seat by shoveling things in back i brushed crumbs from the empty seat onto the empty floorboard when it was as clean as i could get it i sat down zerbrowski slid into his seat belt and started the car it coughed to life i put on my seat belt and he pulled out of the parking lot how does katie feel about your job i asked zerbrowski glanced at me shes okay with it were you a cop when she met you yeah she knew what to expect loverboy didnt want you to come out tonight he thought i was too hurt to go out you do look like shit thanks they love us they want us to be careful hes a junior high school teacher for gods sake what does he know about violence more than hed like to i know i know the schools are a dangerous place nowadays but it isnt the same anita we carry guns hell you kill vampires and raise the dead blake cant get much messier than that i know that but i didnt know that being a lycanthrope was messier wasnt it no i dont think you do blake loving someone who lives by violence is a hard way to go that anybodyll have us is a miracle dont get cold feet did i say i was getting cold feet not out loud shit lets drop it zerbrowski anything you say dolph is going to be so excited that youve decided to tie the noose ah knot i sank down into the seat as far as the belt would let me i am not getting married maybe not yet but i know that look blake you are a drowning woman and the only way out is down the aisle i would have liked to argue but i was too confused part of me believed zerbrowski part of me wanted to stop dating richard and be safe again okay okay i wasnt exactly safe before what with jeanclaude hanging around but i wasnt engaged of course i still wasnt engaged you okay blake i sighed ive lived alone a long time a person gets set in her ways besides hes a werewolf i didnt say that part out loud but i wanted to i needed a second opinion but a police officer especially zerbrowski wasnt the person to ask he crowding you yeah he want marriage kids the whole nine yards kids no one had mentioned children did richard have this domestic vision of a little house him in the kitchen me working and kids oh damn we were going to have to sit down and have a serious talk if we did manage to get engaged like normal people what did that mean did richard want children i certainly didnt where would we live my apartment was too small his house i wasnt sure i liked that idea it was his house shouldnt we have our house shit kids me pregnant me not in this lifetime i thought furriness was our biggest problem maybe it wasnt the river swirled black and cold rocks stuck up like the teeth of giants the bank behind me was steep thick with trees the snow between the trees was trampled and slicked away to show the leaves underneath the opposite bank was a bluff that jutted out over the river no way down from there unless you were willing to jump the water was less than five feet deep in the center of the river jumping from thirty feet wasnt a good idea i stood carefully on the crumbling bank the black water rushed just inches from my feet tree roots stuck out of the bank tearing at the earth the combination of snow leaves and nearly vertical bank seemed destined to send me into the water but id fight it as long as i could the rocks formed a low broken wall into the river some of the stones were barely above the swirling water but one near the center of the river stuck up about waist high draped over that rock was the skin dolph was still the master of understatement shouldnt a skin be smaller than a breadbox not bigger than a toyota the head hung on the large rock draped perfectly as if placed that was one of the reasons the thing was still in the middle of the river dolph had wanted me to see it in case there was some ritual significance to the placement there was a dive team waiting on the shore in dry suits which are bulkier than wet suits and better at keeping you warm in cold water a tall diver with a hood already pulled up over his hair stood by dolph hed been introduced as macadam can we go in after the skin now anita dolph asked better them in the water than me i said is it safe dolph asked that was a different question truth im not sure macadam looked at me what could be out there its just a skin right i shrugged im not sure what kind of skin it is so he asked so remember the mad magician back in the seventies id think you wouldnt remember it macadam said i studied it in college magical terrorism senior year the magician specialized in leaving magical booby traps in outoftheway places one of his favorite traps was an animal skin that would attach itself to whomever touched it first took a witch to remove it was it dangerous macadam asked one man suffocated when it attached itself to his face how the hell did his face touch it first hard to ask a dead man animating wasnt a profession in the seventies macadam stared off across the water okay how do you find out if its dangerous has anyone been in the water yet he jerked a thumb at dolph he wouldnt let us and sheriff titus said to leave everything for some hotshot monster expert he looked me up and down that you thats me well make like an expert so my people and i can get in there you want the spotlight now dolph asked theyd had the place lit up like an opening night at manns chinese theatre id made them turn off the lights after id gotten the first glance there were some things that you needed light to see other things only showed themselves in the dark no light yet let me see it in the dark first why no light dolph asked some things hide from light dolph and they might still take a chunk out of one of the divers youre really serious about this arent you macadam asked yeah arent you glad he looked at me for a moment then nodded yeah how are you going to get a closer look i know the weather just got cold the last few days so the water should be about forty degrees but thats still cold without a suit ill stay on the rocks i might dip a hand in to see if anything rises to bait but ill stay as dry as i can you take the monsters serious he said i take the water serious youll get hypothermia in about five minutes in water this cold try not to fall in thanks for the advice youre going to get wet aikensen said he stood just above me leaning against a tree his smokey bear hat was pulled low over his head thick woolly collar pulled up near his chin his ears and most of his face were still bare to the cold i hoped he got frostbite he put his flashlight under his chin like a halloween gag he was smiling didnt move a thing miss blake left it just where we found it i didnt correct him on the miss hed done it just to irritate me ignoring it irritated him great the halloween smile faded leaving him frowning in the light whats the matter aikensen didnt want to get your delicate toes wet he pushed away from the tree the movement was too abrupt he slid down the bank arms windmilling trying to slow his fall he fell to his butt and kept scooting he was coming straight for me i took a step to one side and the bank crumbled underfoot i gave a hop and ended up on the nearest stone in the river i huddled on it nearly on all fours to keep from falling into the water the stone was wet slick and bonedeep cold aikensen landed in the river with a yell he sat on his butt freezing water swirling to nearly the middle of his chest he beat at the water with his gloved hands as if punishing it all he was doing was getting wetter the skin didnt slide off the rock and cover him nothing grabbed him i couldnt feel any magic on the air nothing but the cold and the sound of water guess nothings going to eat him macadam said guess not i said i tried to keep the disappointment out of my voice gods sake aikensen get out of the water tituss voice boomed from the top of the hill the sheriff along with most of the other policemen were at the top of the bank along the gravel road that led back to the place two ambulances were sitting up there too since gaias law went into effect three years ago an ambulance had to be on the scene if there was any chance the remains were humanoid there were ambulances being called to take away coyote carcasses as if they were dead werewolves the law had gone into effect but no extra money had been put into the emergency systems across the country washington did like to complicate things we were in the backyard of someones summer house some of the houses had landings or even small boathouses if they had deep enough water at the base of their land the only boat you were taking off through this rocky channel was a canoe so no landing no boathouse just the cold black water and a very wet deputy aikensen get your butt up on one of those rocks help ms blake out since youre already wet i dont need his help i called back to titus well now ms blake this is our county wouldnt want you getting eaten by some beastie while we stayed nice and safe on shore aikensen stood nearly falling again when his boots slid on the sandy bottom he turned to glare at me as if it were all my fault but he scrambled up on the rock on the side opposite the skin hed lost his flashlight he was dripping wet in the dark except for his smokey bear hat which hed managed to keep above water he looked as sullen as a wet hen notice youre not offering to climb out on this particular limb i said titus started down the bank he seemed to be a lot better at it than i had been id staggered like a drunk from tree to tree titus kept his hands out ready to catch himself but he pretty much walked down he stopped beside dolph delegation ms blake what made the country great what do you think of that aikensen i said more softly he glared at me hes the boss he didnt sound like he was happy with it but he believed it get on with it anita dolph said translation stop yanking everybodys chain everybody wanted out of the cold couldnt blame them me too i stood ever so carefully on the slick rock my flashlight reflected off the choppy water like a black mirror opaque and solid i shone the flashlight on the first stone it was pale and shining with water and probably ice i stepped onto it carefully the next stone still okay who knew nike airs were good for icy rocks macadams warning about hypothermia ran through my head just what id need to be hospitalized from exposure didnt i have enough problems without having to fight the elements there was a gap between the next two stones it was a tempting distance almost stepping distance but just an inch out of comfort range the stone i was on was flat low to the water but solid underfoot the next one was sort of curved on one side with a point afraid youre going to get your feet wet aikensen flashed a smile that was more a baring of white teeth in the dark jealous that youre wet and im not i could get you wet he said only in my nightmares i said i had to leap for it and hope some miracle of balance kept me safe i glanced back at the bank i thought about asking the divers if they had an extra dry suit for me but it seemed cowardly with aikensen shivering on the rocks besides i could probably make the jump probably i backed to the edge of the rock i was standing on and jumped there was a second of being airborne then my foot hit the rock my foot slid off to one side i collapsed onto the rock hugging it with both hands and one leg the other leg ended up thigh deep in ice cold water the shock of it left me cursing i struggled back up on the rock water streaming from the jeans pants leg my foot hadnt touched bottom the water on either side of the rocks would come up to my waist if aikensens little wading show was a good indication id found a sinkhole deep enough to have doused every inch of me lucky it was just my leg aikensen was laughing at me if it had been anyone else we might have laughed together at how ridiculous all this was but it was him and he laughed at me at least i didnt drop my flashlight i said it sounded childish even to me but he stopped laughing sometimes childish will get you what you want i was beside the skin now up close it was even more impressive id known it was reptilian from the bank standing next to it i could see it was definitely a snake the largest scales were the size of my palm the empty eye sockets were the size of golf balls i reached out to touch it something swirled against my arm as i reached for it i screamed before i realized it was the undulating snakeskin spreading out in the water when i could breathe again i touched the skin i expected it to be light a sloughed skin it was heavy meaty i turned the edge of it to the light it wasnt a sloughed skin the snake had been skinned whether it had been alive when the skinning started was a moot point it was dead now very few creatures can survive being skinned alive there was something about the scales and shape of the head that reminded me of a cobra but the scales even in the light of a flashlight gleamed with opalescence the snake wasnt any one color it was like a rainbow or an oil slick the color changed depending on the angle of the light you going to play with it or can the divers come and get it aikensen asked i ignored him for the moment there was something on the snakes forehead almost between the eyes something smooth and round and white i ran my fingers over it it was a pearl a pearl the size of a golf ball what the hell was a giant pearl doing embedded in the head of a snake and why hadnt whoever skinned the creature taken the pearl with him aikensen leaned forward running a hand over the skin yuck what the hell is it giant snake i said he jerked back with a yell he started scraping at his arms as if he could wipe off the feel of it afraid of snakes aikensen he glared at me no it was a lie and we both knew it the two of you enjoy being out on those rocks titus asked get a move on you see anything significant about the placement of the skin anita dolph asked not really the thing might have just gotten hooked on the rocks i dont think it was purposefully placed here we can move it then i nodded yeah the divers can come in aikensens already tested the water for predators aikensen looked at me what the hell does that mean it means there might have been creepycrawlies in the water but nothing tried to eat you so its safe you used me for bait you fell in ms blake say we can move the thing titus asked yes dolph said go to it boys the divers all looked at each other can we have the spotlight now macadam asked sure i said the light smashed into me i put a hand up to shield my eyes and nearly slipped off the rock jesus it was bright the water was still opaque black and choppy but the rocks glistened and aikensen and i were suddenly center stage the bright light washed all the color from the snakeskin macadam slipped his face mask on regulator secure in his mouth only one other diver followed his lead guess they didnt need four to go in after the skin whyre they putting on tanks just to wade out here aikensen asked insurance in case the current gets them or they find a sinkhole currents not that bad bad enough that if it catches the skin the skins gone with tanks you can follow something in the water all the way down wherever it goes you sound like youve done it im certified well arent you multitalented he said the divers were almost out to us their tanks looked like the backs of whales sticking out of the water macadam raised his face mask out of the water and put a gloved hand on the rocks he took the regulator out of his mouth hugging the rock and paddling with his legs to keep free of the current the other diver moved over by aikensen there a problem if we tear the skin macadam asked ill unhook it from this side of the rock youll get your arm wet ill live right i couldnt see his face well enough under all the equipment but id bet he was frowning at me yeah youll live i moved my hand down the front of the skin until i hit water the cold made me hesitate but only for a heartbeat i reached down soaking myself to the shoulder to untangle it my hand touched something slick and solid that wasnt skin i gave a small yip and jerked back nearly falling i got my balance and went for my gun i had time to say somethings down there it surfaced a round face with a screaming lipless mouth shot upward hands reaching for macadam i had a glimpse of dark eyes before it fell back into the water the divers got the hell out of there swimming with strong sure strokes for shore aikensen had stumbled back falling into the water he came up sputtering gun in hand dont shoot it i said the thing surfaced again i slid in beside it it shrieked its humanshaped hand groping for me it grabbed a handful of jacket and pulled itself to me my gun was in my hand but i didnt shoot aikensen was aiming at it shouts from the shore the other cops coming but there was no time there was just aikensen and me in the river the creature clung to me not screaming now just clinging as if i were the last thing in the world it buried its earless face into my chest i pointed my gun at aikensens chest that seemed to get his attention he blinked focusing on me what the hell are you doing point it somewhere else aikensen im tired of looking down the barrel of your gun bitch ditto i said voices shouting movement on the bank people coming almost there only seconds left until someone came someone saved us seconds too late a shot exploded next to aikensen close enough to spray him with water he jumped and his gun fired the creature went wild but i was already moving diving for the rocks it clung to me as if attached we floated by the big rock swirling in snakeskin but i managed to point the browning at aikensen the sound of his magnum vibrated in the air echoing down my bones if aikensen had turned towards us id have fired goddamn it aikensen put that damn gun away the splashing was heavy and it was probably titus wading into the water but i couldnt look away from aikensen aikensen was looking away from me towards the splashing dolph got there first he loomed over aikensen like the vengeance of god aikensens gun started to swing towards him as if he sensed his danger you point that gun at me and i will feed it to you dolph said his voice was low and reverberated even through the ringing in my ears if he points it at you i said ill shoot him nobodys shooting him but me titus waded up he was shorter than everyone but me so he was struggling in the water he grabbed aikensen by the belt and pulled him off his feet tearing the gun from his hand as he fell into the water aikensen surfaced choking and mad what the hell did you do that for ask ms blake why i did it ask her ask her he was short and wet and still managed to browbeat aikensen why aikensen said id lowered the browning but hadnt put it away trouble with carrying a big gun aikensen is that it goes through a hell of a lot of flesh what titus pushed him making him stumble aikensen struggled to stay on his feet if youd pulled that trigger boy with the creature pressed right up against her youd have killed her too i thought she was just protecting it she said not to shoot it look at it everyone turned to me then i used the rocks to leverage to my feet the creature was dead weight as if hed passed out with his hands locked in my jacket i had more trouble putting the gun away than i had getting it out cold adrenaline and the mans hand stuck on my jacket covering the holster because thats what i was holding a man a man who had been skinned alive but somehow wasnt dead of course it wasnt exactly a man its a man aikensen titus said its a hurt man if you werent so damn busy pulling your gun and shooting at things you might see whats in front of ya its a naga i said titus didnt seem to hear me dolph asked what did you say hes a naga who is titus asked the man i said what the hell is a naga everybody out of the water now a voice from shore yelled it was a paramedic with an armload of blankets come on folks lets not have to run everybody into the hospital tonight i wasnt sure but i thought i heard the paramedic mutter under his breath damn fools what the hell is a naga titus asked again ill explain if you can help me get him to shore im freezing my ass off out here youre freezing more than your ass off the paramedic said everybody to shore now move it people help her titus said two uniformed deputies were in the water they splashed up they lifted the man but his fists had locked into my jacket it was a death grip i checked the pulse in his throat it was there faint but steady the medic was folding blankets around everybody as they hit shore his partner a slender woman with pale hair was staring at the naga glistening like an open wound in the spotlight what the hell happened to him one of the deputies asked hes been skinned i said jesus christ the deputy said right thought wrong religion i said what nothing can you pry his hands loose they couldnt not easily they ended up carrying him cradled between them i sort of stumbled to the shore with his fingers still locked in my clothes none of us fell a second miracle the first was that aikensen was still alive staring at the raw bluish skin of the man maybe the miracle count was higher than just two the medic with the pale hair knelt by the naga she let out her breath in a great whoosh of air the other medic threw blankets around me and the two deputies when you get him pried off of you you get your butt up to the ambulances get out of those wet clothes asap i opened my mouth and he pointed a finger at me clothes off and sit in a warm ambulance or a trip to the hospital your choice aye aye captain i said and dont you forget it he said he moved off to spread blankets and orders to the rest of the cops what about the skin titus asked he had a blanket wrapped around him bring it to shore i said macadam said you sure this is the only surprise out there in that sinkhole i think this is our only naga for the night he nodded and slipped back into the water with his partner it was nice not to be argued with maybe it was the naked ripped body of the naga the paramedics had to pry the nagas hands from my jacket a finger at a time his fingers didnt want to uncurl they stayed bent like the fingers of the dead after rigor had set in do you know what he is the paramedic with pale hair asked a naga she exchanged glances with her partner he shook his head what the hell is a naga a creature out of hindu legend theyre mostly pictured in serpent form great he said will he react like a reptile or a mammal i dont know the medics from the other ambulance were setting up a pulley system and directing everybody up to the warmth of the ambulances we needed more medics the paramedics spread a warm saline solution on a soft cotton sheet and wrapped the naga in it his whole body was an open wound with all that that implied infection was the big threat could immortal beings get infections who knew i knew about preternatural creatures but first aid for the immortal that wasnt my area they bundled him in layers of blankets i looked at the drill sergeant paramedic even if hes reptilian blankets cant hurt he had a point his pulse is weak but steady the woman said should we risk trying an iv or i dont know her partner answered he shouldnt be alive at all lets just move him well keep him alive and get him to the hospital the distant whoop of more ambulances sounded reinforcements were on the way the medics put the naga on a long spineboard and fit it in a stokes basket attached to the ropes the other paramedics had set up at top of the hill you got any other information thatll help us treat him the paramedic asked his eyes were very direct i dont think so then get your butt up to an ambulance now i didnt argue i was cold and my clothes were beginning to freeze to my body even under the blanket i ended up in a warm ambulance wearing nothing but a blanket while more paramedics and emts forced heated oxygen on me dolph and zerbrowski ended up in the ambulance with me better them than aikensen and titus while we waited for the medics to tell us we would all live dolph got back to business tell me about nagas dolph said like i said theyre creatures from hindu legend theyre mostly pictured as snakes particularly cobras they can take human form or appear as snakes with human heads theyre the guardians of raindrops and pearls say the last again zerbrowski asked his neatly combed hair had dried in messy curls hed jumped in the river to save little ol me even though he couldnt swim i repeated it theres a pearl embedded in the head of the skin i think the skin was the nagas someone skinned him but he didnt die i dont know how the skin ended up in the river or how he did dolph said you mean he was a snake and they skinned him but it didnt kill him apparently not how is he in man form now i dont know why isnt he dead dolph asked nagas are immortal shouldnt you tell the paramedics that zerbrowski said hes been completely skinned and is still alive i think theyre going to figure it out on their own i said good point which of you fired the shot at aikensen titus did it dolph said he cussed him out and took his gun away zerbrowski said hope he doesnt give it back if anyone shouldnt be armed its aikensen you got an extra change of clothes with you blake zerbrowski asked nope ive got two pairs of sweats in the trunk of my car i want to get back to whats left of my anniversary the thought of wearing a used pair of sweats that had been sitting in zerbrowskis car was too much for me i dont think so zerbrowski he grinned at me theyre clean katie and i were going to exercise today but never got around to it never made it to the gym huh i said no color crept up his neck it must have been something really good or really embarrassing to get to zerbrowski that quickly what kind of exercise were you two doing i asked a man needs exercise dolph said solemnly zerbrowski looked at me eyebrows going up and how much of a workout is your sweetie giving you he turned to dolph did i tell you that blakes got herself a boyfriend hes sleeping over mr zeeman answered the phone dolph said isnt your phone right beside your bed blake zerbrowski asked he was giving me his best wide innocent brown eyes get the sweats and get me out of here i said zerbrowski laughed and dolph joined him these are katies sweats so dont get anything on them if you really want to work out do it nude i flashed him a onefingered salute oh do that again zerbrowski said your blanket gaped i was just amusing the hell out of everyone i was standing in my hallway at four oclock i was dressed in a very pink sweatsuit my wet clothes were held sort of gingerly in a bundle under my left arm even with the new pink sweats i was cold the paramedics had only let me go because i promised to drink hot fluids and take a hot bath id run up the stairs in a pair of gym socks i could wear katies sweats but not her shoes i was cold tired and my face hurt the headache was gone though maybe it was being dunked in icecold water maybe it was the touch of a naga i couldnt recall any stories associating them with spontaneous healing but it had been a long time since i read up on nagas theyd been on the final in preternatural bio class the big clue had been the pearl and the cobra skin i was going to have to dig up my textbook and reread the section though the doc on call at whatever hospital they went to was going to have to read up faster than i was would nagas be in their computers by law theyd better be would the naga have anyone to sue for him if they didnt would he rise from his deathbed and sue himself i stood in front of my apartment for the second time in six hours and had no key i leaned my head against the door for just a second and felt sorry for myself i didnt want to see richard again tonight we had a lot to talk about that had nothing to do with his shapeshifting i wished i hadnt thought of children i didnt want to discuss the little tykes tonight i didnt want to discuss anything i wanted to drag off to bed and be alone i took a deep breath and stood straight no need to look as woebegone as i felt i rang my own doorbell and vowed to get an extra set of keys made no one of them wasnt for richard they were both for me richard opened the door his hair was sleep tousled falling in a heavy wavy mass around his face he was shirtless and barefoot the top button of his jeans was undone i was suddenly glad to see him lust is a wonderful thing i grabbed the top edge of his jeans and drew him to me he jumped when my wet clothes touched his bare chest but he didnt pull away his body was almost fever warm from sleep i warmed my hands along his spine and he twitched writhing against the cold but never pulling away i dropped the wet clothes on the floor we kissed his lips were gentle my hands traced the edge of his waistband fingers dangerously low he spoke low and soft next to my ear i expected sweet nothings or dirty promises what i got was we have company i sort of froze i had this image of ronnie or worse irving sitting on the couch while we groped each other shit i said softly and with feeling home at last ma petite it was much worse than irving i stared up at richard with my mouth hanging open whats going on he came in while i was asleep i woke up when the door opened i was suddenly cold again down to my sodden toes are you all right do you really want to discuss this in the hall ma petite jeanclaudes voice was oh so reasonable i wanted to stand in the hall just because hed said not to but that was childish besides it was my apartment i stepped through the door richard a warm presence at my side i kicked my wet clothes through the door keeping my hands free the gun was in plain sight over the sweats the holster flapped loose without a belt but i could draw the gun if i needed it i probably didnt need it but it was good to keep reminding the master that i meant business richard closed the door and leaned against it hands behind his back his face was nearly hidden by a spill of hair the muscles in his stomach bunched and just seemed to invite caressing which was what wed probably have been doing if there hadnt been a vampire in my living room jeanclaude sat on my couch the black shirt was spread around his naked torso his arms were straight out along the back of the couch raising the shirt revealing nipples that were only two shades darker than his white skin a slight smile curled his lips he was dramatic and perfect on the white couch he matched the decor shit i was going to have to buy new furniture something not white not black what are you doing here jeanclaude is that any way to greet your new suitor dont be a pain in the ass tonight please im too tired and too sore to mess with it tell me why youre here and what you want then get out he rose to his feet as if pulled by strings all boneless ease at least the shirt closed on most of the pale perfection of his body that was something i am here to see you and richard why he laughed and the sound rolled over me like a wave of fur soft and slick tickling and dead i took a deep breath and stripped the holster off he wasnt here to hurt he was here to flirt i walked past both of them and draped the holster on the back of a kitchen chair i felt their eyes follow me as i moved it was both flattering and uncomfortable as hell i glanced back at them richard was still by the door looking unclothed and inviting jeanclaude stood by the couch utterly still like a threedimensional picture of a wet dream the sexual potential in the room was astronomical the fact that nothing was going to happen was almost sad there was still coffee in the pot if i drank enough hot coffee and took a really hot bath maybe id thaw out my preference would have been a hot shower quicker at four oclock in the morning but id promised the paramedics something about my core temperature why did you want to see richard and me i poured coffee into my freshly washed penguin mug richard was good at being domestic i was told that monsieur zeeman planned to spend the night if he did what of it who told you richard asked hed pushed away from the door hed even buttoned the top button of his pants pity stephen told me he wouldnt have volunteered the information richard said he was standing very close to jeanclaude physically he was looming above him just a bit halfdressed he should have looked uncertain hesitant he looked completely at home the first time id met richard hed been naked in a bed he hadnt been embarrassed then either stephen did not volunteer it jeanclaude said he is under my protection richard said you are not pack leader yet richard you can protect stephen within the pack but marcus still rules he has given stephen to me as he gave you to me richard was just standing there he hadnt moved yet suddenly the air around him swam if you blinked youd have missed it a creeping edge of power fanned out prickling along my skin shit i belong to no one jeanclaude turned to him face pleasant open voice conversational you do not acknowledge marcuss leadership it was a trick question and we all knew it what happens if he says no i asked jeanclaude turned back to me his face was carefully blank he says no and you tell marcus and then what he smiled then a slow curve of lips that left his perfect blue eyes glittering marcus would see it as a direct challenge to his authority i set down the cup of coffee and came around the island standing nearly between them richards energy crawled over my skin like insects on the march from jeanclaude there was nothing the undead make no noise if you get richard killed even indirectly the deal is off i dont need you to protect me richard said if you get yourself killed fighting marcus thats one thing but if you get killed because jeanclaude is jealous of you thats my fault richard touched my shoulder his power was like a rush of electricity down my body i shivered and he dropped his hand i could just give in to marcus just acknowledge his leadership then id be safe i shook my head ive seen what marcus considers acceptable its not even close to being safe marcus didnt know they filmed two endings richard said so you have talked to him about it are you referring to the delightful little films that raina masterminded jeanclaude asked we both looked at him a brush of power lashed out growing stronger it was hard to breathe standing next to him like trying to swallow a thunderstorm i shook my head one problem at a time what do you know about the films i asked jeanclaude looked at us one and then the other he ended staring into my eyes your voice makes it sound more important than it should be what has raina done now how do you know about the films richard asked he moved a step closer his chest touched my back and i gasped the skin up and down my back tingled as if someone had touched a live wire to the skin but it didnt hurt it was just an almost overwhelming sensation pleasurable but you knew if it didnt stop soon it would begin to hurt i stepped away from him standing between both of them giving my back to neither they both looked at me almost identical expressions on their faces alien as if they were thinking thoughts that id never dreamed of listening to music that i could not dance to i was the only human in this room jeanclaude just tell me what you know about rainas movies no games okay he stared at me for a heartbeat then gave a graceful shrug very well your alpha female invited me to join her in a dirty movie i was offered a starring role i knew hed turned her down he was an exhibitionist but he liked a certain decorum to his sideshow dirty movies would have been beyond the pale for him did you enjoy having sex with her on screen richard asked his voice was low and that energy flooded into the room jeanclaude turned to him anger dancing in his eyes she brags about you my furry friend says you were magnificent cheap shot jeanclaude i said you dont believe me you are that sure of him that he wouldnt have sex with raina yeah a strange look crossed richards face i stared at him you didnt jeanclaude laughed i was nineteen she was my alpha female i didnt think i had a choice yeah right she has her pick of the new males its one of the things i want to stop youre still sleeping with her i asked no not once i had a choice richard answered raina speaks so fondly of you richard in such loving detail it cant have been that long ago its been seven years really that one word held a universe of doubt i dont lie to you anita said richard richard took a step forward jeanclaude moved towards him the testosterone was rising higher than the supernatural powers we were going to drown in both i stepped between them bodily putting a hand on each chest the minute my hand touched richards bare skin the power poured down my arm like some cool electric liquid my hand touched jeanclaude a second later some trick of cloth or vampire put my hand on his bare skin too the skin was cool and soft and i felt richards power cross my body and smash into that perfect skin the moment it touched an answering roll of power spilled out of the vampire the two energies did not fight each other they mingled inside me spilling back on each of them jeanclaudes power was a cool rushing wind richard was all warmth and electricity each one fed the other like wood and flame and under it all i could feel myself that thing inside me that allowed me to call the dead magic for lack of a better word the three powers melded into one skincurling heartpumping stomachclenching rush my knees buckled and i was left gasping on the floor on all fours my skin felt as if it were trying to pull away from my body i could taste my heart in my throat and couldnt breathe past it everything was sort of golden around the edges and spots of light danced before my eyes i was in danger of passing out what the hell was that it was richard his voice seemed to come from farther away than it should have id never heard him cuss before jeanclaude knelt beside me he didnt try to touch me i looked into his eyes from inches away the pupils were gone nothing but that lovely midnight blue remained it was the way his eyes looked when he was getting all vampiric on me i didnt think hed done it on purpose this time richard knelt on the other side he started to reach out to touch me when his hand was an inch away a little jump of power ran between us like static electricity he jerked his hand back what is that he sounded a little scared me too ma petite can you speak i nodded everything was in hyperfocus the way the world gets on an adrenaline high the shadows on jeanclaudes chest where his shirt spilled around him were solid and touchable the cloth looked almost metallic black like the back of a beetle say something ma petite anita are you all right i turned in almost slow motion to richard his hair had fallen over one eye each strand was thick and perfect like a line drawn apart i could see every eyelash around his brown eye in startling contrast im all right but was i what happened richard asked i wasnt sure who he was asking i hoped it wasnt me because i didnt know jeanclaude sat beside me on the floor back against the island he closed his eyes and took a deep shuddering breath when he let it out his eyes opened they were still that drowning deep color as if he were about to feed on something his voice came out normal or as normal as it ever got i have never tasted such a rush of power without spilling blood first trust you to think of the perfect thing to say i said richard sort of hovered over me as if hed like to help but was afraid to touch me he glared at jeanclaude what did you do to us i jeanclaudes beautiful face was nearly slack eyes halfclosed lips parted i did nothing thats a lie richard said he sat indian fashion a little ways from me far enough away to make sure we didnt accidentally touch but close enough that that lingering power crawled between us i inched away and found that closer to jeanclaude wasnt much better whatever it was it wasnt a onetime deal the potential was still there in the air under our skins i looked at richard you sound awfully sure that hes up to something im willing to believe it but what do you know that i dont i didnt do it you didnt do it i know magic when i smell it it had to be him smell it i turned back to jeanclaude well he laughed the sound trailed down my spine like the brush of fur soft slick startling it was too soon after the rushing power wed shared i shuddered and he laughed harder it hurt and you knew you shouldnt be doing it but it felt too good to stop his laughter was always dangerously delicious like poisoned candy i swear by whatever oath you would trust that i did nothing on purpose what did you do by accident i asked ask yourself the same question ma petite i am not the only master of the supernatural in this room well he had me there youre saying one of us did it i am saying that i do not know who did it nor do i know what it is but monsieur zeeman is correct it was magic raw power to raise the hackles on any wolf whats that supposed to mean richard asked if you could harness such power my wolf even marcus might bow to it richard pulled his knees up hugging them to his chest his eyes looked distant thoughtful the thought intrigued him am i the only person in this room not trying to consolidate my kingdom richard looked at me he looked almost apologetic i dont want to kill marcus if i could make a great enough show of power he might back down jeanclaude smiled at me it was a very satisfied smile you admit he is not human and now he wants power so he can be leader of the pack his smile widened just this short of a laugh i didnt know you were a fan of sixties music i said there are many things you do not know about me ma petite i just stared at him the image of jeanclaude boogying down to the shangrilas was stranger than anything id seen tonight after all i believed in nagas i didnt believe that jeanclaude had hobbies a hot bath once more in the oversize tshirt sweatpants and socks i was going to be the worstdressed person in the room i was planning to replace that black robe at the first opportunity they were sitting on the couch each as far away from the other as they could get jeanclaude was sitting like a mannequin one arm on the back of the couch the other on the arm of the couch one foot rested atop his knee showing his soft boots to perfection richard was curled on his side of the couch one knee clutched to his naked chest the other knee curled on the couch richard looked comfortable jeanclaude looked as if he were waiting for a roving photographer to come by the two men in my life i could barely stand it ive got to get some sleep so everybody who isnt staying out if you are referring to me ma petite i have no intention of leaving unless richard goes with me stephen told you why im here richard said shes hurt and doesnt need to be alone look at her richard does she look hurt he held up a graceful hand i admit she has sustained some damage but she does not need your help perhaps she doesnt even need mine i invited richard to stay over i did not invite you but you did invite me ma petite first please stop calling me that second when did i invite you the last time i was here in august i believe shit id forgotten it was beyond careless id endangered richard things were working out but i hadnt known that when i left him here alone alone in a place where jeanclaude could come and go at will i can take care of that right now i said if a dramatic gesture will please you then be my guest but richard must not spend the night why not i think you are one of those women that where you give your body there too is your heart if you sleep with our monsieur zeeman i think it might be the point of no return sex isnt a commitment i said for most people no but for you i think it is the fact that he knew me that well brought heat in a rush up my face damn him i dont plan on sleeping with him i believe you ma petite but i see the way your eyes follow him he sits there looking luscious and warm and very alive if i had not been here when you came home would you have resisted yes he shrugged perhaps your strength of will is frightening but i cannot take that chance you dont trust me not to molest him again that shrug that could have meant anything his smile was inviting and condescending why you got the hots for him yourself the question caught him off guard the surprise on his face was worth the outraged look on richards face jeanclaude looked at richard he gave him his full attention he stared at richard eyes roaming his body in a slow intimate dance his gaze ended not on his groin or his chest but on his neck it is true that the blood of shapeshifters can be sweeter than human blood it is a wild ride if you can manage it without getting torn apart you sound like a rapist i said his smile blossomed in a surprised flash of fangs it is not a bad comparison that was an insult you know i said i know it was meant as such i thought we had an agreement richard said we do you can sit there and talk about taking me for food and weve still got an agreement it would be enjoyable to take you for many reasons but we have an agreement i wont go back on it what agreement i asked we are exploring our mutual powers jeanclaude said what does that mean exactly i asked were not sure richard said we havent worked out the details yet weve just agreed not to kill each other ma petite give us a little time to plan beyond that fine then both of you get out richard sat up straighter on the couch anita you heard lillian you need to be woken every hour just in case ill set an alarm look richard im fine get dressed and go he looked puzzled and a little hurt anita jeanclaude didnt look hurt or puzzled he looked smug richards not spending the night happy yes and youre not spending the night either i had not planned to he stood turning to face me i will leave as soon as ive had my goodnight kiss your what my kiss he came around the couch to stand in front of me i will admit i had envisioned you wearing something a little more he tugged on my sleevesalacious but one takes what one can get i jerked the sleeve out of his fingers you havent gotten anything yet true but i am hopeful i dont know why i said the agreement between richard and me is predicated on the fact that we are all dating you date richard and you date me we both woo you one cozy little family can you speed this up i want to get to bed a slight frown appeared between his eyes anita you are not making this easy hurrah i said the frown smoothed out as he sighed you would think i would give up on you ever being easy yes i said you would a goodnight kiss ma anita if you truly intend to date me it will not be the last i glared up at him i wanted to tell him to go to hell but there was something about the way he stood there if i say no kiss what then i go away for tonight he took that step closer to me that put us almost touching the cloth of his shirt brushed the front of my tshirt but if you give richard kisses and do not allow me such privileges then the agreement is off if i cannot touch you and he can it is hardly fair id agreed to the dating because it seemed like a good idea at the time but now i hadnt really thought through all the implications dating kissing making out yikes i dont kiss until after the first date but you have already kissed me anita not willingly i said tell me you did not enjoy it ma petite id have loved to lie but neither of them would have bought it you are an intrusive bastard not as intrusive as i would like to be he said you dont have to do anything you dont want to do richard said he was on his knees on the couch hands gripping the back i shook my head i wasnt sure i could explain it out loud but if we were really going to do this jeanclaude was right i couldnt hold richards hand and not his though it did give me a real incentive not to go all the way with richard tit for tat and all that after our first date you can have a willing kiss not before i said i was going to give it the old college try he shook his head no anita you yourself told me you liked richard not just loved him that you could see spending your life with him but not with me perhaps he is a more likable fellow i cannot compete in niceness thats certainly gospel i said he stared down at me with his blue blue eyes no drag of power but there was a weight to his gaze not magic but dangerous all the same but in one area i can compete i could feel his gaze on my body as if hed touched me the weight of his gaze made me shiver stop it no one word soft caressing his voice was one of his best things one kiss anita or we can end it here tonight i will not lose you without a struggle youd fight richard tonight just because i wont kiss you it is not the kiss ma petite it is what i saw tonight when you met him at the door i see you forming a couple before my eyes i must interfere now or all is lost youll use your voice to trap her richard said i promise no tricks tonight if he said no tricks he meant it once he gave his word he kept it which also meant he would fight richard tonight over a kiss id left both guns in the bedroom i thought we were safe for tonight i was too damn tired to do this tonight okay i said you dont have to do anything you dont want to anita richard said if we are all going to go down in a bloody mess let it be over something more important than a kiss you want to do it richard said you want to kiss him he didnt sound pleased what was i supposed to say what i want most right this moment is to go to bed alone i want some sleep that at least was the truth maybe not all of the truth but enough to earn me a puzzled frown from richard and an exasperated sigh from jeanclaude then if it is such a distasteful duty let it be done quickly jeanclaude said we were standing so close he didnt have to make a full step to press the line of his body against mine i tried to put my hands up to keep our bodies apart my hands slid over the bare skin of his stomach i jerked back from him balling my hands into fists the feel of his skin clung to my hands what is it ma petite leave her alone richard said he was standing beside the couch hands in loose fists power prickled along my skin his power creeping outward like a slowmoving wind his hair had spilled over one side of his face he looked out through a curtain of hair his face had fallen into shadows light gleamed along his naked skin painting it in shades of grey gold and black he stood there looking suddenly primal a low spinebrushing grow trickled through the room stop it richard he is using his powers on you his voice was unrecognizable a low bass growl that was sliding away from human i was glad for the shadows glad i couldnt see what was happening to his face id been so worried about jeanclaude starting a fight it hadnt occurred to me that richard might pick one he isnt using powers on me i touched his bare skin thats all he stepped forward into the light and his face was normal what was happening inside that smooth throat behind those kissable lips to make his voice sound monstrous get dressed and get out what his lips moved but that growling voice rolled out it was like watching a badly dubbed movie if jeanclaude isnt allowed to attack you then you sure as hell arent allowed to attack him i thought he was the only monster i had to deal with if you cant behave like a human being richard get out what of my kiss ma petite you have both pushed it about as far as its going to go tonight i said everybody out jeanclaudes laugh filled the shadowed dark as you like anita blake i am suddenly not so worried about you and monsieur zeeman before you start congratulating yourself jeanclaudei revoke my invitation there was a sound like a low sonic pop a great roaring filled the room the door smashed open banging against the wall a wind rushed in like an invisible river tugging at our clothes flinging our hair across our eyes you dont have to do this jeanclaude said yes i said i do it was as if an invisible hand shoved him through the door slamming the door shut behind him im sorry richard said the growl was slipping away his voice was almost normal it is too close to the full moon to get this angry i dont want to hear it i said just go anita i am sorry i dont usually lose control like this even this close to the full moon what was different tonight ive never been in love before it seems to break my concentration jealousy will do that to you i said tell me i dont have reason to be jealous anita make me believe it i sighed go away richard ive still got to clean my guns and knife before i can go to bed he smiled and shook his head i guess tonight didnt reassure you about how human i am he walked around the couch and bent over retrieving his sweater from the floor where it lay neatly folded he pulled the sweater over his head he pulled a ponytail holder from his jeans pocket and tied his hair back i could see the muscles in his arms work even through the sweater he slipped his shoes on bending over to tie them his coat was long falling to his ankles in the half light it looked like a cape i dont suppose i get a kiss either good night richard i said he took a deep breath and let it out slowly good night anita he left i locked the door i cleaned my weapons and went to bed after the show that richard and jeanclaude had put on the browning was about the only thing i wanted in bed with me tonight all right the gun and one stuffed penguin the phone was ringing it seemed to have been ringing a long time i lay in bed listening to it ring wondering when the hell the machine would pick up i rolled over reaching for the phone it was missing the ringing was coming from the other room shit id forgotten to bring it back in last night i crawled out of the warm covers and staggered into the living room the phone must have rung fifteen times before i got to it i sank to the floor with the receiver clutched to my ear who is it anita ronnie you sound awful i look worse i said whats up later why are you calling at i glanced at my wristwatch seven oclock in the freaking morning this better be good ronnie oh its good all right i thought we should catch george smitz before he goes to work why my face was throbbing i lay down on the carpet cradling the phone against my ear the carpet was very soft anita anita are you there i blinked and realized id fallen asleep i sat up and leaned against the wall im here but i didnt hear a word you said after something about needing to talk to smitz before work i know youre not a morning person anita but youve never fallen asleep on me before how much sleep did you get last night about an hour oh god i am sorry but i knew youd want to know ive found the smoking gun ronnie please what are you talking about i have pictures of george smitz with another woman she let that sink in for a moment or two anita are you there im here im thinking the last was harder to do than i wanted it to be i am never at my best first thing in the morning after an hours sleep i wasnt even close to my best why do you say its a smoking gun well a lot of times a spouse will report the other spouse missing to divert suspicion you think smitz offed his wife how poetically you put it but yes i do why a lot of men cheat on their wives most of them dont kill them heres the clincher after i took the pictures i talked to a few gun stores in the area hed bought some silver bullets at a store near the butcher shop not very bright i said most murderers arent i nodded realized she couldnt see it and didnt care fine looks like mr smitz isnt the grieving widower he pretended to be what do you want to do about it confront him at home why not go to the cops the store clerk isnt exactly positive it was george i closed my eyes great just great you think hell confess to us he might hes shared a bed with her for fifteen years mother of his children theres got to be a lot of guilt there i dont think real well on an hours sleep cops we should have the cops waiting in the wings at least anita hes a client of mine i dont turn clients over to the cops unless i have to if he confesses ill bring them in if he doesnt confess ill hand over what i have but ive got to try it my way first fine do you call him and tell him were coming or do you want me to ill do it i just thought youd like to be there yeah let me know when he hasnt gone to work yet ill call him and be over to pick you up i wanted to say no i have to go back to sleep but what if he had killed her what if hed taken the others george hadnt struck me as dangerous enough to take out shapeshifters but then id thought he was genuinely grieving genuinely worried about his wife what the hell did i know ill be ready i said i hung up without saying goodbye i was getting as bad as dolph id apologize when ronnie got here the phone rang before i could crawl to my feet what is it ronnie anita its richard sorry richard whats up you sound awful you dont you didnt get much more sleep than i did how come you sound so much better please tell me you arent a morning person he laughed sorry guilty as charged furry i could forgive a morning person id have to think about that richard dont take this wrong but what do you want jasons missing whos jason young male blond crawled all over you at the lunatic cafe ah i remember him hes missing yes jason is one of our newest pack members tonight is the full moon he wouldnt risk going out alone today of all days his sponsor went over to his house and he was gone sponsor like in aa something like that any signs of a struggle no i stood up dragging the phone in one hand i tried to think past the leaden tiredness how dare richard sound so cheerful peggy smitzs husbandronnie caught him with another woman a clerk may have sold him silver bullets there was silence on the other end of the phone i could hear his soft breathing but that was all the breathing was a little fast talk to me richard if he killed peggy then well handle it has it occurred to you that he could be behind all the disappearances i asked i dont see how why not a silver bullet will take care of any shapeshifter no great skill involved you just need to be someone that the shapeshifter trusts more silence finally okay what do you want to do ronnie and i were going to confront him this morning with jason missing we dont have time to pussyfoot around can you supply me with a shapeshifter or two to help threaten smitz maybe with a little muscle power we can get to the truth faster i have to teach school today and i cant afford for him to know what i am i didnt ask for you to come just for some of you to come make sure they look intimidating though irving may be a werewolf but he isnt very scary ill send someone to your apartment yeah when soon as you can and richard yes dont tell anybody what we suspect about george smitz i dont want to find him clawed up when we get there i wouldnt do that you wouldnt but marcus might and i know raina would ill tell them you have a suspect and want some backup i wont tell them who great thanks if you find jason before they kill him ill owe you one ill take the payment in carnal favors i said the minute i said it i wished i hadnt it was sort of true but after last night not down to my toes he laughed done ive got to go to work i love you i hesitated just a second i love you too teach the kiddies well today he was quiet for a space of heartbeats hed heard the hesitation i will bye bye when id hung up i stood there for a minute if someone was just walking up and shooting shifters then jason was dead the best id be able to do would be to locate the body it was better than nothing but not much we pulled up in front of george smitzs house at a little after nine that morning ronnie was driving i was riding shotgun gabriel and raina were in the backseat if asked i would have chosen different people for backup i also wouldnt have chosen my boyfriends old lover for backup what had richard been thinking or maybe raina hadnt given him a choice her coming today not the sex i still wasnt sure how i felt about that all right i knew how i felt i was pissed but id slept with someone else glass houses and all in any case richard had given me exactly what id asked for scary intimidating shapeshifters i wasnt used to getting exactly what i asked for next time id be more specific gabriel was dressed in black leather again it could almost have been the same outfit id first seen him in down to the metalstudded gauntlet on his right hand maybe his whole closet was one great big leather fest the earrings were gone the holes even in the harder cartilage of the ears had healed raina was dressed normally enough sort of she was wearing an anklelength fur coat fox cannibalism is one thing but wearing the skin of your dead it seemed a little cold blooded even for the psycho bitch from hell all right she was a wolf not a fox but heck i didnt wear fur on moral grounds she flaunted it she leaned over the back of the seat what are we doing in front of peggys house it was time to spill the beans why didnt i want to do it i undid the seat belt and turned to face her she was looking at me face pleasant enough on her lycanthrope bone structure she had all high cheekbones and a luscious mouth maybe she planned on doing something nefarious today gabriel had draped himself over the backseat the gauntleted hand trailed down ronnies arm even through her suede coat she shivered touch me again and i am going to feed you that hand shed scooted away from him as far as the steering wheel would allow which wasnt far gabriel had touched her several times on the drive over teasing nothing embarrassing but it was bothersome hands are very bony i prefer a more tender cut of meat breast or thigh is my preference gabriel said his grey eyes were startling even in sunlight maybe more so they had a quality of light to the grey that was almost luminous id seen eyes like that before but i still couldnt place it gabriel i know you are a pain in the ass i know youre enjoying the hell out of teasing ronnie but if you dont stop it were going to see just how good your recuperative powers are he slid across the seat closer to me not necessarily an improvement im yours anytime you want me is coming that close to dying really your idea of sex as long as it hurts gabriel said ronnie looked at us with wide eyes you have got to tell me about your evening you really dont want to know i said why are we here raina asked again she wasnt going to be distracted by mr leather good for her bad for me her gaze was intense as if my face were the most important thing in the world was this what marcus saw in her a lot of men are very flattered by undivided attention then arent we all ronnie she got the pictures out of her purse they were the kind of pictures that didnt need any explanation george had left his drapes up very careless gabriel curled back into the seat flipping through the shots a big smile on his face he got to one particular shot and laughed very impressive rainas reaction was very different she wasnt amused she was angry you brought us out here to punish him for cheating on peggy not exactly i said we think he is responsible for her disappearance if hes responsible for one disappearance he could be responsible for more raina looked at me the concentration was just as pure but now i had to fight an urge to squirm her rage was pure and simple george had hurt a pack member he would pay for that there was no uncertainty in her gaze only an instant rage let ronnie and i do the talking the two of you are here to intimidate him if we need it if there is any chance he has jason we dont have time to be subtle raina said i agreed with her but not out loud we talk you stay in the background and look menacing unless we ask okay im here because richard asked me raina said hes an alpha male i obey his orders somehow i dont picture you obeying anybodys orders i said she flashed me a very nasty smile i obey the orders i want to obey that i believed i jerked a thumb at gabriel who called in him i chose him gabriel is very good at intimidation he was big leather clad metal studded and had sharp pointy teeth yeah id say that was intimidating your word that youll stay in the background unless we need you richard said we are to obey you as we would obey him raina said great since you obey richard only when it suits you what does that mean raina laughed it had a hard brittle edge to it the kind of laughter that made you think of mad scientists and people locked too long in solitary i will let you handle it anita blake as long as you are doing a good job jason is my pack member i will not let your squeamishness endanger him i was liking this less and less im not squeamish she smiled that is true my apologies youre not a wolf i said what are you getting out of this gabriel smiled flashing sharp pointy teeth he was still flipping through the pictures marcus and richard will owe me a favor the whole damn pack will owe me one i nodded it was a motive i believed give the pictures back to ronnie no smart remarks just do it he pouted sticking out his lower lip it would have worked better without the fangs but he handed the pictures to ronnie his fingertips brushed her hand lingering a little but he didnt say anything that had been what i asked were all shapeshifters so damn literal his strange eyes stared at me i suddenly remembered where id seen those eyes behind a mask in a film that id rather not have seen gabriel was the other man in the snuff film i hadnt had enough sleep to hide the shock i felt my face crumble with it and couldnt stop it gabriel turned his head to one side like a dog why are you looking at me like i just sprouted a second head what could i say your eyes i just figured out where ive seen them yes he moved closer putting his chin on the back of the seat letting me have a good look at those luminous eyes where the zoo youre a leopard liar liar pants on fire but i couldnt think of a better one not this quick he blinked staring at me meow but that wasnt what you were thinking he sounded very sure of himself believe it or not i dont give a damn its the best answer youre getting he stayed there chin indenting the upholstery you couldnt see his shoulders so his head looked disembodied like a head on a pike accurate if edward found out who he was and edward would find out id tell him gladly if it would stop any more of those films from being made of course i wasnt sure it would stop them they were rainas brainchild supposedly she didnt know about the alternate ending yeah right and i moonlighted as the easter bunny ronnie was staring at me she knew me too well i hadnt told her about the snuff film now id introduced her to two of the stars shit we got out of the car into the bright chilly winter sunlight we walked up the sidewalk with a shapeshifter following at our backs that i had seen murder a woman on screen and feed from her stilltwitching body god help george smitz if he was guilty god help us all if he wasnt jason was missing one of the newest pack members richard had said if george smitz didnt have him who did raina grabbed my hand before it could touch the doorbell her grip had been very fast i hadnt had time to react at all her nails were long and perfectly manicured with nail polish the color of burnt pumpkins those orangebrown nails dug into my wrist just enough to indent the skin she let me feel the strength in that delicate hand she didnt hurt me but the smile on her face said she could i smiled back she was strong but she wasnt a vampire i was betting i could get to a gun before she could finish crushing my wrist she didnt crush my wrist she let go perhaps gabriel and i should go in the back way you did say you wanted us to stay in the background she was smiling and looking oh so reasonable the nail marks in my skin hadnt filled out yet i mean look at us ms blake even if we say nothing he cant ignore us she had a point how will the two of you get in the back door if its locked raina gave me a took worthy of edward as if id asked a very stupid question was i the only one who didnt know how to pick a lock fine go to it raina smiled and walked off through the snow her auburn hair gleamed against the fox fur coat her highheeled brown boots left sharp little prints in the melting snow gabriel trailed after her the chains on his leather jacket jingled as he walked his metalstudded cowboy boots smashed over rainas daintier prints almost as if it were purposeful nobodys going to mistake them for doortodoor salespeople ronnie said i glanced at our jeans my nikes her snow boots my leather jacket her long suede coat us either i said good point i rang the bell we stood on the little front porch listening to the eaves drip we were having one of those strange winter thaws that missouri is famous for the snow was all soft and fading like a snowman in the sunshine but it wouldnt last getting this much snow at all in december was unusual here we usually didnt get real snow until january or february it was taking a long time for mr smitz to come to the door finally i heard movement something heavy enough to be a person moving toward the door george smitz opened the door in a bloodstained apron over jeans and a pale blue tshirt there was a bloodstain on one shoulder as if hed lifted a side of beef and it had bled on him he wiped his hands on his apron palms flat skin stretching along the fabric as if he couldnt get them clean maybe he just wasnt used to being covered in blood or maybe his palms were sweating i smiled and offered him my hand he took it his palm was sweaty nervous great how are you mr smitz he shook hands with ronnie and ushered us inside we were standing in a little entryway there was a closet to one side a mirror on the opposite wall with a low table a vase full of yellow silk flowers sat on the table the walls were pale yellow and matched the flowers may i take your coats if he was a murderer he was the most polite one id ever met no thanks well keep them with us peggy always got on to me if i didnt ask for peoples coats george you werent raised in a barn ask them if you can take their coats the imitation sounded accurate we stepped out into the living room it was wallpapered in pale yellow with brown flowers done very small the couch the love seat the recliner were all a pale pale yellow almost white there were more silk flowers on the pale wood end table yellow the pictures on the wall the knickknacks on the shelves even the carpet underfoot was yellow it was like being inside a lemon drop either it showed on my face or george was used to it yellow was peggys favorite color was i mean is oh god he collapsed on the pale lemon couch face hidden in his big hands he was the only thing in the room that didnt match the yellow lace curtains its been so awful wondering he looked up at us tears glistened in his eyes it was academy award caliber ms sims said she had news about peggy have you found her is she all right his eyes were so sincere it hurt to look into them i still couldnt tell he was lying if i hadnt seen the pictures of him with another woman i wouldnt have believed it of course adultery wasnt murder he could be guilty of one and not the other sure ronnie sat on the couch as far away from him as she could get but still rather companionable cozier than i was willing to be with the son of a bitch if i ever managed to get married and my husband cheated on me it wouldnt be me to go missing please sit down ms blake im sorry im not being a very good host i perched on the edge of the yellow recliner i thought you worked construction mr smitz whats with the apron peggys dad cant run the store by himself he deeded it to her years ago i may have to quit working construction but you know hes family i cant leave him in the lurch peggy did most of the work dads almost ninetytwo he just cant do it all do you inherit the butcher shop i asked wed automatically gone into good cop bad cop guess which one i was he blinked at me well yes i suppose so he didnt ask if she was all right this time he just looked at me with his soulful eyes you love your wife yes of course what kind of question is that he looked less sad and more angry now ronnie i said softly she took the pictures out of her purse and gave them to him the front picture showed him embracing the darkhaired woman peggy smitz had been a blond color crept up his face not so much red as purplish he slammed the pictures down on the coffee table without looking at the rest they slid across the table images of him and the woman in various states of undress kissing groping nearly doing it standing up his face went from red to purplish his eyes bulged he stood up his breath coming in fast harsh gasps what the hell are these i think the pictures are selfexplanatory i said i hired you to find my wife not to spy on me he turned on ronnie towering over her his big hands balled into even bigger fists the muscles in his arms bulged veins standing out like worms ronnie stood up using her five feet and nine inches to good advantage she was calm if she was worried about facing down a man that outweighed her by a hundred pounds it didnt show wheres peggy george he glanced at me then back to ronnie he raised a hand as if he would strike her whered you hide the body he whirled on me i just sat there and looked at him hed have to come over or around the coffee table to get to me i was pretty sure i could be out of reach or have a gun or put him through a window that last was sounding better and better get out of my house ronnie had stepped back out of reach he stood there like a purplefaced mountain swaying between us get out of my house cant do that george we know you killed her maybe know was too strong a word but were pretty sure you killed her didnt have the right ring unless you really plan to start swinging id sit down georgieboy yes by all means sit down george i didnt look behind me to see where raina was i didnt think george would really hurt me but better to be cautious taking my eyes off a guy who weighed over two hundred pounds sounded like a bad idea he stared at raina he looked confused what the hell is this ronnie said oh my god she was staring behind me with her mouth open something was going on behind my back but what i stood eyes all for george but he wasnt looking at me anymore i stepped away from him just to be safe when i had enough distance to be safe i could see the doorway raina was wearing a brown silk teddy high heeled boots and nothing else the fur coat was held open the bloodred lining outlining her body dramatically i thought you were going to stay in the background unless i called for you she dropped the fur into a fuzzy puddle on the floor she stalked into the room swaying everything that would move ronnie and i exchanged glances she mouthed the words whats going on i shrugged i didnt have the faintest idea raina bent over the silk flowers on the coffee table giving george smitz a long thorough view of her slim backside the color was draining from his face his hands were slowly unclenching he looked confused join the club raina smiled up at him she stood up very slowly giving george a good view of her high tight breasts his eyes were glued to her dйcolletage she stood up running her hands down the teddy ending with a pass over her groin george seemed to be having a little trouble swallowing raina walked up to him until she was just a fingers pull away from him she looked up at him and whispered out of full sensuous lips wheres jason he frowned whos jason she caressed his cheek with her painted nails the nails slid out of her skin long and longer until they were great hooking claws the tips were still the color of burnt pumpkins she hooked those claws under his chin putting them just enough in not to break the skin the tiniest bit of pressure and youll have a howling good time once a month it was a lie she was still in human form she wasnt contagious all the color had drained from his face his skin was the color of unbleached paper wheres your wifes body mr smitz i asked it was a good threat worth more than one question i dont dont know what you mean dont lie to me george i dont like it she raised her other hand in front of his face and the claws slid out like unsheathed knives he whimpered wheres peggy george she whispered it the voice was still seductive she might have been whispering i love you instead of a threat she kept her claws under his jaw and lowered the other hand slowly his eyes followed that hand he tried to move his head down but the claws stopped him he gasped raina sliced through the bloody apron two quick hard slices the clothes underneath were untouched talent i killed her i killed peggy oh god i shot her wheres the body i asked that raina seemed to be enjoying her game too much to pay attention to all the details shed out back its got a dirt floor wheres jason raina asked she touched claw tips to his jeans over his groin oh god i dont know who jason is please i dont know i dont know his voice was coming in breathy gasps gabriel walked into the room hed lost the jacket somewhere and wore a tight black tshirt with his leather pants and boots he doesnt have the guts to have taken jason or the others is that right george you dont have the guts raina pressed her breasts against his chest claws still at his jawline and groin the lower claws pressed into the jean fabric not quite tearing please please dont hurt me raina put her face very close to his claws forcing him to stand on tiptoes or have his chin spitted you are pathetic she shoved the claws into his jeans tearing into the fabric george fainted raina had to pull her hands away to keep from slicing him up she kept a near perfect circle of jeans his white briefs showed through the hole in his pants gabriel knelt by the body balancing on the balls of his feet this human did not take jason pity raina said it was a pity somebody had taken eight no seven shapeshifters the eighth had been peggy smitz we had her murderer on the carpet with his fly torn out who had taken them and why why would anybody want seven lycanthropes something clicked the naga had been skinned alive if hed been a lycanthrope instead of a naga a witch could have used the skin to become a snake it was a way to be a shapeshifter with all the advantages and none of the bad stuff the moon didnt control you anita what is it ronnie asked i have to go to the hospital and talk to someone why a look was enough for ronnie to say fine ill call the cops but i drove damn i glanced up and caught sight of a car driving by on the street it was a mazda green i knew that car i may have a ride i opened the door and walked down the sidewalk waving the car slowed then doubleparked beside ronnies car the window whirred down at the press of a button edward sat behind the wheel a pair of dark glasses covering his eyes ive been following raina for days howd you spot me dumb luck he grinned not so dumb i need a ride what about raina and her little leather friend it occurred to me to tell him that gabriel was the other lycanthrope in the snuff film but if i did that now hed go in and kill him or at least wouldnt want to take me to the hospital priorities we can either give them a ride home or they can take a taxi taxi he said my preference too edward drove around the block to wait for me raina and gabriel were persuaded to call a taxi to pick them up in front of another house they didnt want to talk to the police fancy that george smitz came to and raina convinced him to confess to the police when they arrived i apologized to ronnie for deserting her and walked down the block to meet edward we were off to the hospital to talk to the naga heres hoping hed gained consciousness there was a uniformed officer standing outside the nagas room edward had stayed in the car after all he was wanted by the police one of the bad things about working with edward and the cops is that you cant necessarily work with them at the same time the cop at the door was a small woman with a blond ponytail there was a chair beside the door but she was standing one hand on her gun butt her pale eyes squinted suspiciously at me she gave a curt nod you anita blake yeah see some id she said real tough no nonsense had to be a rookie only a rookie had that hardon attitude older cops would have asked for id but they wouldnt have tried to make their voices lower i showed her my plastic id badge the one i clipped to my shirt when i had to cross a police line it wasnt a police badge but it was the best i had she took it in her hand and looked at it for a long time i fought the urge to ask if she was going to be tested later it never helps to piss the police off especially over trivialities she finally gave the badge back to me her eyes were blue and cold as a winter sky very tough probably practiced that look in the mirror every morning no one can question the man without police being present when you called up to ask to speak with him i contacted sergeant storr hes on his way how long will i have to wait i dont know look a mans missing any delay could cost him his life i had her attention now sergeant storr didnt mention a missing person shit id forgotten that the cops didnt know about the missing shapeshifters i dont suppose that youd buy time is of the essence how about lives are at stake her eyes went from hard to bored she was impressed sergeant storr was very specific he wants to be present when you question the man are you sure you spoke with sergeant storr and not detective zerbrowski it would be like zerbrowski to screw this up for me just to irritate i know who i spoke with ms blake i didnt mean to imply that you didnt officer i just meant that zerbrowski could have gotten confused about how much access im allowed to the ah witness i talked to the sergeant and i know what he told me youre not going in until he gets here those are my orders i started to say something unpleasant and stopped officer kirlin was right she had her orders and she wasnt going to budge from them i glanced at her nameplate fine officer kirlin ill just wait around the corner in the patient waiting room i turned and walked away before i said something not so nice i wanted to push my way into the room pull rank but i didnt have any rank it was one of those times when i was forcibly reminded that i was a civilian i didnt like being reminded i sat down on a multicolored couch that backed a raised area of real plants the chesthigh planting area gave the illusion of walls dividing the waiting room into three pseudo rooms the illusion of privacy if you needed it a television set was mounted high on one wall no one had bothered to turn it on yet it was hospital quiet the only noise was the heater coming through the wall registers i hated waiting jason was missing was he dead if he were alive how much longer would he be alive how long would dolph keep me waiting dolph came around the corner bless his little heart he hadnt kept me waiting long at all i stood officer kirlin says you mentioned a missing person to her are you holding out on me yeah but not by choice ive got a client that wont go to the police ive tried to persuade them i shrugged just because im right and theyre wrong doesnt mean i can spill their secrets without clearing it with them first theres no clientanimator privilege anita if i asked for the information youre legally obligated to give it to me i hadnt had enough sleep to deal with this or what he frowned or you go to jail for obstruction of justice fine lets go i said dont push me anita look dolph ill tell you everything i know when they give me the okay i may tell you anyway because theyre being stupid but i wont tell you shit because you bullied me he took a deep breath through his nose and let it out slow fine lets go talk to our witness i appreciated the naga still being our witness yeah lets go dolph motioned me out of the waiting room we walked down the hallway together in silence but the silence was companionable no need to fill it with idle chitchat or accusations a doctor in a white coat with a stethoscope draped over his shoulders like a feather boa opened the door officer kirlin was still at her post ever vigilant she gave me her best flinty steel look it needed work but when youre small blond female and a cop you have to at least try to look tough he can talk for a very short time its a miracle that hes alive let alone talking ill monitor the questioning if he gets upset ill stop the interview thats fine with me dr wilburn hes a victim and a witness not a suspect we dont mean him any harm the doctor didnt look completely convinced but he stepped back into the room and held the door for us dolph loomed up behind me he was like an immovable force at my back i could see why the doctor thought we might browbeat the witness dolph couldnt look harmless if he tried so he just didnt try the naga lay in the bed thick with tubes and wires his skin was growing back you could see it spreading in raw painful patches but it was growing back he still looked as though hed been boiled alive but it was an improvement he turned his eyes to look at us he moved his head very slowly the better to see us mr javad you remember sergeant storr hes brought some people to talk with you the woman he said his voice was low and sounded painful he swallowed carefully and tried again the woman at the river i walked forward yes i was at the river helped me i tried dolph stepped forward mr javad can you tell us who did this to you witches he said did you say witches dolph asked yes dolph looked at me he didnt have to ask this was my area javad did you recognize the witches names he swallowed again and it sounded dry no where did they do this to you he closed his eyes do you know where you were when they skinned you drugged me who drugged you woman eyes what about her eyes ocean i had to lean forward to hear that last his voice was fading he opened his eyes suddenly wide eyes ocean he let out a low guttural sound as if he were swallowing screams the doctor came up he checked his vitals touching the ruined flesh as gently as he could even that touch made him writhe with pain the doctor pressed a button on the bedside its time for mr javads medication bring it now no javad said he grabbed my arm he gasped but held on his skin felt like warm raw meat not first not first i dont understand others they did this to others yes stop them i will i promise he slumped back against the bed but couldnt hold still it hurt too much for that every movement hurt but he couldnt hold still against the pain a nurse in a pink jacket came in with a shot she put the needle into his iv moments later he began to ease his eyes fluttered shut sleep came and something in my chest loosened that much pain was hard to endure even if you were only just watching hell wake up and well have to sedate him again ive never seen anyone that could heal like this but just because he can heal the damage doesnt mean it doesnt hurt dolph took me to one side what was all that about eyes and others i dont know halftrue i didnt know what the eye comment meant but i suspected the others were the missing shapeshifters zerbrowski came in he motioned to dolph they walked out into the hall the nurse and doctor were fussing with the naga no one had invited me out into the hall but it was only fair i wasnt sharing with them why should they share with me the door opened and dolph motioned me out into the hall we went officer kirlin wasnt at her post probably told to leave for a little while cant find any missingperson case that has your name associated with it dolph said you had zerbrowski check me out dolph just looked at me his eyes had gone all cool and distantcop eyes except for dominga salvador zerbrowski said anita said she didnt know what happened to mrs salvador dolph said he was still giving me his hard look it was a hell of a lot better than officer kirlins i fought the urge to squirm dominga salvador was dead i knew that because id seen it happen id pulled the trigger metaphorically speaking dolph suspected i had something to do with her disappearance but he couldnt prove it and she had been a very evil woman if shed been convicted of everything she was suspected of doing it would have been an automatic death penalty the law doesnt like witches much better than it likes vampires id used a zombie to kill her it was enough to earn me my own trip to the electric chair my beeper sounded saved by the bell i checked the number i didnt recognize the number but no need sharing that an emergency ive got to find a phone i walked off before dolph could say anything else seemed safer that way they let me use the phone at the nurses station kind of them richard picked up the phone on the first ring anita yeah whats up im at school louie never showed up for his morning classes he lowered his voice until i had to plug one ear just to hear him tonight is full moon he wouldnt miss classes it raises suspicions why call me he said he was going to meet your writer friend elvira something elvira drew as i said her name i could picture her face her greenblue eyes the color of ocean water shit i think so when was he supposed to meet her this morning did he make the meeting i dont know im at work i havent been by his place yet youre afraid something happened to him arent you yes i didnt set up the meeting ill call work and find out who did will you be at this number ive got to get back to class but ill check back with you as soon as i can okay ill call you as soon as i know anything ive got to go he said wait i think i know what happened to the missing shapeshifters what this is an ongoing police investigation i cant talk about it but if i could tell the police about the missing shapeshifters we might find louie and jason faster marcus said not to tell yeah he was quiet for a minute tell them ill take the responsibility great ill get back with you i hung up it wasnt until i heard the dial tone that i realized i hadnt said i love you oh well i dialed work mary answered i didnt wait for her to get through her greeting put me through to bert are you all right just do it she didnt argue good woman anita this better be important ive got a client with me did you speak with someone about finding a wererat today as a matter of fact i did my stomach hurt when and where was the appointment set up this morning about six mr fane wanted to get it in before he had to go to work where her house give me the address whats wrong i think elvira drew may have set him up to be killed you are kidding me right address bert he gave it to me i may not be in for work tonight anita save it bert if he gets killed we set him up fine fine do what you have to i hung up it was a first bert giving in if i hadnt known that visions of lawsuits were dancing in his head id have been more impressed i went back to our little group no one was talking to anyone there have been seven shapeshifters taken in this area what are you talking about dolph asked i shook my head just listen i told him everything about the disappearances ending with two more shifters have gone missing i think whoever skinned the naga thought he was a lycanthrope it is possible by magic to take a shifters skin and use it to shapeshift yourself you get all of the advantages greater strength speed etc and you are not tied to the moon why didnt it work with the naga zerbrowski asked hes immortal the shifter has to die at the end of the spell we know why now where the hell are they dolph asked ive got an address i said how ill explain on the way the spell doesnt work until dark but we cant take the chance theyll keep them alive they have to be worried that the naga healed enough to talk after seeing him last night i wouldnt be zerbrowski said youre not a witch i said we left i would have liked edward at my back if we did find renegade witches and a few shapeshifters on the night of the full moon edward at my back was not a bad idea but i couldnt figure out how to manage it dolph and zerbrowski were no slouches but they were cops they arent allowed to shoot people without giving them every opportunity to give up elvira drew had skinned a naga i wasnt sure i wanted to give her an opportunity i wasnt sure wed survive it elvira drews house was a narrow twostory set off from the road by a thick line of bushes and trees you couldnt even see the yard before you turned into the driveway woods stretched out all around the small yard as if someone had put the house here and forgotten to tell anybody a patrol car followed us down the gravel driveway dolph parked behind a vivid green grand am the car matched her eyes there was a for rent sign in the yard another lay beside it waiting to be stuck in the ground it would probably go out by the road two clothes bags hung inside the car the backseat was packed with boxes a quick getaway was in the offing if shes a murderer whyd she give you her actual address zerbrowski asked we check out clients they have to have a place of residence or some way of proving who they are we demand more id than most banks why because every once in a while we get a crazy or a tabloid reporter we have to know who were dealing with i bet she tried to pay cash with no id and when asked for three forms of it she wasnt prepared dolph led the way to the door we followed behind like good soldiers officer kirlin was one of the uniforms her partner was an older guy with greying hair and a round little belly i bet it didnt shake like a bowlful of jelly he had a sour expression on his face that said hed seen it all and didnt like any of it dolph knocked on the door silence he knocked harder the door trembled elvira opened the door she was wearing a brilliant green robe tied at the waist her makeup was still perfect the polish on her fingernails matched the robe her long blond hair was combed straight back held from her face with a scarf that was just a touch bluer green than the robe her eyes blazed with the color dolph muttered eyes like the ocean excuse me whats all this about may we come in ms drew whatever for there hadnt been time to get a warrant dolph wasnt even sure we could have gotten one with what we had the color of someones eyes wasnt exactly proof i sort of peeked around dolph and said hello ms drew we need to ask you a few questions about louis fane ms blake i didnt know you were with the police she smiled i smiled was louie here was she stalling while someone killed him dammit if the police hadnt been here id have pulled the gun and gone in there are disadvantages to being law abiding were checking into the disappearance of mr fane you were the last one to see him oh dear she didnt back away from the door may we come in and ask you a few questions dolph asked well i dont know what i can tell you mr fane never made our meeting i didnt see him at all she stood there like a pretty smiling wall we need to come in and look around ms drew just in case do you have a warrant dolph looked at her no ms drew we do not her smile was dazzling then im sorry but i cant let you in i grabbed the front of her robe yanking it tight enough to know she wasnt wearing a bra we either go past you or through you dolphs hand descended on my shoulder im sorry ms drew ms blake gets a little overzealous the words were squeezed out between his teeth but he said them dolph let her go anita right now i looked up into her strange eyes she was still smiling but there was something else there now fear if he dies you die they dont put you to death for suspicions she said i wasnt talking about a legal execution her eyes widened dolph jerked back on my shoulder he pushed me down the steps zerbrowski was already apologizing for my faux pas what the hell do you think youre doing dolph asked hes in there i know it you dont know it ive called in for a warrant until we get it unless she lets us in or he comes to a window and yells for help we cant go in thats the law well it sucks maybe but were the police if we dont obey the law then who else will i hugged myself fingers digging into my elbows it was either that or run up and smash elvira drews perfect face in louie was in there and it was my fault take a walk anita cool off i looked up at him he could have told me to sit in the car but he hadnt i tried to read his face but it had gone cop blank a walk good idea i walked towards the trees no one stopped me dolph didnt call me back he had to know what id do i walked into the winterbare trees melt fell in droplets onto my head and face i walked out until i couldnt see them clearly anymore in winter you can catch glimpses of things for yards but it was far enough for our little game of pretend i angled back for the back of the house the melting snow soaked into my nikes the leaves were a soggy mat underfoot i had both guns and two knives id replaced the one that gretchen never returned they were a set of four that id had made for me hard to find a knife with a high enough silver content to kill monsters and still take a hard edge but i couldnt kill anyone my job was to get inside find louie and yell for help if someone in the house yelled for help the police could come in those were the rules if dolph hadnt been scared theyd kill louie he wouldnt have let me do this but law or no law sitting outside while your suspect kills her next victim was hard to swallow i hunkered down at the tree line looking at the back of the house a back door led onto an enclosed porch there was a door with glass in it that led into the house and a second door off to one side most houses in st louis have basements some of the older houses originally had only outside access to them add a little porch add a little door if i was hiding somebody a basement sounded like a good place if it was a broom closet i just wouldnt go in i checked the upperstory windows the drapes were closed if there were people up there watching i couldnt see them here was hoping they couldnt see me i crossed the open ground without getting out a gun they were witches witches didnt shoot you as a general rule in fact witches real witches didnt practice a lot of violence a wiccan wouldnt have had anything to do with human sacrifice but the word witch means a lot of different things some of them can get pretty scary but they seldom shoot you i knelt by the screen door that led onto the porch i held my hand as close to the door handle as i could without touching it no heat no hell theres no word for it but there was no spell on the handle even good witches will sometimes bespell their outer doors so theyre either alerted to a burglars presence or some attachment occurs say you break in and dont take a thing the spell will stick to you and let the witch and friends find you bad witches can put worse things on their doors wed already established what sort of witches were inside so caution seemed best i slipped the tip of my knife through the edge of the door a little jiggling and the door opened no breaking yet but i had definitely entered would dolph arrest me for it probably not if elvira forced me to shoot her out of sight of witnesses he might i went to the second door the one i hoped led to the basement i ran my hand over it and there it was a spell im not a witch i dont know how to decipher spells sensing them is about my limit oh one other thing i can break them but its a raw burst of power directed at the spell i just call up whatever it is that allows me to raise the dead and grab the doorknob its worked up to this point but its like kicking in a door without knowing whats on the other side eventually youre going to get a shotgun blast in your face the real problem was even if i got past it safely whoever laid the spell would know it hell a good witch would feel the buildup of power before i touched it if louie was behind this door great id go in and keep him safe until my screams brought the cavalry if he wasnt behind this door they might panic and kill him most witches good or bad are nature worshipers to a certain extent if it had been wiccans their ceremonial area would have been outside somewhere but for this darkness and an enclosed space might suffice if i had a human sacrifice lying about id want him stored as close to the ceremonial area as possible it was a gamble if i was wrong and they killed louie no no dwelling on worstcase scenarios it was still daylight it was afternoon the winter sunlight was grey and soft but it wasnt dark my abilities dont come out until after dark i can sense the dead and certain other things in daylight but im limited the last time i did this it had been dark i approached magic the same way i did everything else straight ahead brute force what i was really gambling on was that my powers were greater than whoever laid the spell sort of the theory that i could take a better beating than she or he could dish out was that true in daylight wed find out question was the spell just on the doorknob maybe id have locked the door spell or no spell why not just cut out the middle man i drew the browning and backed up i centered myself concentrating on a point near the lock but not on it i waited until that piece of wood was all there was there was a quality of silence in my ears i kicked it with everything i had the door shuddered but did not open two more kicks and the wood splintered the lock gave it wasnt a burst of light if someone had been watching they wouldnt have seen a damn thing but me falling backwards my whole body tingled as if id put my finger in an electric socket i heard running footsteps in the house i crawled to the open door i dragged myself to my feet using the banister a wash of cool air swept against my face i started down the steps before i was sure i could walk i had to find louie before elvira caught me if i didnt find proof she could have me arrested for breaking and entering and wed be worse off than we were before i stumbled down the stairs one hand in a death grip on the banister gun in the other the darkness was velvet black i couldnt see a damn thing beyond the finger of daylight even my night vision needs some light i heard footsteps behind me louie are you down here something moved in the darkness below me it sounded big louie elvira was standing at the head of the stairs she was framed by the light as if standing in a bodysized halo ms blake i must insist you get off my property this moment my skin was still twitching with whatever had been on the lock only my hand on the banister kept me standing you do the spell on the door yes youre good not good enough apparently now really i must insist you come up the stairs and get off my property a low growl came up from the darkness it didnt sound much like a rat and it certainly didnt sound human come out come out wherever you are i said the growling got louder closer something large and furry darted across the pale band of light the glimpse was enough i could always say i thought it was louie i leaned against the banister and screamed i screamed for help with every ounce of sound i could make elvira darted a took behind her i heard the distant yells of police coming in the front door curse you words are cheap i said it will be more than words when i have the time knock yourself out she ran into the house not away was i wrong had louie been inside all along and i was down here with a different fur ball was it jason jason something came to the stairs and peered up into the dim light it was a dog a big furry mutt dog the size of a pony but it wasnt a shapeshifter damn it growled at me again i got up and started to back up the stairs i didnt want to hurt it if i didnt have to where was dolph he should have been back here by now the dog let me ease back up the steps apparently it was only supposed to protect the basement fine with me nice doggy i eased up until i could touch the broken door i slammed it shut holding the doorknob the dog hit it with a roaring crash its own weight kept the door closed i opened the back door slowly the kitchen was long narrow and mostly white voices came from farther in the house a low growl filled the house reverberating the sound raised the hair on my neck no one has to get hurt here dolph said thats right elvira said leave now and no one gets hurt we cant do that a hallway made up of one wall and the stairs led out of the kitchen towards the living room and the voices i checked the stairs empty i kept going easing towards the voices the growl came again closer dolph yelled anita get your butt up here it made me jump he couldnt have seen me yet the entrance to the living room was an open doorway i went to one knee and peered around the wall elvira stood facing them a wolf the size of a pony was at her side if you just glanced at them you might mistake it for the big dog it was a good cover neighbors see it and think the wolf is a dog the other one was a leopard a black leopard that put every halloween kittycat to shame it had backed zerbrowski into a corner its slick furred back came to his waist big as a hellcat jesus why hadnt they shot police were allowed to shoot for selfprotection are you louie fane or jason dolph asked i realized he was asking the shapeshifters i hadnt told him what kind of shifter louie was and jason was a wolf the wolf could be jason though why hed be helping elvira i did not know maybe i didnt have to know i stood up and came around the corner maybe the movement was too sudden maybe the cat had just grown impatient the leopard leaped at zerbrowski his gun fired the wolf turned on me it all slowed down i had forever to look down the barrel and pull the trigger every gun in the room fired the wolf went down with a bullet in its brain from me i wasnt sure who else had gotten a piece of it zerbrowskis screams filled the echoing silence the leopard was on him slashing at him dolph fired one more time then threw the gun to the floor and waded in he grabbed for the cat and it turned on him slashing with daggerlike claws he screamed but didnt back off dolph down and ill nail it he tried to get out of the way but the cat leaped on him carrying them both to the floor i walked forward gun extended they were a rolling mass if i shot dolph hed be just as dead as the leopard would make him i knelt by them and shoved the gun into that warm furred body claws slashed my arm but i pulled the trigger twice the thing slumped twitched and died dolph blinked up at me there was a bloody slash on his cheek but he was alive i got to my feet my left arm was numb which meant it was really hurt when the numbness wore off id want to be somewhere with doctors zerbrowski lay on his back there was a lot of blood i fell to my knees beside him i laid the browning on the ground and searched for the big pulse in his neck it was there thready but there i wanted to cry with relief but there was no time there was a black stain of blood near the lower center of his body i pulled his coat back and nearly threw up on him wouldnt he laugh at that the cat had damn near eviscerated him his intestines bulged out at the tear i tried to pull my jacket off to hold over the wound but my left arm didnt want to work someone help me no one did officer kirlin had ms drew handcuffed her green robe was gaping open and it was clear she had nothing on under it she was crying crying for her fallen comrades dolph said he alive yeah ive called for an ambulance the male uniform said get over here and help me stop the bleeding he just looked at me sort of shamefaced but neither he nor kirlin moved to help what the fuck is the matter with you two help them we dont want to get it it the disease he said i crawled back to the leopard it looked big even dead nearly three times the size of a natural cat i fumbled at its belly and found the catch not a button not a belt but a catch where the fur peeled away inside was a naked human body i pulled the skin back so they could see theyre shapeshifters but not lycanthropes its a spell its not contagious you chickenshit son of a bitch anita dont pick on him dolph said his voice sounded so strange so distant that i minded him the man pulled off his own jacket and sort of laid it on top of zerbrowski he pressed down but gingerly as if he still didnt trust the blood get away from him i leaned on the coat using my body weight to hold his intestines inside they moved under my hand like something alive squishy and so warm they were hot when the hell are you going to get some silver bullets for your squad i asked dolph almost laughed soon i hope maybe i could buy them a few boxes for christmas please dear god let there be a christmas for all of us i stared at zerbrowskis pale face his glasses had fallen off in the struggle i looked around and couldnt see them it seemed important to find his glasses i knelt there in his blood and cried because i couldnt find his damn glasses zerbrowski was being sewn back together none of the doctors were telling us anything guarded his condition was guarded dolph was also in the hospital not as bad off but enough to stay for a day or so zerbrowski hadnt regained consciousness before they took him away i waited katie his wife arrived sometime in the middle of all that waiting it was only the second time wed ever met she was a small woman with a mane of dark hair tied in a loose ponytail without a spot of makeup she was lovely how zerbrowski had managed to snag her id never figured out she walked towards me dark eyes wide she was clutching her purse like a shield fingers digging into the leather where is he her voice was high and breathy like a little girls it always sounded like that before i could say anything the doctor came out of the swinging doors at the end of the hall katie stared at him all the blood had drained from her face i stood up and moved to stand beside her she stared at the approaching doctor like he was some monster in her worst nightmare probably more accurate than i wanted it to be are you mrs zerbrowski the doctor asked she nodded her hands where they gripped the purse were mottled trembling with tension your husband is stable it looks good hes going to make it christmas was coming after all katie gave a small sigh and her knees buckled i caught her and stood there supporting her dead weight she couldnt have weighed ninety pounds weve got a lounge in here if you can he looked at me then shrugged i lifted katie zerbrowski in my arms got the balance of it and said lead on i left katie sitting by zerbrowskis bedside his hand wrapped around hers like he knew she was there maybe he did lucille dolphs wife was there now to hold her hand just in case staring down at zerbrowskis pale face i prayed that there was no just in case i wanted to wait until zerbrowski woke up but the doctor told me it would probably be tomorrow i couldnt go without sleep that long my new stitches made the crossshaped burn scar on my left arm crooked the claw marks twisted to one side missing the mound of scar tissue at the bend of my arm carrying katie had broken some of my stitches and they bled through the bandage the doctor who had operated on zerbrowski resewed it personally he looked at the scars a lot my arm hurt and was bandaged from wrist to elbow but we were all alive yea the taxi dropped me off at my apartment building at what would have been a decent hour louie had been drugged and tied in the basement elvira had admitted to taking the skins of a werewolf a wereleopard and trying for the naga jason hadnt been in the house she denied ever having seen him what did she need with another werewolf skin the wererat skin would have been for her she said when asked who the snakeskin would have been for she said her there was at least one other person involved that she wasnt willing to give up she was a witch and had used magic to kill it was an automatic death sentence once convicted the sentence would be carried out within fortyeight hours no appeals no pardons dead the lawyers were trying to get her to admit to the other disappearances if shed admit to it they might commute her sentence might a killer witch i didnt believe theyd lighten her sentence but maybe they would richard was sitting outside my apartment door i hadnt expected to see him night of the full moon and all id left a message on his answering machine about finding louie and him being all right the police were trying to keep it all quiet especially louies secret identity i hoped they could manage it but at least he was alive animal control had the dog i got your message he said thanks for saving louie i put my key in the lock youre welcome we havent found jason do you really think the witches took him i opened the door he followed me in and closed the door i dont know thats been bothering me too if shed taken jason he should have been there the wolf once out of its skin had been a woman that i didnt know i walked into the bedroom as if id been alone richard followed me i felt light and distant and faintly unreal theyd cut off the sleeve of my jacket and sweater id tried to save the jacket but i guess it had been ruined anyway theyd also cut through the left arm sheath i had it and the knife shoved in my jacket pocket why do they always cut everything off in the emergency room he came up behind me not touching hands hovering over my arm you didnt tell me you were hurt the phone rang i picked it up without thinking a mans voice said anita blake yes this is williams the naturalist at the audubon center i played back some of my owl tapes that id recorded at night one of them has what id swear was hyenas on it i told the police but they didnt seem to understand the significance do you understand what it might mean to have hyena sounds out here a werehyena i said yes i thought so too no one had told him the killer was probably a werewolf but one of the missing shifters was a hyena maybe elvira really didnt know what happened to all the missing lycanthropes did you say you told the police yes i did whod you tell i called sheriff tituss office whod you speak to aikensen do you know if he told titus no but why wouldnt he why indeed someones at the door can you hold on a minute i dont think ill be right back williams williams dont answer the door but i was talking to empty air i heard him walk across the floor the door opened he made a surprised sound heavier footsteps came back across the floor someone picked up the phone i could hear them breathing they didnt say anything talk to me you son of a bitch the breathing got heavy if you hurt him aikensen i will feed you your dick on knife point he laughed and hung up and id never be able to testify in court who was on the other end of that phone dammit damn it damn it whats wrong i called information to get the number for the willoton police department i pressed the button that dialed it automatically for a small fee anita what is it i held up a hand telling him to wait a woman answered is this deputy holmes it wasnt i got chief garroway after impressing on the dispatcher that this was a matter of life and death i did not scream at her i deserved mucho brownie points for that i gave garroway the readers digest version i cant believe even aikensen would be involved in something like this but ill send a car thanks why didnt you just call richard asked theyd call the county police aikensen might even be assigned the call i was struggling out of my butchered jacket richard eased it off my left shoulder or i might never have gotten it off when it was off i realized i was out of coats id ruined two in as many days i grabbed the only coat i had left it was crimson long and full id worn it twice the last time was christmas the red coat would show up even at night if i needed to sneak up on anybody i could take it off richard had to help me get my left arm in the sleeve it still hurt lets go get jason he said i looked at him youre not going anywhere but wherever lycanthropes go when theres a full moon you cant even put your own coat on how are you going to drive he had a point this may put you in danger im a fullgrown werewolf and tonight is the full moon i think i can handle it he had a faraway look in his eyes as if he were hearing voices i would never know all right lets go but were going to save williams i think the weres are close to his place but i dont know exactly where he was standing there with his long duster coat on he was wearing a white tshirt a pair of jeans with one knee gone and a pair of less than reputable shoes why the scuffy clothes if i shift in my clothes theyre always torn apart precaution you ready yeah lets go he said there was something about him that was different a waiting tension like water just before it spills over the edge when i looked into his brown eyes something slid behind them some furred shape was inside there waiting to get out i realized what i was sensing from him eagerness richards beast was looking out of his true brown eyes and it was eager to be about its business what could i say we went edward was leaning against my jeep arms crossed breath fogging in the air the temperature had dropped by twenty degrees with the dark the freeze was back on all the meltwater had turned to ice the snow crunched underfoot what are you doing here edward i was about to come up to your apartment when i saw you coming down what do you want i want to play he said i stared at him just like that you dont know what im involved in but you want a piece of it following you around lets me kill a lot of people sad but true i dont have time to argue get in he slid in the backseat who exactly are we going to kill tonight richard started the engine i buckled up lets see theres a renegade policeman and whoevers kidnapped seven shapeshifters the witches didnt do it not all of it you think ill get to kill any lycanthropes tonight he was teasing richard i think richard wasnt offended ive been thinking about who could have taken them all without a struggle it had to be someone they trusted who would they trust i asked one of us he said oh boy edward said lycanthrope on the menu for tonight richard didnt correct him if it was all right with him it was all right with me williams lay crumpled on his side hed been shot at close range through the heart two shots so much for the doctorate one hand was wrapped around a magnum i was even betting that there would be powder on his skin as though hed really fired the gun deputy holmes and her partner whose name i couldnt remember were lying in the snow dead the magnum had taken most of her chest her pixielike features were slack and not half so pretty with her eyes staring straight up she didnt look asleep she just looked dead her partner was missing most of his face he was collapsed in the snow blood and brains melting through the frozen snow his gun was still gripped in his hand holmes had gotten her gun out too for what good it did her i doubted either one of them had shot williams but id have bet a months pay that one of their guns had i knelt in the snow and said shit richard stood by williams he was staring at him as if hed memorize him samuel didnt own a gun he didnt even believe in hunting you knew him im in audubon remember i nodded none of it seemed real it looked staged would he get away with it no hes dead i said softly edward came to stand beside me whos dead aikensen hes still walking and talking but hes dead he just doesnt know it yet where do we find him edward asked good question i didnt have a good answer my beeper went off and i screamed one of those little yip screams that are always so embarrassing i checked the number with my heart thundering in my chest i didnt recognize the number who could it be and could it possibly be important enough to call back tonight id left my beeper number with the hospital i didnt know their number either i had to answer it hell i needed to call chief garroway and tell him his people had walked into an ambush i could make both calls from williamss house i trudged towards the house edward followed we were on the porch before i realized that richard wasnt with us i turned back he had knelt down beside williams i thought at first he was praying then realized he was touching the bloody snow did i really want to know yeah i walked back over edward stayed on the porch without being asked point for him richard are you all right it was a stupid question with a man he knew dead at his feet but what else was i supposed to ask his hand closed over the bloody snow crushing it he shook his head i thought he was just angry or grief stricken until i saw the sweat on his face he turned his face upward eyes closed the moon rode full and bright heavy and silver white the light was almost daylight bright this far away from the city wisps of cloud rode the sky made luminous with moonshine richard i knew him anita weve gone birding together we talked about his doctorate thesis i knew him and now all i can think of is the smell of blood and how warm he still is he opened his eyes and looked at me there was sorrow in his eyes but mostly there was darkness his beast was looking out through his eyes i turned away i couldnt hold his gaze ive got to make this phone call dont eat any of the evidence i walked away across the snow it had been too long a night i called from the phone in williamss kitchen i called garroway first told him what wed found once he could breathe he cursed a bit and said hed come himself probably wondering if things would have turned out differently if hed come in the first place command decisions are always hard i hung up and dialed the number on my beeper hello this is anita blake this number was left on my beeper anita this is kaspar gunderson the swan man yes kaspar what is it you sound awful has something happened lots but why did you beep me i found jason i stood a little straighter youre kidding no i found him ive got him at my house now ive been trying to contact richard do you know where he is with me perfect he said can he come take charge of jason before he changes well yeah i guess so why im just a bird anita im not a predator i cant control an inexperienced werewolf okay ill tell him wheres your house richard knows where it is ive got to get back to jason keep him calm if he loses it before richard arrives im running for cover so if i dont answer the doorbell youll know what happened are you in danger from him just hurry he hung up richard had come inside he was standing in the doorway looking bemused as if listening to music only he could hear richard his head moved slowly towards the sound of my voice like a video running on slow speed his eyes were pale golden yellow the color of amber jesus i said he didnt look away he blinked his new eyes at me what is it kaspar called he found jason hes been trying to get you says he cant control him once he changes jasons all right he said he gave it that questioning lilt yes are you all right no i have to change soon or the moon will pick the time for me i didnt exactly understand that statement but he could explain in the car edward can drive in case the moon picks going down highway fortyfour as the perfect time good idea but kaspars house is just up the mountain what do you mean kaspar lives just up the road great lets go youll have to leave jason and me up there he said why i can make sure he doesnt hurt anybody but he has to hunt ill take him out here there are deer in the woods i stared at him he was still richard still my sweetie but his eyes were the color of pale amber startling in his dark face youre not going to change in the car are you i asked no i would never endanger you i have complete control over my beast its what being an alpha wolf means i wasnt worried about being eaten i said i just didnt want you to get that clear junk all over my new seats he flashed a smile it would have been more comforting if his teeth hadnt been just a little pointier than usual jesus h christ kaspar gundersons house was made of stone or at least sided with it pale chunks of granite formed the walls the trim was white the roof shingles pale grey the door was white as well it was clean neat and still managed to be rustic it sat in a clearing at the top of the mountain the road stopped at his house there was a turnaround but the road didnt go past richard rang the bell kaspar opened it he looked very relieved to see us richard thank god hes managed to hold on to human form so far but i dont think he can last much longer he held the door for us we walked in and found two strange men sitting in his living room the man to the left was short dark and had wireframed glasses on the other man was taller blond with a reddish beard they were the only things that didnt match the decor the entire living room was whitecarpet couch two chairs walls it was like standing in the middle of a vanilla icecream cone he had the same couch that i did i needed new furniture who are they richard asked they arent one of us you could say that it was titus he stood in the doorway leading to the kitchen a gun in his hand dont anybody move he said his southern accent was thick as corn pone aikensen stepped out of the door leading to the rest of the house he had another big magnum in his hand you buy those by the caseload i asked i liked your threat on the phone it got me hot i took a step forward hadnt meant to please aikensen said he was pointing the big gun at my chest titus was pointing at richard the two men in the chairs had guns out now too one big happy party edward was very still at my back i could almost feel him weighing the odds a bolt action on a rifle shot back behind us we all jumped even edward another man was behind us in the door his solid grey hair was balding the grey man had a rifle in his hands pointed at edwards head there wouldnt be enough left to pick up in a baggie hands up yall we put our hands up what else could we do lace your fingers atop your head titus said edward and i did it like wed done it before richard was slower now wolfman or i will drop you where you stand and your little girlfriend might get all shot up in the bargain richard laced his fingers kaspar whats going on kaspar was sitting on the couch no reclining was the word he looked comfortable happy as a wellfed cat er swan these gentlemen here have paid a small fortune to hunt lycanthropes i supply them prey and a place to hunt titus and aikensen make sure that no one finds out right i told you i did a little hunting ms blake titus said the dead man one of your hunters his eyes flicked not exactly looking away but flinching yes ms blake he was i looked at the two men with their guns out i didnt turn around to see grey hair at the door you three think that hurting shapeshifters is worth dying over the darkhaired one looked at me from behind his round glasses his eyes were distant calm if it bothered him to be pointing a gun at fellow human beings it didnt show the bearded mans eyes flicked around the room never settling on anything he wasnt having a good time why didnt you and aikensen clean up the mess before holmes and her partner saw the body we were out hunting werewolf aikensen said kaspar were your people richard said no kaspar said he stood you arent i am not a lycanthrope im not even an inherited condition i was cursed by a witch so long ago that i dont care to remember how long is that supposed to make us feel sorry for you i asked no in fact i dont suppose i have to explain myself you have both been decent to me i suppose i feel guilty about that he shrugged this will be our last hunt one big gala event if you had slaughtered raina and gabriel i could almost understand it i said but what did the lycanthropes you helped murder ever do to you when the witch told me what she had done i remember thinking that being a great ravening beast would be a fine thing i could still hunt i could even slay my enemies instead she made he spread his hands wide you kill them because they are what you want to be i said he gave a small smile jealousy anita envy they are very bitter emotions i thought about calling him a bastard but it wouldnt help seven people had died because this son of a bitch didnt like being a bird the witch should have killed you slowly she wanted me to learn my lesson and repent im not real big on repentance i said i like revenge better if i wasnt confident you would die tonight that might worry me worry i said wheres jason richard asked well take you to him wont we boys titus said edward hadnt said a word i wasnt sure what he was thinking but i hoped he didnt go for a gun if he did most of the people in this room were dead three of them would be us pat em down aikensen aikensen grinned he holstered his big gun that left one revolver two automatics and a highpowered rifle it was enough dream team that we are edward and i had our limits he patted richard down a quick search he was having a good time until he got up to where he could see richards eyes he paled just a little looking into those wolf eyes nervous was good he kicked my legs farther apart i glared at him his hands hovered over my breasts not where you start a search if he does anything but search me for weapons i am going to draw a gun and take my chances aikensen you treat ms blake here like a lady no hankypanky aikensen dropped to his knees in front of me he ran just the palm of his hand over my breast lightly just over the nipples i smashed my right elbow into his nose blood sprayed outward he rolled around on the ground hands to his busted nose the darkhaired man was standing he was pointing his gun very steadily at me his glasses reflected the light hiding his eyes everybody calm down now titus said aikensen deserved that i guess aikensen came up off the floor blood covering the lower half of his face he fumbled for his gun if that gun clears your holster i will shoot you myself titus said aikensen was breathing fast and heavy through his mouth little bubbles of blood showed at his nose when he tried to breathe through it it was definitely broken it wasnt as good as eviscerating him but it was a start he kept his hands on his gun but he didnt pull it he stayed on his knees for a long time you could see the struggle in his eyes he wanted to shoot me almost enough to try for it great the feeling was mutual aikensen titus said softly his voice was very serious as if he were just realizing that aikensen might go for it i mean what i say boy dont you be toying with me he got to his feet spitting blood trying to get it away from his mouth youre going to die tonight maybe but it wont be you ms blake if you could refrain from teasing aikensen long enough for me to get him away from you id appreciate it always glad to cooperate with the police i said titus laughed the bastard well now the criminals pay better ms blake fuck you no need to get abusive he tucked his own gun into his side holster now im not going to do a thing but search you for weapons any more of this nonsense and were going to have to shoot one of you to prove were serious you dont want to lose your sweetheart here or your friend here he smiled just good ol sheriff titus friendly jesus he found both guns then patted me down a second time i must have winced because he said howd you hurt your arm ms blake i was helping the police on another case they let a civvie get hurt sergeant storr and detective zerbrowski are in the hospital they were injured in the line of duty something passed over his chubby face it might have been regret heroes dont get anything but dead ms blake you best remember that bad guys die too titus he pushed the sleeve of the red coat up and took the knife he hefted it testing its balance custom made i nodded i do admire good equipment keep it ill get it later he chuckled you have guts girl ill give you that and youre a fucking coward the smile vanished always needing to have the last word is a bad trait ms blake pisses people off thats the idea he moved to edward id give titus one thing he was thorough he took two automatics a derringer and a knife big enough to pass for a short sword from edward i had no idea where hed been hiding the knife who do the two of you think you are the freaking cavalry edward didnt say a thing if he could be quiet so could i there were too many guns to make one of them angry and try to jump the rest we were outnumbered and outgunned it was not a good way to start the week now we are all going to go downstairs titus said we want you all to join us in the hunt you will be let out into the woods if you can get away from us then you are free you can run to the nearest police and turn us in you try anything funny before we let you go and we will just kill you you all understand that we just looked at him i cant hear you i heard what you said i said how bout you blondie i heard you too edward said wolfman you hear me dont call me that richard said he didnt sound particularly scared either good if youre going to die at least die brave it pisses your enemies off can we put our hands down now i asked no titus said my left arm was beginning to throb if that was the most painful thing that happened to me tonight id be ahead of the game aikensen went first richard next with the darkhaired man and his calm eyes at his back the bearded man then me titus edward grey hair and his rifle next kaspar brought up the rear it was a parade the stairs led into a natural cavern below the house it was about sixty by thirty feet with a ceiling that wasnt higher than twelve feet a tunnel led out the far wall electric lights gave a harsh yellow glow to everything two cages were set into the granite walls in the far cage jason was huddled into a fetal ball he didnt move as we all trooped in what have you done to him richard said tried to get him to change for us titus said birdie here said hed be an easy mark kaspar looked uncomfortable whether it was the birdie remark or jasons stubbornness it was hard to tell he will change for us so you say grey hair said kaspar frowned at him aikensen opened the empty cage his nose was still bleeding he had a wad of kleenex held to it but it wasnt helping much the kleenexes were crimson in ya go wolfie titus said richard hesitated mr carmichael the boy if you please dark hair put up his mm and got out a from his waistband he pointed it at jasons huddled form wed been discussing putting a bullet in him anyway see if it would help persuade him to change for us now get in the cage richard stood there carmichael pointed the gun through the bars sighting down his arm dont richard said ill do it he walked into the cage now you blondie edward didnt argue he just walked in he was taking this a lot better than i thought he would aikensen shut the door he locked the door then walked across to the second cage he didnt unlock it he waited with the soggy kleenex pressed to his nose a drop of blood fell to the floor you get to share accommodations with our young friend richard gripped the bars of his cage you cant put her in there when he changes hell need to feed two things help the change happen kaspar said sex and blood i saw how much jason likes your lady friend dont do this kaspar too late he said if i went in the cage i was going to end up eaten alive that was actually one of my top five ways not to die i wasnt going in the cage id make them shoot me first aikensen is going to open the cage then you step inside ms blake no i said titus looked at me ms blake mr fienstien here will shoot you wont you mr fienstien the bearded man uncertain eyes and all pointed a mm beretta at me a nice gun if you didnt insist on buying american the barrel looked very big and solid from the wrong end fine shoot me ms blake we are not joking neither am i my choices are being eaten alive or being shot so shoot me mr carmichael if you will point your over here carmichael did we can wound you ms blake put a bullet in your leg and then shove you in that cage i looked into his beady little eyes and knew he would do it i didnt want to go into the cage but i really didnt want to go in wounded im going to count to five ms blake then carmichael here is going to wound you and we will drag you into that cage one two three four all right all right damn you unlock the damn door aikensen did i walked in the door clanged shut behind me i stood there near the door jason was shivering as if he had a fever but he never moved otherwise the men outside seemed disappointed we paid good money to hunt a werewolf grey hair said we are not getting our moneys worth weve got all night gentlemen he wont resist this luscious tidbit forever kaspar said i didnt like being called a tidbit luscious or otherwise i called garroway before we drove up here i told him about his deputies getting ambushed i told him it was aikensen liar i looked straight at titus you think im lying maybe well just shoot all of you now and flee ms blake you going to give these gentlemen their money back we want a hunt titus the three armed men didnt look like leaving before the fun was an option the police dont know about the birdmans involvement carmichael of the said he can stay upstairs if they come asking questions he can answer them titus wiped his palms against his pants sweating palms nerves i hoped so she didnt call shes just bluffing aikensen said make him change carmichael said hes not paying any attention to her grey hair said give it time gentlemen you said we dont have time youre the expert kaspar thinka something kaspar smiled staring at something behind me i dont think well have to wait much longer i turned around slowly looking behind me jason was still huddled on the ground but his face was turned to me he rolled onto all fours in one easy motion his eyes flicked to me then stared at the men on the outside of the cage i wont do it i wont change for you his voice was strained but normal human sounding youve held out a long time jason kaspar said but the moon is rising smell her fear jason smell her body you know you want her no he bowed his head to the ground hands and arms flat to the floor knees drawn up he shook his head face pressed into the rock no he raised his face up i wont do it like some sideshow freak do you think giving jason and ms blake here a little privacy would help matters along titus asked it might kaspar said he doesnt seem to like an audience well just give you a little breathin space ms blake if you arent alive when we get back well its been nice meetin ya i cant say the same titus i said well now that is the gods honest truth goodbye ms blake rot in hell bitch was aikensens parting shot youll remember me every time you look in a mirror aikensen his hand went to his nose even that touch hurt he scowled at me but its hard to look tough with kleenex sticking out of your nose i hope you die slow same to you i said kaspar please richard said dont do this ill change for you ill let you hunt me just get anita out of there the men stopped and looked at him dont help me richard ill give you the best hunt youve ever had he was pressed against the bars hands wrapped around them you know i can do it kaspar tell them kaspar looked at him for a long moment he shook his head i think youd kill them all id promise not to richard what are you saying he ignored me please kaspar you must love her a great deal richard just stared at him no matter what you do richard theyre not going to let me go he wasnt listening to me richard im sorry kaspar said i trust you richard but your beast i think your beast isnt so trustworthy come on were wasting time garroway doesnt know where to look but he might come up here lets give em some privacy titus said they all trooped out after the chubby sheriff kaspar was last up the stairs i wish it were gabriel and raina in the cages i am sorry about that the swan man disappeared into the rock tunnel kaspar dont leave us like this kaspar richards yells echoed in the cavern but nothing answered the echoes we were alone scuffling sounds made me whirl jason was on his knees again something moved behind his pale blue eyes something monstrous and not friendly at all i wasnt half as alone as i wanted to be jason took one crawling step towards me and stopped no no no each word was a low moan his head fell forward his yellow hair swept forward not long enough to touch the ground but thick he was wearing an oversize blue dress shirt and jeans clothes you wouldnt mind ruining if you happened to shapeshift in them anita richard said i moved so i could see the other cage without losing sight of jason richard was reaching through the bars one hand stretching out towards me as if he could bridge the space and somehow drag me to him edward crawled to the door and began running hands over the lock he couldnt really see the lock from inside the cage he pressed his cheek to the bars and closed his eyes when you cant use your eyes they become a distraction he leaned back and drew a slender leather case from his pocket he unzipped it to reveal tiny tools from this distance i couldnt really see them clearly but i knew what they were edward was going to pick the lock we could be out in the woods before they knew we were missing the night was looking up edward settled back against the bars one arm on either side of the lock a pick in each hand his eyes were closed his face blank all concentration to his hands jason made a small sound low in his chest he crawled towards me two slow dragging steps his head flung upward his eyes were still the innocent blue of spring skies but there was nobody home now he looked at me as though he could see inside my body watch my heart thudding in my chest smell the blood in my veins it was not a human look jason richard said hold on well be free in a few minutes just hold on jason didnt react i dont think he heard i thought the few minutes was being overly optimistic but hey i was willing to believe it if jason would jason crawled towards me i plastered my back against the cage bars edward how are you coming with that lock these are not the tools i would have chosen for this particular lock but ill get it there was something in the way jason crawled towards me as if he had muscles in places that he shouldnt have make it soon edward he didnt answer me i didnt have to look to know that he was working at the lock i had every faith that hed unlock the door i backed down the bars trying to keep an even distance between me and the werewolf edward would get the door open but would it be in time that was the question a sound at the entrance caused me to glance back carmichael stepped into the cavern he had the mm in his hand he smiled it was the happiest id seen him edward ignored him working at the lock as if an armed man hadnt stepped into the room carmichael raised the gun and pointed it at edward get away from the lock now he cocked the hammer back not necessary but always dramatic we dont need you alive stop working on the lock he stepped closer with each word edward looked up at him his face was still blank as if his concentration were still in his hands not quite focused on the gun being pointed at him throw the tools away from you right now edward stared at him his expression never changed but he tossed the two small tools away take the complete kit out of your pocket and toss it out of the cage dont even try to say you dont have one if youve got those two pieces youve got the rest i wondered what carmichael did in the real world something not nice something where he knew what tools would be in a professional lockpicking kit i wont warn you again carmichael said throw it out or i pull the trigger i am tired of screwing with this mess edward threw out the slim leather pouch it made a small slapping sound on the rock carmichael made no move to pick up the lock picks they were out of our reach that was what counted he walked backwards keeping us all in sight he directed some of his attention to jason and me oh joy our little werewolfs awake i was hoping he would be a low ragged growl crawled up jasons throat carmichael gave a delighted bark of laughter i wanted to see him change good thing i checked back in im thrilled that youre here i said he came to stand just out of reach of our cage bars he was staring at jason ive never seen one of them change let me out and well watch him together now why would i do that i paid to see the whole show his eyes were sparkling with anticipation bright and shiny as a kid on christmas morning shit a growl brought my attention completely back to jason he was crouched on the rock floor hands and legs bunched under him watching that growl trickle from between his human lips raised the hair on the back of my neck he wasnt looking at me i think hes growling at you carmichael but im not in the cage he said he had a point jason dont get angry at him richard said anger will feed the beast you cant afford to get angry richards voice was amazingly calm even soothing he was trying to talk jason down or out or in or whatever word you used for keeping a werewolf from shifting no carmichael said get angry wolf im going to cut your head off and mount it on my wall hell revert back to human form after hes dead i said i know carmichael said jesus police find you with a human head in your possession they may get a little suspicious ive got a lot of trophies that i wouldnt want the police to find he said what do you do in the real world this is as real as it gets i shook my head it was hard to argue with him but i wanted to jason crawled towards the bars in a sort of monkey crouch it wasnt as graceful but it had an energy to it as if he were about to launch himself into the air as if when he jumped he could fly calm jason easy richard said come on boy try it rush the bars and ill pull the trigger i watched him bunch every muscle and launch himself at the bars he clung to the bars hands clawing between them arms stretched as far as they would go he wedged a shoulder between the bars as if hed slip through for one moment carmichael looked uncertain then he laughed shoot me jason said his voice was more growl than words shoot me i dont think so carmichael said jason gripped the bars with his hands and slid down to his knees forehead pressed to the bars his breathing was fast panting as if hed run a mile in a minute flat if hed been human hed have hyperventilated and passed out his head turned slowly towards me painfully slow as if he didnt want to do it hed tried to force carmichael to shoot him risked being killed to keep from turning on me he didnt know me well enough to risk his life it got him a lot of points in my book he looked at me and his face was naked raw with need not sex not hunger both neither i didnt understand the look in his eyes and didnt want to he scrambled towards me i backed away almost running backwards dont run richard called it excites him staring into jasons alien expression it took everything i had to stand still my hands gripped the bars behind me hard enough to hurt but i stopped running running was bad jason stopped when i did he crouched just out of reach he put one hand on the ground and crawled towards me it was slow as if he didnt want to but he kept coming any more bright ideas i asked dont run dont struggle its exciting try to be calm try not to be afraid fear is very exciting speaking from personal experience i asked yes he said i wanted to turn see his face but i couldnt i had eyes only for the werewolf that was crawling towards me the werewolf in the other cage could take care of himself jason knelt on all fours by my legs like a dog awaiting a command he raised his head and looked at me a spot of pale green color spilled into his eyes the blue of his irises drowned in a swirl of new color when it was done his eyes were the color of new spring grass pale pale green and not human at all i gasped i couldnt help it he moved closer sniffing the air around me his fingertips brushed my leg i jerked he let out a long sigh and rubbed his cheek against my leg hed done more than this at the lunatic cafe but his eyes had still been mostly human and i had been armed id have given nearly anything for a gun right now jason grabbed the hem of my coat balling his hands into fists tugging at the cloth he was going to pull me to the ground no way i shrugged the coat off my shoulders jason pulled it off me i stepped out of the circle of cloth he bundled the coat to his face with both arms he rolled on the ground with it pressed to his body like a dog with a piece of carrion wallowing in the scent he came to his knees he stalked towards me moving with a liquid grace that was unnerving as hell human beings did not crawl gracefully i backed up slowly no running but i didnt want him to touch me again he moved faster each movement precise pale green eyes locked on me as if i were all that existed in the world i started backing up faster he moved with me dont run anita please richard said my back thunked into the corner of the cage i gave a little yelp jason covered the distance between us in two smooth movements his hands touched my legs i swallowed a scream my pulse was threatening to choke me anita control your fear calm think calm you think fucking calm my voice sounded strident panicked jason had his fingertips hooked in my belt he pressed his body into my legs pinning me to the bars i made a small gasp and hated it if this was going to be it then dammit i wasnt going to go out whimpering i listened to my heart pounding in my ears and took slow even breaths i stared into those spring green eyes and relearned how to breathe jason pressed his cheek against my hip hands sliding around my waist my heart gave a little pittypat and i swallowed it i concentrated on my own heart until my pulse slowed it was the kind of concentration that let you do that new throw in judo the concentration that fed a zombie raising when jason lifted his head and looked at me again i gave him calm eyes i felt my face blank neutral calm i wasnt sure how long it would last but it was the best i could do his fingers slid under my sweater up my back i swallowed and my heartbeat sped up i tried to slow it down tried to concentrate but his hands slid around my waist over my skin his fingers traced my ribs moving upward i grabbed his wrists stopping his hands short of my breasts as he rose my hands stayed on his arms standing with his hands still under my sweater raised the cloth baring my stomach jason seemed to like the sight of bare skin he knelt again letting me keep hold of his arms i felt his breath almost burning warm on my bare stomach his tongue flicked out a quick touch to one side of my belly button his lips brushed my skin soft caressing i felt him take a deep shaking breath he pressed his face into the soft flesh of my belly his tongue lapped my stomach mouth pressing hard his teeth grazed my waist it made me squirm and not with pain his hands balled into fists under my sweater hands convulsing i didnt really want to let go of his wrists but i wanted him away from me is he going to eat me or fuck you carmichael added id almost forgotten him careless forgetting the man with the gun maybe it was the realization that he wasnt a danger to me the danger was kneeling at my feet jasons only been one of us for a few months if he can channel the energy into sex instead of violence id take it id try to keep him away from killing zones whats that supposed to mean keep him away from your throat and your stomach i stared down at jason he looked up at me rolling his eyes there was a darkness in those pale eyes a darkness deep enough to drown in i drew jasons hands out from under my sweater he slid his hands into mine fingers interlocking he nuzzled my stomach trying to bury his face where the sweater had slid over my skin i raised him up with our hands still locked together he raised our hands upward pressing my arms backwards against the bars i fought the urge to struggle to jerk away struggling was exciting and that was a bad thing we were almost the same height his eyes were too startling from an inch away his lips parted and i caught a glimpse of fangs jesus he rubbed his cheek along mine his lips moved down my jawline i turned my head trying to keep him away from the big pulse in my neck he came up for air and brushed his mouth against mine he pressed his body against mine hard enough that i knew he was glad to be there or at least his body was he buried his face in my hair and stood there pressed against me our hands on the bars of the cage i could feel the pulse in his neck thudding against the bone of my jaw his breathing was too fast his chest rising and falling as if he were doing a lot more than foreplay was i about to move from foreplay to appetizer power prickled along my skin but it wasnt jason id tasted this particular power before was the show exciting richard would watching me die like this be a thrill like the woman on the film shes mine jason it was richards voice but with a bass undertone the change was coming jason whimpered it was the only word for it richards power rode the air like distant thunder drawing close get off her jason now that last word lunged out in something close to a scream but it was the kind of scream that cougars gave no fear but warning i felt jason shake his head against my hair his hands convulsed against mine the strength of it made me gasp it was the wrong thing to do he let go of my hands so suddenly i would have stumbled but the line of his body kept me upright he jerked away from me and i did stumble he grabbed me around the thighs and lifted me into the air too fast for me to stop even if i could have he smacked me back against the bars i took most of the blow on my back bruised but alive he supported me with one arm and shoved my sweater upward with the other i shoved the sweater back down he made a sound low in his throat and slammed me into the floor hitting the rock took all the fight out of me for just a minute he ripped the sweater as if it were paper spreading it away from my stomach he threw his head skyward and screamed but the mouth he opened wasnt human anymore if id had enough air id have screamed jason no the voice wasnt human anymore richards power flooded the cage thick enough to choke on jason struggled almost as if the power were thicker than air he swiped at nothing that i could see with hands that had claws for fingers back off the words were a snarl barely recognizable jason snarled back teeth snapping the air but not at me he rolled off me crawling along the rock growling i just lay there on my back afraid to move afraid that any movement would tip the balance and make him finish what hed started shit carmichael said ill be right back folks and the birdman better think of something to make one of you change he marched off leaving us to a silence that was replaced with a low steady growl i realized that it wasnt jason anymore i rose up slowly on my elbows jason didnt try to eat me richard was still standing by the bars of his cage but his face had lengthened he had a muzzle his thick brown hair was longer the hair seemed to have flowed down his back as if attached to the spine he was holding onto his humanity with a string a weak shiny string edward was standing very still near the door he hadnt tried to run when richard went all spooky edward always did have nerves of steel titus was the first one through the door i am mighty disappointed in you all carmichael here tells me you almost had it and this one interfered kaspar stared at richard as if hed never seen him before maybe hed never seen halfhuman halfwolf before but something about the way he was staring said that wasnt it marcus couldnt have done what you did jason didnt want to hurt her richard said he wanted to do the right thing well birdman carmichael said what next i stayed sitting on the rock floor jason was huddled against the far wall on his hands and knees rocking back and forth back and forth a low moaning sound crawled out of his throat hes near the edge kaspar said blood will push him over not even an alpha can hold him in the presence of fresh blood i did not like the sound of that ms blake could you come over to the bars please i moved so i could keep an eye on the moaning werewolf and the armed camp outside why either do it or carmichael will shoot you dont make me start counting again ms blake i dont think i want to come over to the bars titus took out his and walked over to the other cage edward was sitting down he looked at me across the room and i knew that if we ever got out they were all dead richard was still standing at the bars hands wrapped around them titus stared up at richards animalistic face and gave a low whistle good lord he pointed the gun at richards chest these are silver bullets ms blake if you called garroway we dont have time for two hunts anyway garroway doesnt know youre here so we have a little time but we dont have all night besides i think the wolfman here might be too dangerous so if you keep pissing me off ill kill him i met richards new eyes theyre going to kill us anyway dont do it he said his voice was still a growl that was such a deep bass that it crawled down my spine they were going to kill us but i couldnt stand there and watch not if i could prolong the inevitable i walked to the bars nearest them now what titus stayed with the gun pointed at richard put your arms through the bars please i wanted to say no but wed already established that i wasnt willing to watch richard die just yet it made saying no sort of hollow i slipped my arms through the bars which put my back to the werewolf not good grab her wrists gentlemen i balled my hands into fists but didnt pull back i was going to do this right carmichael grabbed my left wrist the bearded fienstien took my right fienstien wasnt holding on very hard i could have pulled away but carmichaels hand was like warm steel i stared into his eyes and found no pity there fienstien was getting squeamish grey hair with his rifle was in the middle of the room distancing himself from it carmichael was here for the whole ride titus came over and started unwrapping the bandage on my arm i fought the urge to ask what he was doing i had an idea i hoped i was wrong how many stitches did you get ms blake i wasnt wrong i dont know i stopped counting at twenty he let the bandages fall to the ground he got out my own knife and held it up where it would catch the light nothing like a little showmanship i pressed my forehead to the cage bars and took a deep breath im going to reopen some of this wound cut out your stitches i figured that out i said no struggles get on with it aikensen came over let me do it i owe her a little blood titus looked at me almost as if asking permission i gave him my best blank look he handed the knife to aikensen aikensen held the point just over the first stitch near my wrist i felt my eyes widen i didnt know what to do looking seemed a bad idea not looking seemed worse begging them not to do it seemed futile and humiliating some nights there are no good choices he cut the first stitch i felt it snap but surprisingly it didnt really hurt all that much i looked away the stitches went snip snip snip i could do this we need blood carmichael said i looked back in time to see aikensen put the point of the knife against the wound he was going to reopen the wound slowly that was going to hurt i caught a glimpse of edward in his cage he was standing now looking at me he was trying to tell me something his eyes slid right grey hair had walked away from the show he was standing close to the other cage evidently he could shoot you but he didnt like torture edward looked at me i thought i knew what he wanted i hoped so the knife bit into my skin i gasped the pain was sharp and immediate like all shallow wounds but this one was going to last a long time blood flowed in a heavy line down my skin aikensen pulled the point down a fraction of an inch i pulled suddenly on my arms fienstien lost his grip he grabbed for my flaying arm carmichael tightened his grip i couldnt get free but i could drop to the floor and make my arm move too much to use a knife on it i started to scream and fight in earnest if edward needed a diversion i could give him one one woman in a cage and the three of you cant handle her titus waddled up he grabbed my left arm while carmichael had my wrist my right hand was back in the cage with me fienstien was sort of hovering near the cage not sure what to do if you were going to pay money to hunt monsters you should be better at violence than this his holster was close to the bars i screamed over and over jerking at my left arm titus held my arm under his pinned next to his body carmichaels grip on my wrist was bruising they had me at last aikensen put the knife to the wound and started to cut fienstien bent down as if to help i screamed and leaned into the bars i didnt draw his gun i grabbed the trigger and pushed it into his body the shot took him in the stomach he fell backwards a second shot echoed in the cavern carmichaels head exploded all over titus his smokey bear hat was covered in blood and brains edward was standing with the rifle to his shoulder grey hair was slumped against the cage bars his neck was at an odd angle richard knelt by the body had he killed him there was a sound behind me a low guttural cry titus had his gun out he still had my arm pinned fienstien was rolling around on the ground his gun was out of reach there was a low growl coming from behind me i heard movement jason was coming back to play great titus jerked my arm forward nearly wrenching it out of the socket he shoved his against my cheek the barrel was cold put down the rifle or i pull this trigger my face was pressed into the bars and the gun i couldnt look behind me but i could hear something crawling closer is he changing not yet richard said edward still had the rifle up sighted on titus aikensen seemed frozen standing there with the bloody knife put it down blondie right now or shes dead edward anita he said his voice sounded like it always did we both knew he could drop titus but if the mans finger twitched while he died i died too choices do it i said he pulled the trigger titus jerked back against the bars blood splattered over my face a glob of something thicker than blood slid down my cheek i breathed in shallow gasps titus slumped along the bars gun still gripped in his hands open her cage edward said something touched my leg i jerked and whirled jason grabbed my bleeding arm the strength was incredible he could have crushed my wrist he lowered his face to the wound and lapped at the blood like a cat with cream open her door now or youre dead too aikensen just stood there jason licked my arm his tongue caressed the wound it hurt but i swallowed the gasp no sounds no struggles hed done damn good not to jump me while i fought the men outside but a werewolfs patience isnt endless now edward said aikensen jumped then went for the door he dropped my knife by the door and fumbled at the lock jason bit into my arm just a little i did gasp i couldnt help it richard screamed wordless and thundering jason jerked away from me run he said he buried his face in a puddle of blood on the floor lapping at it his voice was strangled more growl than word run aikensen opened the door i crabwalked backwards jason threw his head skyward and shrieked run i got to my feet and ran aikensen slammed the door shut behind me jason was writhing on the floor he fell to the ground in convulsions foam ran from his mouth his hands spasmed reaching for nothing that i could see id seen people shift before but never this violently it looked like a bad grand mal seizure or someone dying of strychnine the wolf burst out of his skin in a nearly finished product like a cicada pulling out of its old skin the wolfman raced for the bars claws grabbed for us we both backed up foam fell from the wolf jaws teeth snapped the air and i knew that hed kill me and eat me afterwards it was what he did what he was aikensen was staring at the werewolf i knelt and picked up the dropped knife aikensen he turned to me still startled and pale did you enjoy shooting deputy holmes in the chest he frowned at me i let you go i did what he asked i stepped up close to him remember what i told you would happen if you hurt williams he looked at me i remember good i drove the knife upward into his groin i shoved it hilt deep blood poured over my hand he stared at me eyes going glassy a promise is a promise i said he fell and i let his own weight pull the knife up through his abdomen his eyes closed and i pulled the knife out i wiped the knife on his jacket and took the keys from his limp hand edward had the rifle slung over his shoulder by the strap richard was watching me as if hed never seen me before even with his oddshaped face and amber eyes i could tell he disapproved i unlocked their door edward walked out richard followed but he was staring at me you didnt have to kill him he said the words were richards even if the voice wasnt edward and i stood there looking at the alpha werewolf yes i did we kill because we have to not for pleasure and not for pride richard said maybe you do i said but the rest of the pack the rest of the shifters arent so particular the police may be on their way edward said you dont want to be here richard glanced at the ravening beast in the other cage give me the keys ill take jason out through the tunnel i can smell the outside i handed him the keys his fingertips brushed my hand his hand convulsed around the keys i cant last much longer go i looked into those strange amber eyes edward touched my arm weve got to go i heard sirens they must have heard the gunshots be careful i said i will be i let edward pull me up the stairs richard fell to the ground face hidden in his hands his face came up and the bones were longer they flowed out of his face as if it were clay i tripped on the stairs only edwards hand kept me from falling i turned around and we ran up the stairs when i glanced back richard wasnt in sight edward dropped the rifle on the stairs the door burst open and the police came through the door it was only then that i realized kaspar was gone neither edward nor i had to go to jail even though the cops found the people we killed everyone pretty much thought it was a miracle that we had gotten away with our lives people were impressed edward surprised me by showing id for a ted forrester bounty hunter slaughter of a bunch of illegal lycanthrope hunters enhanced the reputation of all bounty hunters ted forresters in particular i got a lot of good press out of it too bert was pleased i asked edward if forrester was his real last name he just smiled dolph was released in time for christmas zerbrowski had to stay longer i bought them both a case of silver bullets it was only money besides i never wanted to watch one of them drip their life away through tubes i made one last visit to the lunatic cafe marcus told me that alfred had killed the girl all on his own gabriel hadnt known it was going to happen but once she was dead waste not want not lycanthropes are nothing if not practical raina had distributed the film for the same reason i didnt really believe them awful damn convenient to blame a dead man but i didnt tell edward i did tell gabriel and raina that if any other snuff films surfaced they could kiss their furry asses goodbye id sic edward on them though i didnt tell them that i got richard a gold cross and made him promise to wear it he got me a stuffed toy penguin that played winter wonderland a bag of blackandwhite gummy penguins and a small velvet box like one for a ring i thought i would swallow my heart there was no ring in it just a note that said promises to keep jeanclaude got me a glass sculpture of penguins on an ice floe its beautiful and expensive id have liked it better if richard had gotten it what do you get the master of the city for christmas a pint of blood i settled for an antique cameo itd look great at the neck of one of his lacy shirts sometime in february a box arrived from edward it was a swan skin the note read i found a witch to lift his curse i lifted the feathered skin from the box and a second note fluttered to the ground this one said marcus paid me i should have known hed find a way to make a profit from a kill hed have made for free richard doesnt understand why i killed aikensen ive tried to explain but saying i killed a man because i said id do it does sound like pride but it wasnt pride it was for williams who would never finish his doctorate or see his owls again for holmes who never got to be the first female chief of police for all the people he killed who never got a second chance if they couldnt have one neither could he i havent lost any sleep over killing aikensen maybe that should bother me more than the killingthe fact that it doesnt bother me at all naw i had the swan skin mounted in a tasteful frame behind glass i hung it in the living room it matched the couch richard doesnt like it i like it just fine
