john lescroart treasure hunt the second book in the wyatt hunt series to kathryn detzer andy jalakas and again always to lisa m sawyer it is one thing that business between men and women and there are many other more important things including food alexander mccall smith the day he found the body mickey dade woke up under a tree on mount tamalpais sleeping outside a few nights a week had been going on as a regular thing with him for about four months now he always kept a sleeping bag in his used camaros trunk anyway and starting around midmay when the weather got nice everywhere but in san francisco proper hed finish work and leave town in whatever direction struck his fancy even in the urbanized overcrowded bay area there were innumerable places a guy could simply pull over park and crash on the ground under cover of trees or bushes or in the hollow of a sand dune in one of the city or county or even national parks at the beaches off back roads even in the quiet neighborhood watch suburbs monday the past week while it was still light out hed driven down to woodside an exclusive semirural enclave nestled into the foothills behind palo alto and slept out under an old stone bridge over a dry creek bed two days later hed parked a couple hundred feet down an unnamed littleused dirt track cut into the woods behind burlingame around crystal springs reservoir last night hed gone north into marin county got halfway up mount tamalpais and pulled under an old lowhanging scrub oak in a forgotten and unpaved parking lot he always woke up at first light so this morning he was on the golden gate bridge by the time the sun cleared the hills behind oakland he had his ipod coming through his speakers it was midseptember and as usual this time of year the coastal fog was taking a break the morning clarity under the cloudless sky was startling mickey could easily make out the tiny dots of the farallons twentysome miles away over the deceptively still pacific he exited the bridge and soon found himself on marina cruising through the streets the closely set wellmaintained beautiful lowrise homes stirred some vestigial gene he must have picked up somewhere just driving through a neighborhood of real honesttogod standalone homes always filled him with something like contentment although it wasnt quite that it was more like hope that contentment and physical security were among lifes possibilities this was something mickey didnt have much personal experience with he couldnt remember ever having lived in anything but an apartment house although his parents had apparently rented a small bungalow in the sunset before their divorce his sister tamara said she vaguely remembered that house but she was two years older than he was mickey had been only two when his mom had taken them from their father and moved out but mickey didnt get time to enjoy the marina architecture this morning a crowd was clogging the street up by the palace of fine arts at this location he thought somebody was probably shooting a moviethe palace had been a setting in both vertigo and the rock among a host of other films people loved the old domed structure that had been constructed for the panamapacific exhibition back in with its classical columns and its reflecting lagoon the spot conjured both urban elegance and a hint of mystery so he pulled into the yacht club parking lot where he knew you could always get a spot at this time of the morning when mickey got out of his car he was surprised that the noises carrying from down by the palace seemed distinctly ominous and angry someone was giving harsh orders on a bullhorn he heard a fullthroated chorus of discontentmaybe actors and extras emoting but he didnt think so mostly it sounded like a fight from the outskirts of the crowd mickey could make out at least three distinct groups not including the vans from two of the local television stations the police at least twenty of them six of them mounted on horseback held a line near the shoreline of the lagoon the nonequestrian cops were turned out in hats and batsfull assault gear helmets with tinted face masks batons out a larger homogeneous and clearly hostile group of maybe fifty citizens milled around on the sloping banks of the lagoon as if waiting for instructions to charge the police line in front of them a tall bearded guy in camo gear was right up in the face of the lead cop with the bullhorn finally down by the waters edge a smaller group of perhaps twenty people in the uniforms of the citys parks and recreation department huddled fearfully by a small fleet of rowboats laden with what looked like netting of some kind the camo guy started a chant hell no dont let them go and in seconds the crowd was in full throat behind him pressing forward toward the police line the cops brought up their batons as the bullhorn exhorted the crowd to back away back away hell no dont let them go a whitehaired man in a bathrobe and tennis shoes with his arms crossed and wearing a bemused expression stood on a lawn across the street mickey sidled up next to him whats going on he asked the man shook his head idiots who all of em but whats it about the man looked over askance you dont know about the ducks where you been what about the ducks theyre moving em or trying to he shook his head again lunatics stupid idea bad planning insane timing but what else do you expect nowadays huh you really dont know about this moving the ducks down to foster city ahh so thats what this was mickey had read all about it over the past few months but hadnt realized that it was coming to a head so soon now the whole story came back to him the city had approved a million restoration for the palace and its grounds and part of that project included buttressing the remainder of the shoreline of the lagoon most of which was already bounded by a low rockandconcrete wall but the rest of the shoreline closest in toward the palace itself had become degraded over timein the past year alone a couple of kids had fallen in when the banks had collapsed under them it wasnt so much dangerous as it opened the city to possible litigation issues and so the supervisors had given the plan the green light and put up million to get the project started the rest would somehow be funded by private benefactors and lo it had come to pass but to do any of this work first the lagoon had to be drained enter the ducks and the san francisco palace duck coalition and a former berkeley tree sitter who for the present campaign had adopted the nom de guerre of eric canard mickey only now came to recognize the man in his camo gear usually he did photo ops in a full duck suit the palace ducks of course along with its swans herons seagulls and other birds called the lagoon home and if the lagoon were drained canard had argued to the board of supervisors they would become homeless temporarily but truly and in a city that prided itself on being a haven to the homeless this was simply unacceptable so the supervisors caving into widespread derision in the media and on the streethad set about finding a solution to the problem in spite of the fact that san francisco had several nice and completely serviceable ponds those ponds had their own populations of ducks whose environments canard argued would be compromised by the wholesale relocation of the palace ducks to their own home waters so eventually the decision was made to relocate the ducks to foster city a residential community with venicelike canals and few permanent resident ducks twenty miles south down the peninsula this would have been a workable though of course still wildly foolish idea except for one thing six months before foster city had encountered its own problem with its indigenous ground squirrel population these animals were burrowing in the citys levees and destroying them threatening homes with the very real possibility of imminent flooding in response to this crisis foster city had decided to poison the leveedwelling critters en masse this slaughter passed largely unnoticed in foster city itself but did not escape the keen eye of eric canard and when san francisco announced its intention to remove its palace ducks to foster city canard had gone ballistic surely if the ducks were sent to foster city the heartless bureaucrats there would not treasure and protect them these people had shown their true colors around the plight of defenseless animals and would obviously treat the ducks as they had treated their own squirrels if given half a chance and canard was not going to let that happen so hed sued and lost and had threatened to sue again which gave the city a window in which to make its move across the street the chant was wearing down but mickey could still hear a strong voiceundoubtedly canardyelling now at the lead cop so howd this start today mickey asked the old man i thought it was still in the courts no the brains down at city hall decided theyd just go ahead and round up the birds the whole thing is nuts and its all moot anyway they started draining the lake a couple of days ago before they were ready for the ducksin secret i might add and thats never a good ideaso word got out to canard and his people that something was happening down here and the whack jobs started gathering before sunrise this morning uhoh off in the distance the sound of sirens police reinforcements on the way another news van pulled in screeching to a stop the way this thing was developing mickey thought the story had a good chance to go national but mickey had to get home cleaned up and to work so he thanked the older man for his company said good bye and crossed the street about a half block north of the crowd turning right still hugging the shoreline he followed it around to where it veered away from the view of the crowd here the lower water level of the lagoon was much more obvious than it was up by the demonstration the clumpy roots of the cattails shone black with the gunky bottom mud in the morning light the lowhanging tree branches which normally kissed the waters surface now looked trimmed off a foot and a half or so above the waterline an asphalt pathway came down to the waters edge off the parking lot and mickey took it as the shortcut back to where hed parked but he hadnt gone more than a couple of steps when one of the tree roots sticking up from the brackish water stopped him in his tracks it was funny the way these things growing wild in nature could so closely resemble shapes youd expect to find in other species in animals even in people those roots emerging from the water could easily he thought be the hand of a man in fact it seemed so near a resemblance that he forced himself to step off the pathway and look closer he came right down now to the waters edge where from this vantage he could dimly make out six or eight inches under the water an alltoorecognizable shape as mickey stared in dawning belief suddenly the water seemed to move and a trail of bubbles rose out from underneath the submerged form turning it over and raising what was now clearly a body until its head broke the waters surface and the dead mans eyeless face stared up at him caught and silenced in midscream at ten minutes past noon mickey walked up the single flight of stairs that led from the grant street entrance in the heart of chinatown to the front door of his workplace a private investigations firm called the hunt club although the word firm was a bit of a misnomer especially lately six months before the business had been successfully humming along in pretty much the same circumstances it had enjoyed for the first six and a half years of its existence at that time the ownerwyatt huntdidnt seem to have too much trouble keeping himself and his twoandahalfperson staff busy most of the time working primarily for several of the citys wellheeled law firms mickeys sister tamara had held down the frontdesk duties and often did light field and interrogation work especially when women witnesses or children were involved a junior associatetamaras old boyfriend craig chiurcohad done the lions share of the legwork locating witnesses serving subpoenas accompanying clients to depositions and performing the other standard grunt work that made up the business mickey in addition to occasional subpoena service to the hunt club had mostly driven a cab for a living but was pretty much on call fulltime to supply transportation to wyatt or craig should they need it as they often did in a city where parking was always so problematic access to immediate transportation turned out to be a highly valued and oftused service wyatt hunt himself was the computer whiz and the basic brains behind the organization a natural born marketer hunt also pulled in the actual jobs that kept everyone busy until recently anyway when bad luck withering publicity over one huge failed case a faltering economy and possibly some questionable judgment had created a perfect storm that was threatening to shipwreck the enterprise tamara had simply walked away from her job and had fallen into a profound funk from which shed still not emerged and with the exception of piecemeal work with the law firm freeman farrell hardy roake where hunt had several close friends and one girlfriendthe business had all but evaporated mickey though had not only stayed on with hunt hed given up his more lucrative daily work in the cab business quit most of his cooking classes and taken over his sisters position at the front desk he did this because wyatt hunt was not just a good boss hunt had literally saved the lives of both mickey and tamara when theyd been children so mickey wasnt going to abandon hunt hed stick it out until the job dried up and blew away or until it resurrected itself either way mickey was on board for the duration he was still young just twentyseven his own plansto become a chef and open a worldclass restaurantcould wait since like most american men his age he was going to live forever mickey the dutiful had of course called from the marina three hours ago at the minute hed realized he was going to be late for work and had told the answering machine some of the story but hed of necessity left out a lot of it his discovery of the body had stolen the thunder from the demonstration as soon as hed run over and contacted one of the policemen on the scene the television vans and a good portion of the crowd had swarmed to the other end of the lagoon to see the corpse in the water now he let himself in to the hunt clubs two room office a chair scraped in the back and wyatt hunt appeared in the adjoining door on his right just beyond the receptionists desk tall and casually buffed hunt was dressed in slacks a blue shirt and darker blue tie his sport coat mickey knew would be hanging over his chair in his office in the back just in time hunt said for what tell me weve got some work ill play your silly game weve got some work mickey pumped a fist all right you going out i am where to lunch at le central mickey whistled le central was a whitetablecloth french restaurant down around the corner on bush street this potentially meant that wyatt had scored some deeppockets client who would be footing the bill whos the client mickey asked ah the client what client the one were talking about im afraid there is no client so wheres the work coming from what work the work you just said we had hunt leaned against mickeys desk and shrugged his shoulders actually truth be told we dont have any work but hey you told me to tell you we had some work so i played along in fact though im afraid we dont have any paying work he turned a palm up at this stage wed better be able to joke about it dont you think and the good news is that im really going to have lunch at le central and was waiting for you you eaten yet not today other days though i have hunt broke a grin good for you so i wont have to teach you how he looked around the small space with a wistful air as though he might not see it again lets lock up and get ourselves on the outside of some grub le central had a notice on its dailyupdated blackboard informing its patrons that its famous and delicious cassoulet had been cooking now for consecutive days in spite of that both wyatt and mickey agreed that it was too warm a day for the ribsticking beans duck sausage and lamb casserole and instead both ordered the poulet friteshalf a roasted chicken with fries as an afterthought wyatt also ordered a bottle of white wine by no means a common occurrence at lunchtime when mickey raised his eyebrows in surprise he said special occasion you mind not if you dont mind me falling asleep at the desk this afternoon mickey said but if youre okay with that ill force down a glass or two thats the spirit whats the special occasion well lets wait for the wine meanwhile tell me about this morning you actually discovered the body mickey launched into a truncated version of the days events the dead man according to identification in his wallet was dominic como a prominent civic activist whod gone missing about four days before even more startling and depressing from mickeys perspective was the fact that his grandfather jim parr had worked for como as his personal driver the dead man had been one of jims personal heroes so now if and when he went home tonight mickey would be sharing his onebedroom ninehundredsquarefoot walkup with a grieving grandfather and a train wreck of a sister the waiter appeared with their wine hunt tasted it pronounced it fine and then waited for their glasses to be filled before he lifted his heres to new beginnings new beginnings mickey repeated he hesitated his glass poised in front of his mouth why does that sound ominous hunt put down his untouched wine ive pretty much decided to close up the shop let you move on to your chefs career what about you ill be all right probably just hook up with one of the other outfits in town either that or get a real job someplace all these computer and marketing skills ive gotten good at ought to be worth something to somebody i figure maybe a startup but you dont want to do that well sometimes you dont get to do what you want you for example dont really want to be a receptionist and gofer thats not the same thing why not im a lot younger than you is one reason hunt almost chuckled fortyfive isnt exactly one foot in the grave mick people have been known to start over at that age goethe wrote faust when he was eighty so maybe theres still some hope for me thats not it its not just the age you love what you do i sure as hell dont love sitting around the office waiting for the phone to ring but when theres work granted its a good gig im not arguing i like it a lot when its working he lifted his hands an inch off the table but you know what its been like i dont see how its going to turn around so i thought id give you a few weeks noticeill keep you on the exorbitant payroll until i shut the doors for good but i thought you deserved to know as soon as i made up my mind and i pretty much have pretty much or definitely well pretty definitely unless something drastic happens and i also wanted to tell you how much ive appreciated what youve done for me over these past months but i cant ask you to hold on any longer when i dont really see any future in it mickey finally noticed his wineglass he picked it up and drank off a good swallow so whats the timeline well the lease for the office goes another two months from now and ive got to give a months notice so i guess its formal in about thirty days give or take unless something comes up to turn things around i wouldnt hold my breath mick i really dont see what could make a difference at this point something jangled near mickeys head and he swatted at the offending noise that had jarred him so violently from his afternoon sleep the phone hit the floor in front of his desk and the receiver bounced across the hardwood mickey jumped up out of his chair yelling coming sorry just a second he came around the desk grabbed the receiver and breathing heavily managed to say he was sorry again before he realized where he was and said hunt club mickey speaking a mans voice everything all right there yeah i just knocked the phone onto the floor how can i help you youre mickey you said yeah okay hold on a minute ive got somebody who wants to talk to you mickey waited then heard his grandfathers voice hey mick is that you jim yeah me whats up how you doin well a little fucked up where are you the shamrock are you okay good im good but im going to need a lift home here pretty soon mickey looked at his watch and let out a sigh jim its only four oclock im at work at least another hour i dont think mose would let me drink for another hour whos mose bartender here sgood guy slurring how about you just have water or something would he serve you water i dont drink water the things fish do in water you dont want to know maybe hed give me one more drink sounding like he was making the suggestion to someone in front of him maybe not though no back to mickey hes shaking his head hold on just a second here he is again tell him ill drink slow but the first mans voice came back on this is moses mcguire you know where the shamrock is maybe you want to get down here and pick up your old man i dont know if i want to let him out of here by himself in the condition hes in hes my grandfather mickey said whatever mcguire lowered his voice look if he wouldnt have remembered your number just now i would have had to call a cab but he said he didnt want to take a cab so i asked him howd he feel about the cops and i sure as hell dont want to do that meanwhile i got a business to run hes eightysixed here and you need to come down and get him right now how old is he i dont know exactly seventyfour i think somewhere in there thats too old for the drunk tank youve got to come get him swearing to himself by now completely awake mickey said all right put him on again would you and then after a short pause jim god damn it im going to call tam first you just wait maybe shell beat me there and can walk you home shes not home where is she i dont know she went out well ill try her anyway meanwhile you wait just sit there and have a club soda fish avoid club soda like the plague the bubbles make em fart twenty minutes later after doubleparking around the corner mickey pushed his way through the door of the little shamrock jims local hangout one of the oldest bars in the city founded in the little shamrock started out very narrow up by the front door a couple of large picture windows facing lincoln boulevard let in some natural light a bar with a dozen or so stools ran down the left side of the room and on the right in front an eclectic selection of memorabilia including an antique bicycle blackandwhite photos old election posters and a grandfather clock that had stopped during the great earthquake of hung on the wall halfway back the place opened up slightly to accommodate dart players and a jukebox and in the very back under the faux tiffany lamps the room took on the look of a dilapidated old living room with a couple of sagging couches facing a cluster of overstuffed easy chairs jim parr sat at the far end of the crowded bar with an empty glass in front of him maybe the bartender had coaxed him into something nonalcoholic after all jim was staring at the television set his cheeks were wet excusing his way through the press mickey got back next to him and put a hand on his grandfathers shoulder gathering him in a half hug he kissed him on the top of his cueball head hey jim leaned into him for a second then pulled away grabbed the bar napkin and wiped at his eyes howd you get here so fast i ignored the speed limit and im doubleparked you think you can walk course i could walk home if i needed to well luckily you dont need to you paid up here paid as i went only way to live so ive heard like a million times okay lets go the old man got his feet onto the floor and straightened up leaning into mickey the bartender saw what was happening and gave mickey an approving nod he mouthed a silent thankyou parr managed to keep upright as the two of them negotiated their way out of the bar and out onto the sidewalk it was still a clear warm day and the sun was in their eyes as they made their way to the car after mickey poured parr into the front seat he went around and got in this about dominic como he asked his grandfather head back against the seat with his eyes closed turned toward mickey and another tear broke i loved that guy he said mickey facilitated his parking around the city by the judicious use of a handicap placard that he kept in his glove compartment and that he could put onto his dashboard whenever he needed it his grandfather had given him this surprisingly valuable little blue item in theory only handicapped individuals had access to them and there was nothing handicapped about jim parr and there had been nothing handicapped about dominic como either for that matter but como nevertheless had always possessed a handicapped card for those special occasions when nothing else would do when parr had retired eight years ago como gave him one as a present como could get things that other people didnt seem to have access to it had been one of his talents and access to those things was one of the perks of parrs old job so parking wasnt its usual awful and automatic hassle today mickey pulled up into a spot by the emergency entrance to the uc medical center only a couple of blocks from their apartment by this time jim was snoring fifteen minutes later the old man was in his bed still dressed except for his shoes and with the covers pulled up around him mickey closed the bedroom door and sweating from having basically carried jim up to the second floor where they lived he took a dispirited glance around the cluttered living room tamaras murphy bed pulled down from the wall and unmade newspapers from several days scattered around coffee mugs on just about every flat surface he straightened up and when hed finished he opened the door to his own bedroom essentially a large closet with a window facing the wall of the apartment behind them here was his bed a boardandcinderblock bookcase a small dresserdesk combo unit a few prints on the walls but he didnt go into his room dead in his tracks he stopped in its doorway no wonder he fled from this place as often as he could this was no way to live the death of dominic como now confirmed as a murder led off the five oclock news the cause as mickey had suspected was not drowning but rather someone had hit him with a blunt object on the back of the head como had already been missing for four days by the time he was found partially submerged in the lagoon at the palace of fine arts by mickey sitting in front of his television came forward in mild shock as his own image appeared on the screen as part of the big story of the day he had talked to several reporters that morning at the scene of course but never really believed that theyd run with any of the footage of him since his own role in the larger story was at best only a footnote but there he was on tv describing how hed come upon the body he thought this was pretty cool in spite of how young he looked and how disheveled which he suddenly realized was what sleeping out under trees could do to you but when they identified mickey as an associate with the hunt club a private investigating firm it occurred to him that maybe his unshaven mug and sleptin clothing werent the best advertisements in the world that realization brought him up shortthe idea that he might actually be a liability of some kind for wyatts business maybe while he was cleaning up his apartment and his physical surroundings he thought it wouldnt be such a bad idea to work on his own hygiene and appearance but then his image left the screen and channel fours perky anchorwoman was going on with more about the crime and the victim because of his grandfathers longstanding job as comos driver mickey knew a lot about him but he hadnt ever really focused on the breadth of his charitable work now he learned that como had either founded or sat on the boards of no fewer than six major charities in san franciscothe sunset youth project of which he was executive director braceros unidos the mission street coalition the rainbow workshops the sanctuary house for battered women and halfway home the police investigation was continuing but so far there were no suspects cleanly shaven and showered in slacks a buttondown dress shirt under a mountain hardware jacket and tennis shoes mickey walked down to golden gate park then in another quarter mile or so found himself at the de young museum off to his right loomed one of his favorite recent additions to the citys landscape adjacent to the museum a strange looking tower thrust itself nine stories up into the nowdarkening sky the exterior of the tower looked to be made of metallic panelscopperinto which the builder had punched various imperfections from bumps to indentations to holes more unexpectedly especially upon the first viewing the tower twisted as it went up what started as a rectangle at the base shifted as it rose until at the top it was a gravitydefying parallelogram from the topan enclosed viewing platformmickey had been pleased to recognize that the bottom of the tower was aligned with the eastwest grid of the park while the tops orientation was turned to match the grid of the citys downtown streets inside now he stopped a minute to listen to the jazz quintet playing in the lobbya fridaynight traditionthen took the elevators up to the top no charge hed been up here no fewer than forty times and every time the place worked its magic on him the windows were huge both wide and tall and through them the entire city revealed itself beneath and all around him and since because of the towers twisting nature it wasnt really obvious that there actually was a physical building under him it always felt like he was floating the sun had just disappeared into the ocean and the purple western sky was now ablaze with gorgeous orangered clouds the golden gate bridge was right there just off to his right and back behind him the highrises of downtown had just started to twinkle with their evening lights but tonight he wasnt here for the views because of its parallelogram shape the floor came to a point on both the north and south ends mickey looked left and then made his way to the corner where as hed suspected and hoped his sisterin a cowlnecked sweatshirt and camo pantssat on the floor apparently mesmerized hugging her knees they just let you sit here all day he asked she looked up and shrugged im not bothering anybody mickey went down on one knee were you planning to come home sometime sure when eventually good just so i know not to rent out your space he paused oh and in case you were wondering jims all right now her head did turn toward him quickly in surprise why wouldnt he be no reason hes fine really i mean after i got him home he went out whered he go shamrock then to drinkabye land why did he do that maybe he wanted somebody to talk to maybe his roommate didnt tell him she was going out and he didnt want to be alone i dont have to tell him where im going or what im doing or you either absolutely correct i couldnt agree more youre an adult were all adults you dont tell us where you go most nights thats true i probably should do that i may start now or i might start staying at home again he changed his tone jims getting older you know her mouth turned down and your point is my point is hes getting too old to go out on his own and drink too much the bartender said he might have had to call the cops if he hadnt reached me lucky he did then mickey let out a long breath and stared out over his sisters head at the last vestiges of the sunset id have thought you might relate to how he was feeling about what about dominic como being dead she turned up and stared at him when did that happen recently and im supposed to relate to how jims feeling about that because because dominic was somebody hed spent years of his life with kind of like you and craig this was craig chiurco formerly of the hunt club at the mention of her former boyfriend she blinked a few times in rapid succession a tear fell from her left eye and she wiped it away some of the tension seemed to go out of her shoulders after another moment she turned her head to face him what do you want mick i dont know to tell you the truth maybe talk to you a little have you eaten yet today tamaras mouth softened almost into a smile food always food not always but often i figure it cant hurt probably not she sighed and no i havent eaten all day some cereal when i got up he gestured toward the city spread out below them had enough of this view for today i suppose so giving her shoulder a small friendly brotherly push he said lets go so how much how much what how much weight have you lost i dont know exactly maybe ten pounds more than that i think and you weigh yourself every day tam so you know exactly or pretty damn close dont scam a scammer how much okay she looked across the table at him say eighteen eighteen pounds in six months maybe twenty thats way too much especially since you started at basically perfect not perfect enough evidently she tried a smile but it didnt take i just dont have an appetite anymore mick i try but nothing tastes like anything the pot stickers here will knock you out she shrugged maybe well see its not like im trying not to eat its just i dont think of it well you need to mickey slurped at his cup of very hot tea i dont like to see you getting this thin tam it reminds me of mom tamaras teacup stopped halfway to her mouth im not like mom mom was on drugs she overdosed yeah but before that she didnt eat well either and now seeing you you look a little like she did and it brings it back clear as a bell and that scares me mickey im not going to die yeah you are but id prefer if it wasnt like soon otherwise whats it all been for whats all what been for i mean you know wyatt saving us jim getting his life together to raise us she pushed her cup around on the table sometimes i think it wasnt for anything it was just stuff that happened and now were all here and so what jims probably going to die pretty soon wyatts going out of business everythings a dead end mickey put his own cup down craig was that important to you hes gone and now youve got nothing to live for she shook her head its not just him being gone it doesnt even seem like its so much him personally anymore its more the idea that i lived with this this illusion for all that time thinking i was going somewhere that he and i were going somewhere and that all of it mattered she leaned in across from him i mean mick it all made sense it hung together im talking about the world and now it doesnt i cant seem to find where my real life connects back in to it you think youre going to find it sitting up in the tower i dont know where im going to find it so youve given up looking thats kind of what it seems like from here well thats not it no anger flashed in her eyes no then in a softer tone i am really trying not to lose it altogether here mickey i dont think you can really understand what its like when the rugs pulled out from under you like it was from me yeah mickey said i can it got pulled out from both of us another time and that was a lot worse than you losing your boyfriend i remember it pretty well whats your point my point is youre too young to give up theres people out here in the real world who care about youme for instance and jim and even wyattand maybe you owe it to all of us to try to care a little back in return i do care about all of you guys you do how are we supposed to tell you quit working for wyatt you dump your job there on me you disappear on jim i didnt you did tam yes you did and we all felt bad for you and still do he reached a hand over the table and touched hers but youve got to come back now youve got to start anyway remember back before jim even took us on we swore wed always call each other on it if we started down a wrong road remember that yeah okay of course well this is your brother calling you you need to get out of this now start going another way jims going to need you these next weeks at least im going to need you for him maybe even wyatt will wind up needing you wyatt wont ever need me he never did and now hes mad at me hes never said one word about being mad at you if anything hes worried but not even slightly mad he blames himself is what i think for hiring craig in the first place for keeping him on for you guys getting together tamara looked up at the ceiling and seemed to be gathering herself she inhaled deeply and let the breath out in a long sigh the waitress appeared and placed a small dish in front of each of them then a plate of six pot stickers down between them kung pao shrimp coming right up next she said mickey picked a pot sticker up with his chopsticks and put it on the dish in front of his sister if you eat youll feel better he said promise saturdays mickey went to his cooking class at la cuisine located in a large victorian house on webster street between clay and sacramento he was already halfway through his sixweek professional series courseknives and butchering his eighth formal class in the past three years at his present rate he could expect to get his certified culinarian ticket the lowest professional ranking and possibly get hired to cut onions or sift flour for eight hours a day in only another two or three years but it was working toward something that he loved by the time he was thirty if everything worked out hed be working in a kitchen at forty hed have his own place maybe a small one but his own it was a timeline he could live with his class began at the stroke of eight oclock and if you were late you werent admitted no excuses tolerated even if youd paid your entire tuition up front even if you couldnt find a parking place your uncle died all of the above marc bollet the maître locked the front door at showtime sharp and didnt unlock it again for five hours you want the experience of working in a professional kitchen marc said more than once in his stillpronounced french accent you must learn never ever to be late never to be sick dont plan on too many days off or vacations la cuisine is not a career it is a vocation a sacred thing never be less than at your very best or you will find yourself without a job because there is always always someone who wants your chance now mickey a full twenty five minutes before class was to begin courtesy of the best parking spot hed ever found got to the stoop with his cup of starbucks and was somewhat surprised to see that even this early he wasnt the first of his classmates to arrive ian thorpe looked up with an easy crinkling blueeyed smile under a wispy blond mustache he wore chefs clogs a pair of stained khaki shorts and a blue fishermans sweater with white horizontal stripes hey he said i was hoping id catch you before class me you caught me whats up i saw you on the tube last night mickey broke a small smile me too he said but only four times after that it got boring they identified you as a private investigator i know but they didnt get that part exactly right i just work in the office more or less the grunt answer phones get the coffee like that damn what thorpe blew out his eyes scanned the street behind mickey for a moment nothing really i was hoping maybe well maybe you could talk to your bosses boss singular wyatt hunt the hunt club you need a private eye i dont know what i need to tell you the truth but somebody like your boss might be a good place to start i need somebody who knows something about the law and how it works and who isnt a cop and its not for me its my sister she worked for dominic como she did whatd she do she was his driver mickeys mouth all but hung open youre kidding me no why do you say that cause thats what my grandfather did for him too but just at this moment another pair of their classmates showed up at the corner maybe we can talk a little after class thorpe said you be up for that mickey shrugged sure he said why not after class back at the nearest starbucks mickey removed the plastic top from his cup blew over the coffee and took a sip so he said your sister thorpe nodded alicia younger three years shes twentyfive maybe i care about her so much because shes my only family actually mickey put down his cup ive got a sister whos pretty much my only family too except for a grandfather he didnt see any reason to include his boss wyatt hunt an adopted foster child himself who on his own time back when hed been working for the citys child protective services had tracked down jim parr and convinced him to meet with his allbutforgotten and abandoned grandchildren a meeting that had eventually led to jims job as dominic comos driver and then jims adoption of mickey and tamara less than a year later mickey went on anyway my dad disappeared for good when i was like two my mom overdosed when i was seven heroin heroin thorpe said i hate that shit and youre talking to one who knows he lifted his eyes his voice suddenly flat my dad shot my mother and then killed himself when i was twelve it wasnt much fun no doesnt sound like it mickey took a beat let out a short breath thats a worse story than mine or damn close and i dont hear them too often and now were both training to be chefs somebody should do a study orphans and chefs we want to cook for people cause there was nobody to cook for us good theory so you guys didnt have other family one aunt in texas an uncle in florida neither interested so howd you and your sister stay connected mickey asked alicia mostly not giving up we both bounced around a lot foster homes you know you too mickey shook his head we didnt have that my grandfatherthe one who drove for comoshowed up and took us in saved us no doubt maybe himself in the bargain well alicia and me we got split up and farmed out to different families i got into some bad behavior mixed with drugs and wound up at the youth work farm till i was seventeen alicia she moved in with three or four different families but she had some issues of her ownguys mostlyand none of the family units took but somehow she kept up on me where i was and finally talked me into the sunset youth project mickey nodded one of comos charities right actually the main one so anyway between that place and alicia keeping me honest i eventually straightened out got back into school and then even college a miracle really but now you say your sister needs a private eye around dominics death thorpe nodded she volunteered out at sunset and got pretty close to him in the last few months the cops came by and talked to her yesterday she got the impression that she was some kind of a suspect mickey sat with that for a moment at last he picked up his coffee and sipped at it how close was pretty close i dont know not for sure but what would you guess thorpe made a face then shrugged id say it wouldnt be impossible that they were having an affair though alicias always said shed never go out again with a married guy again i told you guys were always her problem shes kind of pretty and then of course having her father kill himself shes got a few issues of abandonment and selfesteem wants to prove shes attractive to men youd think after the first fifty the issue would kind of go away but in dominics case i didnt ask and she didnt say she did tell me though that she didnt kill him you asked he nodded directly i wanted to know what we were dealing with and you believe her absolutely she wouldnt ever lie to me im sure of that okay plus you should see her when it finally came out he was actually dead and not just missing after you found him in the lagoon i mean shes been crying fulltime ever since even with his limited experience of criminal matters mickey had learned that crying wasnt a guarantee of innocence or of much else wyatt hunt had told him that most people who kill someone close to them spend at least some time afterward crying about it for one reason or anothergenuine remorse for what theyd done or selfpity for the predicament in which theyd put themselves so what would you want a private investigator to do for you mickey asked im not sure to tell you the truth i only thought of the possibility of it when i saw you on the tube and they said thats what you were i know its not much of a connection you and me but i thought you might be cheaper than a lawyer that drew a quick laugh thats true enough most of the time we work for lawyers thats basically the gig so youre right wed be cheaper although were probably not going to be what she needs well i thought that at least you werent a cop out to get her i thought maybe you could find out the truth often not so easy but you should know that the cops arent going to be out to get her unless theres some evidence that points to her and then after that the truth might not be what you want to hear in spite of what shes told you or didnt tell you i realize that but i feel like i i mean we talked about it and both of us feel like we ought to do something we cant just sit and let the cops build a case around her especially since it was somebody else mickeys mouth broke into a smile so basically youd want us to find out who killed him or just eliminate alicia as a suspect well if shes really a suspect what you really need is a lawyer except thats a problem too why money thorpe came forward elbows on the table i mean weve got maybe a thousand or so between us but thats at the outside it would pretty much tap us both out mickey sat back and turned his cup slowly on the tabletop actually he said at last if thats all the money you have its good news in a way hows that you cant afford even the cheapest lawyer and no reputable investigator would even start this kind of openended job for that kind of money so you dont have to lose any of it and if somebodylawyer or investigatoroffers to take you on with that little as a retainer you know youre dealing with a shyster thorpes shoulders fell another goodnews moment mickey continued if alicia does get charged the court will appoint a lawyer for her for free you know that right but thorpe shook his head her getting charged wouldnt be good news no matter what i spent some time in custody when i was younger i think real jail might actually kill her we cant let it get to that she didnt kill dominic i promise you mickey spread his hands in an apologetic gesture in that case i doubt theyll get anywhere near an arrest but i dont suddenly he stopped as the germ of an idea occurred to him dominic como was a recent highprofile murder san franciscos large and generous philanthropic community and in fact many of the charities with which como had been actively involved could be expected to have a vested interest in apprehending his killer but in general precisely these very people had a deepseated mistrust if not actual hatred of police and law enforcement in general in this the most leftwing big city in the country better the murder of one of their own should go unsolved than that they should cooperate with the man police and probably the mayor herself would be seeking a speedy resolution to the como case and at least an arrest but a lot of the people who might know the most would be the least likely to talk to the cops what if mickey wondered the hunt club could act as the clearinghouse between the people with information the police who needed the information and the institutions that had the cash that would be willing to pay for the information what if he could pitch the idea of a peoples reward for information related to comos death this could in theory serve a host of purposes it might provide valuable tips for the police it would involve the wider community in the investigation it could of course most importantly motivate an otherwise reluctant witness to come forward on a more personal note the hunt club could stay open servicing the reward hotline if the reward was a significant dollar number many a lunatic would also be contacting the charities whod offered the money with spurious andor just plain stupid or wrong information the hunt club might be of real value managing the flow of information to the police forwarding any genuine leads and gatekeeping against reports from the nutcase front the process would save the cops perhaps hundreds of manhours of unnecessary work winnowing out the wheat from the chaff this was work the charities would want done but they would be illequipped to do it themselves and he and hunt could do it with their collective eyes closed mickey thought that there might be several prospective clients who could chip in to pay for the hunt clubs services finding them would be a bit of a treasure hunt but once mickey did that he might be able to give hunt a couple of months respite before being forced to go out of business the more he thought of it the surer mickey was that the money was out there he just had to find it and if they did the job right and met with success it might even help to restore the reputation of the hunt club within the legal community it could in fact be a new beginning for hunt and maybe even for tamara and mickey disposed to like ian thorpe because they shared such similar tastes and backgrounds might even be able to set his and his sisters minds to rest all of this came to mickey in a rush his eyes glazing over for those few seconds he went still as a stone until thorpe tapped the table in front of him mickey you all right he came back to himself with a small start a fleeting smile you know he said i cant really promise anything specific but i dont see how it could hurt to talk to your sister maybe give her a headsup on how the next couple of weeks might go if you think shed talk to me if i think shed talk to you are you kidding me ian thorpe already had his cell phone out was punching numbers alicia thorpe lived alone in the basement room of a gingerbread victorian on upper masonic and although by now it was close to two oclock in the afternoon as she opened the door to her separate entrance around the back it was clear that she hadnt really gotten herself moving for the day it didnt take a trained investigator to see that shed already spent some of the day crying but the lack of any makeup and a blotchy complexion couldnt disguise the basic truth of ians description of her she was at the very least kind of pretty and obviously braless under a san francisco zoo tshirt tucked into the slim waist of a pair of redstriped running shorts the day was warm the sky clear blue the air windless a table with four chairs and a cinzano umbrella graced the small brick patio area just outside her door and after the introductions the three of them gravitated there and sat down so mickey began no cops so far today no and how long did they talk to you yesterday about an hour there were two of them a man and a woman did you get their names she shook her head no but then said wait and suddenly jumped up heading back to the house she reemerged a few seconds later and handed mickey two business cards well this is pretty decent news he said with a smile of genuine surprise what i know these people theyre among the good ones devin juhle is probably my bosss best friend i dont see how that really helps alicia said it helps because theyll probably talk to us off the record they might be tempted to extend you a few courtesies which normally isnt a big part of the arrest procedure every little bit helps youll see i hope i dont see now her large eyes opened all the waywhite showing around startling green irisesand she reached a hand over and touched his arm for a second so you think theyre going to arrest me mickey backtracked no no no im just saying it could be an advantage that we know the inspectors thats all and that they know us it cant hurt mickey didnt know that this was true certainly if alicia was the bona fide prime suspect she had a good chance of finding herself in handcuffs the minute the homicide inspectors felt that they had a strong enough case to arrest her and regardless of any personal relationship between hunt and either of them they would move swiftly to put her into custody on the other hand hunt had been known to play devils advocate with devin juhle on other cases which more than once had prevented juhle from acting too quickly on his gut and arresting the wrong person in one of juhles most recent homicide cases though the people of the state of california v stuart gorman hunts girlfriend gina had crucified the inspector on the witness stand en route to getting her client acquitted and this had severely strained the relationship between juhle and hunt so the whole question of familiarity with the homicide pros was both nebulous and personal but mickey had seen times when it had worked to hunts advantage and hed like alicia to believe that this could be the case now maybe it cant hurt knowing these guys ian said but its kind of moot if alicias not going to be your client so lets not get her hopes up why cant i be your client alicia asked theres a money issue mickey began but ive been thinking that over and maybe its not insurmountable id have to talk to mr hunt and see what he says but i think i see a way to investigate this thing on your behalf which is what you both want and get paid enough to make it doable which is what we want how would you manage that ian asked mickey temporized since he wasnt yet exactly sure the first step is to hook up with some of the other charities dominic was involved in and see if any of them might want to chip in on a reward now he looked directly at alicia ian told me youd gotten closely involved with him in the past several months is that true she threw a quick glance at her brother then came back to mickey i was volunteering at the sunset youth project getting involved in the process i hope thats going to be my lifes work so you know these people the people dominic worked with some better than others but im familiar with most of them now yes so would you be willing to work with us if it turns out that this means we can help you out she hesitated for only an instant then met his eyes whatever it takes she said all right mickey said let me work out some of the details and run it by mr hunt see what he says again she put her hand on his arm thank you she said thank you so much her eyes had gone glassy perhaps a prelude to more tears i really didnt kill him she said i cared about him a lot okay he was a great man and maybe we were getting a little too close but i really didnt kill him im taking that as a given he said mickey was also tempted to ask her what she meant by a little too close but if she became a client thered be time for all of those questions he was far too aware he realized of how her hand felt resting on his arm so he patted that hand in a professional manner and pushed himself back from the table standing up he took a business card out of his wallet and handed one to her and one to her brother if the cops come again make me your one phone call and ill at least be able to put you in touch with a good lawyer meanwhile let me go see what i can do wyatt hunts home was a unique environment incongruously existing in its lightindustrial southofmarket hood less than three blocks away san franciscos hall of justicea sixstory bluegray slab of concrete that would have been at home in east berlin before the wall fellset the tone for the surrounding area the flat dirty perennially windswept streets werent so much rundown or dangerouslike the tenderloin district for exampleas simply depressing and often deserted especially now on a weekend each street sported an abandoned storefront or two some fast food usually a bail bondsmans office a chinese dentist or acupuncturist other businesses selling auto parts or advertising specialties or discount clothes in every block youd find a bar or more often a venue that rented itself out as a club catering to a different clientele every nightmonday a hiphop dance spot tuesday a lesbian pickup joint then salsa afterhours or karaoke on the japanese tour circuit vagrants and changelings and explorers and the lost among the substrata of humanity that existed in the margins and mostly at night in one of the worlds most glamorous and glittering cities in the midst of all this in a former flower warehouse wyatt hunt had created a kind of wonderland hunt had kept the original outer structure intact so the first thing that hit you if you entered by the door next to the garage entrance on the brannan street side was the sheer volume of the space under the corrugated iron roof perhaps twenty feet high that spanned the buildings nine thousand square feet once inside youd probably next notice either hunts mini cooper parked by the garage door or maybe it would be the nba regulation halfbasketball court hed picked up for a song from the warriors when you crossed the court you got to another playwork area filled with guitars and amps and desks with computers and then you got to a door in a wall that ran from one side of the enormous room to the other beyond that wall hunt had built his living areabedroom bathroom library den kitchenthree thousand square feet all white and pastel and modern modern modern lots of glass blocks in the wall to the alley out back and above them high windows for natural light the drywalled ceiling back here sloping down to fifteen feet or so now in natural light from the brannan street windows and the open garage door mickey was in a basketball game with hunt the sound of the bouncing ball and their grunts and the squeak of their shoes as they broke on the hardwood echoing off the noninsulated walls around them they were playing oneonone winners outs which gave hunt a tremendous advantage since he was the far better player and despite the age differential of over fifteen years in better physical shape than mickey winners outs meant that every time someone made a basket he got possession of the ball again at halfcourt early in the game mickey had scored four quick baskets at one point each rather than two but then hunt had stolen the ball on him and put up an obscene twenty baskets in a row mickey by now feeling like a rag dragged himself to center court just as hunt brought the ball in faked right and broke left a move that put mickey ignominiously on his ass hunt then dribbled three times and laid up his gamewinning twentyfirst point with a triumphant shout ha they were drinking lemonade recovering their breathmickey rather more so than huntsitting side by side on the stoop that led out from hunts kitchen to the alley behind his warehouse home twentyone to four mickey managed to say between breaths how pathetic is that we should have done losers outs you would have had the ball more great remind me next time if there ever is a next time which right now im kind of doubting mickey chugged some lemonade then rubbed the cold glass up against his forehead whyd i let you talk me into this i didnt come over here to get creamed in basketball yeah but you got here and there i was shooting hoops all alone talk about pathetic you took pity on me for which im grateful and in your debt and because of that you went easy on me is that it hunt chuckled perhaps not thats not really my style if im gonna play im gonna beat you i noticed congratulations mission accomplished hunt nodded in acknowledgment so in theory mickey added that means you still owe me right up to a point in theory hunt sipped his drink you getting at something not much except the reason i came by in the first place you want to try to guess which cops pulled the dominic como case hunt sipped at his lemonade wiped some sweat from his brow then wiped his hands on his tank top he looked up at the side of the graffititagged building across the alley okay since you ask it that way im deducing devins one of em and russos his partner you ought to do that stuff as a party trick you know that hunt shrugged off the compliment spread his palms elementary my dear dade but if i may ask you this is relevant to us because because we might be able to talk to them about como why do we want to do that mickey took a breath and launched into an explanation of his strategy about midway through which hunt stopped him wait a minute nice idea but the cops already have a unit to field reward calls i know that but the point is that we want the people who wont call the city who wont call the cops hunt said gently no offense mick but that dog just dont hunt and i mean that in the nicest possible way wed have to turn anything we get over to the cops anyway so somebody calls us first big deal eventually theyre talking to the police weve got no privilege we cant promise anonymity were just an extra phone call yeah but the trick is to get em to call in the first place then we ease em into the process which might not be too hard if its a lot of money and theyre not completely nuts maybe initially we dont ask for names we cant disclose what we dont know if it really looks like theyve got something we just explain that well have to give them up if theyre going to get the reward the whole point wyatt is to get information from people who wouldnt normally give up anything at all we can finesse the details later so in your dreams how much reward are we talking about i have no idea best case fifty maybe a hundred thou maybe more i dont know how many hours well charge but at least it would be work that could keep us solvent a while longer and how do we find these people who are going to offer a reward again wyatt cmon work with me here i go by and talk to em we create a groundswell movement among these people who are already so inclined como was large in half of these nonprofits either as a consultant or an actual board member or director he was the man these people are going to line up to help find his killer hunt got to his feet paced across the alley then turned around and leaned against the wall he took a sip from his glass has it occurred to you that the police might already be lined up to catch his killer too and wont appreciate our involvement well thats where juhle and russo come in we convince them of our value to their investigation assuming that devin and sarah are going to want to talk to me i am assuming that well sad to say thats not too likely going to happen either hunt pushed off from the wall behind him ive tried to keep a low profile around this but dev and i kind of stopped hanging out together after gina ate him on the stand on the gorman case yeah i remember but didnt he eventually get the collar on the real killer in that one because of you and gina he did well well i agree he should have been overcome with gratitude at how we burnished his flagging career but somehow he didnt see it that way he kind of thinks i set him up and gina screwed him and she did make him look bad at the trial no worse than bad incompetent and stupid and i helped her he shook his head so no is the answer no to pretty much anything ive asked him since but this is something new and it will save him time and effort maybe lots of both hes got to see that and if he doesnt russo will maybe hunt now back at the stoop lowered himself down again finished his lemonade in a long swig and placed the beaded glass on the cement between his legs ill think about it and i do appreciate you trying to keep us alive here mick but im not sure this is the way we need more than one case well maybe not we do good on one case people might start remembering we do good work in general what im just trying to do is get us back on the street get you back on the street instead of sitting in the office waiting for the phone to ring hunt let out a frustrated sigh not to be defensive mick but ive been doing a little more than that a lot more the way it usually works is your clients come to you and nobody seems hot to let us play so we make our own game we can bring these people in i know we can how do you know that mickey took a breath hesitating alicia thorpe was the other foci in the elliptical orbit they needed to enter and so far hed left her out of it entirely theres a woman who may already be a suspect who knew como and most of what he was working on she can put us in touch with the people we need to talk to hunt looked across at him shes a suspect she might be a suspect juhle and russo talked to her she got an alibi for when nobodys got a clue when como actually died so that answer would be no no alibi hunt said and otherwise we know shes not guilty because mickey let out a breath shes not guilty wyatt originally she wanted to hire us to find out who killed como she wouldnt have done that if she did it theres so many arguments against that one that i dont know where to start still hunt held up his hand again and sucked on his cheek for a minute she good looking enough to be affecting your judgment i hope not mickey turned to him met his eye nodded possibly but i dont think so for the record though i would marry her tomorrow if shed have me good to know and she was involved with como intimately dont know maybe but she didnt kill him again mickey hesitated lets say that i think we can choose to believe she didnt and not have it come back and bite us its a calculated risk and also pretty much the only game in town and meanwhile she can put us in touch with people who will pay you to be back in that game maybe thats shortterm but guess what tell me no you told me about ten minutes ago if youre in the game youre gonna win it or die or kill somebody trying hunt chuckled thats flattering mick it really is but that was basketball mickey dade shook his head truly amused that his boss didnt seem to realize this fundamental truth about himself dont kid yourself wyatt thats any game you get yourself into at six oclock that night mickey checked the coals in his weber kettle cooker and then came back into his purple kitchen he walked over and opened the refrigerator atypically loaded with food after leaving hunts hed gone down to the ferry building and though it was by then late in the day the various stores there still had a selection of foodstuffs that put to shame most of the other regular grocery stores in the city now he pulled out the paperwrapped leg of lamb he was going to butterfly and barbecue after smearing it with garlic rosemary salt pepper soy sauce and lemon juice he brought it over to his cutting board where hed piled up the ingredients you really didnt want to refrigerate if you didnt have to heirloom tomatoesgreen purple yellowbunches of thai basil thyme and rosemary two heads of garlic a lemon he opened a bottle of chianti and poured himself half a juice glass full grabbing his favorite six inch carbonsteel sabatier knife off the magnetic holder on the wall he honed it to a razors edge with his sharpening steel then whistling he pulled the leg of lamb toward him and started cutting five minutes later mickey laid the lamb out flat on the grill and covered it then back in the kitchen he took a saucepan down from its rung on the wall he put it on the stove over high heat throwing in half a stick of butter and some olive oil in another minute hed added chopped shallots garlic thyme and rosemary some allspice and three cups of the chicken stock that he made from scratch whenever he started to get low some things you simply couldnt cut corners on he stirred a minute more added a cup and a half of arborio rice and some orzo then turned the heat all the way down to the lowest simmer and covered the pan this was his own personal version of ricearoni the san francisco treat a simple pilaf but he liked his strategy of first making the kitchen so fragrant that it drew his roommates to the feast whether they were inclined to eat or not and sure enough here was jim following his nose through the doorway from the living room that smells edible should be mick said pouring wine into another juice glass and holding it out for him you ready yet for some hair of the dog that was one ugly fucking dog jim said taking the glass but salut he and mickey clicked their thick glasses and both sipped and then tamara appeared in the doorway im not really hungry but i might have a little of whatever that is we call that a side dish tam it goes with the other stuff thatll be ready in a half hour well i dont know if ill have much but ill sit with you guys mickey handed her a half glass of wine whatever he said tamara and jim sat on the green benches on either side of the table dipping the stillwarm sourdough bread into a small bowl of extra virgin olive oil the finished medium rare lamb rested under foil on the cutting board as mickey finished cutting the tomatoes for donnas famous salad named after an old girlfriend and early cooking influence which was going into his big wooden bowl and was composed only of tomatoes basil salt and balsamic vinegar no oil when the doorbell rang mickey turned away from the cutting board tam mickey said you want to get that she turned the knob and pulled the door open and just stood there wyatt hey tam i dont she inhaled then let out the breath i mick didnt tell you i was coming over no another long exhale he knew if id known i might have left why would you have done that because because i dont know i didnt want to face you you want hunt said i can go now no dont be stupid youre here i can just as easily be gone tam i dont want to cause you any pain he hesitated mickey should have told you he asked me no she said he was right not to hes trying to force me to change the way ive been lately hows that isnt it obvious look at me you look fine no i dont i look like death death should look so good she snapped at him dont bullshit me wyatt if youre going to patronize me then maybe you really ought to get out of here hunts gaze went hard and then what i mean between you and me thats just it even if it is what does it matter i hope you dont mean that he took a breath it matters because like it or not youre family and i dont have so much of it that i can afford to lose any of it i love you tam im always going to love you dont you know that looking down she shook her head sometimes i feel i dont know anything anymore i thought you hated me i could never hate you why would i hate you because i left she met his eyes im so so sorry i just couldnt handlea tear broke and trickled down her cheekany of it that was all right i understood it was fine hunt brushed the tear away with a finger you handled what you could and did what you had to do tam youve got nothing to be sorry about no then why do i feel like if id stayed on maybe things with the business wouldnt have gotten so bad that was nothing to do with you you in the office wouldnt have made any difference wouldnt have brought in any clients thats all on me and nobody else whats gone wrong is because of me and the decisions i made hunt stepped toward her whatever you want to do tam whenever you want to do it im with you im on your side really he said really and always she dropped her head and shook it one last time before bringing her gaze up to look at him as something seemed to break in her oh wyatt im so sorry im such a mess and then suddenly she was in his embrace her shoulders let go deep sobs racked her body and she held on to him with all of her might hunt brought his arms up tightly around her its all right he whispered her visible loss of weight had shocked hunt when shed first opened the door and now holding her he couldnt help but be aware of how fragile shed become he would let her cry it out gradually he brought a hand up to stroke her hair gently shh he comforted her after a time as the sobbing abated and she was starting to settle shh its okay its going to be okay while tamara went into the bathroom for a minute to get the swelling out of her eyes hunt came into the kitchen nodded a hello at mickey and slid in next to parr whats a man got to do to get a drink around here he asked parr nodded in commiseration he can be mighty light with a pour that grandson of mine i dont know where he could have picked up that bad habit mickey coming over with a fresh glass and the bottle of chianti said yeah well what jim heres not telling you is that hes still recovering from a few too many nonlight pours yesterday a rare anomaly for which ive already endured too much abuse from my offspring parr picked up the wine and filled wyatts glass then poured a little more into his own the two men clicked their glasses mr hunt its good to see you you too james you too hunt put his arm around parrs shoulders and drew him toward him you been keeping out of trouble hah mickey said i had a few drinks yesterday in mourning for my friend dominic como parr said and the boy here decided he had to come drive me home from the shamrock mickey turned from slicing the meat hes leaving out the part about the bartender calling me at work saying it was either going to be me or the cops that would never have happened well luckily we didnt have to find that out did we mickey popped a slice of lamb into his mouth and this is all the gratitude i get its a heartless world hunt said i guess i shouldnt have talked jim into taking in you and tam all those years ago you wouldnt have had all this aggravation he wouldnt have had all the aggravation parr said you want to talk aggravation try living with two teenagers for any given week much less the six or eight years it actually takes seven mickey said without missing a beat parr turned on him seven what seven years people are teenagers for seven years if you want to grant that teenagers are people at all and not an entirely different species and where do you get seven mickey held up fingers as he counted thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen seven parr turned to hunt the boy is such a literalist ive noticed hunt said astonishingly the warm weather was holding after the dinner and its attendant accolades for the chef mickey suggested they take his bottle of homemade limoncello up to the roof where there was a mellow dim light from a japanese lantern more room a better view and more comfortable chairs than the kitchen benches so the three males walked up the outdoor stairway and out onto the deck that got used on every single one of the nineteen days a year that the nights were pleasant everybody had helped bus the table but at her insistence tamara stayed down to wash the dishesshed be up soon so after they all got seated hunt checked behind him to make sure she was not coming up the stairs then leaned in over the round deck table is she seeing a doctor mickey shook his head no she wont do that why not how much has she lost at least twenty pounds though she says less at this parr coughed that much are you sure about that mickey nodded i asked her yesterday she said eighteen maybe more so im thinking probably twenty or twentyfive thats too much parr said i knew she was losing some weight but i should have seen it was that much its been gradual jim i didnt see it myself until i happened to notice yesterday after all the time ive been staying away so you dont have to beat yourself up over it but youre right wyatt its serious enough she says nothing tastes like anything well hunt said that lamb sure tasted like something and so did the pilaf and that salad have you been making food like that every night no good cause if she had that in front of her and didnt eat it well mickey said i havent been home here a lot the past few months he hunched his shoulders without me i think these guys live on macaroni and cheese and not much of that hey parr said i eat an egg every morning oh sorry mickey said then to hunt and jim here has a whopping large egg every single day which is why hes so fit relatively tam doesnt make a big deal of it parr said she just doesnt put food in her mouth or not much of it then again i should have noticed well hunt said weve all noticed now and then tamara was up there with them and everybody had their limoncello in front of them in matching little blue glasses and finally hunt got around to mickeys suggestion about como i checked after you left mick and youre right nobodys put up a reward yet are you working on that tamara asked not yet mickey replied hunt went on mickey got the idea that we could drum up some business go to some of these charities the good news is i called the pd hotline number this afternoon and theres nothing about como so so far at least the pd doesnt have anything special going on around his murder its just an answering machine saying theyll get back to you so the door may be open the bad news is that the door might not necessarily be open for us have you talked to juhle mickey asked hunt shook his head no i thought id hit him at home tomorrow i think his wife still might like me although connies got that loyalcopwife gene and i cant be positive but she and i have been through a lot together too so its a faint hope anyway ill find out soon enough parr cleared his throat whos juhle friend of mine hunt said also the homicide cop who pulled the case and why will you be talking to him about this reward i mean because if we do have any luck drumming up this business well have to coordinate anything we do with what theyre doing sometimes cops dont like to share maybe youve heard juhle might take some convincing that this could be helpful to him seeing the questioning look on parrs face he asked what it just seems a little cart before the horse is all i mean if theres no reward yet what are you bringing to the party wouldnt your position be a hell of a lot stronger if you had something tangible to offer thats a good call mickey conceded wait until we get some of these charities on board then talk to juhle you could do that parr said or just save yourselves a lot of time and go straight to len turner hunt spoke up whos he hes pretty much the man around nonprofits in the city in what way hunt asked ive never heard of him parr chuckled which is the way he likes it hes a lawyer pretty much at the top of the charity food chain he represents most of the big ones and also runs the mayors community outreach program back in the day he was dominics right hand and if anything hes got even more influence now you want something to happen around a reward hes the guy you want to talk to len turner got it hunt said and then you go get that bastard who killed dominic hunt threw a look across at mickey then over to parr thats not exactly it jim the main job would be fielding the calls we wouldnt really be investigating on our own parr leveled his gaze well you damn well should he swallowed against some strong emotion then looked again around the table its just that dominic saved this family he didnt have to give me my job nobody else would have not with my history i mean here i am two strikes down hell we all know but he believed i could straighten up and do the job every day and because of that i got to build a good life finally and let you kids have yours and then somebody goes and kills him thats just not right its not right his watery eyes shone they got to be caught thats all im saying that its personal and if youre going to be in this thing you might want to keep that in mind as you go about your business jims right tamara said we get close we ought to go after him we hunt said tamara nodded and thats the other thing while were on this im listening well i dont know if you want to hear this after ive been such a flake for so long but if youre out following up leads wyatt and mickeys out hunting up these people who are going to kick in more reward money whos going to be answering the phones and keeping the office going a silence hung for a long moment around the table between them until mickey said i guess sis that would be you which would be special hunt said if there actually was a reward and someone was paying us to administer it notice the judicious use of the word if len turner was listed in mickeys telephone book under san francisco city of as the director of the communities of opportunity at ninefifteen pm on this saturday night after theyd come down from the roof hunt called turners number on mickeys phone he intended to leave a message that hed like to make an appointment to meet with mr turner early next week he was somewhat surprised when mr turner answered the phone himself and dumbfounded when after hunt mentioned dominic como and his reward scenario the man suggested that if hunt were free he might consider coming by to discuss the idea more fully right now twenty minutes later the night guard at the semidarkened city hall let hunt in then directed him up the grand stairway where hed find mr turners office to the right on the second floor room this turned out to actually be a suite of rooms the first of which was furnished as a barebones windowless conference area with a large blond wooden table and sixteen chairs a back door out of this room led to a hallway with a couple more side rooms at the end of which was a heavy paneled dark wood door with a frosted glass window and a light on behind it hearing what sounded like a telephone conversation in progress hunt hesitated for a moment then knocked and heard a cultivated voice tell him to come in len turner sat behind a busy but apparently wellordered oldfashioned carvedfront desk he held up a finger indicating he was just finishing his phone call and hunt waited on the square maroon persian rug that he estimated at about twelve feet on a side the right wall was bookfilled from the floor to the tenfoot ceiling behind turner a couple of large windows afforded a postcard view of the opera house and the war memorial along the left wall decorated with dozens of framed photographs of the great and nongreat posing with leonard turner a couple of low filing cabinets made the rooms only concession to bureaucracy by a low table with four upholstered chairs there was also a halfsize brushedsteel refrigerator and a table with an espresso machine cups glasses and a selection of highend spirits turner here in his office at nearly ten oclock on a saturday night wore a light blue shirt and golden tie his saltandpepper hair complemented a frankly handsome face of regular features a strong jaw an aristocratic nose his voice speaking on the phone was businesslike and yet somehow soothing as he wound up the conversation now hanging up he raised the wattage of his smile as he stood and came around the desk extending his hand mr hunt sorry to keep you waiting len turner can i interest you in a good cup of espresso im having some or water tea a soft drink something stronger espresso would be good hunt said i was a little surprised to find you still working at this time of night turner nodded with a selfdeprecating air a man who loves what he does never works a day in his life thats a good way to look at it hunt said have a seat turner said and let me get this coffee going he put two demitasse cups under a doublespigot on the hightech machine and pressed a button in thirty seconds he placed one of the cups in front of hunt and took a seat with the other one across the table from him now he said holding his cup up in a toasting fashion his face suddenly sober to dominic hunt raised his own cup nodded and sipped a terrible thing turner said terrible did you know him well he was my closest friend im sorry to hear that turner lifted his shoulders so when you mentioned what you wanted to talk about naturally i thought it would be worthwhile to meet with you as soon as possible ive been racking my brain to come up with some way to try to not only honor dominics legacy and memory but actually to help bring some closure to this horrible situation when you mentioned a reward it struck me as a singularly right gesture im glad to hear that we thought it might be helpful to get more of the community involved if we could of course that may be the only way out of this from what ive gathered from the police if somebody saw or heard something its a sad but unfortunately true fact that some people just dont trust the police hunt nodded ive run into that so you know youve talked to them then the cops just trying to gather some sense of what happened which no one seems to have much of an idea of knowing dominic as i did i have to think it must have been some random mugging or robbery attempt or something no one who knew him could have harmed a hair on his head he sat back but regardless finding the perpetrator has got to get some real priority now in the short term more than it seems the police are giving it hunt replied with some care i dont think its that theyre not giving it a high priority so much as that it takes them time to generate and follow up any leads and thats where we thought we might be able to help thats exactly what i was hoping too because the longer this whole thing festers the more it can infect the entire community he paused im talking about the nonprofit community here hunt put down his cup turner went on a man with dominics profile there are going to be the inevitable rumors about what really happened and why and whos covering what up and i think its critical that these rumors dont gain currency and that the wild speculations of people who may even sincerely be trying to help be somewhat controlled thats how we were thinking to go sir if the reward gets large enough and does prompt a lot of calls a good number of them are probably going to range from unlikely to ridiculous our idea is to identify those and save the cops time so they can concentrate on the valid leads of course sure of course but im also talking aboutif were going to be working together here you and iim talking about keeping some kind of control over the flow of information that the public gets to see as well perhaps realizing how that sounded turner held up a palm im not saying we hide anything of course thats not what i mean at all but you have to remember that there are any number of people in this city who see our work as wasteful or nonproductive or even unnecessary and theyd like nothing more than to have ammunition to tear us down hunt sat back are you saying theyll find this ammunition around mr como no i strongly strongly doubt that dominic devoted his whole life to the cause of easing poverty and helping the downtrodden but even so there are people who would smear him and thats what im hoping youll be able to exert some control over how does that sound to you hunt felt that his own control over the precise parameters of his involvement if any with this man had shifted to some degree he wasnt at all certain that he could promise turner what he seemed to be describing or whether in fact it was even a reasonable approach he just didnt know the man was powerful and persuasive and clearly was going to have his own agenda but hunt didnt think that there would necessarily be a conflict he couldnt finesse so after a moment he nodded doable he said it sounds doable turner clapped his hands good i really think this is an excellent idea mr hunt excellent so how specifically were you planning to proceed over the next couple of minutes hunt gave him chapter and verse on mickeys idea of contacting many of the citys nonprofit organizations and soliciting them for inclusion in the reward fund turner nodded in agreement throughout at the end volunteering to help with the solicitationshe knew all these peoplein any way he could in fact what made the most sense he told hunt was that there be a central command that turner himself could act as the escrow holder of the funds after which he would administer the reward and in consultation with law enforcement decide on the reward recipients if any he would be the liaison between hunt and the various organizations in hunts efforts to keep the contributors informed he would also be happy to consult with hunt when there was a question of whether or not information should come out and finally he rolled along i think we have to talk about your compensation for all of your efforts on this i was thinking of me and my two associates billing at our regular hourly rate i can get you our fee schedule first thing next week that sounds fair great but there is one other small thing this whole concept really wont work unless we get a guarantee of a certain flexibility on the part of city government how do you mean i mean if the police or the district attorney decide to seize any and everything we may get over the phone by search warrant as it comes in then were not going to get any calls turner pondered that for a brief moment i could make a couple of calls and be of assistance in that respect meanwhile i could have a contract drawn up in the next couple of days but if youd like to get started as soon as you can we can be oldfashioned gentlemen and seal the deal with a handshake right now how does that sound again hunt wasnt completely sure how it sounded but what turner was suggesting was certainly not unethical and it would put hunt mickey and tamara to work at full pay immediately and it wasnt unusual for a job to morph slightly or even greatly as its execution played out he was sure he could stay on top of what were clearly mr turners priorities so stifling his minimal scruples he stood up and reached out his hand across the table that sounds like a deal to me he said wyatt hunt hadnt been to devin juhles home out on taraval street in a very long time in the first years after hunt had opened his office as a private investigator he had nearly lived with devin and connie and their three childreneric brendan and alexa he and juhle had been baseball teammates in high school and they had still played games together often including the children whenever he came overpingpong basketball foosball catch that was before california v gorman it was also before the scandal involving hunts former associate that had knocked the bottom out of his business and essentially destroyed his credibility with the police department and most of the criminal law community hunt wasnt kidding himselfthis thing with juhle wasnt simply a bridge to mend it was a chasm to breach now at ninethirty on a sunday morning that had blown in blustery and coldthe three days of san franciscos summer weather having exhausted their allotted runhunt parked his mini cooper on the street in front of juhles small standalone twostory home made sure he was packing presents for the kids and sat for a moment gathering the courage to go and face the music the neartragic opera that hed helped to compose finally unable to stall any longer he opened his car door and walked across the lawn and up the four steps to the front door and rang the bell the chimes rang within and he heard running footsteps and the door flew open for a horrible second hunt thought that brendan the middle one age eleven or so didnt even recognize him hed grown about four inches and had put on fifteen pounds but the face suddenly broke a smile as he said uncle wyatt and the boy actually threw his arms around him then calling back into the house its uncle wyatt more footsteps from down the hallway that led to the kitchen in the back of the house and here was connie in green sweats formidable and attractive as ever drying her hands on a dish towel her expression welcoming and warm with just a trace of concern around the eyes well look at whos here he stepped into the house and they hugged bussed each other on the cheeks after which connie held him out at arms length its so good to see you wyatt so good and then her face clouding over is everything all right everythings fine he looked around her and saw alexa hanging back in the hallway her body language quizzical and reserved hunt gave her a tiny wave and a hey sweetie but she only nodded and hunt realized that it wasnt only devin he was going to have to win over again connie was going on devins off with eric at soccer can you believe sunday morning at seven oclock is that obscene or what but they ought to be back in a half hour or so if youve got time to hang around for a while was he expecting you unlikely i wasnt sure i was expecting myself until i woke up hunt took a beat then you think hell talk to me she made a face and broke a halfsmile that told him she wasnt too certain of that but the actual words she said were stranger things have happened meanwhile how does a cup of coffee sound like a fanfare of trumpets amused connie shook her head i remember what ive missed about you they were catching each other up on their respective lives over the past months the talk flowing as it always did with connie hunt halfway through his second cup at the kitchen table when they heard a noise and connie said thats the garage door they fell then into a sudden and tense silence waiting the garage connected to the kitchen eric was the first one through the door unlike his younger brother he was about the same physical size as the last time hunt had seen him but his face had broken out with acne and his voice had a different pitch when tentative yet polite he nodded and said hi uncle wyatt hey big guy good to see you you too he advanced and reached out his hand which hunt standing shook he chose to take it as a good sign that they still called him uncle perhaps still considered him juhles brother on some level devin evidently wasnt in any hurry to get in the house he would have known hunt was inside from the distinctive car parked out front the connecting door closed shut behind eric and they heard some sounds from the garagedevin closing his drivers side door throwing the duffel bag where it belonged hunt found his breath snagged in his throat juhle opened the door and stood for a second in the doorway holding it open nodding first at his wife then briefly at hunt he turned and closed it with an exaggerated gentleness turning back around he leaned up against the counter and crossed his arms over his chest nodding again his face a mask hey wyatt he said with no inflection whatever what can i do for you i dont think so juhle said thats police work the two of them sat at either end of a sagging beige sofa in the downstairs family room a converted halfbasement where juhle had his pingpongpool table set up along with a dartboard and a foosball game area a television rested on the middle shelf of a builtin bookcase mostly devoted otherwise to sports trophies for the kids and connies washer and dryer reinforced the places basic functional nature juhles house wasnt big and the family and their activities filled it all up every spare inch its police work hunt countered that wont do any good you wont get the calls were going to get and if you did youll spend all your time screening out the nuts juhle shrugged shook his head dismissing the idea how many good tips you think youre going to get two three not even that end of story no it isnt not if we get the reward set up and it gets big and it will whats big i dont know maybe a hundred grand maybe more micks shooting for the moon and hes a charmer hunt came forward on the couch so were not talking any couple of calls a day here its not impossible the reward might go to half a mil and if that happens the flakes come out of the woodwork you know this and i know it and youre going to spend half to all of your time either chewing your cud on nothing or running down ridiculous leads trying to identify one good one another shrug thats what we do wyatt run down leads its police work wyatt sat back let out a breath this is getting a little circular dont you think you got any of these leads juhle paused then spit out we got squat that was my guess hunt said you know time was this would have been a slam dunk for both of us dev winwin juhle glanced down the length of the couch time was a lot of other things too you want to talk about some of em talks cheap wyatt and bullshit walks this isnt bullshit this is something i can legitimately do to help your investigation we are going ahead and contacting potential reward sources and who are these sources people connected to como who want to see his killer get caught none of them more than i do granted but we can generate leads you cant calls from folks who would never call the cops most of what we get will be crap sure but if we even get one good tip you couldnt get youre better off hunt sat back spoke matteroffactly this is a free gift to you dev call it an apology if you want sometimes the jobs we do were on different sides it doesnt have to be personal this brought a cold smile and of course its going to put money in your pocket for what you just admitted to me was mostly going to be crap for this im supposed to say thank you you fuck with my career my livelihood and my family and you tell me its not personal it didnt happen that way dev you could look at it that gina and i saved you from being the cop who sent the wrong guy to prison and then ps she hands you the real guy the actual killer and you get the credit for that arrest hows that hurt your career you want to tell me that no answer your feelings hunt went on okay after what happened on the stand okay sorry but your career your livelihood your family i dont think so up one flight on the main floor the television laid down white noise tires squealed and a cars horn sounded from outside on the street juhles jaw was set the corners of his mouth drawn down he stared in the direction of the bookcase wall across from him then pulled himself upright on the couch and leaned forward his elbows on his knees hunt lowered his voice this is a done deal dev im telling you as a courtesy this is happening but whatever you think of it we will help you any way we can without a ceasefire much less a peace treaty in hand hunt got up tell connie and the kids it was nice seeing them now that hunt was on board with him mickey had all the excuse he needed to see alicia thorpe again they met at bay beans west a coffee shop on haight street about midway between their two residences got their brews and realized it might be hours before they could find a place to sit inside so they decided to walk instead down to lincoln and then due west into the teeth of the wind out toward the beach for the first couple of blocks they made small talk about the changing weather starbucks versus bay beans how the la cuisine classes were going for both mickey and ian how everybody their age seemed to be doing one job for money then all these other things that they seemed to like better for freealicia volunteering at the sunset youth project mickey and ian learning to cook so whats your day job mickey asked her when youre not volunteering its kind of embarrassing if its work that pays you its not embarrassing as my grandfather used to say there is no work if done in the proper spirit to which honor cannot accrue a small contralto laugh thats good does that apply to being the hostess at mortons every job in the world according to jim but especially hostess at mortons mickey said perhaps the most honorable of the service jobs well thank you ill start trying to look at it that way instead of as six hours of mindnumbing tedium there you go they walked on in silence for a while and then mickey said ian told me about your parents she cast a quick glance over at him yeah did he tell you that pretty much the same thing happened to me she stopped and faced him your father shot your mother and then himself no but my father disappeared and then my mother overdosed same result no parents she closed her eyes then shook her head i dont really remember it too much it was just the way it was i was only nine i was seven but i think its the most indelible memory of my lifethe shape under the sheet on the gurney knowing it was mom as they wheeled her out i must have blocked it she said after a silence that lasted for half a block mickey cleared his throat so about dominic all these charities he ran he only ran one the sunset youth project and of course all the subordinate groups off that okay so what are those she shrugged lets see the art gallery the two schools the development company the theater the moving company the sunset battalion sunset battalion sounds like a bunch of commandos no its more like an urban peace corps mostly older guys some of the girls people whove been in the program awhile so what do they do another shrug pretty much whatever needs to be done tutoring handing out pamphlets bringing back the strays working the neighborhoods theyre kind of the bootsontheground people his understanding limited at best mickey nodded well then with this other stuff whats the actual sunset youth project do sunset itself its the i dont know what youd call it the umbrella the administrative side they kept walking and she must have noticed another question playing around on mickeys face because she said what im just trying to get my arms around this whole thing i mean if dominic was only running one program whats with the car well the one program has maybe two dozen sites in the city maybe more the main office and k through eight down on ortega the residential treatment center in potrero the outpatient center for adults by city college then the high school she stopped the litany you get the idea i could get you the whole list if you need it but the point is that sunsets a huge organization huge whats its budget do you know total she thought a moment fifty million a year give or take mickey stopped in his tracks no really really im pretty sure its somewhere in that neighborhood its in the annual report you could check fifty million dollars somewhere in there im pretty sure with everything i mean all the programs sunsets probably serving five thousand people a day all told citywide it adds up ill say so wheres all that money come from everywhere mickey are you kidding me individual philanthropists foundations tuition and other income from the schools moving company fees and the sale of the redeveloped buildings i mean a lot of these things are profit centers in themselves but also theres a ton of public health money from the city this city i thought we were in a budget crunch she nodded always but even if they cut way back the health services department is going to stay the single biggest agency in the city is that true the biggest alicia shook her head im sure thats right i think theyre in for five million to us just sunset but then theres also americorps which is federal and funds the battalion for another several mil and then theres all the just daytoday regular fundraising that gets you to fifty million pretty close most years wow yeah i know its impressive so ive got to ask this what was dominic making running this thing does anybody know that sure its public record again you could look it up in twenty minutes she broke a small smile but you dont have to because i already know his salary was six hundred fortyeight thousand dollars every year last year anyway and at least close to that the year before and before that she shrugged its a major executive job mickey he earned what he made he deserved it still mickey said six hundred and fifty grand makes me think i might want to go into charity work myself i thought you wanted to be a chef i do but im flexible for that kind of money i believe i could be tempted no she touched his arm again you dont do it for the money you do it for the work its great helping people it really is way better than standing in a restaurant saying hello with your smile on all day thats why i got into my own volunteering although now with dominic gone she stopped and visibly gathered herself as she threatened to tear up sorry she said i keep doing this but wiping her hands over her eyes she got herself back under control so i guess were to that now my relationship with dominic we can be if youre comfortable with it im fine with it the words confident enough that they carried with them almost the hint of a threat ive done nothing im ashamed of although the other day you said that maybe you and mr como were too close what did you mean by that i meant that there was some chemistry physical chemistry that we both acknowledged but he was a married man and he wasnt going there and neither was i wed even talked about me quitting so we wouldnt be around one another so much but that just seemed like a needless hardship on both of us and why did we want that we liked being together we joked and had little secret things we did that made everything fun i mean it in the middle of all this serious stuff he did every day was fun he was just a great guy doing great work and that was the other side of it of what the job the actual job what about the job she bit her lower lip this is the part where you laugh at me i dont think so try me as they started walking again she took a breath of air i kind of want to go into politics and change the world at least try to make it a better place thats not a bad thing the politics maybe but not the general idea no i know but here i am with my little degree in political science and im a hostess at mortons you know what im saying sure you wanted to do something more important she nodded and now youre thinking so she gets a job driving a limo im not thinking that im listening okay so the thing about this job with dominic isnt so much about driving him around its about moving into another world where theres power and money and good things can happen she was getting into it now and her voice came to life you know what happened to the last three of dominics morning drivers this is in like the last two or three years she held up one finger jon royce now administrative assistant to guess who alice tallent city supervisor two terry mcgrath emt school and fast tracked to the fire department three deshawn ellis scout for the san francisco giants who got dominic and me the best tickets ive ever seen last opening day connections mickey said she nodded i know it might sound crass and selfserving and then of course it maybe looks like im using the relationship with dominic to get a leg up on a career but id already done a lot of volunteer time at sunset when ian was there just to be near my brother so it wasnt like i just glommed on to this opportunity to get ahead and then this driving job came up and i was kind of next in line and i truly didnt know how i was going to feel about dominic once i got to know him on the way back by now chilled to the bone they found themselves on either end of the back couch at the little shamrock drinking irish coffees the place late on a sunday afternoon had only two other customers playing a nearly silent and intense game of darts alicia came back from the bar and put their second round down on the small table in front of them sitting back she crossed one leg over the other and flashed a quick glance in mickeys direction here weve been doing all this talking she said and i havent really been completely straight with you about dominic shaking her head she said no not about dominic ive told you everything about dominic hesitating she drew a breath you know how i said i must have blocked out everything around what happened with my mom and dad thats not really true i didnt think it was mickey said i dont think anybody does that not at nine years old i was going to let it slide she nodded i noticed and i thank you for that but maybe i shouldnt be so defensive about it especially with somebody whos doing all this work for me and whos been through something so similar i dont know how similar it really was alicia me and tamara got a home out of it i gather you and ian didnt no she said they split us up not that they tried to but ian was i guess kind of gangly and sullen and all bad attitude so it turned out not too many people were willing to take a chance on him but they were with you a shrug i was quieter maybe more pliable just as angry as ian was i think maybe i still am i dont know but nobody saw it at first although none of my homes really stuck either anyway the bottom line is we got separated pretty quick and he got into most of the drugs in the universe and some pretty bad behavior mickey remembered he told me he spent some time at the work farm not really some time she said just about all the time from thirteen to eighteen but you kept up with him not so hard really his address didnt change she reached for her irish coffee and took a sip anyway i guess my point is that i was on my own and wasnt really too much of an angel myself i dont like to think about how i was back then but i dont want to pretend to you that i didnt have any reaction to what my dad did and that i didnt act out because of it because i did i was pretty ragedriven okay no not really okay i was as bad as ian was not with all the drugs maybe but getting myself in trouble and i kind of focused on older men if you see where im going with this dominic she nodded if the cops look theyre going to think they see a pattern she said but i wanted you to know that stopped a long time ago and it was all long over by the time i started working with dominic and it didnt start up again with him i believed you the first time mickey said still she said she reached over and rested her hand for a second or two on his thigh looked into his eyes i wanted you to know mickey his leg nearly burning where shed rested her hand reached out and grabbed his own irish coffee brought it to his mouth well while were on this type of stuff he said ian mentioned something else i was a little curious about whats that jail he put his glass down what about jail suddenly her voice became querulous frightened in her eyes he picked up a sense of the dark rage shed alluded to earlier im not going to jail she whispered at him you said you were going to keep me out of jail and thats still our intention i didnt do anything to dominic i really didnt easy alicia i didnt say you did i said wed be trying to keep you out of jail and just to try to prepare you for possible eventualities maybe keeping you out of jail wont be possible after all thats a major part of the job but its not the only part no that wont work its got to be the major part mickey dont you understand i didnt do anything again she emphasized her point by reaching over and putting a hand on his leg i cant go to jail thats what ian said too he said he thought it would kill you he looked over at her as now she pulled her hand away from him came forward and hunched over her hands clasped in her lap i was hoping to reassure you that even if it came to that you could get through it how can you say that how can you know have you ever been in jail no but i know she cut him off her voice loud and harsh i dont care what you know you cant know until youve been there its not what you think okay theyve got complete control over you i cant go there again suddenly the bartender was back with them everything okay here alicia threw a look at mickey then up fine were fine she said sorry just try to keep it down a little back here then huh when he went back to the bar they sat in silence for a long minute finally mickey said again she was back to being hunched over her breathing heavy alicia at last with a deep sigh she straightened up the cops shouldnt have it it shouldnt be on my record i wasnt even eighteen its supposed to be erased it was just a joyride and a stupid accident was anybody hurt no just me a little but the car belonged to the house i was staying in the guy theres a fucking pervert and i stole his fucking car which ended that particular shot at my domestic bliss with stepparents but the jail part was she stopped looked pleadingly at him nobody knows this except ian you dont have to say mickey said ive got a good imagination i thought because there were only women on that side of the jail mickey moved over next to her put his arm around her and brought her in next to him nobodys going to let you go to jail he said thats not going to happen i promise as soon as the words were out of his mouth mickey regretted them you didnt promise when you couldnt absolutely deliver it was one of the mantras he and tamara had lived bya promise is a promise they used to say but this particular horse was already out of the barn and there was nothing he could do about it now when wyatt hunt opened his office door in chinatown the next morning at eight fortythree tamara was at her old desk shed told him on saturday night that if hed take her back she would be there but actually seeing her in the flesh gave him a hopeful jolt of adrenaline maybe the firm would get back on its feet again and this was the first sign that things were turning around she glanced at her wristwatch then up to her boss her face alight i didnt realize that youd changed your hours at a glance she looked good lightly made up with lipstick mascara and eye shadow a black silk blouse under a multicolored scarf around her neck camouflaged her protruding collarbones the overall effect was nothing like anorexia shed obviously lost some weight of course but hunt might not have noticed anything amiss if he hadnt seen her and had his arms around her two nights before still reluctant to embarrass her on the one hand or to scare her off with overeffusiveness on the other he kept his greeting lowkey so the cat actually did drag you in for the record i cant tell you how good it is to see you sitting there again i cant tell you how good it feels to be sitting here again she hesitated then added i really want to thank you for letting this happen wyatt i dont know too many other people who would be okay with taking me back anybody whod had you working for them once would take you back in a new york minute tam im the one who should be thanking you and i do okay she lowered her eyes then raised them back up to him a trace of her old impish smile playing around her mouth do you think we can be through with all of this yucky stuff pretty soon absolutely no more yuck starting now good mickeys already out on that len turner list you gave him hell check in when hes done or a little before lunch whichever comes first and devin juhle called no message just please call him back when you get in got it and tamhe stopped on his way to the back office and stood by the side of her deskone last bit of yuck she sighed with some theatricalityone of her mannerisms from the old days which he loved okay one what striking fast he leaned over and kissed the top of her head welcome back on his way to the sunset youth project administrative offices at ortega street and sunset boulevard mickey couldnt get comos salary out of his brain or sunsets million peryear operating budget these dollar figures shifted his initial take on comos murder this much money around it was likely in play and as far as this went it was good news for alicia if she was of any interest at all to the police it was not because of money but because of her relationship to como as alicia had told him information on nonprofits was a matter of public record and hence easily accessible with len turners list to guide him mickey had done some computer research last night and verified that the three largest nonprofits where como had a seat on the boardthe mission street coalition sanctuary house and halfway homeeach operated with a budget of over million per year since none of these quite matched the size and scope of the sunset youth project mickeys first call was on comos home turf the twostory building wasnt much of a scenic destination the low overcast skies didnt help much either standing across the street mickey was struck by how sad and nondescript the place looked the grounds took up an entire city block off to his left side behind a twelvefoot cyclone fence with razor wire threaded around the top were a deserted asphalt playground four basketball hoops with no nets a metallic climbing structure and parking for half a dozen cars including a lincoln town car limousine over the front doorway a flag hung at halfmast inside now mickey walked through the wide low lobbyagain echoes of public schools hed attended a dozen or more young people loitered by the stairway on his right he was headed toward a directory mounted on the wall in front of him but noticed that the large office next to it venetian blinds behind the glass was lit up and obviously occupied its door wide open stenciled on the glass were the words sunset youth project office of the executive director inside the large room more loiterers stood around between the desks behind the counter mickey slapped on a smile and knocked excuse me he said im looking for lorraine hess the associate director stood behind the desk in her office and reached out a hand to shake mickeys dominic como mickey was quickly learning had an eye for lovely women first the truly beautiful alicia thorpe and now his assistant director solidly built more than slightly overweight and even in rimless eyeglasses lorraine hess clearly at one time had been a babe and except for the weight wasnt so far from still being one she wore a rustcolored woolen suit over a plain white blouse the ensemble a few years out of style her hair shoulderlength and mostly gray was a riot of mismanagement but not unattractive and of a piece with the sultry sunken bedroom eyes once not so long ago she might have been distractingly prettier and might even be now if shed give more thought to her appearance but this clearly wasnt much of a concern to her and especially not today the first business day after the discovery of comos body as you can imagine she was telling him were in a state of complete numbness and disbelief around here to say nothing of the personal devastation none of us can understand how this could have happened the random killing of such a wonderful man nobody who knew him could have wanted to do anything to harm dominic its just such a loss thats what im hearing from everybody mickey said im not surprised thats what i told the police when they came by it must have been a random thing a mugging maybe it couldnt have been someone he knew who knew him do you know who he was going to meet no he never told al mr carter his driver i thought alicia thorpe was his driver hess made a little moue ms thorpe was one of several daytime drivers that shift ends at three al carter drove the rest of the time in any event you were asking if i knew who dominic was going to meet and the answer is no al just let him off early near his house and that wasshe swallowed against her emotionthat was the last time anyone saw him she removed her glasses rubbed her eyes then replaced them now looking at mickey as though she were seeing him for the first time im sorry you said you were with a private investigating firm is there something you came here to tell me or any way i can help you well as a matter of fact and mickey went into his prepared pitch on the reward ending by telling her that wyatt hunt had cleared the idea with len turner who would manage the reward fund you mean youll be working with mr turner as well as the police yes maam thats kind of the plan were assuming that once the idea gets out into the nonprofit community the reward might become fairly substantial and wed then serve the purpose of evaluating the information received and passing the legitimate stuff along to the police were hoping to elicit information from people in the community who might not normally cooperate much or willingly with law enforcement at the same time wed screen calls from cranks and publicity seekers since we know therell be some of them as well basically wed be acting as a clearinghouse and of course validating the claimants for the reward if any but wont the police be investigating as well sure but mr turner agrees that we could provide a valuable service by being a conduit to a community that doesnt always willingly interact with law enforcement even if they have very persuasive stuff thats why you offer a reward its a little more proactive and as of last night the police had no active leads they were working on hess made no real attempt to disguise the stress and fatigue of the days since comos disappearance now she leaned back in her chair closed her eyes briefly and let out a deep sigh and youve come to us i presume to sort of get the ball rolling yes maam mr turner recommended that you call him if you have any questions or misgivings were offering our services thats all were trying to coordinate and facilitate the reward but its entirely your call well hess said i appreciate that but i dont know if i have the authority to make that decision as you know with dominic gone weve got a huge vacuum at the top right now and again she closed her eyes shook her head wearily brought them back to mickey on the other hand if mr turner says i know we want to do all we can as soon as we can to find out who could have been responsible for this how much money were you thinking youd need to start that would be entirely up to your discretion but enough to incentivize somebody who otherwise might not be inclined to come forward and as ive mentioned mr turner wasnt thinking youd be in this alone he told us that mr como was on several other boards maybe youd want to set an example for them to follow i would have to go to our board but suddenly she seemed to come to some decision a bit of color came back into her cheeks and she slapped her palm down on her desktop hell at least wed be doing something instead of just sitting here waiting for the police and twiddling our thumbs do you think twenty thousand would be enough im sure i could go to the board with that much in mind i could reach them all this morning by phone i think that might be a good start mickey said restraining an urge to let out a war whoop in fact he knew that this was about the maximum total reward that most professionals advised be offered it was one thing he knew to offer million for bin laden and another thing to dangle such a vast amount of money in a local case that it would serve as a distraction attracting so many tips as to drown out any actual leads but in this case the idea was to generate every conceivable tip even paranoids have enemies he knew and even psychos sometimes possessed real information but he kept his reply lowkey that would give me something to go to the other charities with not till you hear back from me though hess said ill need the approval of our board absolutely mickey said if youd like i could wait it looked like a school because it still was a school k through eight sunrise school he got outside onto the asphalt yard just as the recess bell sounded as the kids came flying out all around him he let himself through a small gate in a fence turned the corner of the building and found himself in the small parking lot hed noticed from across the street a tall rangy middleaged black man was leaning back against the building arms crossed over his chest watching in a supervisory way as two other young men went over the limousine with sponges and hoses on a hunch mickey sidled over to the area and caught the mans attention excuse me he said are you al carter with a questioning expression the man straightened away from the wall he exuded authority except for a wellbuzzed tonsure he was bald and the high clear forehead spoke of intelligence and patience his voice when he spoke was lowpitched unhurried educated i have that name he said and you have the advantage of me mickey extended his hand and introduced himself you dont know me he went on but maybe you knew my grandfather jim parr at that names mention the closedup face relaxed somewhat i certainly did know your grandfather is he still among the quick i dont know about that mickey said hes slowed down a little but carter chuckled shaking his head cutting him off the quick young man he said in contradistinction to the dead the quick and the dead i was asking if jim were still alive as of this morning well thats wonderful news tell him hello for me i will mickey gestured toward the car so what are these guys doing carter cast a throwaway glance in their direction we call this washing the limousine its one of their tasks are they being punished for something a little halflaugh punished to the contrary theyre being rewarded these two young men were handpicked by mr como to do this job and if they continue to do it effectively theyll be promoted to more responsible and important jobs now his expressive face did cloud over or they would have been suddenly the eyes focused and he raised a finger in mickeys direction youre the young man who found him i am and you are jim parrs grandson as well right thats an extraordinary coincidence yes it is mickey said so how is it carter asked that youve stayed involved in matters surrounding mr comos death what do you mean i mean you found his body your grandfather used to be his driver nowhe gestured to include their surroundingsyoure here the connection eludes me theres no mystery to it i work for a private investigator were offering to coordinate a reward program ah a reward program i dont believe ive heard of that its in its early stages ms hess is hoping that the sunset youth project here is going to put up twenty thousand dollars with others of mr comos charities kicking in it could get to quite a substantial sum carters eyebrows went up his head canted to one side so he said the assumption being that there is information out there somewhere someone knows something hes not talking about i dont know about assumption mickey said more like a hope maybe someone knows something but doesnt recognize its importance the hope is that the money might get that person motivated to think a little harder about what theyve seen or might have heard you for example mr carter you were the last person to see him alive if im not mistaken right no that would have been his killer carter broke a sad smile a small yet critical distinction dont you think but the police have already spoken to me and i told them everything i knew which im afraid wasnt much i left him off near his home on tuesday night how near a couple of blocks and he never mentioned who he was supposed to be seeing not by name no he said it was just an old acquaintance who was having problems but old acquaintances of mr como could fill the phone book mr dade according to that criterion it could theoretically have even been your grandfather and beyond that its possible that he had his scheduled meeting with the old acquaintance hed told me about and then after that met with his killer or as i think lorraine would like to believe it was a random attack by some mugger but you dont think that no carter said no i dont think i do do you have any specific reason for not thinking that carter shook his head i wish i did i wish there was something i could point to but its just a nebulous feeling wellmickey his wallet out removed one of his business cardsif it gets to be more than that call this number or of course the police the information doesnt have to come through us to qualify for the reward if thats a concern it isnt i wouldnt be doing it for the reward mr dade no of course not i didnt mean to imply that you would and remember that as we speak right now the reward sits at zero but still mickey added if something does occur to you or something new develops it might be nice to know the moneys sitting there waiting for somebody to claim it carter nodded his face set in grim stone ill keep that in mind he said first thing that monday morning len turner had talked to the mayor the mayor had placed a phone call to the chief of police who had personally called devin juhle and suggestedan order would have been inappropriatethat he extend every courtesy to the concerned citizens who were assisting in the investigation by offering this sofar nonexistent reward devin juhle told hunt hed be with his partner sarah russo at the ferry buildings marketbar restaurant at eleven am theyd be willing to review the progress in the como investigation to bring hunt up to speed with the understanding that if hunt was successful in helping to get a reward established and funded then when he got anything hed reciprocate in the normal course of events they all would have met at lou the greeks the citys legendary bar and eatery across the street from the hall of justice but juhles choice of a lunch venue far removed from the normal haunt of cops and other courthouse denizens drove home to hunt the fact that he was still very much on probation or worse here juhle and russo might cooperate with him and see how things went but neither of them was ready to be seen with him in public sarah was married to graham russo a junior partner in the one law firm that was with some regularity still throwing hunt the occasional bone of work she was also a tenyear homicide veteran and the mother of two boys a freckled and athletic tomboy with beatlelength dark hair she looked about fifteen years younger than her actual age barely old enough to drink she and her husband and kids had been to a couple of case celebration parties at hunts warehousehome and as far as she was concerned hunt was okay she agreed that the reward idea was at best stupid and at worst distracting but she pointed out that it was no more stupid or distracting than half of the political things that san franciscos police department had to put up with every day she was willing to go with the flow down on the embarcadero the morning cloud cover had lifted and mostly dissipated now a gauzy sunlight bathed the outdoor tables as sarah was gearing up on her summation so weve got nothing on his activities after five forty five last tuesday the wife ellen didnt even call to say she was worried about him and hadnt seen him until almost seven oclock on wednesday night apparently juhle put in he frequently stayed out late at some fundraiser or another got home after she was asleep and was up and out the next morning before she got up didnt sleep in her bed or in their bed hunt asked evidently not russo said or not that she noticed americas fun couple hunt said so where was she tuesday night then the wife russo didnt have to consult her notes she walked up to chestnut and went to a movie the reader it checks at least thats what was playing there that night still is for that matter she went alone she nodded thats what she says got home around ninethirty read for a while went to sleep around eleven the waitress arrived with their food all of them were having the cuban pork sandwiches and iced tea and the young woman put the plates down saying and todays award for most original order goes to everybody got a little chuckle out of that and then the waitress was gone and hunt took a bite of his sandwich and said but nobody saw him on wednesday all day right he didnt come into work right juhle said so it was tuesday night thats close enough russo said me says he cant be sure but its not a stretch to say he didnt come home tuesday night because he was already dead how about his phone hunt asked whod he talk to lots of people juhle said and i mean like forty different numbers in or out the last day all of whom weve called by the way and most of whom weve reached but the last completed call in or out was at nineforty after that it all went to voice mail and the cell site information says hes where his driver said he left him russo held up a muchscribbledupon computer printout for hunts edification juhle stopped his chewing police work and a darned fine job of it too hunt said and what did all these good cellphonetalking citizens have to say everybody so far russo said has had a completely plausible reason to have talked to him and about half of those are verified by comos calendar anyway no ancient acquaintances that weve come across maybe it wasnt true what he told his driver maybe that russo conceded or maybe the driveral carterdidnt tell us the truth about what como told him hunt put his sandwich down looked across at russo any sign of that she shook her head not really no carter got the limo back to sunsets headquarters where they keep it parked at sixthirty when it was still light out three witnesses there agree with that timetable and theres no motive for him anyway carters loyal as a dog hes been driving como around for something like eight years but wait juhle suddenly said lets back up to the first thing wyatt asked about that maybe what como told this guy carter wasnt true maybe he wasnt meeting an old friend after all devin likes the idea of a woman being involved russo said whos that hunt asked all innocence young girl juhle said really really beautiful young girl i think even sarah will agree russo nodded even sarah admits shes very pretty in factjuhle leaned halfway across the table to huntshe is so incredibly beautiful shell make your teeth bleed alicia thorpe twentyfive or so volunteering at sunset and como was having an affair with her thats the problem juhle shook his head sadly if he was they both were damned discreet and so hunt asked how would she be involved then exactly russo let herself chuckle probably not is your answer and devins answer after we talked to her and mine too while were at it and dev so badly wants an excuse to go look at her again i told him if he kept it up id have to tell connie hell juhle said ive already told connie now she wants to see her too im thinking of taking connie out to mortons and spending a million dollars just so we can both look at her mortons hunt asked shes the hostess there russo told him hunt looked over at juhle is she there tuesday nights juhle pointed back at him not the last one she could have been anywhere did you ask her juhle threw him a withering gaze oh i must have forgot what a good idea then of course i asked her wyatt she like mrs como was home alone watching television except if she really was out with como but alas russo said we have nothing like any evidence on her hunts cell phone went off and he brought it to his ear and had a short conversation when he closed it he said well im glad you took this opportunity to get me caught up on all the excellent police work and progress youve made so far that was tamara from my office and it looks like were going to be in business together for a while jaime sanchez came up from the mission street coalition offices to downtown to have lunch with len turner at the olympic club a venue in the grand tradition of old san francisco the spacious highceilinged dining room conveyed a tone of gentility and leisure here all voices were wellmodulated controlled there was no unseemly hurry or vulgar clothing on display almost all of the male diners todayand today as every day they were mostly malewore conservative dark business suits and ties one could order of course nearly anything from the waitstaff but the buffet was so staggeringly laden with all manner of foodstuffsfrom cold cuts to chicken three ways from smoked salmon to poached and sautéed fish pastas and potatoes and a carving station with leg of lamb prime rib and fresh hamthat most guests availed themselves of that opportunity sanchez wore his own personal uniformunpolished brogues a pair of wellworn khakis a blue blazer with some years on it and a light orange shirt with matching woolen tie he enjoyed flouting this bastion of privilege with his inadequate attire he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror and his relatively short physical stature along with the general swarthiness of his complexion didnt make for much of a presentation either at least in this crowd to hell with em he thought he knew he was here because of what he represented his partner len on the other hand couldnt have looked more natural here and couldnt have fit in more easily sanchez thought that he had probably come here as a child on his fathers knee he knew not just the greeter and the waiters by first name but the bussers behind the buffet well he told himself this was why len was so valuable to have as a partner the man was not only a skilled negotiator and lawyer but he cultivated an ease that inspired confidence the sense that everything was as it should be and under control even in rarefied settings such as this one len was always at home tall aristocratic fit and tanned could it all be just genes that to sanchez was a scary thought now they were returning from the buffet in contrast to sanchezs overheaping plate of fettuccine green beans french fries caesar salad and prime rib turners plate held a small bit of petrale in lemoncaper sauce a few slices of scalloped potatoes and three spears of asparagus as they sat down two of them at their four person whitetablecloth table sanchez forced a laugh ive got to learn to control myself around a buffet like that i see all that incredible food and i swear to you len i want all of it his elegant colleague offered a small smile thats what its there for jimi you want more when youre done go back and get it nobodys going to say a word he forked himself a bite of fish savored it nodded in mute approval then directed his attention back across the table thanks for coming up on short notice no problem sanchez said always better to talk in person anyway you said it was urgent wellturner waved a handmaybe the urgency is relative but i thought it would be worthwhile if you and i first came together on a consistent game plan for this reward idea which basically i like and then talked a little about strategy for the succession at sunset which is going to be a huge deal dont i know sanchez said yes im sure you do but first things first huh always so what do you have turner put his fork down nancy neshek called me as soon as shed gotten off the phone with lorraine what nancy understands and you im sure while perhaps lorraine doesnt is what a great fundraising opportunity this reward scenario is for all of us he lowered his voice and leaned in over the table heres dominic como fallen hero champion of the people every organization where hes on the boardthats yours and nancys and at least three others i could namewe announce were ponying up x number of dollars for the reward its going to be a citywide concerted effort to find his killer because the police have run out of leads but youre asking arent these charities running on lean budgets anyway wheres all that money going to come from for sanchez the picture suddenly snapped into sharp focus our generous contributors right we make a special onetime appeal for emergency funds to cover the reward were offering so we commit lets say a couple of hundred grand between us maybe moreit doesnt really matter chump change whatever it turns out to be we print up special pledge cards get em out to your mailing lists and into the community make a pitch on tv it could easily bring in two three million maybe more the number lit up sanchezs eyes this was the kind of plan that could make the nonprofit world so incredibly lucrative turner was proposing that he and nancy neshek and a few other executives could invest thirty or forty thousand dollars each on the reward and its attendant publicity and conceivably bring in a million or more each for their efforts and that wasnt even including private foundation and grant money whichgiven dominic comos personal connections with these groupssanchez thought would flow like water never mind that none of the charities might ever actually have to pay a cent of that reward since it was far from a certainty that anyone could provide the information that would lead to an arrest in the como case nevertheless this onetime special fundraising campaign would raise money that no one in the real world would ever audit or follow up on in any way this was because once they gave contributors simply tended to assume that the funds would be used either for the express purpose of the campaign or to buttress another needy area in the charitys charter this is one of those opportunity knocks moments jimi well want to get this reward up and posted as soon as we can sanchez brought a hand up to his mouth placed two fingers on his lips against the urge to smile of course he said that goes without saying i was going to put up twentyfive same as sunset that sounds about right nancys in at that level too and im sure i can talk to a couple of other colleagues and get the total up to over a hundred which is about the minimum well need for credibility as soon as we get to that number i thought id announce the press conference put things in motion then we can sit back and just watch the money start to pour in sanchez went back to the buffet for dessert and sat down again across from turner with a wedge of cheesecake and a brownie sitting under a scoop of vanilla ice cream both men waited while their coffees were refilled and then sanchez waded into the turbulent waters of the succession question at the sunset youth project i realize that therell be an open evaluation and hiring process len but i dont think anyone could object to my qualifications ive been running mission for seven years id be a logical and natural choice turner dabbed his lips with his napkin well thats what we need to discuss jimi im all for supporting you and for advancing your candidacy with the board but there are still some unresolved issues that arent so obvious sanchez clearly hadnt anticipated this objection from his colleague his brow went dark like what like first lorraine hess pah shes but turner raised a hand stopping him lorraine hess is a woman with ten years handson experience with the nutsandbolts stuff jim she knows the place inside out shes going to have a good deal of support from the board and shes made no secret of the fact that shes going to want to be in the running and deserves the job and did i mention shes a woman weve never had a woman director that could prove to be more important than everything else put together len offered half a smile youre damn lucky shes not black sanchez was shaking his head shes not executive material len you and i both know it shes a worker bee shed be best staying where she is i dont think she even has a clue what dominic actually did this brought a tight smile did anybody i like to think ive got a pretty good idea of it while he shoveled a bite of cheesecake and washed it down with some coffee turner said id be interested to hear that we can look on it as part of your interview process sanchez swallowed fair enough he said but saying what he did first of all entails what he didnt do and that is any actual work with sunsets organization he was just totally above it which by the way is why lorraine wouldnt be any good at his job there wasnt really anything to dominics job at all except to do favors and collect money i think shes still under the impression that he actually had some function within the organization when in fact he didnt no i agree that was his genius call it that if you want but if some new hire goes waltzing into there thinking he or shes going to be doing something as opposed to simply peddling and trading influence theres going to be anguish and gnashing of teeth believe me now turner leaned in over the table well frankly jimi thats exactly the concern that some of us on the board have about your interest in the job you have actually been in charge of running your programs daytoday at mission keeping track of your people mandating profit centers to use your phrase youre a bit of a worker bee yourself sanchez allowed himself a small nod ive been biding my time len im ready to move up to a new level i think ive paid plenty of dues and then who takes over your place at mission its good you asked that you know that my wife has been in the office and on the payroll almost since the beginning shed be the natural choice id think and would serve to demonstrate our commitment to gender equality turner sat back with a look of appreciation you know jimi he said all this time weve worked together and i had no idea you were so ambitious those two jobs yours and lolas theyd bring in what round it off to eight hundred dont you think that might draw a little scrutiny sanchez put down his fork i make two hundred now len lolas at around one fifty no one raises their eyebrows if i move to sunset and lola moves up at mission no one will even notice the important thing is that dominics work continues that our people keep getting elected and how does that happen you know how that happens turner did know in fact as counsel to sunset turner had come to understand the power that dominic como had held not only did he control the purse strings on his millionperyear budget he directed those funds to where they could wield the most political influence in the city for the great secret of the nonprofit community especially in the incredibly corrupt environment that was san francisco was its intimate connection to the political and hence the business community comos genius lay in the fact that hed positioned himself as the broker between all of the elements he was the go to guy for problems among the families of the power elite if a judges son needed rehab for example comos wide ranging connections in the social service community made it possible for a spot to open in a facility in arizona say or los angeles rather than in san francisco where the boys presence could be politically embarrassing for the father if a supervisors daughter needed a job como could find her a place with the muni bus system in fact if a politician was having trouble with any one of san franciscos constituenciesunions hispanics gays immigrants city employeescomo had been the de facto intermediary greasing the wheels of governance through the judicious application of money or personnel for the simple fact was that election laws in the city forbade any individual giving more than to any single political candidate for whatever position be it district attorney city supervisor mayor or any other elected position on the other hand there was no limit at all to nonprofit charity giving which could also be written off on taxes len turners position functioned entirely upon this axis his clients for the most part developers of multimilliondollar longrange city projects found it in their hearts to be charitable to worthy foundations such as the sunset youth project because the money that found its way into dominic comos coffers could then be applied to the election of city officials sympathetic to these projects armies of volunteers ostensibly on their own time manned phone banks handed out pamphlets packed rallies andon a darker notesometimes disrupted their opponents events while technically illegal and certainly unethical these practices continued unchecked because the people whose job it was to oversee these activities were among the very people benefiting from them now turner pushed himself a bit back from his table crossed one leg over the other and reached for his coffee cup he met the eye of his companion and nodded jaime was telling him that he knew how the game was played and signaling that he was ready to try to take his own game to the heights that como had scaled it was true that he wasnt as polished as como had beenbut then who was well listen turner said i appreciate your frankness jimi lets let things settle for a few weekshell dominics not even buried yetand then see how we stand its good youve given me this early warning of your interest ill pass it along to some of the board meanwhile lets get this reward up and running take advantage of the opportunity thats right in front of us hows that sound good that sounds good len but i did want you specifically to know that my interest in taking over dominics job at sunset isnt going away if it wasnt for the unfortunate choice of words in this situation id be tempted to say id kill for that job tamara heard hunts cry of delight from back in his office she jumped up at her station went to the connecting door and opened it to see her boss standing up behind his desk arms outstretched above him in the classic touchdown signal im guessing good news she said hunt brought his hands down but his eyes still danced that was the wife ellen who had just got off the phone with len turner you want to guess she confessed no she gave you a list of suspects no but she does want to talk to us meanwhile how about if she puts up fifty grand on her own fifteen hunts smile wouldnt go away five oh tam fifty she didnt want people to think she didnt care as much as any of the nonprofits shes the most hurt shes been damaged the most she wants the killer to be caught more than anybody else i feel terrible for her but in all other ways ive got to say that im starting to feel pretty good about this whole thing your brother is too much you know that i do but dont tell him hell get all swellheaded dont tell me what mickey appearing as if by magic behind her in the doorway i promise my head will stay the same size it is now his sister half turned to face him ellen como just came in for fifty thousand which brings us up toyoure not going to believe thistwo hundred twentyfive thousand dollars mickeys mouth dropped no way hunt nodded the phones been ringing off the hook ten here fifteen there a couple more twentyfives this was a brilliant idea uhoh mickey said tams right i can feel my head getting bigger he pushed on the sides of it with both hands stop he cried in mock desperation stop then smiling its no use im going to have to buy a new hat you dont have a hat tam replied ive never seen you wear a hat whew thats lucky i could have been out a perfectly good hat ill buy you the damn hat hunt said when the telephone rang again tamara pushed her brother to the side and ran over to her desk hunt came up to stand beside mickey at the door waiting to hear what was coming next the hunt club tamara speaking how can i help you a pause then yes yes we are uhhuh that would be us just a minute mr hunt is handling that ill let you speak with him she covered the receiver and looked over its somebody from len turners office she said youre not going to believe this but the board of supervisors just voted to pitch in by the time hunt left the office the city had pledged thirty thousand dollars and the total reward from still other nonprofits had grown to three hundred thousand it was a lifeline so he was in high spirits as following ellen comos phoned instructions he pulled his mini cooper into the sandstone driveway in front of the mansion on cervantes street getting out of the car he looked up at the façade in front of him marveling at the way some people managed to live he loved his giant old warehouse of course but that was industrial and mostly his own handiwork this place just took his breath away looking as though it had only yesterday been painted a rich tuscan orange it might have been plunked down whole and set here from the hills outside florence an actual turret rose over a circular entryway giving the place the feel of a castle one side of the face of the second story was a picture window that would he knew command a view of the marina the bay and the golden gate bridge beyond over the garage directly in front of him a riot of bougainvillea bloomed and above that apparently another entire wing stretched to the property line at the side and well into the back he took the fifteen curving steps up through a flowering garden of herbs and brightly colored blossoms and stopped at the top to check out the view behind him which was if anything grander and more expansive than hed imagined even the entry floor here was higher than the tops of the residences across the street so the vista included the dome of the palace of the legion of honor in the lagoon in front of which mickey had found comos body and beyond that the greenery of the presidio he tarried a moment longer taking it all in and was just about to turn and ring the doorbell when the door suddenly opened behind him mr hunt ellen como waited expectantly i didnt hear the bell but i saw you standing out here hunt shrugged an apology im afraid i got mesmerized for a minute this is quite a view you have cursorily glancing behind him she nodded i tend not to notice it much anymore it never changes you know but please she stepped back and pulled the door with her do come in they sat on matching chairs with a table between them the table held a plate of chocolate chip cookies a floral pitcher of water a coffeepot sugar and cream two cups and saucers and two glasses ellen was very nearly beautiful obviously fit and exquisitely turned out here in the midafternoon she wore a demure dark brown tailored evening dress not a perfectly dyed reddishbrown hair on her head was out of place hunt thought it was possible that shed had a face lift and maybe other cosmetic surgery particularly around the eyes but if so the work was all but undetectable he noticed her handsusually a giveaway of ageand they were smooth and gracefullooking she might equally have been thirtyfive or fortyfive and at whatever age a product of wealth and breeding before we get started hunt began i wanted to express my condolences to you i realize that this must be an incredibly difficult time and if at any point you dont feel up to talking she acknowledged him with a small nod a tiny lift of her cheekbones that might have been an attempt at a smile thank you but i asked you here if you recall im very grateful to you for coming out of course so how can i help you she gathered herself drew in a breath folded her hands together on her lap her shapely legs were crossed at the ankles under her chair you said youd be looking into tips you got from people who might want to claim part or all of the reward right well i thought to do that efficiently you might need to have background on dominic on what he was involved in who he was involved with hunt decided to come out with it right away are you talking about alicia thorpe hed already gotten the report from mickey that ellen had sent juhle and russo to talk to alicia to consider her a suspect ellen como narrowed her eyes perhaps surprised by the question i mentioned her to the police she said and they didnt seem too interested they seemed more concerned with where i was my socalled alibi hunt was canted forward on the chair comfortable they did go and interview her he said i think the problem is that they dont have any physical evidence yet the murder weapon anything like that so youve been talking to them too the police hunt gave her what he hoped was a reassuring look last time just about three hours ago were in pretty close communication when you saw them did they mention that girl as a matter of fact they did i think theyre considering her a person of interest at this time but as i say since theres no actual evidence her eyes flashed in sudden anger what do they need theres plenty of evidence that she and my husband i told them this but they wont do anything im sure they would if they could maam theyre under a lot of pressure to make an arrest soon if they get something on anybody theyll move quickly on it she now came forward herself listen to me im telling you for an absolute fact that my husband was infatuated with that girl he told me so himself he thought it was only fair that i should know she coughed out a bitter laugh he said they hadnt done anything if you want to believe that lorraine hess as much as told me that she caught them in flagrante in the office and she said it wasnt the first time as if that mattered he said he was just kind of in love with her whereas he loved me that was the real thing where with her it was just something he was going through he was sure hed get over it but he wanted me to know he wanted to be honest whatever that meant it was all so civilized he didnt want to hurt our marriage so what did you do when he told you that what did i do i didnt do anything for a while i was just numb here was my husband of thirtytwo years telling me he was in love with another woman but somehow that didnt mean he didnt love me too or even more so for a couple of weeks i think i just sleepwalked around the house trying to understand she let out a long breath and straightened up with her back against her chair then i came to my senses and told him that i just couldnt take this any longer that he had to fire her when was this im not sure exactly not the exact day but recently anyway in the last week before he he disappeared and what did he say to that your demand that he fire her he said he didnt know if he could it wouldnt be fair to her suddenly she slapped her palm down on her lap and again and again fair fair fair as if what he was doing to me was fair all that talk of fair it made me sick literally sick he didnt know if he could can you imagine hunt could only nod he kept saying that because they werent doing anything and by that he meant having sex that he was still faithful to me that he wasnt cheating but i didnt even know what he meant by having sex i mean since clinton who knows what that means anymore maybe they were doing everything but she blew out heavily oh listen to me it doesnt matter what they were doing he was in love with her that was the important thing hunt gave her a few seconds to get herself under control then he spoke quietly so what finally happened how did you leave it her head nodded several times last weekend his last weekend i mean i told him i was kicking him out if he didnt fire her that was it i couldnt take it anymore we had a terrific fight and and he agreed he agreed to fire alicia yes i told him it was me or her and for once he made the right decision and this was just before he went missing another nod a day or two before hunt mulled this over for a moment then raised his eyes to meet hers ellen did you tell all this to the police she hesitated not all of it she said then went on they made it clear they thought it might have been me who killed him they wanted to know what i had done the night the tuesday night they kept going on about was i sure what id done and what time id gone to sleep and why didnt i report him missing until the next day she sighed anyway it was just clear to me that they thought it must be the spouse it was always the spouse they werent going to look too closely at the thorpe girl no matter what i said they already thought it was me but then i got to thinking that maybe i didnt tell them what theyd need if they talked to her i was just mad and not thinking too clearly since theyd only just told me theyd found dominic hunt paused again so did he in fact fire her yes she tightened her lips on that tuesday he called me at home to tell me specifically that he had told her it was over she was done working for him she gathered herself drew herself up then ill tell you what happened then she met with him that night to beg to get her job back and he told her he couldnt give it to her and she went into a rage and killed him hunt let out a breath this was a compelling and believable enough scenario unfortunately for ellen there was an equally compelling argument to be made that everything had been exactly as she had described it except for dominic actually firing alicia instead perhaps ellen had followed him to the palace of fine arts and heard him tell alicia he was leaving his wife to be with her if it was going to be either alicia or ellen como might have said it would be alicia and so by the time alicia left ellen had worked up enough of her own jealous rage to kill him herself but hunt only said do you mind if i go back to the police and give them the parts of this story you left out not at all she said i wish you would i should have told them the first time i just wasnt thinking clearly they may want to come back and talk to you again that would be fine she said then she added i know if they look theyll find something on her then suddenly as though someone had thrown a switch she broke a really beaming smile wiped her palms on her dress and stood up ive already sent len my check she said crossing back to one of the sideboards she turned this is going to sound a little funny she said hunt got up on his feet as well whats that if it turns out that that girl did kill dominic and im certain that it will and its on my information that they get her im going to claim that reward all of it the press release went out at and tamara got the first call at youall aint cops right cause i aint talkin to no cops the caller identified herself as virginia collins and she lived alone on a thirtyfoot sailboat named delightly berthed in the marina shed heard the announcement about the reward on knbcs four oclock news on her radio and she wanted to know who she could talk to to give her information she wanted to make sure that there was a record of exactly who she was and when she had called so that if her information checked out she would get the reward shed heard all kinds of stories she told tamara about where theyd announce a reward and then deny payment to the person who really helped get the arrest and conviction because they werent connected and didnt know anybody who had to do with releasing the reward funds and also she wanted to know about the conviction part what if they just arrested the person youd helped to identify and then they couldnt convict did you still get the money or any part of it and while she was at it did tamara know how hard it was to get convictions on anybody in san francisco it was common knowledge that juries in this town never convicted virginias brother john had been an attorney for a while working for the da this was back in the eighties and even then it was nearly impossible to get a jury to convict somebody and what if there was a plea bargain did that count they should definitely give some portion of the reward for the arrest itself and then a bonus for the conviction what about if they arrest the wrong person tamara had to ask that never happens virginia replied they arrest somebody you can pretty well bet that they did it but you see the problem tamara persisted they arrest somebody and give you half the money or whatever and then they find somebody else actually did it and theyve already lost the payment then what thats why theyve got to have the conviction along with the arrest okay thats a good point but even so i want to make sure theres a record i called and what i told you and when like if im first that ought to make a difference a big difference im sure it will tamara said by now she had concluded she was talking to if not a certified lunatic then certainly someone light on a few critical synapses can you tell me briefly the nature of your information are you kidding i dont think so virginia replied not on the telephone theyre all tapped you know the cops i give you the information they solve the crime take all the credit i dont get no reward i aint talkin to no cops i dont think all the phones are tapped tamara countered not anymore a brief harrumph well if you believe that if i were you id just be a lot more careful somebodys listening in i can tell you that for a fact youre not on a cell phone there at your office are you no weve got a landline well maybe thats a little better at least they cant pluck it out of the air but they can tap a landline just as easy especially an investigators office like yours ill try to be careful what i say then maybe you can give me a few more details on your contact information at least and we can have someone call you back or set up an interview i wouldnt have them call no right of course you said you were down on a boat at the marina mickey had actually been out on real work serving a subpoena on a dental hygienist named paula chow who had worked in the offices of bernard offit for six years ending her employment with him a couple of years before it seems that while treating female patients for tmj or in laymans terms clicking of and pain in the jaw dr offit had developed a technique that included massaging the breasts of these women eventually fourteen victims of this questionable treatment came forward and pressed charges dr offits defense attorney contending that this technique was indeed not just defensible but therapeutic needed to call witnesses such as ms chow who would testify that dr offit was a fine man and a good boss and would never have done anything so tawdry for his own sexual gratification and more particularly that she had seen him administer this treatment and that none of the patients had complained at the time nor had there been any sexual component to it mickey found ms chow at her new place of employment at a dentists office on clement street and served her for a court date the following week he then called his sister at work to check in she told him that right at this moment mickey was needed to go talk to a possibly crazy woman who lived on a boat in the marina what makes you think shes possibly crazy youll see so he drove out park presidio and around to the same marina parking lot hed used last friday morning parked and came to the gate leading down to the boats the sun was out by now although the wind was brisk and the bay was a kaleidoscope of sails skidding along over the whitecaps a woman stood just inside the gate with her arms crossed and an impatient look on her face wearing a yellow slicker over painters pants and boat shoes she seemed to be in her late fifties or early sixties with windblown hair the color and consistency of straw im virginia are you the hunt club she asked him with some asperity mickey flashed his disarming smile not the whole thing just pretty much its top operative well good she said i need someone with brains got some id yes maam mickey flashed her his drivers license and gave her a hunt club business card this was a long way from identifying him as a private investigator but it seemed to satisfy her only after shed perused the card for a long ten seconds did she reach into her pocket for the key to the lock while unfastening it she shot him a squinty look cant be too careful you know yes maam i couldnt agree more theres a lot more rape going on than people report right people look at me fiftyseven going on thirty i always say and tell me i shouldnt worry about rape im too old but you know rapes not a sexual crime its not about sex its about hate and anger there was a woman last month sixtytwo over in berkeley in a wheelchair can you believe mugged and as they say sexually assaulted which means raped anyway thats why i like it down here behind this fence nobody gets in here doesnt know one of the boat owners good policy mickey said she looked him a good hard squint in the eye for a second or two possibly to see if he was fooling with her but again he must have passed her scrutiny because with a follow me then she turned and led him down to a badly misused sailboat near the end of the pier which she stepped onto then she and mickey were seated on cracked and slightly damp cushions around the wheel virginia had some laundry drying hung with clothespins from the guylines on the seaward side from inside the galley came the sound of talk radio mickey had already decided that tamaras call on this woman was correct but crazy people could have good information still he didnt want to take more time than was necessary chatting here so he crossed a leg casual and relaxed leaned back against the seat gave her a smile so virginia i understand you have some information you think might be helpful about the dominic como murder i think i do yes do you need anything to verify the time were talking is there some official form or something we sign that i can keep a copy of mickey feeling that maybe tamara hadnt sufficiently prepped him here figuratively put on his tap dancing shoes well he said im sure we could have you come down to the office and we could write up a statement for you to sign and have it notarized if it comes to that but why would you want that exactly the reward she said simply so someone dont steal the reward from me ah an nobody tells the cops who i am i come up with something first and then next thing you know everybody knows it because i told it and suddenly nobody remembers where it first came to light pretty convenient if you ask me mickey nodded taking all of this very seriously all right virginia he said at length ill tell you what well do if it meets with your approval you tell me what your information is and if we both decide its significant or important enough i can take you down to the office right away and we can draft and notarize your statement then copy it and send you back here with your copy how does that sound she gave him the thousandyard stare again considering then making up her mind she nodded im glad they sent somebody with brains the three of themmickey tamara and wyatt huntsat with their knees all but touching at a small table in a blessedly quiet corner of the quiver bar at the epic roasthouse pat kuletos gorgeous new place on the embarcadero right at the waters edge it was a cocktail hour of celebration about the new work theyd picked up hunt springing for drinks at the end of the day she was absolutely lucid mickey was saying no question about what she saw and what it meant and i must say i dont think any of us would have even thought of it so what was it hunt asked mickey sipped at his beer you really ought to guess if only to get a feeling for how far off we all were she saw the limo out there hunt said after it was supposedly back at sunset not close tam she heard something nope way more obvious she saw something tamara said good from her boat getting warm mickey said wait a minute hunt put in so it happened out by the boats mickey was enjoying the moment leading them on i told you think outside the box we would never ever have thought of this were not even in the right area code and we know it happened because she saw it with her own eyes for a long moment all was silence okay hunt said he actually met somebody on one of the boats they had a fight out there but no thats too far from the lagoon nobodys carrying a dead guy three blocks or even from the boats out to the parking lot no no carrying involved no boats involved either mickey tipped up his beer again put it down gave a lastchance look to his colleagues theatrically he sighed we can call devin juhle and close the case as soon as i tell you guys he said but i thought obvious as it is we might want to talk about it a little first before we bring in the cops one last triumphant glance around the table okay you know the blimp the tourist blimp hunt very slowly nodded airship ventures he said with caution the eureka right thats the one well virginia was out on her deck tuesday night late dusk just enjoying the peace and serenity out there and she notices the eureka coming back from out over the golden gate beautiful if you like blimps and who doesnt just floating around up there but whatever it was a warm night and she just watched it sail pretty much straight overhead a couple of blocks south but really darn close and then suddenly shes looking up at it and she sees somethingim not making this upshe sees something fall out of the thing at first she cant believe what shes seeing but then she realizes it looks like a body and it just falls and falls until it goes out of sight just over the trees about where the lagoon would be lucky they drained it tamara said he might have killed a duck but he hit the lagoon before it was drained mickey said and he didnt hit a duck anyway tamara smiled brightly well that was lucky too youre right hunt said drily we never would have thought of that he fell into the lagoon tamara asked absolutely howd he wind up at the one end tied up in all the roots and stuff must have been the tide mickey said theres no tide in the lagoon hmm mickey said theres a slight snag in the story heres another one hunt said she saw this and didnt call the police ah mickey held up a finger that ones covered she thought the police might think she had something to do with it if she reported it she was going to wait until it was in the paper or on the radio and learned more about it but then they were obviously covering it up somehow at least until she heard about the reward and realized what it must have been which was como tamara put down her cosmopolitan wow i know mickey said i was impressed so now im wondering how many calls like this were going to get wyatt maybe we could figure out a better weedingout process not if they wont talk on the phone tamara said theyre all tapped you know and i dont think virginias the only one that knows it heck mickey said even i know that but really wyatt hunt finished his scotch well lets see how many of em we get we told devin half our work would be weeding out the wackos maybe more and if we dont get some live ones ill be interviewing them too not that it wasnt a good time mickey said hunt made a face no i hear you sounds like it at ten after six hunt walked into the homicide detail and over to juhles desk the inspector looked up and hunt opened a leather folder and extracted several sheets of paper juhle didnt exude joy at the interruption whats this he asked eleven reports one guy didnt give his name or address but we included a summary of his statement nine people gave statements eight to tamara over the phone theyre in order from least obviously crazy to most crazy one lady wouldnt talk on the phone so i sent mickey out to talk to her she saw como fall out of a blimp and i had a chat with mrs como who mentioned a couple of things she forgot to tell you when you interviewed her dont look at me like thatim just the messenger thats ten in two hours dev plus mrs como hunt paused its something he said juhle raised his eyes tell me about the blimp lady at a quarter to seven hunt and juhle had baseball gloves on hunt owned several and were playing hardball catch softtossing alongside the basketball court in hunts warehouse both of them dressed in street clothes what pisses me off juhle was saying is people telling you stuff that they didnt tell me and russo when we talked to them whatd they think we were doing just dicking around hunt caught juhles toss and threw it back people dont trust cops either that or theyre scared of em me and russo she looks about fifteen and scares no one trust me and i cant even scare my own kids its what you represent youre involved with the cops everybody knows that basically youre in some kind of trouble you talk to me or mickey or even tam its just a conversation besides you didnt want to talk to the blimp lady we saved you from that im grateful you guys are my heroes juhle threw hunt caught hunt threw juhle caught juhle said ellen como we talked to ellen como for like an hour maybe more she told us basically nothing helpful and she gives you the store she got the feeling you thought she was a suspect well she wasnt all wrong there she is a suspect note the clever use of the present tense whatd she think she doesnt call to report her missing husband for a whole day she lives two blocks from where they find his body he got left off outside their house no no it cant be her what can we be thinking he unleashed a fastball hey youre gonna throw the arm out again easy hunt demonstrated a nice soft sixty foot toss so anyway he concluded ellens pretty sure its her alicia she said he fired her on that day the very one well the girl said there wasnt anything physical between them hunt caught the next throw and shrugged maybe there wasnt ive seen her if you remember id bet there was but even if there was so what that doesnt mean she killed him and you realize that ellen could have just been trying to deflect the investigation away from herself youre kidding hunt said i never would have thought of that yeah well the thing is they both had a reason and shes the spouse so she gets top billing until we find some evidence leading someplace else and on that front juhle shook his head no somebody must have dragged him to the lake or even went in with him and got him tucked under the trees but theres no sign of struggle on any of the banks weve just got the body with the bump on the head hunt threw what caused the bump any idea me says no pattern injury no definite shape or weight to the weapon other than that something hard a rock a piece of lumber hell a baseball bat an anchor a sap a gun who knows maybe somebody will call you and give you a hint and then you can tell us did i mention that this pisses me off i think so you dangle three hundred grand out thereand by the way thats obscene in its own rightand suddenly youve got witnesses you got people just dying to be good citizens you think any one of em might just think to pick up the phone and tell what they think they know to the police you think that maybe could happen just once you want the truth always hunt caught juhles toss and kept the ball in his mitt signifying the end of the catch i wouldnt hold my breath hunt met his girlfriend gina roake for a late dinner at sams grill sams was a hopping power room during the lunch hour but settled into a more intimate groove as the evening wore on now closing in on nine oclock roake and hunt sat in one of the booths back by the kitchen their waiter had pulled the curtain on them after hed left their dinners and there might as well have been no one else in the restaurant roake was older than hunt closing in on fifty but as an inveterate exerciser and outdoors person she was in excellent shape after twentyfive years in the practice of law shed just recently had her first legal thriller brief deception accepted for publication and she was thinking about her next one most of the dinner theyd talked about what that one might be about and of course the marketing for the first one would they want her to go on tour what about her law practice when she was out of town should she spend her own money on advertising did she want to use the same character in the second book or break in an entirely new one maybe she should go to nonfiction write up one of the real cases shed seen or worked on god knows there had been some good ones did she have a big enough theme did it have to be a murder case hunt nodded got to be murder theyre always murders though all these books right you know why any violent crime thats not a murder has a living victim and the victim can tell you what happened you could write a book but it would probably be pretty short and it wouldnt be much of a mystery she smiled besides people dont care so much about bicycle theft or other lesser crimes except maybe rape now that i think of it you could probably do a rape case but youd have to kill people in it eventually anyway and if youre going to be knocking people off might as well make it a murder case to begin with maybe youre right she put her fork down reached across the small table and took his hand have i been monopolizing the conversation very charmingly but that means yes im sorry nothing to be sorry about its all been interesting and yet in spite of thatshe broke a smileyou seem slightly distracted maybe a little he said maybe a little she repeated then what actually its been a hell of a day good bad i was thinking bad and didnt want to ask youd get to it well in fact in a remarkable and unexpected change of pace its been nothing but good pretty amazingly good in fact he ran down the events for her from tamaras appearance in the office this morning to mickeys idea and the miraculously evergrowing reward the reprieve on his business shortterm at least ending it with ellen como and the tragicomic relief of virginia now and forever to be known as the blimp lady the victims fall from the sky into the lagoon which he concluded weve pretty much discounted as improbable good decision gina shook her head in gentle amusement this town but after another minute her expression grew serious so in effect youre investigating this murder not exactly passing what we find if anything along to juhle is all hes talking to you again im glad to hear that me too i felt a little guilty i still feel a little guilty about driving you guys apart does he know youre still seeing me i assume so hes a cop he knows everything but that doesnt matter it wasnt you and him it was me and him although hes not too thrilled that people seem to be coming to me now and not him is he offering them money too thats what i told him it wasnt much consolation gina sipped wine put her glass down something obviously still on her mind i can hear the gears turning from over here hunt said a fragile smile i just worry about you getting in the face of these murder suspects thats not exactly the same thing as surveillance or rounding up witnesses or subpoena service hunt downplayed it im not really getting in anybodys face gina just passing along information didnt you just tell me you went and saw ellen como well and isnt she a suspect isnt she in fact like the prime suspect even as we speak hunt couldnt reply all im saying roake went on is that the thing about people who have actually murdered someone theres always some small chance theyll feel the need to do it again i dont think thats going to happen most victims dont babe thats kind of the point until that last little uhoh i should have seen this coming moment after which oh well too late now she picked up a piece of sourdough looked at it put it back down i dont mean to sound paranoid wyatt and maybe i wouldnt if all this wasnt around dominic como but since it is since it is what stalling gina moved a few more items aroundtwirled her wineglass adjusted the placement of her knife finally she raised her eyes i really dont want to slander the dead especially a dead wellrespected and apparently wellloved community leader but lets just say you dont get to be a power broker in this town on comos level if you dont have a whole lot more going on than meets the eye like what specifically i cant give you specifics i dont know any which is how he wanted it all i can tell you is that things just happened because dominic como laid his hands upon them or didnt happen if he didnt do you know len turner this got all of hunts attention i do hes handling the reward what about him hes handling the reward thats perfect what about him is that cutting to the chase hes ruthless and unethical as well as all but invisible to the general public hes also counsel or was to como and several other of our most successful service oriented nonprofits some have been known to call him consigliere want to hear a story sure okay twenty years ago len turners a young attorney with dewey cheatham and howenot their real name i got it hunt said i thought you would anyway turners got a client who owns this tiny little fouracre parcel of land down by china basin that would be worth about a zillion dollars except for the slight problem that back in world war two and through the fifties it was a us navy munitions and fuel storage facility which means that now its essentially a toxic waste dump down to about a hundred feet but now theres starting to be talk that the giants are going to move to china basin which as youve noticed they have and the whole areas going to be a redevelopment gold mine you with me so far hunt nodded sí okay so turner gets hired to change the zoning and get it approved by the board of supervisors this turns out to be not as difficult as you might think because turners clients had a lot of money to begin with so he simply found experts and hired them to write fraudulent environmental impact reports he then paid off one of the supervisors frank addario to support it and shepherd it through the board but and this is my favorite part the best move he made was anticipating resistance from the conservancy club which coincidentally had about fortynine other questionable sites all over the state they were fighting to save he bribed themtheir president actuallyto the tune of a million dollars to forget this one spot in what was already a severely polluted city environment so what would it hurt so what happened hunt asked so the zoning got changed and everybody won except of course the city as soon as a buyer appeared and got about two months into the cleanup and discovered that the land essentially could never be used didnt they sue sure and they even won in the sense that the sale got rescinded but and this is the truly great part turner and his clients then turned around and sued the city for approving the zoning change in the first place they hadnt done their due diligence et cetera and finally the city settled with these cretins to the tune of like ten million dollars can this guy turner be my lawyer hunt asked gina gave him a sweet smile no because im your lawyer but you see what i mean and the story isnt over yet im listening okay before the settlement while all the stink is going on over this deal and the lawsuit needless to say all the supervisors who voted for the zoning change are taking a lot of heat at about this time como enters the picture or this particular picture hunt cocked his head how do you know all this roake hit him with a level gaze mostly david this was her former fiancé david freeman who for forty or more years before he died had been one of the citys legal titans he was counsel for the conservancy club aha okay back to como como sees an opportunity here and starts pumping money that certain development interests had been donating to the sunset youth project into the campaigns of the supervisors who are running to unseat the scoundrels who have helped perpetrate this fraud on the city thats got to be illegal oh its illegal all right but illegal only matters if someone is going to pursue it criminally and back then in the das office perhaps because the da had a son who was having rehab issues himself there didnt seem to be the will this is getting good hunt said i thought youd enjoy it and so to continue guess what a majority of new supervisors got elected and those are the folks who to avoid the cost and hassle of litigation for the good of the city and to put this ugliness behind them approved the settlement in other words it all just went away oh and one other thing hit me this was also when the city signed over the decrepit and abandoned former ocean park elementary school to the sunset youth project to use as their headquarters wow hunt said nice ending you see why i think it might be smart of you to watch out and pay attention around this thing it might have been comos wife or something else personal all right but it might also have been something altogether different in which case there are interests you dont want to get in the way of wellhunt went back to his mealyou made your point but i still think theres a big difference between these financial shenanigans and people actually killing other people over them you do huh i do well then i better not tell you about addario and ayersthe supervisor and the conservancy club president i bet youre going to though she nodded before the settlement got announced addario apparently committed suicide and ayers was apparently the victim of a hitandrun i notice you said apparently twice in there right solemn gina nodded again good word isnt it apparently is the new allegedly tamara opened her eyes before the alarm went off while it was still dark out and for a moment could not exactly place herself although she had slept in the same murphy bed that shed been using for the past six months she turned to look at the digital clock on the windowsill and saw that it was at and wide awake she tossed the blankets off and sat up shed been sleeping in plaid flannel pajamas that had once been mickeys and they swam on her even with the string on the pants pulled as tight as it would go quickly she made the bed then lifted it gently folding it up into the wall so it wouldnt wake anyone after a quick trip to the bathroom she looked in at where mickey slept and felt a surge of relief and love when she saw his gangly form splayed out on top of his bed closing the door softly she went into the kitchen turned on the one light and set up the mr coffee for eight cups while the coffee gurgled and dripped she rummaged in the refrigerator pulling out a plate covered with strips of leftover lamb then some polenta butter a carton of eggs five minutes later she poured her first cup of coffee added heavy cream andwhat the hellthree sugars then scooped her threeegg concoction onto her plate smothering it with ketchup the first bite was so delicious that it brought tears to her eyes the hunt clubs office was over a chinese gift shop on grant avenue the door was around the corner on sacramento and at twenty minutes early because they were excited about the possibility of more leads coming in by phone mickey and tamara were just getting to that door when coming from the other direction they almost literally ran into the two women who were about to turn into the same doorway and upon recognitionit was gina roake and another younger attorney from her office amy wuthe exclamations and hugging commenced we heard from wyatt you were back were so glad its true weve missed you so much i missed both of you too mickey standing to one side said me too ambiguously and wu came over and gave him a conciliatory buss on the cheek and about half a hug we would have missed you too mickey she said except you just wouldnt go away hunt showed up early too but it was still after everyone had gone upstairs and gotten the office opened up the coffeemaker going the shutters open the three employees were acutely aware of the number blinking at tamaras phone but waited until roake and wu left to go back to their own offices before they encircled the desk while tamara pressed the playback button hi the hunt club this is cecil rand three eight one two two eight four i believe ive seen something that might have to do with the dominic como murder im not sure if its anything and i dont want to have the police think im just trying to waste their time so maybe you could call me back thanks he repeated his number and hung up hello a tentative womans voice is anybody hello my name is well never mind i guess ill just call back when youre there oh super mick said unless you die in the meantime next was another woman no greeting this is nancy neshek im the executive director of the sanctuary house my name may be familiar because my organization has also put up twenty five thousand dollars for the reward so i wont be calling to claim any part of that but i did have a question if one of you could please call me back either at home or my office sometime tomorrow its somewhat important she then left both of her numbers said thank you and goodbye and rang off hey im damien jones over here at the mission street coalition and uh well theres just some stuff goin on here that aint right i mean they say we getting all this foundation money sposed to pay for room and board and food and stuff and then they take it out our pay i dont know how como did it over there at his place you know sunset but if i can get moved over there im applying next my name is eric canard with the san francisco palace duck coalition and i just wanted to inform you that ill be going to the media myself in the next day or two to expose this obviously fraudulent murder youve got everybody talking about and the even more blatant attempt to deflect attention from the situation with the displaced ducks from the palace lagoon which is now as im sure you know just about completely empty i dont know whos putting up all this supposed reward money but i think i can prove that there is both no dead man and no money that will actually be paid for any reward if the hunt club is even in fact your real name after that hangup hunts mouth twitched well mick thats at least one for you the penultimate message was from a real client another of roakes junior associates calling about scheduling a deposition for the first two days of the following week and would wyatt call to verify his availability finally the tentative woman again maddeningly repeating her first message almost verbatimshed call back later when they were there leave a message mickey actually yelled at the telephone leave a goddamn message whats the matter with you he looked at his sister whats the matter with her she afraid somebodys going to jump through the phone and bite her but tamara could only shrug and turn to her boss how do you want to divide these up she asked hunt decided that calls number one and threenancy neshek and cecil randwere worth his time and energy and that mickey would take the other ones leaving eric canard to mickeys own judgment as an obvious flake and publicity hound but one who in fact had probably spent a significant amount of time in and around the lagoon and might have seen something and who would never ever under any circumstances talk to the police for his own part hunt first called nancy nesheks home number and left a message then still before nine am he called sanctuary house which had apparently not yet opened its main office for the day leaving another message there he next called cecil rand who picked up on the first ring and told hunt hed meet him at johnny rockets diner on chestnut street in the marina district rand told hunt he was old and black and rundownlooking youll think im a bum but im not and he would be wearing an almostnew raiders jacket hunt said hed be in his cooper if rand was outside waiting hunt made it down there in about fifteen minutes and saw a man fitting that description standing in the doorway to johnny rockets he was rolling down his window to say hello and ask if he was cecil rand when the man pointed at him said hunt and got a nod in return he jaywalked stopping the traffic through the opposite lane passed in front of the car over to the passenger door and got in cool car he said fastening his seat belt ive always wanted to ride in one of these bigger than it looks isnt it yeah i love it hunt said plus you wouldnt know to look at it but its a rocket ship the thing hauls he looked across at his passenger who came exactly as advertised so where we going hang a right the lagoon hunt gave him another quick glance his clothes were worn but clean and he exuded a kind of raw confidence that made hunt glad hed included cecil as among the legitimate tipsters and his saying that they ought to go to the lagoon was promising it was after all if not the scene of the crime itself then nevertheless a venue of significant interest theyd just turned off chestnut when rand volunteered that he almost hadnt called probably wouldnt have if it hadnt been about dominic although if it turns out i get some of the reward you know that wouldnt hurt none either but even then if it wasnt dominic i dont know if id have bothered but whoever killed him they got to get caught you knew mr como yeah the guy saved my life the phrase struck hunt since hed heard so many other people use it in recent days hows that he asked i did some time growing up down at corcoran you know thats a prison ive heard of it lot of folks havent youd be surprised well you get out of prison its hard to find work maybe youve heard that too his unshaven face wrinkled he obviously thought hed uttered some kind of witticism so i got nowhere to go when i get here back to the city i mean and im in town maybe two weeks standing in line outside the divisadero kitchen the money they give me out of the joint just about all gone and im thinking shit what now and suddenly up comes this limo and pulls in and this guyit turns out its dominic but i dont know it thenhes dressed up like a banker bettern a banker he gets out and hes smiling talking to people right at home with brothers all like that so by the time im inside hes there too his jackets off and hes actually serving up food on my tray and im thinking this is some strange dude and i dont know why but i stop there in front of him and the lord speaks to me and tells me to ask him if he knows where an excon like me can get myself a job and he just stands there lookin at me a minute and then says dont let him leave without snagging him again so i dont take my eyes off him and then hes putting on his jacket and i get up and he actually comes over to me and asks me what i want to do and when can i start and i tell him anything and right now and i can see he likes that cause he says come on out with him and he drives me in his limo out to this house theyre rebuilding over on fell and next thing i know im carrying drywall and learning how to put it up got pretty good at it too i bet you did rand nodded satisfied so there it was steady work with his rehab people until i learned what i was doing and then dominic caught me onto a regular crew i mean real construction work saved my life here pull over here theyd come all the way up to the north end of the lagoon near where mickey had found comos body by now the only water left was visible as little more than a sinuous puddle that ran down the middle of the mud slick that used to be the bottom of the pond now before we get to it maybe i should have said this first rand put a quick hand on hunts arm stopping him from getting out i want to keep it that my name dont get out in front of the police on this thing if it turns out its somethin then its what it is is all but i dont want anybody telling the police who got you here and howd i see it when nobody else did good hunt didnt like to make promises he wasnt sure he could keep but he didnt want to shut rand down either so he nodded ambiguously and let him continue cause you know rand went on they get somebody like me done time next thing its howd he know where to look he must have been part of it you understand what im sayin i do a brusque nod least not till they doin the reward when its over i hear you okay then and they both reached for the door openers as soon as they got out of the car hunt could smell rotting vegetation and gas and he noticed that all along the opposite shore the degraded shoreline had been fenced off no doubt in preparation for the improvements the new rockandconcrete wall cecil rand came around and led him across the street then down across the grassy lawn to the old retaining wall they were still quite a ways from the waterhugging trees that marked the exact site where como had been found but rand didnt seem to know or care about that and stopped perhaps fifty yards short of it and on the street side okay now rand said as they stood looking out over the mud the sky today was heavily overcast and the gray morning light flat and without glare now i aint saying this is absolutely somethin its just what it is all right hunt said what are we looking at rand moved in closer next to hunt and pointed slightly off to his right i was walking by here last night before dark and stopped right here seen it and started thinkin on the reward put my stogie out here to mark the spot so id get it right hunt looked down and saw the carbon x on the low wall then his eyes came up following where rand was pointing just this side of the last of the water rand said its still there what though and then hunt squinted maybe ninety feet away from where he stood and still ten feet on this side of the puddle the smooth flat surface of the mud yielded an instantly recognizable shape out of place among the smattering of roots and bottles and rotting algae it looked like two sticks crossed at perfect right angles but hunt knew what it was even as he said i see it you mean the tire iron rand was nodding and nodding the corners of his mouth turned up in satisfaction im seein that ol thing in the mud last night and thinkin i be lookin at what got used on dominic the headquarters for the mission street coalitions moving company occupied two large warehouses and an office that was little more than a shed in the light industrial neighborhood a couple of blocks off cesar chavez boulevard between the and freeways mickey clueless drove out to the coalitions residential home on dolores got there at about ninethirty then asked around and at the desk for damien jones the administrative bureaucracy at the home wasnt the most organized system mickey had ever encountered and it took him nearly a half hour to hunt down damiens likely whereabouts and he only succeeded then because inadvertently he had run into the executive director of the program jaime sanchez and his wife lola identifying himself for what he was an associate with the hunt club mickey had explained that mr jones had called the reward hotline number at the office yesterday and apparently had some information relating to the murder of dominic como this seemed to surprise and slightly displease both of the sanchezes they couldnt imagine what that might be or why damien hadnt told them first but nevertheless mr sanchez directed mickey to the moving companys headquarters where he arrived at tentwenty only to discover that mr jones was out with a moving crew on a job at forty second avenue almost to the beach and a good half hours drive or more from headquarters before he started that drive though mickey took a frustration break and called his sister at the office giving her the playbyplay of his morning so far which had produced nothing at all even in the limited realm of eliminating spurious claims to the reward money so now im off to fortysecond avenue fortysecond avenue thats like five blocks before you leave the continent do you realize that the way this mornings going im not even going to lay eyes on this jones guy until noon and thats if hes not on his lunch break someplace else and all for what so i can get to meet another blimp lady except this guys a guy this is dumb isnt there somebody else i can check out did that girl ever call back i can check out damien jones when he comes back home tonight if he does if his names even jones which now that i think about it it probably isnt well well what mick did you ask me a question i bet i asked you a hundred in there try one again one okay have we gotten any new calls yes great who hangup lady not her not yet but actually weve gotten three more the bad news being that they all sound to me like wyatts going to give them to you if i had to bet are they closer than damien jones i mean physically closer maybe i can see one of them on the way out to see him or all of them i think maybe you should wait until wyatt decides dont you his sisters voice of calm reason finally made an impact mickey let out a deep sigh into the telephone and said probably he took another breath speaking of which you get any word from him as a matter of fact i have the guy he met this morning he thinks he might have come up with the murder weapon yes news of success on any front pumped mickey right up what is it a tire iron they found in the lagoon hes called devin and they should be over there by now that is so great mickey said do you think this reward thing might actually work sis would that be cool or what very cool mickey very cool but lets just see what happens see if the tire iron i mean if they can tell and then where it leads if anywhere but at least its something some real evidence maybe okay mickey said okay what okay im motivated again well keep doing it this way meanwhile what are you doing for lunch she hesitated i havent really thought about it i had a huge breakfast you know this morning i remember but theyve got this new theory where you can eat two or even three meals in one day and it wont kill you in fact it might even be good for you dont worry ill get something she said youd better therell be a quiz on what it was when i get back damien jones at long last mickey got the strong impression that damiens boss wasnt happy to give him time off for this interview but mickey had told him the halftruth that mr sanchez had directed him how to find mr jones intimating that the big boss himself wanted the interview to proceed now mickey and damien had walked a few houses down the street from the movein job site and were sitting on concrete steps leading up to one of the other houses out here the gray cloud cover was thick but high enough that it wasnt quite fog in spite of that every few minutes the deep bass of a foghorn punctuated the early afternoon stillness since mr jones had called with information that seemed to have at least an oblique relevance to the investigation mickey found that he had to summon all of his patience as it quickly became obvious that damien was under the influence of some kind of controlled substance during the first few questions trying to establish a rapport with the young workman it wasnt even obvious that damien remembered the substance of his call to the hunt club the previous night so mickey gently prodded you said something about the fact that the foundation was supposed to pay for your room and board but now you were paying and it wasnt fair right right and that mr como didnt do the same thing at his place the sunset youth project okay okay and that this somehow had something to do with his murder damien sat on the step with his elbows on his knees staring straight in front of him to all appearances stumped after a minute he laughed softly to himself hung his head and shook it seemed like i had it all worked out last night but that wasnt exactly it what you just said mickey nodded all understanding although he knew that if this was all he was going to get after the four hours hed spent tracking this bozo down hed be sorely tempted to kill him still he reined himself in and managed to sound sincere thats all right he said but that dont mean it isnt true mickey wasnt clear what antecedent damien was referring to here and in fact was reasonably sure that damien couldnt identify it himself but all he said was no i know i mean its a racket you know what is the whole you know the rehab thing a racket yeah hows that well damien looked up the street making sure he was still out of earshot the foghorn sounded and he continued you know they collecting money from the foundations big money suddenly mickey felt a chill raise the hairs on his arms unbidden the discussion hed had with alicia thorpe the other day about the sunset youth projects funding from the city and from other foundations came back to him in sharp detail particularly her disclosure that the citys health services department was the biggest single line item in the citys budget and now here was mr jones no relation to mr einstein referring to the same thing which didnt necessarily mean anything except for the rather salient fact that mr jones addled as he might be or might have been last night somehow was introducing this funding issue into a discussion about dominic comos murder and now it seemed jones had found a scent and it was mickeys job to keep him on it right he said so the mission street coalition gets money from the city so what so what is they sposed to use that to keep up the program but it dont go to no program so wheres it go damien now that i wish i knew he clucked in disappointment but oh yeah this what i was sayin the whole thing is they get me stead of jail into the program here okay right okay the thing is they aint no program to the program you know what im sayin thinking patience young jedi mickey said not exactly maybe you can tell me okay heres the thing we here for the rehab you know otherwise we maybe in jail right right so we get here aint nobody doin that twelvestep shuffle aint nobody urine testing we just come in and say no we aint doin no shit and sign this form and then we done except they make us work getting a little wound up now damien joness expressive face went into a deep frown hey look at me now whatchu think i been doin all day cept humping these loads and the company the coalition they chargin the same as like bekins you know the moving people and they sposedly payin us fair but we dont never get to see no money see what im sayin thats the money goes for rent and food my money not no foundation money so wheres all that foundation money go thats what i want to know so bottom line is they got me workin for a year payin all the bills here and meanwhile i dont do every little thing they ask im out of the program and back in jail you want to know the truth they got theirselves a bunch a slaves workin here nothin less and im one of em and that aint right no it isnt mickey said and im glad you decided to tell me about all this but you called last night originally about the reward and im afraid if this doesnt have anything to do with the murder of dominic como well you know what im saying dont you for a long minute mickey thought hed lost damien for good the faraway stare came back the exhausted elbowsonhisknees posture methodically he bobbed his head as though listening to his own private soundtrack then when at last he spoke mickey could barely hear him you know them battalion people out there again one of alicias references sort of an urban peace corps and mickey snapped back to full attention what about them well brothers i know in there they gettin paid all right and they dont do no real work so im thinkin hows that happen and how do i get some of that what do you mean they dont do work damien rolled his eyes explaining the obvious i mean work like im doing humpin loads cleanin up sweepin kitchen work like that so what do they do whatever dominic como says ah the explanation didnt really turn any light on for mickey but now at least como was overtly in the conversation now the trick was to keep him there so youre saying what exactly well first i want to get me some of that that might be a little difficult damien since comos dead now okay yeah okay but im talking if here his eyes brightened his whole demeanor perked up and he snapped his fingers here it is here it is thinkin on the reward now what i got last night hit me okay im in that battalion right like the most i got to do is wash a car or pass out some pamphlets or answer some phones some shit like that basically nothing you with me so far so say i fuck up a little maybe go off the rehab something smallmaybe a doob or a beer one time you know they test out there not like here anyway who knows why i get on comos bad side and now hes tellin me im done with the battalion im back in the shit workin like im doin here or say even better im close to done with my time and he says hes gonna violate me back to jail out of the program see what im sayin now still not completely im afraid hey he kicks me out now i am fucked i cant let that happen i got to stop him before you know so you kill him damien jones threw his hands up in celebration flashed mickey his brightest smile now you got it thats what im talkin about he kept nodding as though making sure that the strands of his argument if thats what it was held together thats what im talkin about now he looked straight at mickey thats where you look at them battalion people its one of them hallelujah and you know where to find me suddenly and thoroughly deflated mickey all at once came to the fullblown realization that in spite of damiens enthusiastic narrative he was in his own way another variant on the blimp lady if not nuts then certainly and fundamentally unhelpful by now just about completely baffled by trying to fathom the solution that damien had apparently reached and was sharing with him mickey leaned in toward the young man and just so im sure i understand damien youre saying you think mr comos killer is one of these battalion people im saying you look there i bet you gonna be happy you did and if we do after that why exactly do we need to find you then damien straightened his back put on a look of surprised indignation what we been talkin bout all this time first i get his place in the battalion out there the killers and second cause then you got to give me that reward hunt had called devin juhle and sarah russo within minutes of his initial sighting of the tire iron but theyd been in the field on another matter and hadnt checked back in with him until lunchtime meanwhile hed taken down cecil rands vitals and promised to keep him anonymous at least until it was determined if the tire iron out in the mud was tied in any way to the death of dominic como after rand had gone hunt then tried again to reach nancy neshek but she hadnt come in to her office at sanctuary house this morningevidently a regular occurrence what with her fundraising duties andor women in crisis situations and she still wasnt answering at home hed then checked in with tamara to see about any new leads he decided that talking to two more people who identified themselves as members of canards palace duck group probably wasnt even worth mickeys time and he himself wasnt inclined to call belinda no last name a psychic who if put in close contact with comos body could recreate his last hours and thus probably shed enormous light on the murder and reluctant to abandon his post lest someone come and remove his possible evidence while no one was guarding it he put his back up against a tree and waited now finally juhle and russo stood with hunt at the concrete edge of the mud flat that had once been the lagoon the cloud cover had mostly burned off and now the mud had a dull shine making identification of anything somewhat problematic and even if i see it which i dont juhle was saying how do you know it has anything to do with anything i dont but its there all right hunt said and since it might be evidence in a murder youre investigating i thought youd call those fine upstanding people from crime scene investigations to collect it for you im going to go look at it russo said are you shitting me juhle asked its kneedeep mud out there sarah and you cant touch it till csi gets here anyway im not going to touch it but were not calling csi if it turns out its a pipe thats been in this lagoon for a hundred years you guys watch my shoes and she sat on the wall and started removing them all right juhle sat next to her god damn it ill do it aw dev youre so cute when you get all guyprotective she held out a hand to him but im good really im a mom after all ive already waded through tons and tons of shit and this is only mud ill think of it as a spa treatment but you wyatt she added you better point me straight at it or ill arrest your sorry ass on any charge i can think of or even one i make up hunt turned to juhle shes a little harsh dont you think you want to see harsh point me even a little bit the wrong way and so saying she finished tucking her socks into her shoes next she rolled up the bottoms of her pants and swung herself around lowering herself into the mud into which she sank as far as her ankles for the record she said this is not warm spa mud after a good shiver she added okay wyatt point hunt stood at the charcoal x that rand had drawn with his cigar the night before he had a decent idea of the location of the tire iron and pointed out a tree on the opposite bank that russo should head for its ten or twelve feet before you get to the water you cant miss it she turned back to him id better not cause i tell you right now im not going to spend a lot of time mucking around looking for it it was truly one slippery step at a time and she walked gingerly when she was about halfway there hunt said id have thought youd have dragged this lake already we did we took out six dumpsters of shit so howd you miss this i dont know murphys law juhle grunted anyway were here now for all the good its going to do us why wouldnt it because the water washes away the trace evidence except not all of it not all the time well see just at this moment a blackandwhite police car pulled to the curb above them and emitted a short onenote blast of his siren hunt and juhle turned and saw two uniformed policemen coming out of the car and down the grass looking stern and ready for action excuse me gentlemen the lead cop said would you mind telling me but juhle already had stepped in front of hunt with his id out introducing himself saying the magic word homicide juhle instantly transformed the cops into two nice guys who wanted to know if there was anything they could do to help shes got it hunt said and sure enough russo was straightening up out in the middle of the mud waving her arms juhle turned back to the cops actually guys you can help one of you please call dispatch and have em get csi down here as fast as they can move tell them its the como one eightyseven lorraine hess associate director of the sunset youth project stood wringing her hands in her office doorway facing the two police inspectors but youre saying you dont know if its from the limousine yet is that right thats right sarah russo naturally taking point with the obviously distracted woman nodded and spoke in her wellmodulated educated nonthreatening voice all weve done so far is sent the tire iron itself directly down to the police laboratory for analysis and all we know so far is that its the basic kind of tire iron that comes standard on a lot of cars including the lincoln town car theres a small chance if it was the murder weapon that it will still have at least traces of mr comos hair or blood or something recoverable through dna although maybe not in any event though the things a mess and its going to take some time maybe a lot of time to find out what were dealing with there for sure she trotted out her professional smile which looked entirely genuine in the meanwhile inspector juhle and i got to talking and realized that it would probably be worth our while to see if there was still a tire iron in mr comos limousine but why hess asked i thought the limousine was back here by the time he was murdered thats what weve heard juhle decided to speak up that may be true but it is true i believe inspector well be that as it may if the tire iron is in fact missingjuhle shrugged nonchalantit at least opens the door to the possibility that someone from here at sunset might have been involved in the murder but the tire iron could be gone from the limo and still not have been the murder weapon yes of course sarah said and by the same token if it isnt gone then were pretty much back where we started it could be any tire iron from any one of hundreds of cars in the city anyway the point is with your permission wed just like to look hess brushed a vagrant hair away from her forehead well sure i mean that goes without saying but dont you need a warrant or something like that juhle flashed a glance at russo at the unexpected question he cleared his throat a warrant would give us the absolute right to take that car apart and look all through it he said and im sure we could get one in short order but we thought we could save some time and energy trying to find mr comos killer by just coming out here and asking if we could check the trunk thats all right hess said of course parked along the side right russo asked do you have a set of keys yes and yes im sure ive got a spare bunch of them here somewhere or maybe in dominics office can you give me a minute russo nodded all the time you need hess turned and went back into her office opened a drawer or two sighed closed the drawers again then came by the inspectors again and walked across the lobby and into comos office a little nervous dont you think juhle whispered she doesnt want to think its one of her people id think shed be happy for the chance to prove its probably not any of them i mean if the tire irons there i know what youre saying but the more i think about it what does that really mean if its there it means nothing if its not there by itself it means nothing either it means somebody took it out big deal when six months ago yesterday and even if our very own tire iron from the lagoon is what killed him how do we know its that particular limos tire iron after all we dont thats what makes this job so much fun but it might in fact narrow the field and you agreed to come out here if you remember i just dont know what were going to do if we find its gone if it is itll lead to something you just watch great she said words to live by and then lorraine hess emerged from dominic comos office holding up a set of keys wearing a smile that managed to be hopeful and fearful at the same time after swearing that shed walked down to union square and bought a hot dog with lemonade and fries for lunch tamara gave mickey the three names on the phone when he called in after the complete strikeout with damien jones but hearing about the duck people and belinda the psychic mickey decided hed be damned if he was going to talk to any of them getting together with nutcases who at least had some kind of a whackedout storydamien or the blimp ladywas one thing but wasting his time with automatic fruitcakes like belinda for example wouldnt help the police or the hunt club there was such a thing as an automatic commonsense pass on certain people and hed make that point to wyatt the next time he saw him meanwhile he told tamara to call him if the mysterious hangup lady or any more or less legitimate crazy person called back and needed to have their evidence debunked but meanwhile he was going to try to call on another source for inside information about dominic como say hi to her for me dang how did she know but alicia didnt pick up when he called her on her cell phone so he left a message and then tried her brother and got another strikeout it was turning out to be that kind of day so he drove back on lincoln alongside golden gate park a plan for the next couple of hours developing in his mind when he got to the panhandle at the east end of the park he found a parking spot and walked back to the bocce court that hid itself very effectively beneath the cypresses maybe his luck was changing because there as hed hoped in the company of three other old geezers was his grandfather lining up a shot mickey waited until hed throwna damn good roll that stopped inside all the other balls and only a couple of inches from the jack it must have been the last shot of the round since it drew enthusiastic applause from parrs team and good natured snarling obscenities from the other men as all of them started walking down the court to pick up when they turned back jim saw mickey and raised a hand you see that shot he asked im on fire today were up eight three this game you know all these reprobates as mickey nodded all around jim asked everything all right tamara okay yeah shes good she loves being back at work ill tell you that otherwise everythings fine except nobody in the world is home which makes it hard to hook up with people so since ive got the time i thought id go get something for dinner and then i thought id stop by and see if theres anything you especially felt like jim shrugged you make it its going to be good so it doesnt really matter even goat another shrug never had it can you just go out and buy goat sure birites got it they can get anything youd really eat goat if i made it id eat anything mick you know me you might check with tam though she might have some thoughts on goat im thinking of inviting somebody else over too whatever jim said im easy one of the bocce players called over and jim told him to keep his fucking shirt on then came back to his grandchild so hows the case going decently i guess tam thinks wyatt might have found the murder weapon meanwhile im eliminating the bad tips and getting to meet a really fun whole new class of people that id never otherwise get to know whats that apparently sane whackjobs no not whats the fun new class of people mick whats the murder weapon a tire iron maybe jim parrs face hardened bastard you getting any closer to who did it not that i know of maybe therell be fingerprints or something on the tire iron but that would be a long shot so probably not shit maybe i should just go out there where sunset and do what i dont know talk to some people see if theyd talk to me find out what was really happening ive got a better idea jim dont do that why not because its a really dumb idea thats why not well its hard for me to believe that nobody out there knows anything at all i mean dominic just has a regular day of work and then goes home and meets somebody who kills him somebody must have known or seen something dont you think yeah i do but we cant seem to get started down any trail that leads anyplace all im saying is maybe i could right and why is that because youre a trained investigator hey smartass im as trained as the next guy if i heard something important i know for damn sure id recognize it i know those people out there but we dont know its one of them well that just goes to show what you know what does that mean it means its staring you right in the face and you dont see it what is the plain simple truth about dominic which is that sunset was his whole life he lived and breathed it morning noon night weekends holidays his whole life get it if somebody killed him and it wasnt completely random it had to have something to do with sunset period maybe only a little bit but something which means its probably right there if you know what to look for this speech since there was little to refute in it shut mickey right up he took a few deep breaths through his nose his mouth a tight line you might be right about that he said finally but you going out there is still a dumb idea oh okay then i wont jim no you convinced me i promise i wont go out there a promise is a promise you know absolutely scouts honor too now listen ive got to get back to kicking some ass in my game and youve got to go buy some goat ill see you tonight all right right once upon a time in the early days of the current administration of district attorney clarence jackman gina roake had been an original member of his kitchen cabinet advising him on municipal and legal matters while he grew into the position to whichmuch to his surprisehed been appointed the cabinet remained in its informal existence meeting almost every tuesday for lunch at lou the greeks for about a year and during that time its members found that they had formed strong bonds with one another defense attorneys like roake her partner dismas hardy and her thenfiancé david freeman somehow managed to find common ground with the likes of jackman the city and countys chief prosecutor and abe glitsky then deputy chief of inspectors of the san francisco police department also among the members of the cabinet was jeff elliot the writer of the chronicles popular citytalk column elliot had contracted multiple sclerosis as a young man and over the years had gradually declined to the point where he now only rarely left his wheelchair or his desk in the basement of the chrons building at fifth street and mission bearded decidedly heavyset and with thick graying hair grown well over his ears he was nevertheless as sharp as ever a repository of pretty much everything that could be known about the city its residents or its institutions public or not now unable to allay her concern about her boyfriend wyatt hunts nonchalance in his attitude toward both his investigation into comos death and the presence of len turner in the mix gina roake was sitting on a hard wooden chair catercorner to elliot in his tiny cubbyhole of an office it was fourthirty on tuesday afternoon actually elliot was telling her if i believed in coincidences id say it was quite a coincidence you happening to come by here today with that question why is that because just today i rummaging around on the surface of his desk he extracted a sheet of paper from a small pile of them well here troglodyte that i am i still ask for and get hard copy galleys they hate me for it but what are they going to do im a star so anyway this is tomorrows column you might find it somewhat interesting citytalk by jeff elliot everyone knows that the murder last tuesday of community activist dominic como has left his flagship sunset youth project syp in a precarious state but citytalk has learned from sources in the citys health services department that its troubles may have begun before mr comos death the sources who wished to remain anonymous because the reports they spoke about were not due to become public until later this week portrayed an organization rife with political intrigue and corruption roake looked up from the page let me guess she said como and his pals were lining their pockets with grant money damn elliot said you stole my scoop who woulda thunk it okay so let me go double or nothing just a wild guess somehow len turners in this up to his eyes elliot sighed youre psychic gina shrugged its a small talent she went back to the column according to documents released by the federal government last friday the syp is to be barred access to federal grants and contracts for up to one year due to its unauthorized use of americorps funds americorps has contributed over million to syp over the past four years according to its contract with americorps syp agreed to use these funds to pay tutors at its ortega campus to redevelop certain selected properties to be used as residential treatment facilities and to assist with marketing and operations in syps other subsidiaries such as its moving company art gallery and theater instead the documents list a number of violations against mr como including misuse of americorps funds for his personal benefit including paying several different drivers to take him to personal appointments wash his car and run personal errands unlawfully supplementing the salaries of instructors at the ortega campus with federal grant funds by enrolling these instructors in the americorps program and giving them federally funded living allowances and education awards improperly using americorps members for political activities such as pamphlet distribution and telephone solicitation misusing americorps members as janitors and clerical personnel at the ortega campus not as tutors so howd they find out gina asked tell me someone in the organization ratted him out i love it when the vipers turn on each other nothing so dramatic at least not that we know of someone with the federal corporation for national and community service caught some irregularities you gotta see the full report its pretty blunt bean counters gina said you gotta love em elliot nodded keep reading now comes the juicy local stuff and affirmation of your psychic power in a closely related matter just this past weekend the san francisco board of supervisors released its yearly budget analysis of the communities of opportunity coo program headed by len turner mr turner apart from this mayoralappointed position also serves as legal counsel to several serviceoriented nonprofit organizations including the mission street coalition the sanctuary house for battered women and notably the syp among several others the coo program has supplied nearly million mostly foundation money from private sources into community redevelopment for some of the citys most povertystricken neighborhoods but the justreleased budget analysis has revealed that despite this influx of cashearmarked for afterschool tutoring health care addiction rehabilitation and job placementthe program has essentially nothing to show for its efforts over the past two years so gina said the supes found out this was coming looks like it and they were shocked shocked that there was gambling going on at ricks exactly so where did the money go read on below is a partial listing of questionable expenses so far unearthed conferences for community development professionals theatrical and musical events consultants and public relations program office and community staff and community outreach beyond these expenses nearly million went to communitybased organizations and other servicesie to the very nonprofits who were charged with administering the coo funds and finally in the coo program alone mr turner pulls down a salary of per year revelations such as these lend credence to the pejorative term sometimes used to describe these professional fundraisers and community activists poverty pimps they like to describe themselves as people who are doing well by doing good they are doing very well indeed in fact judging from the financial improprieties apparent in these two recent reports it seems that in san francisco nonprofit is in fact a high profit big money game and taking into consideration mr comos murder it may also be a deadly one gina roake handed the galley sheet back to jeff elliot looks plenty grafty to me she said not to mention slightly dangerous which is exactly the message ive been trying to get through to wyatt its a good one isnt he getting it not clearly enough i dont believe she paused so off the record what do you think the odds are that these two reportshere she indicated the article shed just readhad nothing whatsoever to do with comos death elliot leaned back and scratched at his beard fifty to one maybe a hundred to one id be stunned if they didnt i would be too the timings just too perfect so the question is why exactly would someone want to kill him over this elliot broke a smile you going for the reward not specifically although if we came up with something really good right here and now id be happy to share with you okay deal elliot stretched out a hand and they shook now give me a second sitting in his wheelchair he closed his eyes head back theory number one takes a bit of a stretch to start out but ends strong lets hear the stretch part all right we assume that como either didnt know about or wasnt handson responsible for any of the stuff from tomorrows column he held up a hand i said it was a stretch but lets assume roake made a face okay but only for the sake of argument fair enough como is a bona fide saint who doesnt know that scandal is about to blow up all over at sunset somebody else lets call him turner for lack of a better word has been screwing with the books and playing loose with the rules for three years or more try twenty roake said okay twenty anyway so last week como gets wind of lets say the americorps problem cutting off his federal grants so he goes to turner his corporate counsel and realizes that its got to have been turner behind the cooking of the books and the misuse of the funds so he meets him alone and calls him on it says hes going to fire him get him kicked off the coo program all of the above turner cant have that happen and voilá he whacks him yeah but turner knows this stuffs going to come out anyway sure but if the community hangs together sunset loses some federal funding for a while but otherwise nothing happens nothing changes on the other hand if como makes a stink turners in deep shit with the whole nonprofit world which is his entire income not to say life roake chewed on it for a moment possible she said if you can buy the premise which im afraid i cant yeah elliot said i dont know if i can either i mean it would be hard to argue that como didnt know he had some drivers taking him around places you know i know so wheres that leave us we need a second theory and i got the first one so its your turn all right roake closed her own eyes okay hows this one of those private interests that provided the funding they got pissed that como was essentially stealing from them personally so they killed him elliot was shaking his head doesnt sing for me at all and besides thats the coo money youre talking about and that reportthe budget analysiswas coming out right about the time somebody killed him so if it was about money the timing says it was about the federal money and turner somehow dont you think all right hows this they both knew about the money problems are either of them looking at prison time over this i dont know youre the lawyer you should know this right me id say not impossible okay lets go with that for the moment say turner knows hes going to jail if its him and como each pointing fingers at each other except if comos dead then its turners finger and that fingers only pointing in one direction at como como stole the money misappropriated the money its all his fault thats good elliot said yeah but if that were the case im surprised turner didnt even try to make it look like a suicidecomo knows hes going down for this and decides to kill himself but still in general terms i think it flies orroakes eyes lit upeven better youre going to like this turners got some rehab and paroled people in these residential units and he hires one of them to take como out they dont do it he violates them back and they go to jail and hell what do they care about como anyway so its a hit at least its a theory that works and weve got to have something involving both len turner and the money right elliot clucked its tempting to think so maybe hunt ought to talk to him thanks jeff she said but thats pretty much exactly what i came here to talk him out of hes basically working for turner but he doesnt want to be messing with him besides turners controlling the funds for the reward elliot raised his eyebrows so youre telling me hunt gives turner a pass hes not going to look at him at all thats my hope theyre just supposed to be a clearinghouse for information going to the police so what do your psychic powers say unfortunately she said they say im whistling in the wind when they looked in the trunk of the limo out at the sunset youth project they found that its tire iron was in fact missing now back at his desk in the homicide detail devin juhle hung up his telephone and looked across his desk and then the desk of his partner russo where she sat with the tip of her tongue sticking out through her lips as she labored over the typed transcription of an interview theyd done on another of their cases picking up a paper clip he tossed it across and she looked up in exasperation what youll never believe who that was george clooney nope guess again if its not george clooney i dont care who it was yes you will she picked up the paper clip unbent it bent it back it couldnt have been the lab already with the tire iron juhle nodded with satisfaction mr como must have been more important than even we thought he was and they found a trace of his dna strong profile and no doubt about it howd the lab even find the dna after that soak in the lake probably that prayer to saint jude i said but really really hair follicle stuck to the tire iron it settled into the mud and the mud covered it up so all of it didnt wash away in a million years it might have been a hair fossil if wed have left it alone juhle leaned back linked his hands around the back of his head you know what this means warrant for the car russos shoulders sagged as she let out a sigh and i suppose were going to want to do this tonight get the warrant tonight impound it tonight before anybody can get it any cleaner do the search first thing tomorrow he gestured to the markedup paperwork on his partners desk sarah whats got into you look what youre working on when the games afoot the trails heating up i can feel it now he was on his feet lets go find us a judge you with me i know youre with me she sighed again with perhaps exaggerated weariness yes kimosabe im with you much to hunts delight tamara had fielded three calls in the afternoon from previous clients who all seemed to have developed amnesia about the last six months or maybe hunt had served sufficient penance for his transgressions and his firms name in the newspaper suddenly announced to the legal world at large that he was back in business if the citys wellconnected serviceoriented charities were entrusting him with work then clearly his name was no longer anathema and his firm no longer a pariah all three of the clients were law firms located in buildings that were within a short walking distance from hunts office and by seventhirty on this tuesday night he was walking out of the last one at market and spear now wrestling with something that had been the least of his worries over the past monthsstaffing in the past two and a half hours hed just reestablished personal relations with these bigtime litigators who needed private investigators to sit in on their depositions or serve subpoenas or locate and deliver witnesses everybody hed talked to seemed genuinely enthusiastic that he was back in businesshad they actually thought hed closed upand all of them had work that of course couldnt wait after all this was the law where nothing could wait everything had to be done yesterday latest when could he start but he only had mickey who didnt have any kind of license besides the one that he used to drive and tamara ditto whod been back on the job for a whole two days now thinking it never rained but it poured but basically happy about it hunt headed back to his office to make some calls to see if he could line up a few underemployed licensed stringers that he could bring on to do some work for him temporarily when he got inside the main door though he noticed the message light blinking and pushed the button to hear juhle pass along the news that hunts anonymous source might be in line for part of the reward after all since the police lab had discovered dominic comos hair on the tire iron theyd retrieved from the drained lagoon and what did hunt think of that hunt thought first that cecil rand would be happy to see some money at the end of this and second that it was not too surprising finding the murder weapon near the scene of the crime although the speed of the police labs analysis was nearly unprecedented he also didnt think any of this was overwhelmingly important it didnt identify a suspect not unless there were fingerprints or other identifying marks on the tire iron and there couldnt have been or juhle would have mentioned them hunt went back through the door behind tamaras station switched on his light and pulling the chair up behind his own desk sat down and started going through the notes hed taken at his various meetings estimating his personnel needs for the next couple of weeks touching his mouse he awakened the computer screen in front of him and he pulled up his address book and then suddenly he wasnt looking at the screen anymore but had slumped back in his chair some barely registered thought nagging at him for a minute maybe more he didnt move except to squeeze the skin around his lower lip finally he got up and walked outside again to the reception area over to tamaras desk there on her yellow pad shed written the names and telephone numbers of the reward callers and up near the top was nancy neshek who hadnt been either at work or at her home all day hunt had tried for the fourth and last time just at five oclock before hed gone out for his first meeting and neither had her workplace heard from her nor had she answered her home telephone hunt sat down in tamaras chair and punched in the neshek home number on the fourth ring the answering machine picked up again and hunt waited and then on the off chance that she was monitoring her calls and would pick up when she heard him he left a brief message identifying himself he then waited again to give her time to reach the phone until at last when it was clear she wasnt going to answer he hung up and sat still again she had called and left a message here last night saying it was somewhat important and that he could reach her either at her home or office the next day shed been very specific he could reach her either at home or her office and he hadnt been able to do so of course something could have come up she might have made other lastminute plans but it had been bothering him at some subconscious level since late in the afternoon and now suddenly it struck him as truly significant five minutes later hunt had used his computer wizardry and discovered her home address on seacliff avenue and was in a cab on his way home there he picked up his cooper it didnt take him fifteen more minutes to pull up outside nancy nesheks house on the cliffs overlooking phelan beach when he got out of his car he was struck in spite of the size and stunning architecture of the homes by how deserted the street felt and how strongly the gusts blew off the ocean a hundred or more feet below in the deepening dusk the twostory neshek home still exuded a pale yellow glow although through its lower windows all was dark inside hunt first went to the front door and rang the doorbell hearing the chimes echo back through the house he checked his watch it was just eight oclock abandoning the front porch he walked down the driveway and around to the side of the garage where a quick look revealed a car parked inside next he crossed over a perfectly manicured gravel path and climbed the six steps up to the back door a thick slab of oak whose large window let hunt look into a kind of mudroom behind what appeared to be the kitchen going back to the car for his flashlight he also slipped on a pair of gloves his heart now pounding in his throat he knew that he could be shot or restrained or arrested now as a cat burglar and no one would blink an eye returning to the back door he tried the handle and verified that it was indeed locked he shone a fast beam of light into the mudroom and kitchen and saw nothing unusual or out of place back down those rear stairs he followed the gravel path again along the back of the house until he came abreast of another bank of windows stepping through the garden and getting to them he saw that they made up the back wall of the dining room in the neighbors house twenty feet over a light came on and he froze an outside door opened over there then slammed shut another gust rattled the trees and hedges behind him drawing a slow breath he got back through the garden and now followed the lawn next to the gravel pathreducing the noise of his footstepsaround the side of the house where the neighbors had just turned on their lights hunt estimated when hed cleared the dining room windows and stepped up to the next bank of them a dog barked somewhere in the neighborhood as he risked another brief beam from his flashlight he shone the light over the floor and the leather couch the rattan rug in the center of the living room and then the matching chairs over on the piano side he would never have seen it if he hadnt caught a glimpse of a river stone fireplace mantel and leaned in at the window to follow the play of his beam over the stones and there with the side of his face pressed against the window on the floor he saw a hand and a portion of an arm before the rest of the body disappeared from his angle of vision mickey rubbed the boneless goatleg roast with olive oil salt pepper rosemary and thyme he inserted fifteen cloves of garlic into slits hed made in the meat and now the smell of the thing cooking with root vegetables in the oven infused the entire small apartment alicia sat on one side of the fold down table tamara and jim parr on the other and after throwing together a beet arugula and goat cheese salad ian had boosted himself up onto the kitchen counter mickey was just stirring the polenta into the pot of boiling and salted water ian had explained with no embarrassment at all that he was an addict and an alcoholic and couldnt drink but everyone else was having cheap rosé in heavy juice glasses they were talking about surfing which was what alicia told them she had been doing all day out at ocean beach how did you not freeze tamara asked oh you never go without a wetsuit its not like surfing in hawaii or even down south if you didnt have a wetsuit you couldnt last five minutes how about the sharks mickey said but alicia was shaking her head not here up in bolinas maybe but not here famous last words ian put in i tell her shes surfing around the general vicinity of seal rock you know why its called seal rock right you know the preferred diet of the great white shark i rest my case but alicia just shook her head ive never even seen a shark out there ian most people who get eaten dont see em either except from the inside well im not planning to get eaten besides youve got to take risks sometimes if you want to do what you want to do suddenly she turned back to face her tablemates am i right mr parr flattered to be included parr nearly choked on his wine and then coughing was shaking his head up and down laughing at himself no guts no glory he said thats my motto and i managed to get myself old living with it youre not old mr parr jim please jim then who is not old in spite of a life of risk then alicia whirled back on her brother see and finally to the rest of them ian doesnt want me sleeping out in my car either too dangerous it is dangerous ian said theres all kinds of nuts out there mickey turned away from the stove you sleep out in your car alicia nodded sometimes last night i did i wanted the early morning waves actually in it mickey asked and tamara clarified adding mickeys been spending about half his nights sleeping outside mostly on the ground though he said i cant stretch out in my car she can ian explained shes got a honda element she can run laps in the damn thing if she takes the seats and her surfboard out why do you do it mick alicia asked sleep out i mean he stirred the polenta for a moment i dont know exactly he said its not structured its peaceful you feel free you wake up with the sun he shrugged i just like it how about you she sighed well heres the thing i get two days off a week monday and tuesday otherwise ive got to be in a dress and nylons and high heels and makeup and sometimes a lot of the time i guess i feel like im trapped so i drive off and sleep where i stop and i dont feel so i dont know so regimented like i can still make some of my own decisions and im not stuck in a life i dont want to live i mean she added look at all of usmaybe not you jimbut the rest of us were just all marking time trying to get into something thats going to feel like our real lives you know you guys going to chef classes and tamara you starting your day job again maybe i sleep out to remind myself that my real self is still there ive still got time ive got game im going to be doing something thats really me someday that matters and as long as im still that person who can just jump up and go sleep out somewhere then thats someone i recognize im still here as though surprised by how much shed revealed about herself she ducked her head a bit into her shoulders and looked around at her audience sorry she said tmi too much information its my inner nerd i cant shut her up thats all right tamara grabbed a bite of arugula from the bowl in front of her were a tolerant household the nerds welcome too mickey was looking in at the goat and now pulled it out of the oven setting it on the top of the stove he covered it with aluminum foil then turned back to the table ten minutes to let the meat rest while the polenta cooks then we eat and you said it better than i could alicia that was pretty much exactly it in spite of her nononsense style of dress tonightshe wore old jeans a plaid flannel shirt and hiking bootsmickey had been fighting the temptation to stare at her since shed come in but now he braved a quick surreptitious look and noticed a faraway glaze and glassiness in her eyes alicia are you okay biting her lip she nodded just you know dealing with the dominic thing again that whole doingsomethingthatmatters is looking a little more distant right now thats all but im okay really parr tipped up his glass then poured himself some more what about dominic did you know him too did she know him ian asked and for the next twenty minutes until the dinner was halfway goneeveryone loving the goatthey covered the common ground between jim and alicia as comos drivers some of the life and politics up at sunset how things were the same and how they had changed yeah but even with all the changes parr was saying everything i hear is that what dominic did was essentially the same he drives around talks to people helps wherever he can serves food drives nails he was just a handson guy im never going to believe dominic was stealing money and irregularities a business this big theres always going to be paperwork problems but if somebody was taking money it wasnt dominic but do you think thats what this is about mickey asked somebody taking money and dominic found out this is whats been getting to me alicia said i cant imagine what its about given who dominic was the man he was it just defies belief well all eyes went to parr but i promised my goodcooking grandson i wouldnt go out there and ask around ian was sitting in the visitors chair at the end of the table and what would you ask about parr put his fork down just what weve all been talking about here somebody taking money maybe somebody who just wanted to take over i mean look at it dominics been doing it his way forever so long as hes there its going to keep getting done the same way but now theres more money and more organization all around am i right more decisions that hes got to take part in but hes not really interested he wants to be on the street cause thats who he is mickey though was shaking his head its a good theory jim but lets not forget that dominic wasnt exactly saint francis of assisi living with a vow of poverty just his legit salary was six hundred and fifty grand a year in this job he held up a hand at the expected opposition around the table not that he didnt earn it but he was also the rainmaker who brought in most of that money and is that a bad thing alicia asked not at all but lets remember that whoever took him out killed the goose who kept laying the golden egg year after year alicia jim here is talking about serving food and driving nails but how often did dominic do fundraisers too almost every day right at least four days a week at least she had to admit mickey shrugged im just saying i havent seen any sign he was slowing down in the job in fact the more we talk about this the more im inclined to start with what al carter saiddominic was meeting somebody he knew over how he could help him that sounds like dominic doesnt it handson oneonone even if the appointment was just an excuse to get dominic alone at least he believed it maybe you should talk to al carter again mickey alicia said and mickey nodded the thought has crossed my mind hunt had sat in his car and pondered for most of fifteen minutes then had placed a call to gina roake she advised him to leave the scene and to make an anonymous call to the police department reporting what hed seen maybe even disguising his voice he wanted she had told him nothing to do with discovering the body of nancy neshek if indeed it was she which he did not doubt but they both knew he could not do that without running the risk of losing his license more than that he just didnt see himself operating like that so about twenty minutes ago he had called juhle and then gone back to sit in his car at the curb the first police vehicle to appear was a blackandwhite sfpd squad car this might turn out to be a dicey moment hunt realized since his precise role here was nebulous at best especially when the crime was murder and the scene was a lockedup darkened mansion in one of the citys most expensive neighborhoods nevertheless there was nothing to do but brazen it out so he flashed his lights briefly at the squad car as it pulled up and emerged from his cooper into the lights of the squad car with his identification held out in front of him im a private investigator named wyatt hunt he announced im the one who called inspector juhle one of the officersthe name badge over his pocket read sorensonjerked a thumb in the direction of the house theres a body in there yeah how do you know i saw it from the window he didnt want to go into too much detail about which window and what hed been doing out here in the first place maybe they wouldnt ask youre sure reasonably yeah okay the cop opened the back door of his squad car please have a seat and well be right back this sounded like a request but hunt knew that squad car doors didnt open from the inside when you were in the backseat and that a cage separated him from access to the cops stuff in the front he was being detained in the nicest possible manner sorenson said lets go lou and they walked together up to the nowdark front porch where sorenson tried the door rang the bell and called out police a couple of times to no response meanwhile his partner was shining a flashlight beam through the windows on either side of the front door after a short discussion they walked back to the squad car and opened the door its all locked up i know the back too right we didnt see anything sorenson said hunt got out its farther to your left he said way over by the corner you saw something over there we didnt see a thing it was lighter out hunt was starting to wish hed taken ginas advice and placed an anonymous call when another figure approached on the street to his right excuse me the man said i live just across there whats going on here but sorenson was within hearing and moved a few steps down the pathway to the door would you please stay back sir this is a potential crime scene a crime scene what happened sorenson had the neighbor and hunt both in his flashlight now were not sure he said as another car pulled up behind sorensons squad car heres the sergeant his partner said lets hope so eventually juhle arrived in his personal camry but not before another squad car a van from channel that must have picked up the dispatch call an ambulance in case the person wasnt in fact dead and needed medical attention and six other localsneighbors who had materialized out of the oncedeserted street by the time juhle got there none of the other five policemen on the scene with their flashlights and looking through the door and front windows had been able to spy the body hunt knew he was going to have to admit hed been over to the side window snooping and was starting to get a bad feeling about it it was a windblown night and late now at least two hours since hunts original phone call to his friend within five minutes after juhle had arrived and after trying to finesse what hed actually done for a little longer hunt had finally directed juhle to the side window where hed seen enough of the body to authorize a breakin then after a brief discussion deciding they could just crawl in and get inside the house if they could unlock and open a window sorenson had punched out a small pane of glass from the bay window on the ground floor opposite the room where the body lay within a minute or so someone had climbed through the window turned on some lights and opened the front door and of course discovered the completely dead body of nancy neshek meanwhile breaking the window had set off the burglar alarm which brought apparently all of the rest of the neighbors outthey numbered at least thirtyalong with four more squad cars to control the crowd hunt leaned back up against the hood of his cooper arms crossed freezing in his light jacket he knew that one day he would laugh about this entire scenario since to the tune of the deafening schoolbell alarm there were now six squad cars two of them with rotating blue and red strobelike lights thirteen cops not including juhle three paramedics and their ambulance and another news van and its crew capturing the absurdity as it unraveled but there wasnt anything really funny about it now finally the alarm company managed to turn off the bellsthe sudden silence like a vacuum in the night this sucks it really does juhle said im not so wild about it myself hunt replied by now it was midnight nancy nesheks body still lay in the living room where someone had hit her more than once with a fireplace poker and where she had subsequently died the crime scene technicians were working and still photographing the scene the coroners assistant was in with them waiting until they were finished before she would order the body moved for the moment she was having a conversation with sarah russo whod finally arrived an hour ago in high dudgeon from her night impounding the limo and an interrupted late dinner she very obviously didnt even want to see hunt and not so much juhle either so hunt and juhle sat outside in the van that served as the mobile command center for sfpd away from the action and the hostility neshek actually called you on this reward thing juhle asked last night but not to give information to ask a question and you dont have any idea was the question was not a clue hunt shook his head except im pretty sure it wasnt if i knew how to compute the circumference of a circle pirsquared juhle said but hunt kept shaking his head nope thats the area i think its pid but that wasnt what she called about anyway juhle hesitated so what got you out here hunt ran it down for himthe original call with its sense of urgency her lack of availability at both of her phone numbers during the whole day but really bottom line he concluded it was just a hunch hunches are good ive got another one then whoever did this did como not impossible maybe even probable he indicated the house lets see if whoever it was left something for us in the way of evidence and by us i mean the police not you and me i thought we were all about share and share alike wrong in fact youre lucky youre not sitting in an interview room downtown and you know it as far as it went this was probably true who was to say that hunt hadnt in fact come out here to speak to neshek and had gotten inside the house where for some reason he struck her down with the poker then set the house alarm locked up walked out and called juhle certainly both juhle and russo had been overtly aware enough of this possibility that they hadnt permitted hunt to enter the house and thus have a ready and benign explanation if they found trace evidence of his presence therea fingerprint a hair follicle hunt had spent time answering questions in police custody before and knew that the only thing that stood between him and another interrogation room right now was the forbearance of juhle and russo and in any event juhle went on ill want a taped interview from you by tomorrow lets say high noon dev come on its its the only offer youre getting from me wyatt and its a damn good one id suggest you take it before i get sarah involved and ask her opinion which i think would be somewhat less lenient wyatt came forward on his chair you realize dev that i didnt even have to call this in i could have gone home and let somebody else discover the body in three days or a week or whenever you could have but that would have been a crime a private eye sees a body hes supposed to report it its kind of like our rule that if you find a body were going to want a statement its all about having a complete file this really isnt negotiable wyatt and its a favor i probably shouldnt even offer but really really in my heart i dont see you killing our victim out there hunt managed to chortle thank you so much youre welcome so tomorrow noon hunt gave it a last try you know comos memorial service is tomorrow at eleven i was planning to go to that see who showed up talk to a few people the whole worlds going to show up yeah but my point is that ill be in the green room at the war memorial when high noon rolls around welljuhles smile had no humor in itthen in that case wed better get your statement before eleven in fact keep talking much longer and well drive downtown right now and get it all polished up before dawn if youd like good it didnt sound good to hunt hed heard the best offer he was going to get so he stood up shook juhles hand told him hed be there before eleven and said good night i know its early hunt began when mickey picked up his phone at around seven oclock the next morning but no sweat mickey replied we saw citytalk and figured whoa tams in the shower now and as soon as shes out were on our way down unless youve got something for us to do out here no we need to talk first before we do anything you guys are great have you heard yet about nancy neshek he hadnt and hunt told him mickey paused to take in the enormity of it this things heating up pretty good isnt it he said at last its not cooling down thats for sure hunt said hunt pulled a chair for himself from the back room and forty minutes after mickey had hung up the phone at his apartment the three of them were all seated and gathered in the tiny reception area at the hunt club weve got some huge issues to deal with today that werent here yesterday hunt began first tam ive got a list for you and ive got to put you on calling in some freelance troops to do some hourly work for us evidently with the reward words gotten out that were in the private investigations business again and im not about to let the opportunity pass because we dont have enough people if i give you the assignments and deadlines you think youd be comfortable doling em out this was a significant increase over any of the responsibilities tamara had shouldered in the past but mickey could see that the idea hit her like a shot of adrenaline hunt clearly was trying to motivate her to stay on take more ownership of her job get back to the way shed been before the meltdown and this appeared to be an effective way to do it if you think i can i know you can get em in here so you can see them in person make sure theyre not stoned or drunk get an idea of what theyre capable of tell them what well pay and parcel out the individual gigs good good all right now we got three new calls this morning but the first two sound like crazies to me we all agree nods all around and no wonder with one call being from belinda the psychic againapparently she was hot on the scent nowand the other from a guy who used to know dominic at one of the projects and had seen him walking around near japantown yesterdayhe was sure of it but the len turner call hunt went on im going to have to talk to him again hell be at the memorial service today as you heard on his phone message hes pretty pissed off he thinks we had something to do with the leak to citytalk if thats what it was mickey raised a finger what do you think it was wyatt i think these reports were due to come out anyway and both turner and dominic knew about them in advance somehow beyond that i think hes a dangerous guy who thinks that since hes paying us well do whatever he wants now i dont know what they did about these reports if anything but obviously somebodys playing fast and loose with this community money and meanwhile i want to protect our position visàvis the reward and turners clearly the guy to see about that but first ive got to waste a couple of hours this morning talking to juhle and russo about finding nesheks body so mick were going to want to change our strategy okay sure whatever this isnt clearinghouse stuff anymore which is why weve got to be careful with mr turner since its not what he thinks hes paying us to do we dont want to give him a reason to pull the plug agreed of course he looked over at tamara see why i love this guy then back to mickey okay even if we havent had any reward calls you and i are both going to get in a quick look at this neshek thing if only because then we can eliminate suspects on como hows that mickey asked if somebodys got an alibi for monday night two nights ago when neshek got killed then odds are they didnt kill como assuming of course which i am that the same person killed both of them do juhle and russo think that tamara asked they wont say so at least not to me but theyd be dumb if they didnt mickey sat his arm resting on the back of his chair apparently relaxed but he couldnt stop tapping his foot so whats the plan the plan is that i go to the memorial service this morning and concentrate on the como people and see if theres any i can eliminate if say mrs como had a bridge group over or went to napa or something on monday night then shes clear same with al carter or even your friend alicia mickey shot a quickangry defensiveglance at his sister then said to hunt what about alicia youre not telling me shes really still a suspect in this well shes a person without an alibi for the time como was killed if shes got one for neshek whats that look tamara answered we had her and her brother over for dinner last night her and her brother his jaw suddenly clamped down hunt looked from tamara to mickey and back again why did you do that because theyre good people mickey said i wanted to have them over were starting to be friends im happy for you wyatt said evenly but theyre alsoor at least she isa suspect in a murder investigation unless shes got an alibi on monday night mickey and tamara shared another furtive look what now hunt said tamara let out a breath she slept out in her car by the beach monday night got up early to surf tuesday morning after a pause hunt asked what beach mickey took it ocean out by seal rock hunt hesitated again did i tell you where nancy neshek lived no the defensive pose sitting heavy on mickey now where just above phelan beach well out that way mickey was shaking his head there is no way alicia killed anybody wyatt if you talked to her youd know that in five minutes how would i know that because you could tell you could just see the person she is hunt just barely did not snort i dont think ive got to remind either of you how unreliable personal reactions can be people can hide things really for truly they can fool you even with who they are he pointed a finger at each of them all of us know this firsthand so excuse me if im not overly enthusiastic about alicias overtures to become your friend she hasnt made any moves wyatt i asked her over to dinner thats true tamara added im sure it is mickey getting a little hot now what do you mean by that hunt held up a restraining palm nothing im just cautioning you to go slow and be a little wary and neither of you should be socializing with these people really but mickey couldnt let it go she didnt do anything wyatt i know she didnt all right wyatt said but let me ask you this did she tell you that dominic como had fired her on the last day of his life the siblings exchanged another glance who told you that mickey asked mrs como who heard it point blank from her husband maybe she was lying to you maybe he was lying to her maybe both hunt admitted but maybe im going to ask alicia about it today if shes at the service not at a nice friendly dinner and while im at it i plan to ask her and al carter if i get the chance if either of them know where they store the tire iron in a lincoln town car why would that matter because we know the weapon that killed dominic como was a tire iron and we know that the tire iron from his limo isnt there anymore we do mickey asked when did we find that out yesterday afternoon juhle and russo went out to sunset and looked and theyre probably looking for more in it now even as we speak after a minute tamara brought up the usual objection that doesnt mean the tire iron that killed him came from that car good tam no it doesnt not automatically but on the other hand theres nothing says it isnt either it certainly could be and mick just consider this your friend alicia who might have just been jilted by him and fired at the same time on the last day we know he was alive had easy access to it and then certainly had access back to him mickey was sitting back his mouth set his hands clenched in his lap this is bullshit no mick these are facts we have to deal with hunt slowed himself down with a breath look im not saying shes guilty of anything she might be the nicest person in the world but shes in this until conflicting evidence or an alibi gets her out okay you cant become friends with her and probably not with her brother either im sorry but you just cant he looked from one of them to the other neither of you a heavy silence settled in the tiny reception area mickey and tamara shared a few more looks until at last mickey came back to hunt his voice again under control so what do you want me to do look around up at sanctuary house nancy nesheks place that would be a start juhle and russo are going to be futzing with the limo and crime scene stuff from last night all morning this gives us a small opening before anybody in sanctuary has a chance to get their guards up so youre going to talk to al carter mickey asked yeah if hes at the service which he should be what about him a shrug one of my lunatics yesterday damien jones maybe he wasnt actually off on everything he said we should look for somebody probably with the battalion but maybe not up at sunset which by the way my grandfather agrees with meanwhile just so youre clear that al carters another guy with access to the tire iron also the last known human to see como alive i dont know about his alibi if any and he hasnt told us very much about comos mysterious last appointment either yeah ill talk to him thats a good thought but listenhunt leaned his lanky form forward his elbows on his kneesthe main thing for all of useven you tamis to be careful here whoever it is this killers now done it twice lets not force a third all were trying to do is collect information and pass the valid stuff along to devin thats all mickey shook his head nice try but its gotten bigger than that wyatt he said a whole lot bigger the address of the administrative headquarters for the sanctuary house for battered women was on potrero avenue near san francisco general hospital unlike the other serviceoriented nonprofits hed visited in the last few days for obvious reasons sanctuary did not shelter educate or test any of its clientele onsiteinstead they were assigned often with their children to one of the organizations seventeen secure locations within the city limits because of this sanctuarys footprint here on potrero was so small as to be nearly invisible mickey drove by what should have been the address twice before he realized that the office must be somewhere among the buildings that made up the much larger hospital complex fifteen minutes after hed finally managed to park in a handicapped zone in the hospitals main but still woefully inadequate lot he found the placeone of many apparently identical offices on the ground floor of the hospitals admitting and triage building it was a typical overused bureaucratic medical landscapealready at nine am long lines had formed at each of the glass windows with the chairs in the main lobby filled with mostly older and poorly dressed patients although there was still the usual complement of mothers with their coughing or sleeping children spaced out young adults and obvious derelicts all waiting in numb patience while the clammy fluorescent lighting lit the area and reflected up at them from the greenish tile flooring the only indication of sanctuary houses presence was the name of the organization stenciled onto the glass doorway now open at the farthest extent of the lobby mickey stood in the doorway for a long moment in front of him a counter bisected most of the room across the front and behind it were mazes of green and gray filing cabinets and a few desks venetian blinds over the high back windows to his left the counter made a right angle and behind it more of the ubiquitous greentinged glass separated out the two or three other offices he heard low voices apparently coming from one or more of those offices but saw no one so he stepped forward and following instructions please ring for assistance pushed the little hotel bell that someone had ducttaped down to the peeling wooden counter in five seconds a tiny and tentative bespectacled young woman appeared from between one of the banks of filing cabinets wearing what looked to mickey like a thriftstore cotton dress and a devastated and yet somehow impatient expression beneath her wire rimmed glasses her eyes were red and swollen mickey at once realized two things that the employees had heard the news about their executive director and that maybe this should have been an assignment for tamarathe vast majority of the time mickey supposed that men here were going to be the enemy it came with the turf still he dredged up a look of respectful solicitude can i help you she asked having done his homework mickey knew the name of the associate director id like to speak to adele watrous he said if shes in is there something i can help you with are you ms watrous no i was hoping to talk to ms watrous its mrs and she is having a difficult morning im afraid we all are can i tell her what this is about mickeys heart went out to this young woman but he was here to get informationspecifically if nancy neshek had mentioned to anyone here the question shed wanted to ask huntand the further down the food chain he went with the staff he thought the less likely the result im afraid its about ms neshek which i can see you already know about im very sorry she opened her mouth to reply but no words came out and then she closed it nodded twice then again and finally disappeared back into the maze after another moment a grandmotherly woman appeared her snowwhite hair was disheveled and she too had clearly been crying but she spoke in a crisp no nonsense manner im adele watrous she said is this about nancy how can i help you im working on the investigation into mr comos death he began and now ms nesheks nancys she made a call to our office on the night she died and i was hoping to talk to you about whatever she might have told you if anything that might shed some light on her death nodding wearily mrs watrous lifted the flipup portion of the counter and motioned him inside into the office proper then led him beyond the first door they passed and into the second one once they were seated the door closed behind them she templed her hands at her mouth and blew into them a time or two regaining her composure when did you hear about it mickey began she sighed this morning the phone started ringing around sixthirty one of our women out at the jackson street facility heard it on the news after that she opened her hands everybody then suddenly in a kind of a double take she seemed to focus on him more clearly you said you were investigating dominic comos death yes and you think nancys is related to that we dont know what we do know is that nancy called the hotline at our office after the reward was announced on monday and said that she had a question an important question and would we please call her the next day here at your offices or at her home she said shed be at one of the two places definitely but never answered at either no she never made it in here on tuesday she paused but that wasnt by any means unusual i mean shed often get called out to one of the sites and have to stay until whenever trailing off she shook her head in obvious dismay and confusion mickey gave her a minute were you both here when the reward on mr comos death was announced and when was that exactly around four in the afternoon well thenshe considered carefullyim sure we were here yes both of us but i dont remember hearing about it here i know we didnt talk about it this was more or less what hunt and mickey had expected but that didnt make the bare factthat watrous had no information about why neshek had called the hunt clubany easier to accept he pursed his lips in frustration might nancy have spoken to anybody else here about it did she stay late for example again mrs watrous gave the question its time and again she shook her head no she left right at five on monday or a little after i stayed on till a little past six grasping at straws mickey asked was that also usual that she left work right around five no usually she stayed much later unless she had a fund raiser or some event or something like that the work here is never finished so we tend to put in some long hours somickey barely daring to hope but here at last was a possible openingwas there something monday night then she started to shake her head again and then abruptly stopped well yes i mean oh god i hadnt even thought of that whats that mrs watrous they were having a coo meeting at city hall coo you know the communities of opportunity oh and speaking of which did you see that thing in the paper this morning the citytalk column thats what they must have been going to talk about that report coming out who was that besides nancy i mean well i suppose all or most of the beneficiaries us mission street sunset delancey all the others now her color suddenly high adele watrous tapped impatiently on her desk people dont realize its harder than it looks youve got to put on a song and dance to get people to come out and give you money for these projects you see whats in the paper today you think its all about throwing this foundation money away on music or public relations consultants or other nonessentials but youve got to spend money to make money especially in these times in this field mr turner understands that theres no other way to do it i believe you mickey said keeping his calm the mention of len turners name in this other context suddenly put his brain on high alert so youre fairly certain that nancy was planning to attend this meeting im sure she was but you can find out if she did easily enough youre right mrs watrous we can wellmickey started to get to his feeti want to thank you for all your help and cooperation here today i know this news must have been brutal it was i still cant make myself believe it and you know whats really so terrible almost the worst part whats that suddenly her weariness seemed to overcome her she sighed again and closed her eyes briefly when she opened them she shook her head in what mickey took to be resignation the worst part is that were so used to terrible news here we get terrible news here every single day due to the late night theyd both spent at the neshek home neither juhle nor russo got into work until just before hunt arrived to make his statement to them in nancy neshek they had a fresh homicide to begin investigating and the crime scene analysis and report to review but russo wanted to go down and finish up whatever work remained with the limousine first after all theyd gone to all the trouble of getting a warrant and having the lincoln towed to the impound lot and that lot was only just across seventh street adjacent to the hall of justice where they currently found themselves anyway but hunts going to be here to make his statement any minute juhle was at his desk in the homicide detail a wideopen room filled with desks on the fifth floor of the hall of justice were going to want to talk to him about that and find out what else he knows or knew about neshek id bet you hes also going to know about those citytalk numbers but russo cut him off i dont even want to talk about wyatt hunt sarah come on it was late what were we going to accomplish by taking him downtown we were going to accomplish the mandate of our job we were going to accomplish what were supposed to do to somebody who discovers a body in any kind of a compromising manner how about that juhle shook his head he didnt kill nancy neshek no how do you know that how do you know he didnt contaminate the crime scene how do you know what he did before you got there look sarah hunt isnt going anywhere if his statements squirrelly in any way we haul his ass back here and grill him till hes welldone but thats not going to happen he was up at her place because shed called with a question about the reward and well weve been through all this yes we have and for the record it still fries my ass i dont care what time it was we should have hauled hunt down here and if marcelthis was marcel lanier head of homicideif marcel gets wind of this and goes ballistic im laying the whole goddamned thing off on you as my senior partner who made the final decision and meanwhile just so im not tempted to lock up hunt on general principles if he shows up here when hes supposed to im going to stroll on out of here and take a look at the guts of that limo right now you and your pal can play pattycake in the interview room and ill catch the rerun on the tape later sighing juhle got up from his chair you were way more fun when you were younger you know that not really she said people just think i must have been and she turned on her heel when hunt got to homicide to make his statement juhle was waiting for him after wrestling with the decision hunt decided that his job was to pass relevant or potentially relevant evidence along to devin and sarah so he included an account of alicia thorpes completely unverifiable and somewhat provocative alibi for monday night hunt finished with juhle then grabbed both his sport coat and a tan overcoat against the stillgusting and cold north wind that he could hear whipping up the street when he got back into his office he waited for tamara to finish her call and hang up and asked about her progress with his potential pool of parttimers were in luck and more than that you might be happy to hear that the downturn in business over the last six months might not all have been fallout from craig what makes you say that well my first call was to willard whiteanother local private investigator firmand gloria said i could have her whole staff for a few days if we could put em to work beats her having to lay them off she said really how many people she talking about up to five clearly the number surprised and pleased hunt after mickey had gone out again this morning for his interviews wyatt had spent some time with tamara going over the notes hed taken yesterday on the work hed acquired hed estimated that load at close to two hundred hours five standins would bridge the gap nicely and from what it sounded like they and perhaps even their bosses might all be available to fill in on standby if he kept hustling future work why dont you see if you can get all five of them down here later today and maybe even gloria and will themselves say two or twothirty and call me on my cell and let me know tamara snapped him a salute will do mon capitaine oh and we also did get one more reasonably intelligentsounding reward call finally from hangup lady real name linda colores she was walking home from workshes one of the floor people at the pottery barn on chestnutand she heard a man and a woman having an argument on one of the streets down by the palace she thinks this was last tuesday night but shes not sure exactly did she get anything they actually said i didnt ask her that i didnt want to step on your toes but i got her vitals if you want to go out and talk to her although she works all afternoon starting at one or i could ask her to come in here in the next hour or so and i could talk to her hunt standing in front of her desk shook his head in admiration has anybody recently told you how fantastic you are tamara blushed and looked down briefly then back up thank you its good to be back working i didnt know if i could do it anymore or do anything really i wasnt worried about that in fact it never crossed my mind he came forward and put his palms down on the desk across from her you can do anything you put your mind to tam you know that dont you she couldnt meet his eyes i used to but then i kind of got convinced i was fooling myself he was standing looking down at her but she couldnt seem to commit herself to raising her eyes hey when he reached across touched her chin and gently lifted it she looked up and gave him a halfbroken smile you know she said he shook his head you werent fooling yourself tamara you were amazing you are still amazing okay waiting still touching her chin he held her gaze on him okay and at last something gave way in her and she nodded okay he pulled his hand away from her chin and straightened up thats settled then once and for all she saluted again yes sir she said once and for all you want to talk to this linda colores i could okay hunt said go for it nearly the size of a football field the green room at the san francisco war memorial was on the second floor of the stately marble building next to the opera house on van ness avenue floors and pillars in the vast room were of marble the ceiling was at least twenty feet high and the featured colors were gas chamber green trimmed with gold the room was earthquake rated for people though it easily could hold many more than that for comos memorial city employees were on hand at both sets of doors to turn mourners away and prevent the room from getting overfilled hunt got there early enough to get in without any problem and he looked around to see an oversized photograph of a smiling dominic como hung from the wall behind the podium hunt had already walked by one of the long tables piled high with brochures of the sunset youth project the battalion special corps and pledge cards for the reward fund the large portable screen up against the front wall indicated that the service was also going to include a video or a slide show hunt was beginning to wonder what he had hoped to accomplish by coming here today at all not only was this going to be a difficult if not impossible venue in which to hold even the most cursory of interviews he did not yet know many of the players by sight the only people he had actually met in connection with dominic como were his wife ellen and len turner now ellen was surrounded by a mob of wellwishers and fellow mournersperhaps some of them family members but also a large host of mostly africanamerican men women and teenagers who hunt assumed were comos associates fellow workers and many of the beneficiaries of his charitable work over four decades but then in the sea of faces hunt spied a familiar one on the outskirts of the group surrounding ellen and he gradually made his way up near the podium and touched the arm of the man whod discovered the tire iron in the lagoon mr rand he said extending his hand wyatt hunt rand recognized him right away shook the proffered hand and said halfjokingly you aint here to tell me i already got that reward now are you hunt grinned no sir im afraid not but now that you mention it weve learned that it was in fact the murder weapon i dont think thats been in the news yet they found some of what may be mr comos hair on it that didnt get washed away so if that information leads anywhere id have to say that youre still in the running at least for part of it are you waiting to talk to mrs como not really i never met the lady im just payin my respects he raised a hand and mouthed a hello to someone he knew and then came back to hunt good to see this kind a turnout specially after all that in the paper today i dont know where they got all that make dominic look like some kind a i dont know what you see that i did so whatd you think i think jeff elliot usually gets his facts right so you think dominic was skimmin some a that i dont know what to think to tell you the truth i didnt read it so much that he was skimming something for himself as that he was only supposed to use certain money for certain things and maybe he didnt care so much about that you got that right he just put it where they needed it and all that about his car and people runnin for him thats just the way he done it drivin folks around taking people where theys needed rand waved a finger around at the crowd you just look around in this room and now tell me dominic como didnt help a whole lot more people than most anybody else ever meets you hear what im saying i do you do things first you ask permission later thats how he was an nothin wrong with that you ask me you feel the same way about len turner the name alone cast a shadow over rands face you got a problem with him hunt asked rand shrugged dont hate him different breed of cat thats all how do you mean well i mean like dominic he one of us one of the people and turners not this brought a tolerant smile you go have a word with the man you find out soon enough i already have and i will again and i believe you he turned to where rand had glanced and finally saw turner with a small knot of other mourners in somber conversation you know those other people over there with him too some that big goodlooking woman behind ellen talkin to him now that lorraine hess dominics number two next to her is al carter dominics driver rand nodded one of em then the couple holdin hands thats jimi and lola sanchez from over at mission street those are a lot of my reward people hunt said im going to mosey over there and say hello good talking to you cecil hed gone two steps when he stopped and turned oh and as soon as i know anything on the reward ill get back to you rand showed some teeth i be waitin by the phone when he got close to the turner group hunt hung back for a minute to listen as opposed to the scathing citytalk column the death of nancy neshek hadnt made it into this mornings newspaper but still from radio television phone calls and the internet word had obviously gotten out and now this core group of nonprofit professionals was discussing her death hunt waited for a lull in the flow of the conversation then stepped in excuse me for interrupting he said but i thought id come by and introduce myself turner took over and made the introductions all around and when hed finished hunt said i couldnt help overhearing what you were talking about nancy cant really be dead hess said i cant believe that it cant be true im sorry maam hunt replied but its an absolute fact turner asked hunt you think this is connected to dominic how could it be hess asked the group at large how could any of this even be happening carter calm but firm put a hand on hesss arm lorraine think about it how could it not be connected to dominic nobody knows about that one way or the other hunt said cause of death was the same blunt force trauma to the head beyond that its all conjecture so youre saying someone killed her turner asked hunt nodded without a doubt lorraines right this is unbelievable jaime sanchez put his arm around his wife and drew her in closer to himself he looked to hunt for an answer do you have any idea what this is all about no hunt said the timing suggests a connection with mr comos death plus ms neshek called my offices on monday night with a question about the reward what was the question turner asked she never got to ask it she wanted to talk to me in person but never got to it and this is why were paying you len turner asked this and the chronicle story this morning the question was so unexpected and so hostile that for a moment it stopped hunt in his tracks but not for too long i knew nothing about the citytalk column until it came out this morning and even if i had known about it i would not have been able to stop it jeff elliot writes what he wants we are doing what youre paying us to do mr turner were following up leads as quickly and efficiently as we can turner was fuming well i trust mr hunt that youll also do the other thing that were paying you for which is to keep us wellinformed of the progress of your investigation that seems to have become a problem lorraine hess interrupted so youre saying these murders were about the money they had to be about the money not at all hunt said i dont know what theyre about though i do believe theyre connected nancy and dominic ran very different operations mr hunt turner said youve admitted that any connection between them was conjecture dont you have anything specific to report to us in the way of progress no sir im afraid i dont weve had lots of phone calls and several interviews although i dont believe the police are close to an arrest yet on either case but poor nancy tears had overflowed onto hesss cheeks and youre saying the police havent found anything at her house either nothing at all i mean this isnt a situation like dominic found four days later floating in the lagoon there must be something i dont know hunt said they only discovered the body last night im sure they havent gotten through sifting everything they got something may turn up this just seems so hard to imagine jimi sanchez said nancy and dominic were the last people youd ever but he was interrupted by what sounded to hunt like a strangled cry right behind him turning hunt was still only a few feet from ellen como who was standing now as if transfixed her hand extended outward her eyes focused on a spot somewhere in the back of the room following her line of vision hunt didnt at first notice anything unusual the large crowd mostly milling in front of one of the brochure and pledgecard tables until he heard ellens voice again how dare that slut show her face in here and then raising her voice even further speaking to no one and to everyone ellen como went on put her out put her out on the street where she belongs get her out of here now now do you hear me the suddenly silent crowd seemed to separate and open a corridor through the room and hunt standing right beside lorraine hess found himself looking at a very attractive young woman in a plain black dress that hinted at an exquisite body beneath it she was standing perfectly still with one hand held over her heart her eyes were wide in surprise at being thrust into the spotlight by this unexpected reaction and this if anything made her if possible even more luminous on the other side of hunt al carter spoke in a matteroffact toneill get herand moved at the same time to escort the young woman who hunt immediately knew had to be alicia thorpe out of the room the exterior of the lincoln town car was spotless and shone with a high gloss the black leather seats likewise might as well have been brandnew the trunk contained a spare tire but no tire iron or any other tools or debris it looked as though it had been vacuumed within the past day all the nonleather internal soft surfacesdashboard steering wheelhad recently been wiped down with armor all which as all cops and many miscreants know does not readily yield fingerprints russo and juhle stood by while the crime scene personnel lifted the front rugs on both sides and found nothing under them the csi team had also already shone their flashlights and used their whisk brooms under the nonremovable front seats the entire exercise had so far yielded one paper clip nearly hermetically wedged into the seatbelt connector on the drivers side the police impound garage doubled as a maintenance shed for cityissued cars and looked very much like the service area of any gas station russo on her knees her own flashlight in hand watched while crime scene personnel now felt around under the passengerside track that allowed the seat to move forward and backward the technician in her surgical gloves worked something back and forth gently until it came loose from its perch under the seat the woman straightened up cricking her back held up for their inspection an unopened condom in its wrapper eureka russo said getting warm now oh yeah juhles enthusiasm less than genuine that ought to break the case wide open you wait after she placed the condom in a ziploc bag the tech opened the back door of the limo waited for her partner to do the same on his side and then the two of them lifted the backseat russo turned her flashlight beam to the area under the seat cushion itself and it illuminated what looked like a multicolored rag of some kind scrunched into a ball and caught there whats that juhle asked the tech was extricating it with some care from the springs under the seat she finally brought it out and held it up by one end so that it fell open and revealed itself as a silk head scarf in reds yellows and oranges but all of it did not fall out several folds in the silk appeared to be stuck to each other the inspectors watched and waited while the technician pulled one of her standard toolsa woods lampout of her kit and shone it on the scarf under its ultraviolet light a smear of characteristic stains appeared as fluorescent she made a face and held it out at arms length semen she said jim parr got outside then noting the weather immediately went back in and up the stairs to his place to get his heavy peacoat and so by less than a minute he missed his first chance to catch the njudah bus to downtown as he rounded the corner to the bus stop he saw it pulling away and took the opportunity to dust off several of his favorite underutilized profanities the next bus put him in the thick of the last minute crowd rushing into the war memorial building he was standing in the middle of the crush of humanity at the bottom of the stairs when word traveled down that the green room had reached its capacity and that no one else could be admitted over the next twenty minutes those members of the crowd who chose to remain including parr managed to push themselves upstairs where they got backed into the hallway that led to the doors inside of which the memorial was to take place jostled back and across the entire hallway and now near the entrance to the elevator parr had just about decided to call it a day when he saw his old acquaintance and successor al carter approaching him shouldering his way through the mass of people gathered between his spot and the green rooms door his arm protectively around a tearful and perhaps frightened alicia thorpe al he called out alicia carter raised a finger in acknowledgment on an impulse parr pressed the button for the elevator when it opened he stepped back into it and held the door open as a few of the overload of mourners filed in before carter and alicia finally made it too going down anywhere carter replied his arm still around alicias shoulder wrap though she was clearly shaken alicias hooded expression barely allowed her to nod at parr before she leaned her head against carters chest the doors closed in front of them and the elevator began its descent on the ground floor carter stayed around long enough to exchange a few pleasantries with parr then he turned to alicia are you sure youre okay id like to kill ellen she said but otherwise you got a way home carter asked im good she said i drove myself down parr cleared his throat you wouldnt by any chance be going back my way would you save me another muni adventure sure she said done carter had made sure the guard at the door hed exited upstairs knew hed be coming back in he was certain that hed be readmitted so he could afford these moments of pleasantries with jim and alicia but clearly he wanted to get back up after a few last encouraging words to alicia carter left them both in the lobby and disappeared again into the elevator when he was gone alicia turned to parr lets get the fuck out of here now they were speedwalking together on van ness into the teeth of the misty north wind alicia had parked a few blocks away and the walk to her car wasnt much conducive to conversation once they were both in her car the doors slammed shut and quickly locked behind them they sat for another moment in silence breathing heavily alicia fumbled in her purse found her keys turned the ignition on and blasted the heater and then the fan all the way up parr still wore his heavy coat over his dress suit and it had cut the wind and cold to some extent but aliciain her flimsy dress and woolen shawlhugged herself with her hands up and down on opposite arms and took deep breaths and long exhales until she had gotten herself back to some sort of comfort eventually she reached out and put her hands on the steering wheel then gave parr an apologetic smile sorry i didnt mean to get so cold ill forgive you this time are you all right yes just cold maybe not just that huh what happened back there for an answer she just shook her head her hands gripped the steering wheel at ten and two her knuckles white she turned away from parr to study a green lights worth of traffic as it passed outside her window slamming the car into gear she released the parking brake turned the wheel again checked the traffic then abruptly another shudder of cold or something else went through her and she shifted back into neutral and set the parking brake she stared into some middle space somewhere out in front of her fucking ellen como she said what about her she saw me and went ballistic and kicked me out of there she thinks i had a thing with dominic she paused which i did not thanks for not asking parr shrugged none of my business im not that kind of person not with married men anyway i just dont get involved that way anymore its nothing but trouble you know parr chortled full disclosure its not a big problem in my life and dominic wouldnt have been any part of that anyway no matter what that wasnt who he was either you knew that too didnt you parr stopped looking at her he folded his arms over his chest what she asked i didnt say anything yes you did he hesitated people can change he said i believe that i did what does that mean it means that the dominic i knew maybe wasnt the dominic you knew she brought her hands down off the steering wheel onto her lap youre saying he used to play around her startling green eyes took on a glassy brightness as if tears were starting to form in them she turned to face him regularly often parr shrugged and if thats true you dont believe me do you listen to me darling you tell me to my face that you walk on burning coals im going to believe you im just saying that for dominic the dominic i knew it might have been a little out of character if he didnt even try she took a long beat and waited did mickey know that dominic too mickey i dont know where mickey she shook her head in impatience come on jim what im asking is if mickey is assuming that i slept with dominic too the way everybody else is well first not everybody else is thats not an answer her voice taking on a panicky tone did you tell him that you thought i probably was easy hon easy mickey and i never talked about it not at all i had my business with dominic and mickey has his life he never asked about my opinion on any of this were talking about and i wouldnt have told him anything because i didnt know anything now i do but only because youve told me and its still none of my business or his no i think it is his hows that its just that mickeys investigating who killed dominic and i already told him what i told you that dominic and i were close but not that close and if he thought that wasnt true then not only would i be a liar but id have a motive you see parr reached over and patted her on the hand youre overthinking this darling micks not that complicated you want an old mans opinion id say that hes thinking about you and him not about you and dominic and i couldnt exactly say id blame him she all but blushed youre sweet jim thats a sweet thing to say im a sweet old fart all right but the point is micks on your side we all are she let out a deep sigh i cant tell you what a relief that is jim especially after what ellen what she did in there i cant have mickey thinking i did this too i didnt i really didnt youll tell him that wont you and hes got to believe me and you too then right to stand between me and the police you see that dont you course i do darling even a blind man could see it well all right then taking another breath she picked up parrs hand and kissed it now lets get you home she said she pulled out into the traffic lane got up a couple of blocks to california street and hung a left heading west you know if you dont mind parr said after a moment its out of the way but maybe you could drop me out at sutter what for i thought id talk to some people see whos hanging around who knows what mickey said he was going to be out there talking to al carter parr scratched at his cheek thats mickey and al and als back there at the memorial so i dont think ill be in anybodys way not for a little while at least so what are you looking for i dont know exactly except ill know it if i see it or hear it somebody always knows something you know even if they dont know what it is and what else am i doing with my time anyway that is if you dont mind the drive the drives nothing drivings what i do ill be happy to take you out there even you he said after a bit she shot a glance over to him even me what you drove dominic that tuesday morning didnt you she nodded how long four hours five something like that why you think hard enough i bet you can remember something he said that would give you an idea about who he was meeting that night specially if you two were close like you say you talk about anything important with dominic that morning anything unusual her hands were again tight on the wheel her eyes straight ahead her brow creased in concentration or worry no she said no i dont think so nothing i can remember anyway linda colores heretofore the hangup lady tried to make herself comfortable on the one wooden chair that tamara had set up across from her reception station in the outer office but it didnt seem to be working are you all right she asked ms colores perhaps twentytwo years old was a thin and stylishly dressed woman she flashed a quick and apologetic smile then raised a hand to her right temple im sorry my head tamara had already opened her desk drawer ive got some ibuprofen if but ms colores waved that off no im sorry but i know what it is food did you eat something that disagreed with you no not food that way i shouldnt say food i should say no food she stole a quick glance at her watch is that the real time elevenfifteen tamara checked her own watch then the corner of her computer saw that it was and nodded elevenfifteen she said ms colores swallowed im so stupid im out of bed at seven i run five miles i get ready for my appointment with you before i have to go and work all day and i just forget one little thing actually two the first one is that im hypoglycemic i dont eat my head explodes and other things the second thing i then forget is to actually put some food in my mouth tamara eyed her with some suspicion are you sure you didnt talk to my boss or my brother no im kidding but both of them are always on me to eat eat eat she paused for a second maybe we should go out and have a little bite would you like to do that i think i have to im sorry tamara pushed her chair back and stood up no more apologizing okay we go get something to eat we talk about what you heard the other night good yes good ms colores said thank you fortuitously hunts office was close to belden alley just a block away mickey often said that belden alley alone one short block in length if it were the only street in the city might make san francisco qualify as a betterthanaveragedestination restaurant town and then hed list its restaurants like a carnival barker brindisi cucina di mare voda taverna b plouf café tiramisu café bastille and sams grill partially guided by expense although none of the places would bust even tamaras budget she convinced linda that brindisi was what they wanted fifteen minutes later during which they made small talk mostly about food and their brothers linda had two both older the waiter delivered tamaras rigatoni with lamb ragout and artichokes and lindas grilled salmon sandwich on ciabatti with lobster mayonnaise salad and fries so tamara began a few bites into her lunch what happened that tuesday night well thats the thing linda said then paused for a moment i feel really bad that i didnt do more i mean when it happened but then i know it sounds bad to say i didnt want to get involved but at the time it just seemed like a fight and all i wanted to do was get away from it and then at the store they were talking about how they found the body right near where id been and then at first i wasnt even sure it was tuesday i mean i really didnt think about it at all as maybe connected to mr comos murder until i heard about the rewardi know that sounds a little crass dont worry about that still i just thought about what if it might have actually been important you know its fine linda thats why they put out a reward get people thinking about things that otherwise they might not really have registered but now youre pretty sure it was tuesday no im completely sure she dabbed a napkin at her mouth i have this little calendar booki know this is pretty typea but welcome to linda land as my brothers say anyway i kind of use it as a shorthand diary for everything i do every dayhow much i ran hours i worked where i ate who i went out with movies books its probably a disease and ive definitely got it she shrugged in any event i checked back and realized it had been payday and cherylshes my friend from workand i decided to go wait at the a bar and have dinner there which of course took about three hours for dinner well one and a half for the waittotally worth it by the waythen about the same for dinner but the point is that i probably got out around ten ten fifteen said good bye to cheryl and thenremember it was that warm weeki was stuffed so i decided it was so nice out id walk some of the food off so i headed down to the palace of fine arts which i love at night go on so then im down by the lagoon just really strolling enjoying the night and i get down to the parking lot by the exploratorium and i hear these voices a man and a woman so i stop its not like i was trying to eavesdrop just ahead of me the trail turned and they must have been around the bend you didnt see them no even if i had it would probably have been too dark to recognize them but anyway it was obviously a fight i mean just from the sound but then im standing there and the woman goes god damn you and i hear this like slap and then shes all oh god im sorry im so sorry i didnt mean that clearly getting caught up in the emotion of her retelling linda colores blew at a few of her hairs that had fallen in front of her face then brushed them from her forehead so now im thinking she continued ive got to get out of here but its like my feet are stuck to the ground im just rooted there afraid im going to make some noise if i move i mean i really dont want to be there but another shrug followed by another sigh so she hit him now linda nodded and then theres this silence and finally i hear him plain as day look he says im sorry but its over i cant do anything about it and she goes you can you can if you still love me and he goes arent you listening to me thats the problem i dont love you anymore and then i hear her say no no no that cant be and then theres this kind of sickening sound like a i dont really know what it was like exactly i mean she kind of groaned with exertion or something and then there was this this kind of dull soundi even thought at the time it could have been somebody getting hit with something i know i should have maybe gone and looked then i mean it sounded bad enough but by then i was scared i mean really scared and then suddenly i start to actually feel sick and lightheaded myself and i turn back and start walking away as fast and as quietly as i can i really should have done something about it then i think i mean called the police or told somebody but when there was nothing about it on the news not until friday when they found the body and even then i didnt immediately put it together although i guess i should have shouldnt i youre here now tamara told her when a lot of other people wouldnt be so i wouldnt beat myself up over it too much i dont like to think im such a coward linda said or that i only came forward now because of the reward i dont think that tamara said and im the only one listening being thorough mickey stayed on at the sanctuary house offices and spoke for a time with each one of the five other women who worked there to see if any of them had seen or heard anything from nancy neshek on the monday afternoon of the reward announcement that might bear on the question she had meant to put to the hunt club none of them was particularly helpful all were shaken and tearful it was after noon when mickey finally finished and left the admin office from the hospital lobby he called hunt on his cell phone and left a message thinking whats the goddamn point of having a cell phone if you dont take it with you or keep it turned on hunt was supposed to be at the como memorial so was nearly the entire cast of characters from which he needed to find alibis for the past monday night so it was doubly frustrating that mickey had just learned that the communities of opportunity people had held a meeting on that night presumablyin fact almost certainlynancy neshek had been there along with many others of the nonprofit executive directors associates and certainly even len turner and hunt at this very moment was in all probability with these people and didnt have that one rather critical bit of information but then getting to his car mickey realized that if hunt spoke to even one of these people hed find out about the mondaynight meeting right away anyway still mickey liked being the bearer of good news especially when he thought it was good stuff and hed discovered it himself so he placed another call to the office to brag a bit to tamara but she didnt pick up there either and what was that about he wondered for just a brief moment he found that his stomach had gone a little hollow where was his sister had he and hunt been too cavalier about bringing her back to work in assuming thats what she wanted in giving her more responsibility or might mickey hope against hope that she had actually of her own volition gone out for something to eat it was after all lunchtime his phone still in his hand without much forethought he went to his favorites list and hit jims number heard it ring four times got his answering machine give me a fucking break he said aloud and leaving no message he threw his phone onto the seat next to him he knew who he wanted to call next but really what was he going to say to alicia except that he had just loved her company the night before and wanted to see her again wanted to see her all the time in fact what she had called her nerd moment from the night before had struck mickey as incredibly poignant echoing as it did his own feelings it had humanized her to an extent that had taken him by surprise he really didnt need anything to help make her more compelling but there it had been unpracticed and sincere a glimpse of the person under the package beautiful there as well still he would have to wait she was mourning dominic como in fact now that he thought of it she was almost certainly at the memorial herself this was just swell he was thinking here he was all dressed up and no place to go in the future he would really have to try to remember to get more andor clearer assignments from hunt before he left the office for the day which now stretched long and empty before him he turned the key in the ignition the car started right up and he pulled out of his space when he got to potrero the traffic was heavy and unbroken going south to his left but there was an opening turning right if he moved quickly and so he jammed down on the accelerator that was the extent of the thought he gave to turning back uptown it could have easily gone either way since he didnt have a destination in mind such a small random decision such huge consequences the windows that overlooked the booth tables at lou the greeks were set high in the westfacing wall their bases perhaps six feet from the floor this unusual design feature wasnt due to some architects skewed or artistic vision from outside the building all six of the windows sat level to the asphalt that paved a debris and dumpsterstrewn alley lous had been built about halfway underground patrons entering the buildings front double doors could either go up the stairs to the first flooracme bail bonds florence wardnotary public and presto dispatch a document delivery serviceor down eight ammonia or possibly urinetinged steps through a red leather onesided swinging door and into the bustling netherworld of lousopen six to two seven days a weekfull bardaily special when you walk in the bar is to your right if its lunchtime the bar is jammed with all the stools taken and behind them a couple of rows of standing room if its your first time here you notice the high windows under them the six oldfashioned fourperson wooden booths the lowslung acoustic tile ceiling the faint odor of cooking oil soy sauce maybe spilled beer the place squeezes twenty fourtops onto the floor and six twotops around the walls and every weekday it serves over two hundred lunches all the more remarkable because its menu every day save the occasional bonanza of fortune cookies is comprised of only one dish the special lou the greeks wife chiu was chinese and for twentyfive or more years shed been honoring her and her husbands union by creating a new dish nearly every single day always based on their two nationalities todays special for example general lous pork was at once typical and unique pita bread pockets stuffed with bright red chinese barbecued pork scallions garlic hoisin sauce yogurt and hot pepper flakes a lot of hot pepper flakes juhle and russo sat sucking their iced teas through straws across from each other in one of the booths russo set her glass down swallowed and blew in and out noisily a couple of times holy shit she said lou calls this some spicy id like to see a lot spicy if this is some this stuff is fire juhle slid over the little jar of pure hot pepper seeds in oil you want to get serious add some of this then it gets spicy i pass russo sipped again rubbed at her lips i mean it holy shit you already said that its a two holyshit pita pocket juhle took another bite chewed contentedly switched to another subject without preamble so how can it hurt were just talking to her we dont know its her scarf devin juhle shrugged sipped some tea shrugged again we ask her we show her that lovely color photograph you took and ask the lovely ms thorpe if shes ever seen this thing before she says no we keep looking maybe ask some other people if they ever saw her wearing it or somebody else wearing it on the other hand she says yes were getting close im not even so sure of that no why not pray because even if its hers we dont know if its his semen granted but we will know in a couple of days and and you just seem to want to be building this case on one flimsy lead after another you really dont see this i see what youre saying sure first we get the tire iron we know its comos hair on it but we dont know its from comos limo although the tire iron from the limo is missing right right there are a lot of tire irons in the world close but not proof positive so then we search the limo and guess what we find the scarf and sure it might not be the thorpe girls scarf and it might not be comos masculine essence on it either but jesus dev you think you could just say semen i doubt it i dont even say semen when im talking to connie so what do you no never mind forget i asked go on so i agree with you is what im saying in theory weve got all these things we dont know for sure could be but might not be the tire iron the limo the scarf that might not be hers the semensee i can do itthat might not be his but lets saylets just saythat the elements of the trail i see here all turn out to go in our direction i mean it turns out the tire iron came from his limo its her scarf and his semen then in that case shes definitely lied to us which tells us something new doesnt it now add to that that she had daily access to the limo that he fired her that day we dont know that only maybe that he said he was going to so we ask her that too she tells us yes shes got a motive and all this is not even talking about monday night where she slept in her car out by the beach a couple of blocks below where nancy neshek breathed her last juhle took the last loud slurp from his iced tea held up a hand until hed swallowed it im not saying were ready for an arrest here sarah but come on put a little press on her get another statement see if she answers the same as last time what have we got to lose when the service was over al carter hung back over in the corner of the downstairs lobby of the war memorial building while hunt corralled turner the sanchezes and lorraine hess into a circle off to the side at the bottom of the steps carter listened in while hunt pinned down each of them in turn about their whereabouts the night of nesheks death it seemed to take some of the wind out of hunt when he learned that theyd all been at a meeting with one another on the monday night when neshek had been killed but then when he learned that nancy neshek had been there with them all too he picked up again so hunt asked what time did the communities of opportunity meeting break up where had every one of them gone afterward this last question got turner hot enough that nobody wound up having to answer maybe turner had exploded hunt didnt realize that he was talking to the leadership of the philanthropic community in san francisco none of len turners associates were suspects in either one of these murders in fact turner himself had hired hunt and these people had contributed to the reward werent those the facts hunt had had to admit that they were and then turner went on the offensive carter had heard him do it before he reminded hunt that all of these executives had places to go and important things to do and maybe hunt could better spend his time following the leads he had already developed through the process they were paying him for rather than harassing them in this ridiculous manner thank you after the executive group broke up hunt had waited until theyd all left the building then hed sat down on the steps and had a brief talk on his cell phone by the time he closed the phone and slid it into its holster on his belt carter was standing in front of him arms crossed over his chest leaning back against the wall that len turner hes a force of nature isnt he hunt stood up nodded in acknowledgment through a frustrated grin al carter isnt it yes sir i had a talk with one of your people the other day out at sunset mickey mickey it is and his grandfather is jim parr thats him do you know jim i do he was my predecessor and taught me some of the driving ropes its not all about steering and brakes and acceleration you know theres a significant political component as well id imagine so in any event mickey mentioned that he might be trying to see you again today as a matter of fact al carters wide intelligent face closed down slightly he didnt make an appointment no i think he just planned to go out there and hoped hed run into you did he mention what he wanted to discuss maybe you and i can take care of it here whatever it might be although i must tell you my ignorance about mr comos movements that last night is near total i dropped him off near his home as i told your mickey and the police and had the limo back in the school lot by sixthirty then i went home myself can i ask you a question sure the police impounded the limo last night do you have any idea why i presume they wanted to search it more thoroughly for what for whatever they find you know they think they have the murder weapon this brought a little snort yes lorraine hess told me the tire iron not necessarily the tire iron from the limo but a tire iron certainly and are they sure reasonably yes unless theres some way dominic comos hair ended up on another tire iron that found its way into the palaces lagoon yes carters smile did not reach to his eyes that would be an impressive long shot so presumably i had access to the tire iron more than most am i then a suspect i havent heard that from the police i dont believe they have a suspect yet ah i was forgetting we dont have suspects anymore do we only persons of interest the vocabulary change affords me little comfort carters lips pursed out and then in his facial muscles moved in a way that suggested he was trying to smile but this time his lips could not hold the expression let me ask you this then mr hunt among the potential suspectspeople with access to the limo and the tire iron and so onare there any other black men with prison time in their background not that i know of can you appreciate why this might be a matter of some concern to me of more than average concern obviously dont take this wrong but might someone come to the conclusion that you had some kind of a motive carters eyes closed down almost to slits before he opened them again as the broad expressive face fell into relaxation ive had the job eight years im an exconvict all the demographics predict that i shouldnt have a steady job much less an education and yet i do all compliments of dominic a generous and powerful man but there was a price hunt said if he wanted to go if he needed to go doesnt matter where it was what time it was how long you had to wait for him whatever he was doing you either took him and took it or hed find someone else who would this was unstated and intuitively understood and an absolute job requirement so you were essentially on call all the time even with the other drivers he used this brought a mirthless laugh again i dont mean any kind of slur dominic was a great man it was a privilege to work for him but for the interns the younger people without criminal records the girls there wasnt much in the line of actual driving except to our work sites certainly they did not drive him to open ended events nighttime meetings with partners and constituents other things women carters smile and gesture were ambiguous in any event he said with the other drivers the relationship was symbiotic dominic got good presentable inexpensive help and then he placed that help with other people in the city who could help him you want tickets to the giants the warriors the niners you want a parking ticket fixed or more likely a drug bust youd like the ear of your supervisor on a development issue but that wasnt you you werent in line for one of those jobs no i was a lifer i am a lifer except now with him gone he spread his hands and youre concerned that someone might take that as a motive that you wanted out perhaps unwisely i mentioned it to a few people and i dont really know if i did want that what else would i do what am i going to do now but did i sometimes feel trapped yes might dominic have heard about it and fired me perhaps he didnt tolerate disloyalty even the hint of it he might even have fired me on tuesday hunt nodded well as motives go id call that pretty weak even if anyone could prove it i agree but my socalled alibis for both nights are also flimsy i live alone and i was at home alone both nights so combined with my record my race the motive the lack of alibi and the fact that except for his killer i was the last person to see him the police i see what youre saying well no im not sure that you do since i havent said it yet hunt waited ive wanted to stay out of all of this to the extent that i could reward or no reward i know how the police often go about their work and im afraidyou see its already happened to me once beforeim afraid that they might find in me a path of least resistance thats the only reason ive decided to talk to you you know something yes and i only mention it with great reluctance because of everything ive told you about here today i wanted you to understand me if they dont have someone else theres a likelihood theyre going to come knocking at my door he took a breath and held it his lips again pursed and tight he fired alicia thorpe that morning yeah were sitting outside her place right now hoping to talk to her juhle said got any idea where she might be hunt was in his car talking on his cell phone which miraculously had a strong signal two floors down in the city hall lot after finishing up with al carter hed half jogged through the thickening drizzle gotten to his car and punched in juhles number sorry i know where she was an hour ago and that was here but ellen como had her kicked out she could do that it was her party devin she could do anything she wanted it wasnt very pretty he paused so what did you get juhle ran down the latest link in the chain that was apparently beginning to close around alicia thorpe at least juhle concluded if its her scarf why do you think its hers shes the only female driver the scarfs in the limo hello anyway at least it gives us something to ask her about not to mention carter corroborating ellens story that dominic fired her you believe him yep on the very day we got that right tuesday morning did carter change his story then about who como was going to see no he didnt know that dominic said he was meeting an old friend and didnt go into it in truth it might not have been alicia but carter thought it might have been so how long before you find out about the semen if it was comos as opposed to whose i dont know dev maybe as opposed to any other guy whod ever been in the limo getting some head from somebody wearing a scarf whered you find it in the limo anyway the scarf under the backseat why just trying to picture the scenario that gets dominic into the backseat thats where people sit in limos wyatt yeah mostly i know except i dont think como did i read that somewhere or saw his picture something maybe both he prided himself on being a regular guy sitting in the passenger seat up front im sure of that and whats that mean i dont know maybe nothing so how long how long what before you know the semen was dominics dna about the same as the dna on the tire iron round it off to four days maybe six multiply by the phase of the moon divide by i dont know lets say fourteen its anybodys guess but after today we may not need it until the trial well see you think youre near an arrest well see it would be great if you could say something else besides well see it would i know well keep me in the loop well see juhles tone was distinctly ironic hey this could be her gotta run and he broke off the connection alicia pulled up to the curb outside the house where she rented her basement room and sat unmoving staring straight ahead in the drivers seat with the motor running her hands locked onto the steering wheel she had her lights on and the windshield wipers swished back and forth intermittently whats she doing juhle asked i dont know waiting for her favorite song to end meditating juhle gave her a full minute before his patience ran out he got out of his own car crossed the street came up behind her and knocked on the drivers side window startled alicia jerked her hands away from the wheel and her head toward juhle who wore a practiced professional expression and held his badge open next to the window after a brief moment of what he took to be confusion she moved one hand over to the door and the window came down yes ms thorpe inspector juhle you may remember i wonder if we could ask you just a few more questions she dropped her head before lifting it back up again then she dredged half a smile from somewhere said sure grabbed her purse rolled up the window and pushed open the door by this time russo had joined juhle and now the three of them marched across the lawn and down the side path that led to the entrance to her room in the back the wind wasnt as strong as it had been downtown although the mist and drizzle out here had intensified into true rain falling straight down on them it didnt make any of them walk any more quickly when they got inside with the door closed behind them alicia hit the lights and adjusted the thermostat then turned im just going to throw on a pullover if thats okay she crossed the room and took down a bright green knitted sweater that was hanging from a peg on the opposite wall and brought it over her head coming back to them she got to the table and pulled out one of its chairs indicating that they do the same they all sat im supposed to be at work in about an hour and a half should i call them and tell them ill be late juhle and russo exchanged a glance and russo said i dont think well be that long but if we get close youll have that opportunity okay fine she looked from one inspector to the other so she drew a breath what can i do for you well juhle began as i said weve got a few more questions for you about mr como russo had gone solemn and she nodded him and a few other things yes am i some kind of a suspect alicia asked juhle answered we havent identified any true suspects yet ms thorpe were trying to fill in gaps in our understanding at this time and hope you might be able to help us so im not under arrest you are absolutely not under arrest juhle said you dont have to talk to us at all and can terminate this interview at any time so i dont need to call a lawyer russo forced a conspiratorial smile if you want to call a lawyer alicia that is your right she said we could wait here for him or her to show up or make another appointment later but we are hoping to keep making progress on this case and thought you would want to help us keep it moving along to catch mr comos killer it shouldnt take us more than a half hour juhle added maybe less okay alicia said in that case great thank you juhle took out his pocket tape recorder and placed it on the table between them well just be taping what we say to preserve an accurate record we did this last time too you recall yes all right juhle pushed away from the table and leaned back in his wooden chair he crossed one leg over the other his body language clearly stating that he was no threat to alicia or to anyone else i apologize if we cover a few things we went through last time but weve been talking to a lot of people and sometimes we lose track of the sources of certain information this was the purest of twaddle and juhle knew it what he was really hoping was that alicia would contradict her earlier answers and thus give them substantial leverage and of course if alicia had elected to wait to talk to a lawyer she would have known this but there wasnt anything she could do about it now she didnt even seem to realize it might be a troublesome issue now then juhle began youd been driving for mr como for how long tagteaming juhle and russo walked her through most of her earlier statementher service at sunset her duties as comos driver her perceptions of some other key members of the staff at the ortega campusand finally got to her personal relationship with her boss which she answered as she always had they were close friends but not intimate juhle kept it casual so once again you did not have any kind of physical relationship with mr como no never kissed him she hesitated not in a romantic way no russo picked up the distinction what other way did you kiss him then alicia showed her first sign of true frustration a sigh accompanied by a slight puckering around her lips more like a buss on the cheek sometimes when id first see him or when i was leaving both russo asked sometimes russo wasnt letting it go usually pausing again nodding alicia said by the end yes most days just like friends do maybe a small hug and a little kiss hello a hug and a kiss then juhle asked not a big hug really just like a greeting or a goodbye she leveled her gaze at both of the inspectors in turn come on you guys you know what im talking about we usually kissed hello and goodbye just like id do with my brother it wasnt sexual we had become friends thats all juhle asked and you were still friends on the day he was killed yes of course russo you werent having any troubles at work no none alicia straightened up in her chair whats this about russo came forward but did not answer her instead she said you were at mr comos service this morning not for long we understand that mrs como asked you to leave a bitter chuckle if thats how you want to put it juhle asked how would you put it were you there no maam well the way id put it is she had me thrown out why would she have wanted to do that russo asked because shes a crazy woman alicia said she thinks i had something going on with dominic which i think weve been through enough huh were you aware juhle said that she demanded that mr como fire you that wouldnt surprise me nothing she did would surprise me but mr como didnt tell you that what that his wife wanted him to fire you no when anytime it never came up no never sarah russo her hands clasped in front of her on the table raised her head and he didnt in fact fire you no he didnt that last tuesday was just another day at the office for you juhle said is that what youre saying thats what im saying god knows ive thought about it enough trying to remember any hint he might have given me while we were on the road about his appointment that night but it was just a normal day tuesday you mean right that last tuesday but you didnt come into work the next day russo asked yes i did i went home when i saw dominic wasnt there and what about the day after that what about it did you come in then alicia paused no why not alicia hesitated a moment longer well dominic wasnt in so there wouldnt have been anything for me to do russo on a scent came forward how did you know he wasnt in what do you mean i meanits a straightforward questionhow did you know dominic wasnt in i dont know i dont remember i must have called you must have called why would you have called did you call most mornings to see if he was at work before you came in no sometimes i must have those days or i had heard he was missing i think that was probably it his wife by then had said he was missing alicias eyes were bright with emotion and suddenly she found a voice for it and while were on that listen she said ive been sitting here letting you guys ask me all these questions but dont you thinkforget all these innuendoes about me and dominicdont you think its just a little suspicious that his wife didnt even call to report him missing until he was already gone for a whole day isnt that a little hard to explain doesnt that bother you at all plus the fact that mrs como is the one who was jealous regardless of whether i gave her a reason to be or not and i didnt shes the one who thought dominic was cheating on her and if she thought that she might have wanted to kill him for it doesnt that make more sense than sniffing all around me juhle raised his eyebrows at his partner he wasnt here to tell alicia everything or anything that they knew or assumed that ellen como had had no real access to the presumed murder weapon that they had no indication or information that shed ever ridden or even been in her husbands limo and hence couldnt have left a possibly incriminating scarf there that both ellen and al carter apparently independently had stated unequivocally that dominic had in fact fired alicia on his last morning at work ellens behavior and unsubstantiated alibi notwithstanding she was not really their prime suspect although of course they had not totally written her off but juhle only said we appreciate your perspective but as weve told you the investigation is ongoing were just trying to gather information and to that end russo picked up i wonder if you could tell us what you did last monday night if the question was meant to shake her up it succeeded almost to the point of panic alicias mouth turned down her eyebrows came together over her eyes she looked to juhle as if verifying that this was what they wanted to know monday night a week ago she asked the night before dominic was killed no russo answered patiently this past monday night two nights ago two nights ago why juhle had his professional face back on if you could just answer the question alicia the official tone hit its mark and alicia sat back meekly holding her hands together in her lap monday night monday night tuesday i was at a friends for dinner and then monday oh i got it monday i slept in my car down by the beach ocean beach i wanted to go surfing tuesday morning and you were alone in your car russo asked yes and from what time i dont know exactly i had a pizza with my girlfriend danielle at giorgios on clement i guess i left at around ten and drove out to the beach russo asked right did you talk to anybody out there juhle asked were they having bonfires that night alicia shook her head i went to sleep in my car ive got a mattress i throw in and a sleeping bag i wanted to be up early what happened monday night again ignoring alicias question russo threw a sharp glance at juhle then reached under her jacket and pulled a color photograph out of her breast pocket she placed it on the table in front of alicia do you recognize this she asked alicias eyes lit up briefly then closed down as she looked at russo to answer her yes thats my scarf i lost it a couple of weeks ago where did you find it her name is linda colores tamara had hunt sit down in the one chair across from her in the reception area as soon as hed arrived back at the office the hangup lady id forgotten all about her hunt replied whatd she have to say that she was out by the palace on the night mr como was killed like maybe ten or tenthirty she was just walking by herself after dinner on the path by the lagoon and two people were having an argument right in front of her tell me she saw them i wish i could but she didnt they were around where the path turns right down there at the end near where mickey found the body but the point is that she heard them really clearly okay a man and a woman the man telling the woman he didnt love her anymore then maybe the sound of her hitting him at least this grunt of exertion and then this kind of sickening sound so whatd she do then your witness she got scared and turned and got out of there as quickly and quietly as she could while our murderer hunt said made sure como was dead then got him into the lagoon and tucked him away in the roots linda didnt know anything about that but id say probably i would too anyway tamara said i dont know if that tells us anything we dont already know or think we know but it seemed important to me somehow its damned important hunt said if only because that was really the end of it if thats when como was killed thats what it sounded like to linda and if thats the case its not part of the money issues is it in spite of what gina would have me believe and its also tamara said not a guy maybe not not unless our woman here hid como away and then called somebody to finish up so two of them not likely i admit but not impossible alicia and her brother no wyatt no im just saying but then other possibilities sprang into his mindellen como and al carter or ellen como and len turner or even nancy neshek and an accomplice whod wound up then killing her then back again to alicia and almost any man who would do anything for her and her favors which after only a quick glimpse of her at the memorial service hunt figured would include most of the male population of the known world if mickey had turned left which was south on potrero he would have gotten to cesar chavez boulevard after only a couple of blocks then immediately taken the onramp to north and made it back to the stockton garage at just about the time he figured wyatt would be returning from the memorial service they would have grabbed a bite somewhere compared notes on their respective mornings adventures and developed a plan for the rest of the day or even week but as it happened he turned right got up to eighteenth street which reminded him of the tasty and tender goat hed bought the day before at birite market which happened to find itself on eighteenth as well so he turned left on eighteenth intending to get provisions for the homesteadwhatever looked good and something wouldfor the next couple of days his plan was to keep cooking at home for as long as tamara kept showing her renewed appetite the light was solid green for him to go when he got to mission and so there wasnt any reason to slow down he was thinking about special cuts of pork they might have at birite and then after that maybe hed go to his favorite burrito place only a few blocks over to his right on mission he never even began to see the volvo going according to the accident records that were later filed in the incident approximately thirty miles per hour the car ran the red light and broadsided him on his passengerside door the initial impact pushed his car sideways for exactly thirtysix feet until its momentum was stopped by a tenyearold chevy suburban that was parked at a meter on the westside curb of mission this second collision on mickeys side of his car just behind his seat t boned his camaro smashed his head against the side window concussed him broke his left arm and three of his ribs and rendered him unconscious his cell phone which hed thrown onto the passenger seat a few minutes earlier and which held all of his contact information got bounced around like a pinball inside the car and hit something hard enough to smash its screen and break it making it useless the parked suburban jumping the curb killed a homeless john doe everybody called frankie whod been a fixture begging at that intersection for the past seventeen months the driver of the volvo who was wearing her seat belt and whose airbag deployed perfectly according to factory specifications was a bit banged up but basically uninjured hunt came out of his own office in the back and hooked a hip over tamaras desk she was working on a scheduling spreadsheet on her computer and kept tapping the keyboard for a second before still typing she turned to face him yes ive been wrestling with it for half an hour driving back here and ive got to ask you a question she didnt miss a beat almost thirty she said but most people guess closer to twentyfive in mock chagrin hunt hung his head when am i going to learn tamara put on an empathetic face one day itll just happen you wait she broke a smile okay whats the real question the real question is mick how serious is he with this thorpe woman tamara sat back alicia wyatt her names alicia i know what her name is tam im a little worried about both of you using it being on a first name basis with her i dont want you two getting too close to her you said that this morning i meant it then too and i noticed it kind of pissed off both of you mickey maybe a little more and that was before i talked to al carter and heard the latest from devin thats what ive been wrestling with whether i should even tell you what they said either of them either of you of course you should tell us weve got to know what were dealing with thats true but i dont want either of you shutting me out because im keeping an open mind on all the possible suspects are you as far as i can tell tam you tell me where im not she touched his hand you dont have to get mad you know im afraid i cant help that six months ago youll remember we had a little problem with this isnt like that it isnt employee of the hunt club gets involved with murder suspect who turns out craig was never a suspect no thats true we both know what craig was though dont we an actual murderer too smart to get himself suspected and he had everybody fooled even me tamara flared even you i like to think that if theres an even there in that equation its even me all right ill give you that but thats not the point either the point is mickey and whether hes being blinded to the truth about somebody he obviously cares about and if he is what im going to do about it and are you sure you know that truth no not ultimately but i do know some truths or probable truths and i just learned what might be another couple of em you want to hear them still pushed back away from her desk tamara her mouth a grim line folded her arms go ahead all right lets start with her relationship with como she admits they were close in fact real close mrs como says it was more than thatdominic was in love with her he admitted it and even if he didnt they got themselves caught doing it in the office no they didnt mrs como says they did lorraine hess says they did we call this corroboration besides which i dont think a guy like dominic como gets in love with somebody if something physical isnt going on you buy that im listening all right we know weve got a tire iron probably from the limo as the murder weapon we know alicia could have gotten to that anytime she wanted next we find out from your witness just todayhangup ladythat two people a man and a woman are having a violent fight at about the same time and in the same place where dominic got hit good good so then this morning an hour ago im talking to al carter and im not even asking him any questions about ms thorpe and he volunteers information that exactly corroborates mrs comos story that dominic fired her on that tuesday the day he got killed we didnt know that this morning when we all were talking we just had ellens word for it but now with carters what did she say alicia when juhle talked to her what do you think she denied it and you think that was a lie i think that al carter and ellen como both didnt independently make up the same story lets put it that way theyre not exactly bosom pals you know theres no indication that theyve ever even talked to each other tamara merely shrugged what else well since you ask devins latest from underneath the limos backseat theres the whole semenonherscarf thing and it is her scarf hunt straightened his back eased himself off the desk and over to the window letting the gravity of this last revelation work its way into tamaras worldview at the window he turned around im not making that last part up tam its her scarf she admitted it it was stuffed into the limos backseat tamara uncrossed her arms her hands went to her belly which she squeezed a couple of times i dont mean for this to give you a stomachache tam but i dont want you and mick thinking youve got to stick up for her because youve all become friendly since this investigation started and also lets remember last monday night shes sleeping in her car a quarter mile from nancy nesheks he came back over to the desk im not saying she did it not yet although dev and sarah are getting pretty close to thinking so but i am saying wed be foolishany of usto just ignore these facts now tamaras hands had settled onto her lap her eyes stared before her without focus does mickey know all this hunt shook his head not what ive found in the past hour or so carter and devins information i tried to call him but his phones off hes probably still down at sanctuary house i left him a message but just to call i thought id tell him like ive told you in person see how he takes it tamara blew out heavily so what about all the money stuff didnt you talk to all those people at the memorial too do they all have alibis for monday the clenched muscles in hunts face started to relax he just barely allowed the corners of his mouth to turn up well thats the other reason im not a hundred percent with devin and sarah about ms thorpe yet i havent eliminated too many other people either but ill tell you one thingthis len turners a piece of work did you talk to him again oh yes definitely did you ask him about monday night as a matter of fact i did well well i asked and he didnt answer not him and not nobody else neither why not because he clean cut me off and how about ellen how about her wyatt monday night hunt met her eyes shook his head in disappointment no no what no never talked to her never even thought of it tamara pulled herself back up close to her desk do you want me to call her and make an appointment maybe if thats the only thing youre supposed to do youll remember maybe hunt said but i dont know if id bet on it len turner sat in a leather chair in his other spacious office the one that housed his law practice on california street he was smoking a cuban cigar and drinking hennessey vsop cognac from a cut crystal glass turner didnt like the storm of bad publicity about the coo money but hed weathered worse the plain fact of the matter as he would explain to jeff elliot as soon as he could arrange an interview with the columnist was that sometimes you didnt see tangible results for specific projects because there was just never enough money period and as in every other business you had to advertise market put on shows to educate and generate enthusiasm for the cause hire consultants and public relations experts pay decent salaries to your executives so that youd get quality people this wasnt just the nonprofit world it was the big wide world the biggest problem with the citytalk column was that it conveyed the impression that because the coo programs specific objectives hadnt been met turner had mismanaged these funds and this in his honest opinion was not the case the simple fact was that the million in private foundation moneyreally a pittancethat supported the coo over the past couple of years needed to be about double that or maybe triple if it was going to address the real needs of real people who lived in the impoverished areas of the city this was because nothing got done for free in san francisco it was a paytoplay environment and had been for all of turners lengthy career if you wanted to renovate a dump of a house in the mission and turn it into a marketable or even usable property first you had to buy it from the slum landlord who hadnt put in an improvement including paint since that landlord of course got a substantial writeoff for the monetary loss entailed in donating his property to your charity then you needed your plans and then your redone plans approved by the housing department for a sizable fee each time through often if not always youd need a zoning variance by the board of supervisors which tended to be exquisitely sensitive to even the most remote and spurious objection to the project brought to them by one concerned constituent or another a residential unit for drug rehabilitation for example because it was used in conjunction with the courts was considered a public building and as such was subject to the strict enforcement of the americans with disabilities act so you often needed internal elevators wheelchair access and restricted handicapped parking spaces all buildings in san francisco of course now had to be retrofitted for earthquakes asbestos had to be removed every step of this process demanded juicesome kind of payoff to someone whether it was financial or political or most commonly both and none of this even included when the real fun began with the awarding of the contract to do the actual work on a publicly bid job for example the contractor better have a woman or two and some gay people and a politically correct mix of caucasian and africanamerican and hispanic and asian workers on the job oh and some veterans even better if theyd been wounded or maimed but the great thing about the fundraising environment in san francisco was that the very idea that somebody was going through the process of trying to get better housing and a better life for poor people and even using rehabilitated drug addicts to do such meaningful work tended to open the coffers of philanthropy never mind that the houses often didnt actually get made the art classes and day care centers didnt get staffed the theaters never put on a show because of all the hassles the payoffs the uncertainties still the money kept coming in to support the efforts and it came in at about the same rate that it was going out to advertise educate and promote of course turner wasnt going to go into all of that with jeff elliot it would be enough to explain the costs and benefits to keeping the programs running at all the major foundation donors all understood the game and would probably continue to give at pretty much the same levels that they always had so he wasnt really too concerned about the coo section of the citytalk column the americorps side of it on the other hand and elliots cavalier parting shot that the nonprofit game was a deadly one was a cause for immediate and serious concern first of all although funding had been cut for only a year this was federal money that once withheld might not ever be reinstated california politicians had a lot of juice in washington turner knew california would get its share of the money and san francisco would always get a bite of that but that didnt mean that turners organizations had to see a dime there were ten others waiting to take up the slack at the first sign of his blood in the water further though all the specific charges of misuse had been leveled at como turner knew that if the feds were sniffing around sunset for misappropriated funds they could not be far from his own complicity and worse outright fraud turner had cautioned como about his largesse to most of the citys political movers and shakers but the man had been a force of nature and did exactly what he wanted when the mood struck him and now all that money was gone with nothing to show for it the actual chargeshaving drivers and errand goers and paying his teaching staff out of americorps moneycould all be explained away as accounting errors in a busy place run by nonprofessionals these things happened more problematic was that turner hadnt been cautious enough himself the legal fees hed accepted from comoand from all of the other americorps recipients that he representedamounted to nothing less than straight kickbacks for helping these charities obtain their federal funding fifty thousand a year here from mission a hundred thousand there from sanctuary house a half a million over four years with sunset turner knew that hed let his greed get away from himhe really didnt know why because he didnt need it but the money was just there for the taking and it seemed ridiculous not to and after the first few years he simply came to believe that the government would never even look at where the money went much less audit for it hed been wrong and now the records were there should the auditors come around to him looking for fraud given time he could probably get that billing cleaned up como and neshek were no longer around to testify against him so he could pass off their excesses and poor bookkeeping on their own organizations fortunately too turner was certain that he could control jaime with the leverage of offering sunset to him and mission back to his wife maybe it could still all work out for the best but then with this hunt fellow nosing around clearly hunt had expanded the original mandate turner had given him to simply monitor the reward calls for the police and more importantly to keep him informed as to the progress of the investigation it seemed to turner now that hunt was actively investigating not just comos but nesheks murder and nobodycertainly not the reward consortiumhad hired him to do that turner considered simply firing hunt and getting someone more tractable to do the job but on reflection he decided to follow the old adage keep your friends close but your enemies closer it looked like for whatever reason hunt was in this for good so long as hunt nominally worked for him at least turner could keep a close eye and maybe even some control on what he was up to and at that thought turner finally felt the knot in his stomach loosen he took a long sip of his cognac and a good pull at his cigar then blew the fragrant smoke out into his beautifully appointed office he was going to have to put in a call to mr hunt remind him of their original understanding the parameters of his role get this last monkey off his back for all the reasons hed elucidated to wyatt hunt the only thing al carter knew for an absolute certainty was that he had to keep his profile as low as possible around the police he was black an exconvict the last person to see como alive as far as he was concerned right there he had strikes one two and three and it might not be long before he was out strikes four and five as if they needed them were his easy access to the tire iron and his lack of alibis on the nights of either of the murders the greater part of him was amazed in fact that the two inspectors hadnt already braced him and brought him downtown for questioning somehow heor maybe just the circumstanceshad held them off for now and maybe what hed told hunt about the thorpe girl would slow them down for a few more days as well he hadnt liked to do that to the girl or to put himself into the evidence mix on any level but realistically what were his other options in the meantime hed been thinking about it nonstop for the past four days and hed come to the decision that he needed some hardcore insurance and finally he thought he had a workable plan now he sat alone in the very back booth in front of a cracked mug of steaming coffee at miz carters mudhouse on california the carters whod run this establishment for years were no relation to al when the door opened he raised his hand and caught the attention of the couple whod just come inhis younger brother mo and mos wife rae they walked on back greeting people they knew in the bustling coffee shop they were childless married for seventeen years and regulars here they were also solid citizensa crucial criterion for als purpose todaythe owners of ebony emery the tanning salon and manicure place a few doors down in the laurel center meanwhile al slid out of the booth and was standing by the time they got back to him he greeted mo with a warm chest bump and a tapped fist and rae with a chaste hug and an air kiss by her ear the original miz carters daughter penny had a couple more cracked mugs of coffee the places funky trademark small plates and a big wedge of cinnamon coffee cake in front of mo and rae before theyd gotten their napkins unwrapped everybody made small talk casual and loose while penny hovered and took orders al on one side of the red leather booth put in an order for a hamburger and a milk shake while his brother and sisterinlaw on the other said theyd split the macandcheese and the house salad as he ordered mo was slicing the cake giving some first to his wife then serving himself when penny went to place the order mo popped a bite of cake into his mouth sipped from his mug then put it down and raised his eyebrows a question but now that the time had come al found his resolve weakening he smiled to cover the sudden embarrassmentthats what it wasthen put his own mug down twirled it a couple of times youre great to come down rae thin and buxom gave him a kind smile that animated her face and made it a thing of beauty it didnt exactly wear us out al then in a more serious vein whats troublin you brother this thing with dominic at least that what else well the neshek woman too i dont know her his brother said one of dominics colleagues got herself killed too this past monday night good lord rae said two of em now two of em carter said mo came forward over his coffee and cake put his elbows on the table and his hands on both sides of his face the ridge over his brows was pronounced almost hooded they got you involved carter blew out a long sigh not yet bromo not yet but youre worried rae asked carter bobbed his head down and up it seems to be my constant state lately so what do they got on you mo asked nothing theres nothing to get he met their eyes one at a time i swear to both of you theres nothing to get rae reached a hand over the table and touched carters well then sugar what you worried about his throat rumbled as though he were chuckling but there wasnt anything funny in his eyes you got to ask she looked down picked at her cake with her long fingernails no i guess not i think about it you think they do that again they did it last time carter said three and a half years for a crime i didnt commit his brother spoke up through his natural reluctance hey al not that you hadnt done some shit okay grant that carter said i was a dumb kid i wasnt an angel maybe im still not but i keep my nose clean and i damn sure didnt kill mr como or anybody else whatever ive done before ive paid for it now and thats not how its supposed to work you know that theyre supposed to send you up for something you actually did last time they missed that little detail i never went near that liquor store and yeah well his brother cut in the problem was you shoulda remembered back then how we all look the same problem is carter said im remembering now and there is no way im going back in on this so what rae stopped and started again why did you need to talk to us how we gonna help you im not sure you can but he stopped speaking as penny showed up back at the booth with their orders after shed put the food down she asked whats a fish say when it swims into a wall they all looked up at her you tell us darlin mo said dam and with a delighted giggle she was gone back to the counter al carter couldnt help himself the absurdity of the ridiculous joke while his life was in such turmoil had him chuckling damn he said shaking his head damn damn damn that womans been reading my mail and suddenly the chuckling turned into real laughter extended laughter finally wiping his eyes carter faced his relatives across the table sorry i dont know why that hit me me neither his brother said rae put a hand on her husbands arm mans got to be under some stress then she looked across at carter with sympathy in her eyes you got to get out more sugar she forked a bite of lettuce so how we gonna help you she asked but you not sure we can whats it going to depend on al mo asked its going to first depend on whether you two spent either tuesday a week ago or monday this week alone together mo stopped his macandcheese on the way to his mouth either or both either would be good enough monday was what rae asked two days ago thats it rae was already reaching for her purse from which she extracted a small spiral calendar she flipped the pages stopped flipped another one went back to her first stop last tuesday no i had my book group went on till midnight she turned the page monday i got nothin thats cause monday is monday night football mo said raiders and baltimore you didnt see that game al matter of fact i did bromo home alone he pointed so you two watched it together just the two of you youre sure romantic fools that we are rae answered so now what carter let out a breath of relief he seemed to see his hamburger for the first time picking it up he took a huge bite sipped some milk shake chewed some more and swallowed okay he said this next parts where it gets tricky were here mo said i know you are carter paused heres my worry its all about these alibis last time when they sent me down you remember here i was minding my own business by my lonesome sleeping at my placehell its two in the morning how unusual is that and thats what i told them but as we know they didnt choose to believe me how could i be home sleeping at the same time im robbing that damn store see so the alibi even though it was the truth wound up hanging me anyway mo put his fork down all right so so im not comfortable telling the man this time that i was home alone havent you already told him that rae asked i did well then well no thats not going to do it what do you mean mo asked i mean i need something else something stronger so youre thinking youre going to change what you told them mos brows had come together in a frown that is no kind of a good idea they know you lied they all over you right carter said which is why i dont go to them and tell them anything everything just stays the same except if they come back on to me mos expression was pure confusion and then what happen then i tell them i lied the couple exchanged a glance i tell them raecarter took a tentative breaththat i was with you thats why i couldnt tell them the truth the first time when they asked i didnt want it to get out to mo i couldnt have it get back to mo raes frown matched her husbands so then they ask me then what then they probably wont even ask but if they do you tell them yeah you were with me mo was home having some beers and watching the game you told him you were out with your girlfriends your book club whatever it was but really you came to my place and stayed on till late he took another sip of his milk shake you think you could go along with that both of you make sure your brother doesnt have to go back to the joint tamara had handled the preliminary meeting to okay the staffing earlier in the day but now at threethirty hunt was still in the middle of his followup meeting with the willard white peoplewill gloria and three of their staffrunning down the tasks hed need to have them perform for his law firm clients over the next week or two they were all jammed into his small back office with straight back wooden chairs for the principals the others sitting on the file cabinets though he had told tamara to hold his calls while the meeting was in progress suddenly the phone on his desk chimed and he glared at it then excused himself and picked it up mickey was propped up in a bed in a double room at san francisco general hospital his ribs were bandaged his left arm was in a soft cast the area around his left eye was swollen and discolored groggy from the painkillers he was otherwise reasonably coherent managing a feeble smile when he saw his sister and then hunt behind her you should see the other guy he said then grimaced he told them that because of the head injury they wanted to keep him overnight for observation but he was sure hed be back to relatively normal in no time he was he said actually very luckyfirst that he wasnt killed and second some cops had come by and told him that the woman whod hit him and whod been completely and unarguably at fault was insured to the hilt hed probably get a good used car out of his totaled wreck of a camaro and at least some if not all of his hospital bill would be paid they might not even have to make a claim on the insurance he carried through hunts business if all went well they would let him out tomorrowtamara could pick him up in the old volkswagen she hadnt driven in six monthsand he might even be in at work by the afternoon dont push it hunt told him whenever youre feeling better then mickey wanted to tell hunt about what hed learned at his visit to sanctuary house that morning and did hunt know that many of the reward participants including nancy neshek had actually been to a communities of opportunity meeting together on monday night at city hall that became clear at the memorial hunt said although they all put on a good act that theyd barely heard about nesheks death you think that was bogus mickey asked hunt shrugged hard to say he gave them both a pretty much wordbyword account of everyones reactions to nesheks murderturner hess carter jaime and lola sanchez it didnt take longand then took a deep breath and came out with what hed been avoiding but aside from them there actually have been a few new developments which youre not going to like too much tamara added what hunt filled him in on the latest news about alicia and mickey brought up the same objections that tamara had earlier well i know how both of you feel hunt replied but id have to say at this point that devin and sarah consider her the prime suspect and you both ought to know that wed be smart to think of her the same way at least until we get something that positively clears her hunts eyes went from mickey around to his sister you think we can do that we can try tamara said at last folding under the pressure of hunts gaze hunt turned back around and leaned in toward the bed how bout you mick mick but mickeys eyes were closed his breathing regular for all the world as though the pain drugs had kicked in again and he had faded off to sleep at a few minutes after six tamara said good bye to hunt got out of the car hed driven her home in opened her buildings front door checked her mailmostly throwaway stuff except for the pg e bill and the latest gourmetand climbed the stairs up to her apartment letting herself in with her key she sang out a greeting but not too loud as her grandfather was known to take the occasional nap hey jim im home when he didnt respond she walked over a few steps his bedroom door was ajar she pushed it open enough to see inside his bed was still made and he wasnt in it well he was probably hanging out with his friends she thought usually he made it a point to get home by dinnertime which tended to be around seven she didnt give his absence a lot of thought she dropped the mail onto its spot at the top of the living room bookshelf then turned and hung up her coat in the closet by the front door on her way into the kitchen to check the refrigerator for something to drink she passed the phone saw the number flashing and pushed the button for playback hi this is alicia thorpe and im trying to get ahold of mickey mickey your cell phones not picking up i think it must be not turned on or something so im trying the other number you gave me could you give me a call as soon as you get this or jim or tamara maybe you could get in touch with him and have him call me i really need to see mickey as soon as i can the police came by again today and well i can tell mickey all this when he calls she left her number and continued i should be able to answer all day i called in sick at work so really anytime but sooner would be better thanks talk to you soon i hope tamara her face now clouded over by concern and indecision stood by the phone and pushed the button to hear the message again this wasnt any social call clearly alicia understood that her situation had changed her voice was charged not just with tension but with an undertone of desperation conflicted by the recent and unequivocal instructions from her boss tamara remained standing by the telephone for another minute or so after that she continued on into the kitchen opened the refrigerator found some orange juice and poured herself a glass bringing it with her she went back to the living room and plopped herself down on the one stuffed chair they had by the back windows she took a good drink and put the orange juice glass on the small table next to the chair then she came forward and clasped her hands she started to get up once thenhamstrung by her indecisivenessall but fell back into the chair on her second try she was more successfulshe got all the way up and over to the telephone it took her another minute before she played the message a third time then at last she picked up the receiver and punched in the numbers alicia this is tamara i got your message here at the apartment i have to tell you that mr hunt doesnt really want us to talk to you either me or mickey i know i think i agree but the bottom line is hes the boss but you should at least know that mickey was in a car accident today no hes okay they think i hope theyre holding him for observation overnight tamara had been planning to come back down to visit mickey again with her grandfather when jim got home but by eightthirty a very long two and a half hours later he had not arrived back at the apartment frustrated now and starting to get worried she tried to call mickey at the hospital but san francisco general hospital did not provide telephones for individual patients in their rooms in fact the afternoon call to the hunt club that had informed her of mickeys condition had not come from mickey directly but from a nurse in the emergency room who placed the call on her cell phone as a favor to her brother on her first try she got cut off when she pressed pound according to the instructions on her second she punched seven different numbers in the automated menu over a fiveminute period each option provided a suitable wait before suggesting the next one the hospital by the way had chosen the mellifluous and relaxing tones of eminem as background while you waited when she finally reached a human being at the nurses station on mickeys floor she could tell immediately from the womans sublimely indifferent bureaucrats tone that it was going to be a trying few more minutes im sorry the woman said we dont deliver messages from the nurses station you can come and visit the patient and deliver your message in person until ten oclock how about if the message though is that i cant get down to visit him well then theres a message center option in the menu that you can access by simply hitting the pound key i tried that before and it didnt work this time its taken me about half an hour to get to talk to you this was an exaggeration of course but it was what it felt like arent you near to his room mickey dade number three twentyseven couldnt you just go and tell him his sister cant make it down tonight and will pick him up in the morning im sorry i cant leave the nursing station unmanned look trying to sound reasonable arent you only like twenty or thirty feet from his room cant you just walk across im sorry but im not allowed to leave the nurses station you can just press pound and leave a message im sure hell get it i pressed pound the last time and it got me disconnected thats not really very likely if youll hold i can just transfer you myself with great reluctance tamara found herself saying all right we can try that thank you a click then an ominous emptiness sounded at her ear for about five seconds before tamara heard a chirpy threetoned highpitched ring and then a metallic disembodied voice if youd like to make a call please hang up and god damn it she slammed the phone back onto the receiver swearing a blue streak she walked into the kitchen made an aboutface came back to the telephone picked it up about a foot and slammed it down again then she turned and stared at the door to her apartment and while were at it she said aloud to no one where the fuck are you jim the drugs were beginning to wear off but when mickey opened his eyes for a minute he thought he might be hallucinating alicia what are you doing here shouldnt you be at work your sister told me what happened she sat in a chair near the head of his bed beyond her he caught a glimpse of the wall clockeight fortyfive you look really beat up i wouldnt be surprised are you okay they say im going to live but she really nailed me the other driver i mean he closed his eyes briefly opened them again yep alicia was still there you didnt have to come down here he said im glad you did but i had to see you she said well you came to the right place i dont seem to be going anywhere soon i have to talk to you can we do that he abandoned the flippancy of course why wouldnt i talk to you because your boss told you not to mickey went to shake his head but with the pain didnt get far he didnt exactly tell me not to he just said it would be dumb why does he say i killed dominic too he says hes keeping an open mind but he does believe the cops are thinking that way so tam and i ought to watch out too mickey she reached out and rested her hand on his arm i swear to you i didnt have anything to do with that or with nancy neshek either i promise all right please tell me you believe me mickey drew in a breath here indeed was the crux he didnt need to consciously recall the many discussions hed had with tamara in the wake of the boyfriend whod betrayed her and wyatt hunt and everyone else hed known those conversations were by now part of his dna even mickey had considered craig a good guy possibly a future brotherinlaw and a fine choice at that and now here mickey was in an analogous situation with a woman for whom he had an attraction that wasno other word for itdangerous and still knowing everything he did he was thinking about committing in the same way his sister had committed more than thinking about it almost without conscious volition he found himself answering her i do believe you he said you didnt kill anybody at his words her eyes teared up and she put her head down resting it against the side of the bed her shoulders rose and fell a couple of times before she looked up at him again how can i ever thank you dont worry about that the big question is what are you going to do now i dont know i dont have any idea thats why i came here to ask you i think theyre going to arrest me i cant let myself get arrested mickey i really cant you think theyre that close she nodded i dont know what they need but they asked me if i had any plans to travel outside the bay area anytime soon if you want my opinion i think im their main suspect she moved her chair closer in to the bed and now spoke in a near whisper i didnt go in to work today i didnt want them to know where to find me you think theyd arrest you down there at mortons why not thats where they questioned me the first time mickey hesitated following the inexorable logic of what must have been true so youre out of your room too he asked she didnt seem surprised at the question i grabbed some stuff as soon as they left and threw it in my car so where are you going to go from here mickeyshe hesitatedi dont have anyplace to go my brothers the only family ive got and i know theyd look for me at his place id just been sitting out by the beach until i heard from tamara then finally i decided i needed to come in here to ask you to help me in spite of himself mickeys chest heaved as a bitter laugh began then stopped with the clutch of his broken ribs wincing he moved his right hand over to cover them mickey im okay im okay he puffed out a quick breath then another just enjoying the humor in you thinking i could help you especially how i am right now but i know you can he closed his eyes and took a beat to think she wanted him to help her was begging him to help her she was not who they thought she was and he might be her only hope left opening his eyes he met her gaze look alicia he said this is a little town how long do you think you can hide from them if they really want to find you a couple of days a week a month and do you really think that doing that will make it better for you when they do find you even if you could avoid them for a little while youd just be making it worse i dont care if its days or a week mickey i need some time and they need some time to look at other suspects so you were parked all day out at the beach right you dont think theyve got the plates on your car i dont know then realizing the obvious they would wouldnt they you can bet on it you might as well have gone in to work youre in that car they got you i didnt think of that have you used your cell phone sure to call work and say i was sick then your house and then when tamara called me back and then ian just to let him know where i was slowly now slowly against the pain mickey shook his head you cant use your cell phone alicia they can locate you by that they can a small smile its a rough environment for fugitives out there but im not a fugitive im not under arrest not yet anyway she brought her hands up to her forehead rubbed it brought her hands back down theyre just not looking in the right places mickey they cant be theyve got to be missing something this was what we talked about when we first got together you remember you were going to investigate the murder now murders and not let them land finally on me you remember that dont you thats what this was all about right was i making all that up the details still fresh in his mind mickey experienced again the rush of those moments when hed determined that his plan could resuscitate the dying hunt club while at the same time give him an opportunity to get to know this woman this remarkable woman this woman with whom he could see himself well hed done the hunt club part it had its new clients and its reward billings his efforts had at least for the time being even brought his sister back from the edge of anorexia returned to her some of her sense of selfworth all that was left was in some respects the personal respects the most important part and now the person at the center of that was asking him if she was making all that up everything hed promised her had she just imagined that was it all merely a game for mickey to toy with and then drop when it became inconvenient difficult even perilous was she take away the selfserving rationalizations just another pretty girl to him was i mickey she repeated was i making all that up he took his right hand off his ribs and laid it gently on her shoulder no he told her thats still what this is about thank you she whispered thank you she put her hand over his then leaned over and kissed it so what are we going to do mickey with some difficulty pushed himself up on the bed first he said wed better find where they hid my clothes the clothes and valuables were hung in a plastic bag in the closet mickeys bed was one in a threebed room but the one closest to the door the other patients in the room had screens pulled around those beds and the one in the middle had three visitors chatting away after she brought over the bag of mickeys clothes alicia went to the hallway door and stood in it just inside the room even moving slowly and with great care it didnt take mickey more than two minutes to get on his underwear and pants he couldnt get his shirt over the cast but thank god it had been a cold day and he had his jacket which served he called alicia back to him and she helped him with his shoes left untied his socks were just too much trouble to even bother with they went into his jacket pocket along with the shirt she took his good right arm and together they strolled out into the hallway the walk out of the hospital was challenging dizziness made him come to a dead stop three times beyond that even though it was his left arm that was broken his left leg had evidently gotten banged up badly as well both his hip and his knee throbbed with every step and his ribs were worseconstant pinching pain that kept him from standing straight once they cleared the building itself just walking unimpeded out the front entrance they hit the drizzle and the biting wind alicia was wearing her jeans and hiking boots and a waterresistant ski jacket over a pullover sweater and she pulled her left arm out of the sleeve and wrapped the jacket over mickeys shoulders holding his right arm pressing up tight against him nevertheless by the time they made it out to alicias car at the very far end of the darkened parking lot mickey was shivering his teeth actually chattering a general pain now diffused by the shaking throughout his body alicia opened the front passenger side door and got him into the seat then spun out of her heavy jacket and draped it over him tucking it in around him she ran around the car got in turned on the ignition and set the heater to max itll warm up in a minute she said then well jam the fan still shivering his teeth audible in the close space huddled down inside the blanket mickey could barely get out one word good alicia revved the engine to speed the heating process but kept her lights and the windshield wipers off they were cocooned the drizzle on the cars windows preventing them from seeing much outside in less than a minute she reached down and turned the fan onto high and feeling the vent she nodded better than outside already mickey rocking almost imperceptibly back and forth just shook his head five minutes later the car was warm enough that he didnt need her jacket and she gently helped him get it unwrapped from around him his shivering had stopped and with the surcease of movement the pain had noticeably lessened everywhere but in his arm and ribs no phones he said in fact turn it off completely but what if we have to call somebody well borrow somebodys or find a pay phone we really dont want to use your cell starting now okay she held down the button that turned her phone off im trusting you thats a good idea she looked over at him so what are we going to do now good question he said dancings definitely out though darn i know its a disappointment im a great dancer actually you ever go to the swing clubs not enough drawback of working nights well when we get out of this maybe some monday or tuesday he lapsed into a thoughtful silence and eventually alicia broke it mickey im thinking you got any close girlfriends you can trust who live alone she considered for a moment then shook her head not who live alone no im about the only one my age i know who does what are you thinking im thinking youre going to have to lie low somewhere where the cops wont think to look for you if it gets to that plus weve got a car problem this one might as well have a sign on it so weve got to put it someplace where it cant be seen but then we cant use it thats right so how do i get around where do you have to go thats not close to your biggest problem good point but how do you get around for that matter you dont have a car anymore either plus you can barely walk theres that too he said grimly youve got to give me a minute here he gently probed at his head are you hurting bad she asked he glanced over at her and tried a smile in the living room of her nob hill condominium gina roake sipped her oban and said youve got a half hour to cut that out completely buster i mean it wyatt hunt rubbing her feet on the ottoman between them gave her a grin a half hour from now im betting ill have moved on to other things promises promises you wait and see i believe i will she sighed contentedly leaned back sipped her scotch again so how close is our inspector juhle hes waiting until the dna work comes in on the semen but even if he gets a hit its still a long way to tipperary it all comes down to whether or not he fired her that morning he nodded appreciatively at her and if youre paying attention i believe that would be your influence at work on juhle its going to be a while before he makes an arrest again before hes got the evidence lets hope youd think theyd teach that in cop school they do then they get out into the real world and need to make arrests especially when they know who did it as in this case gina sighed and in so many others well yes no argument there so theyre convinced its this woman alicia id say yes what do you think hunt considered for a moment roake softly kicked his hands its not a trick question you dont have to answer if its going to make you stop apologies hunts hands went back to work on her feet what do i think i think its highly unlikely that both ellen como and al carter independently made up the story about her getting fired the day he gets killed i think that happened what does she say she says not but then again she would wouldnt she roake shrugged so then i think hunt pressed that if thats true if como fired her then she had a damn good reason to kill him especially if they were intimate and the scarf establishes that pretty much if its his semen roake brought her scotch to her lips anybody ever see them together out of work maybe going into her place some motel one of sunsets residential units i havent heard of that at work yeah according to ellen but i dont think devin and sarah have gotten around to asking neighbors if thats what you mean except you know youre alone together in a limo four or five hours a day im willing to lay odds a determined couple could get in a little nooky from time to time and it does appear in fact that thats what happened doesnt it could have happened if it was actually como or alicia for that matter although it might have been neither neither neither the drivercarter is itand his girlfriend if any or one of the other young male drivers and somebody they were driving around on any given day hunt stopped rubbing her feet again and chuckled roake you are definitely in the right field you know that what does that mean it means that your devious defenselawyer mind just automatically sees all the ways you can rearrange and argue the facts so that the most obvious explanation gets lost in the shuffle well sometimes the most obvious explanation is wrong most of the time though not still enough to make the exercise worthwhile from what ive told you dont you think its likely alicia i have no idea with a sigh she pulled her legs back off the ottoman and sat up straighter in her chair she put her glass of oban down on the table next to her seat there is simply nothing ive heard that comes close to convicting her wyatt if i were going to be exerting any energy here i have to tell you im still liking len turner who i had a nice chat with this morning you know roake sucked in a quick breath concern suddenly obvious in her demeanor you didnt do anything to make him feel threatened i hope no he was surrounded by his gang at comos memorial do you know what if anything juhle and russo are doing about him hunt shook his head no not much i dont think looking into his alibis if any trying to get a feel for his financial records asking ellen como or anybody else about personnel or financial problems that might have come up recently between him and como seeing if turner has any kind of special relationship with any of the battalion members all of those would be included under the general heading of not much what about the battalion nothing specifically and again just rumors why am i doubting that roake she wilted under hunts gaze all right she said although it galls me if this is the way it has to get to juhle and russo they should be looking in this direction already if i didnt think you needed to know so youll take mr turner more seriously i wouldnt mention it okay hunt said casually thats a good lead in what do you know i know and everybody knows that one of the battalions visible roles is that for only twenty dollars they hand out little signs you put in your window that your business supports the sunset youth project youve seen them all over the city right right so so what most people dont know is the percentage of contacted businesses of all types that support the syp you want to guess all businesses right asian cleaners and restaurants hispanic mom and pops muslim shop owners law offices cigar stores everybody take a stab hunt shrugged forty percent close gina said a hundred percent hunt was silent for a long beat theyre selling protection he said no they couldnt be gina responded the city would surely bust them would it not oh except if they somehow had enough political influence to just let the practice remain a necessary evil the cost of doing business here the syp is really doing a world of good for a lot of people and thats true so businesses should be glad to pony up twenty bucks for such a good cause plus they get the nice sign in the window that cant be the entire battalion no its not its only a few who go out if somebody doesnt pay trusted senior guys in other words professional muscle on the payroll and paid for by your tax dollars by the way and you think turners got access to these guys not exactly no well then wyatt i know it fifteen years youre a public defender here you learn a few things these kids arent angels to begin with you know como gives them the jobs strictly legit tutoring and cleaning up at ortega passing out political pamphlets and like that eventually the promising ones are in the battalion moving up getting paid decent money americorps money by the way lifes good turner picks a few every year and just tells them if they want to stay on theyll just do this or that break the window on this store vandalize that flower shop strongarm some liquor store clerk otherwise they go back to jail and como didnt know about this gina shrugged maybe he did i dont know but he wouldnt have had to or maybe it was his cost of doing business and he thought it was a fair trade or maybe he just found out last week and he called turner on it youre saying turner could have one of these battalion kids kill for him im saying if i were juhle or russo at least id try to rule it out oh and if it turns out this is any part of it i told jeff elliot id split the reward with him ill put that in my report if the time comes with a strong recommendation ive got a strong recommendation for you roake drained the last of her scotch and placed it down on the lamp table with finality she reached over took his hand and stood up if you want to get the lights it was by no means the obvious choice in fact it was risky and desperate but mickey couldnt think of another solution alicia had abandoned her own digs if juhle and russo were planning to put her under arrest the next place they would look would probably be ians who was listed at mortons as her primary contact in case of an emergency as shed told mickey none of her girlfriends lived alone so they were out and once they realized that mickey had disappeared from the hospital they would undoubtedly come to his place they could go to a motel of course but that was both expensive and impracticalthey would have to register and he with a black eye and his arm in a cast would be easy to identify eventually he formed his plan and under his direction she took the freeway to the sixth street exit and turned right onto brannan then made a uturn and pulled into the depressed curb space outside an industrial rollup garage door to a goodsized and completely darkened warehouse mickey got out into the now frankly bitter night and pushed the button on the box next to the metal door adjacent to the garages entrance when no one answered he got back into the car and directed alicia to turn right at the next corner then to take another quick right into the alley behind brannan she pulled over and stopped by a low stoop under a darkened door that he knew to be painted bright orange by day the light over the door and all the windows in a row high along the wall were dark but mickey knew where he was going as he got out of the car again and found the key right where it was supposed to be tucked into a magnet case that was stuck against the upper inside edge of a floor vent on the side of the stoop he told alicia to wait where she was then opening the back door he let himself into hunts warehouse on the residential side he deactivated the alarm and then turning on lights as he walked through the kitchen den hallway by the bedroom he let himself into the massive basketball court side then crossed to the door next to the garage and unlocked it retracing his steps in spite of his gimpy walk he was in seconds back in alicias car directing her down to the end of the alley then through another couple of right turns back onto brannan and then waiting by the curb while he let himself in again and pushed the button to raise the garage door as soon as she was all the way inside with mickey getting her parked so shed be out of the way of wyatts cooper another push of the button let the garage door down alicia let herself out of the car and stood dumbstruck turning all the way around as she attempted to take it all inthe half basketball court the guitars and audio stuff the computers against the opposite wall where are we she finally asked my boss lives here pretty cool huh unbelievable it may have been unbelievable but it was also very cold on this side of the warehouse and in another minute they were inside the living area where the temperature was close to seventy degrees alicia found herself a seat in a leather andchrome reading chair in the den and mickey went to help himself to a couple of beers from hunts refrigerator he brought back the pilsner urquells and a corkscrew that doubled as a bottle opener i could open these he said but i bet you could do it easier i bet i could too she opened both bottles passed one to mickey who gingerly sat on hunts tan leather couch so did i miss something she asked does your boss know we were coming here mickey tipped up his bottle i dont see how he could have since i didnt know it myself until about a half hour ago but yeah i know it could be a problem but i dont think so wyatts a good guy and hes on the right side besides that and more important juhle wouldnt ever believe that hed be keeping you here not without telling him and at least until theres a warrant out for you theres no legal issue you can stay anywhere you want so were staying here thats my plan mickey sipped more beer for a few days anyway its the safest place i can think of plus your cars off the street presto youre disappeared thats scary maybe but a lot safer for you and not just because of juhle what do you mean i mean whoever killed dominic and neshek if they know youre a suspect and you say show up dead looking like a suicide well now wouldnt that be convenient now you are scaring me well thats one of the reasons i thought of coming here youre safe here from everybody alicia digested that for a long moment so when is mr hunt getting home i dont know sometime you dont want to call him and leave a message were here i dont think so mickey said he didnt want to give hunt the option of ordering them outnot an impossibilitybefore hed had a chance to argue for his position it might be better as a surprise nobody ever cooks for me mickey said except in restaurants well i do now at tenfourteen on this wednesday night alicia was standing over a bowl of half a dozen broken eggs in hunts kitchen by his fourburner viking stove mickey had stolen one of hunts shortsleeved sweatshirts and he and alicia had maneuvered it down over his cast and now he satnearly reclined actuallyat the kitchen table shed already set out a couple of plates and utensils and had bread going in the toaster he held his justopened third beer in his right hand pouring the eggs into the skillet she pinched some salt and pepper over them then opened the spice cabinet over the kitchen counter and took down a small bottle of yellowish liquid truffle oil normal people have truffle oil dont leave home without it mickey said sure should i put some in every chance you get in a small stream she added some of the magical stuff gathered the eggs with a spatula then turned off the heat as the toast popped up after buttering it she put a slice on each plate ladled the eggs onto each covering both pieces of toast completely then topping the mass with another pat of butter mickey picked up his fork and took a bite these are perfect he said after theyd finished their eggs and alicia had washed up they were back in the den mickey had perked up when theyd first arrived and that burst of energy had carried him through their meal but now he sat slumped down in the reading chair feet up on an ottoman head on a pillow covered with a blanket that alicia had found next to the pillow on the top shelf of hunts bedroom closet the couch opens up his voice sounded thick and groggy you can sleep there what about you im good here im almost asleep already sorry mick youre mangled and battered you get the bed period are we going to have a fight about this she was already pulling the cushions off the couch no youre going to get in the bed as soon as i get it made and what about you ive got my trusty sleeping bag and pad in the back of my car out there she pulled out the couch mattress which was already made up for guests with a sheet and a blanket then pulling down a corner of the blanket she turned to face him do you need help getting up no but even as he said it he winced at the attempt stop she stepped over and took off his shoes then held his feet up while she moved the ottoman out from under them next she removed the blanket and draped it over the bed with his feet flat on the floor he took her hand with his good arm and lifted himself into a sitting position while she went to one knee in front of him okay she said good arm around my neck easy easy suppressing the urge to moan he was up still leaning on her she guided him over a few steps then helped him down so that he was sitting on the bed finally she put his pillow down where his head would be lifted his feet and turned him so that he could recline fully she pulled the oversheet and both blankets over him and tucked them in then she lowered herself and sat on the edge of the bed hows that clearly the movement had cost him any boost hed felt when theyd first gotten here had dissipated with the adrenaline and the beer now a light sweat had broken on his forehead and he was breathing through the pain in his ribs slowly and deeply through parsed lips good would you tell me if it was bad maybe he broke a tired smile probably not you macho guys she gently wiped his forehead with a corner of the oversheet then tucked it back around him after a minute her shoulders settled and she let out a long sigh im so sorry mickey for what getting you into this you didnt get me into this i got me into this she brooded on that for a long beat not really if i she exhaled heavily again anyway i dont know how i can thank you i dont know what id be doing right now if it wasnt for you youd be fine no id be running i think though i see now how dumb that would be he shook his head ever so slightly theres no need to run not yet maybe not ever but i wouldnt have known that if not for you id have just screwed up more mickey put his hand softly on her thigh you havent screwed up you didnt do anything wrong look at me alicia look at me you havent done anything wrong she turned to face him but couldnt hold his gaze rather her mouth trembled and she closed her eyes she put her hand over his as though grasping it for support for a long moment neither of them moved mickey studied her face on the verge of tears and then heavy drops formed and fell at the same time from both of her eyes hey mickey squeezed her leg hey now its going to be all right but she was shaking her head from side to side no i have screwed up i did do something wrong no you didnt you just i did mickey i did i i lied to those inspectors ive even been lying to you now she looked straight down at him that last morning when i came in to work dominics last day what about it he did fire me he said i couldnt work at sunset anymore he couldnt see me anymore either he said we could never see each other again her shoulders began to shake and a deep wrenching sob broke from her throat tamara got ready for bed and then turned on the television to watch the late news generally preferring to read or in the old days when she had a social life to hang out with friends she almost never watched tv but tonight it was the only thing she could think of to keep herself from imploding with frustration concern and anger mostly anger jim parr still hadnt made it home where the hell had he gone and why wouldnt he have called if hed known he was going to be so late but of course he didnt have a cell phone had never bothered to learn how to use one as if this took some sort of special dexterity or brains she had already decided that she and mickey were going to buy him one immediately if not sooner of course then he probably wouldnt pick it up when the damn thing rang on his belt he had nothing but scorn for her and mickey being the slaves to technology anyway beyond that she would be good and goddamned if she would try getting through the gestapo switchboard at san francisco general again to try to talk to mickey she did consider testing her volkswagen and driving down there but in the end decided that since it was past visiting hours shed have less chance actually seeing him than she would talking to him on the telephone and wasnt it just the perfect karma for today that micks cell phone had died in the accident so she couldnt call him directly that was really special and further proof that god hated her and when wyatt hunt had dropped her off at her home earlier he told her that he had a date with gina roake and it was far too late to interrupt them even if she thought wyatt might have been able to help in some way which she didnt finally she knew she could call the police and report her grandfather as missing except that it was decidedly premature for that she knew from work that authorities would do nothing about a missing person report until that person had been missing for at least three days beyond that jim had been home most nights for the past six months since tamara had lived here but at least three times hed wound up staying out somewhere mysterious and didnt seem to feel the need to explain where or to check in with his grandchildren shed thought it was just drinking and probably passing out at the apartment of one of his bocceball companions but then shed discovered the plastic container of viagra certainly not mickeys when shed been cleaning up one day and a little later had overheard him bragging to mick that hed gotten lucky but the whole tenor of the evening nagging at her she thought shed better at least check the late night news to see if there was anything about a body of an old man being found in a ditch or somewhere but though there was no shortage of murder and mayhem in and around the greater bay area there was no mention of anyone who could have been her grandfather at the end of the program the smiling weatherman informed her that the northern storm whose lower edge had arrived in the city this morning would really slam them tomorrow it would be cold and wet great news for a droughtstarved state and more good newsit was expected to drop up to four feet of snow in the sierra somehow underwhelmed by all the terrific weather and other news tamara hit the remote pulled the covers over her head on the murphy bed turned onto her side and went to sleep hunt liked to run most mornings but he wasnt a fanatic when the weather turned this ugly he thought he could let a day go by and not miss it too much hed pump some iron at home and maybe get in a sprint workout on the court and could still be showered and shaved dressed and ready to head for work by eight with his windshield wipers slapping away at a few minutes after six oclock hunt depressed the garage door button on his cars visor and started to turn in only to abruptly slam on his brakes just there to his right parked along the wall was a dark blue honda element a frown creased his brow and he considered jamming his car into reverse backing out of there and calling the police telling them he had an intruder instead though he scanned the open space in front of him the coopers lights were still on and he could see at a glance that no one was lying in wait for him although someone could conceivably be using the honda for cover his heart pumping in his ears he pushed the visor button and heard the garage door beginning to close behind him moving the cooper forward he next pushed the dashboard button to shut off his engine pulled out his keys and opened his car door his cars beams now were out and crouching low he scampered over to the light switch next to the metal door and brought up the room lights nothing and nothing looked to have been touched on this side of the warehouse anyway hunt owned a couple of guns he generally did not carry them with him and didnt have them now they were locked into a hidden safe under a pullup board in the floor in his bedroom note to self he was thinking when youre working on any aspect of a murder case carry your piece you just never know but if that was todays lesson it was too late to benefit from it now again he considered letting himself out into the downpour using his cell phone getting a police presence or some reinforcements but again something stopped him it was all so quiet his alarm should have gone off every nerve on full alert he walked over to the element and dared a quick look inside through the slightly tinted window he could see that the backseats had been folded up to the sides there looked to be a pile of clothes covering the floor all but tiptoeing now he crossed his basketball court and got to the inner door which was unlocked and opened it without a sound the rooms on this side of the warehouse would only be naturally lit by the high windows in the far wall and little of that light penetrated to this hallway which was close to pitchblack now he didnt hesitate at all but picked his steps as quietly as he could into his bedroom dim light from the windows here relieved the blackness of the hall but not by much over in the corner he lifted the edge of the throw rug by now he was breathing hard and drops of sweat were beginning to stand out on his forehead somebody was still in or had been in his place and if he was going to meet them even if it was someone he might know from somewhere enough that they knew about his alarm and its secret code it was going to be on his terms he pulled up the floorboard and silently lifted it away the last time hed closed his safe as was his habit hed set it so that the combination was mostly set and needed only a half turn to the right this time it worked as it should and he reached in and lifted out his acp sig sauer p the gun was loaded and he released the safety and snicked a round into the chamber then walked back out into the hallway turning on the lights as he went hunt was by no means over his adrenaline rush and his anger and he spoke in a whisper all the more intimidating for its control you could have so easily gotten yourself killed both of you i cant believe how stupid this is they were all sitting at the kitchen table the gun safety now back on rested on the counter behind them mickey was still barefoot in his jeans and hunts sweatshirt augmented by the blanket wrapped around his shoulders alicia barefoot wore her jeans from last night though shed thrown on a brown turtleneck sweater from the stash in her car alicia raised her eyes to meet hunts ill go if you want me to no at his outburst mickey clutched at his ribs hunts expression dark he turned to his employee thats not the worst idea ive ever heard mick and wheres she supposed to go how about back home how about to her regular life mickey very slowly shook his head shes not going to have a regular life until this is over wyatt juhle and russo think its her you told me that yourself i also told you theyre a long way from a warrant that could change in a heartbeat and besides its not just them its not alicia took the opportunity to break in mickey thinks that whoever really did this might might want to kill me too hunts mouth twitched in derision and why would they want to do this if shes the main suspect mickey said and then she kills herself or its made to look like she kills herself the investigation goes away hunt took a beat ive always said youve got a good imagination mick this guys already killed two people why wouldnt he kill somebody else if it would end it you dont think that could happen a lot of things could happen mick do i think theres a likelihood he turned his gaze from one of them to the other no yeah well i dont want to bet on likelihoods any likelihood at all is too much you want to bet alicias life that something like that wont happen we just cant do that hunt blew out a heavy breath look mickey went on we took this job among other reasons to investigate this murder now these murders and try our damnedest to keep alicia out of jail thats not why we took this job yes it is wyatt it is exactly its what i promised her before i even came to you about the rewards this unexpected information didnt make hunt any happier it might have been nice to let me know about that a little sooner mickey started to shrug but the pain stopped him its what i did wyatt it seemed like the right thing alicia did not do this either of these hunts glance at alicia made it clear that he wasnt close to sold on this story he came back at mickey so what do you propose we do as opposed to what weve already been doing trying to investigate these murders well first mickey said without hesitation for her own safety she stays here he held up his good hand look theres no warrant out on her devin and russo havent even asked her to check in with them so shes just hard to find visiting a friend however you want to spin it if it comes up at all what if they get a warrant or the grand jury gives em an indictment you told me that wont happen at least until they get the other dna and even with the dna wheres the case against alicia mickey looked over at her seemingly took strength from her expression of gratitude and if they come back with a warrant or indictment then we ask gina to come aboard as her lawyer for the first time hunt relaxed his fierce front and wouldnt devin love that wouldnt he except mickey wasnt done but thats not going to happen wyatt devin and russo havent even looked at neshek yet therell be clues at the crime scene there the investigation is going to open up something will break or else one of our reward people will come up with something at least itll move in a different direction and then alicia can go back to her life and in the meanwhile shes here nobodys going to look for her here wyatt she can sleep in her car you wont even know it hunt looked from one of them back to the other i hate this he said but then unbidden and unwelcome he recalled the discussion hed had with gina the night before all of the unanswered questions about the money about len turner about his connections if any to the battalion and mickey was righteven forgetting the nancy neshek homicide all of that was stuff devin and sarah had barely begun to look at still mickey had without his permission moved a murder suspect into his home had essentially committed the firm to take her on as a de facto client and one who didnt seem likely to come up with a retainer but even beyond all that was mickeys point that if the damned woman was in fact innocent she might be at risk and now hed made it hunts business you know what they say about fish and guests he asked after three days both stink hunts face had reverted back to where it had been all morning unyielding so three days thats my best offer then we figure out some other accommodation he pushed back his chair got up grabbed the gun and walked off down the hallway toward his bedroom the windshield wipers kept up their regular rhythm hunt grimfaced waited out the red light on market finally he turned to mickey youre sure youre okay to be moving around mickey barely inclined his head i moved around more last night thats not what i asked ill be all right weve only got three days it might be longer than that you might want to prepare yourself it probably will be in fact so dont get your hopes up and then where does she go as you say well figure something out ive got some people i know from cooking classes who might let her crash with them yeah hunt said make more friends the light turned green ahead of them the line of traffic did not move the driver behind hunt laid on his horn and hunt said i wonder if hed do that if he knew i was packing mickey received this intelligence in silence but he shot a quick look over at his boss say what he would to the contrary hunts decision to carry a gun on him marked a sharp escalation in his estimation of the dangers of this case so hunt said when i got there this morning you were both on the sofa bed you want to elaborate on that and in case youre wondering its not really a question of whether you want to or not i need to know your relationship friends but yes i find her attractive im attracted to her you tell her that i think shes probably figured it out but nothings happened nothing she was nervous out in her car alone finally they rolled ahead about two car lengths six or eight cars ahead of them the light turned red again so how do you know shes innocent and you do realize i hope that you are betting your life and maybe mine on that i think you can tell when someone is a good person some people and i know all about what youre going to say about you and tam and craig but alicia is different shes real shes consistent just last night she even told me the one thing shed done that she felt she hadnt handled correctly in this investigation and nobody made her tell me that she just wanted to be completely honest and what was that the office door opened and tamara raised her head and turned her eyes wide with surprise mickey what are you i was going to come down and get you at the hospital in a couple of hours how are you but in the palpable tension she shut up hunt a couple of steps behind him let mickey step out of the wayjust barelyand then with a curt nod and no greeting passed around tamaras desk to his own door which he opened and then turned back to her im not to be disturbed half an hour he said no exceptions he closed the door silently behind him mickey slowly and carefully lowered himself into the one clients chair for a very long moment the siblings just stared at each other finally tamara drew a deep breath this is going to sound like a ridiculous question since youve been in the hospital but have you heard from jim have i heard from jim she nodded he was supposed to go to the memorial yesterday though i dont know if he actually did and in any event he didnt come home last night ive been worried sick about him al carter was reluctant to make too many changes in his habits lest he call undue attention to himself so on thursday morning he presented himself at the ortega campus at eighttwenty which was the new time hed been coming in since dominic como had originally gone missing of course there was still no limo but he had to believe that things someday would return to normal and when they did he didnt want to have lost his place in the pecking order the day seemed to be getting off to a slow start again this morning following the closure of the admin offices until midafternoon of the day before for comos memorial al had dropped by here after his meeting with his brother and sisterinlaw at the mudhouse yesterday he stayed just long enough to let his presence register and to pick up a stack of a hundred or so pledge cardsnewly printed with a recent photo of a smiling and vibrant dominic como all the sunset people had been urged to hand these out to acquaintances friends and businesses so it was good form to grab a bunch and disappear with them although in carters case he simply tossed them into his garbage when he finally got home now he closed his umbrella and walked through the empty echoing lobby the teachers lounge back behind the wideopen general offices area seemed to have attracted everyone whod so far come in to work today and it fairly hummed with lowkey activity making his way through the desks and cubbies outside when he got to the lounge door he put on a confident and sober face and waded into the crowd younger battalion members mingled here democratically with both the clerical and executive staff someone had brought in doughnuts and of course there was regular and decaf coffee and hot water for those who wanted tea or hot cider but in spite of the sweets and drinks between comos and nesheks deaths yesterdays citytalk column and the miserable weather the mood in the room was decidedly somber al slapped some backs and made small talk as he negotiated his way through to the refreshment table not for nothing had he worked all those years with the consummate politician that was dominic como he finally found himself holding a jelly doughnut and a cup of coffee on the periphery of a small group of women that included his nominal new boss lorraine hess in a quick appraisal carter saw that the events of the past two weeks had played havoc with hesss looks when al had first come on at sunset shed been in her mid to upper thirties and quite attractive vivacious and upbeat with a body that was a little short of spectacular over the years shed softened her image and her body tone considerably until she began to fit als description of the poster child for the aging female bureaucratlarge and gray but especially when she smiled which had until recently been quite often her face had always retained something of its youthful glow and even beauty but not today today she wore fatigue like a shroud that enveloped all of her her eyes rimmed with dark bags had sunk in over her hollowedout cheeks even through the thick padding of imperfectly applied makeup blotches were apparent on her forehead on the imprecise jowllined thickness of her jaw the conversation she was engaged in with the other women around her concerned the americorps improprieties and what they would mean in terms of immediate funding whether there would be layoffs how it would affect sunsets ability to conduct business with the city hess a master at these administrative and bureaucratic details was holding her own against the onslaught downplaying the threat but al could clearly see that on top of everything else shed endured these topics and her people were wearing her down he decided to rescue her pardon me for butting in he said but lorraines telling you the truth its not going to change anything dominic knew all about this long ago too he was trying to get it all straightened out behind the scenes before they went public with it but well we know what happened before he could do that but the plain fact is and weve all heard him say it a hundred times that with government funding when you get a difference of opinion one side is going to say that the other is guilty of sin thats discouraging especially when were set on helping others but the thing we have to do now all of us is just to forget about all this bad news and go back about our work and not concern ourselves with things over which we dont have control first of all len turner and dominic were already talking about appealing the suspension of funding and next when lorraine takes over here fulltime shell convince these auditors that all of these are insignificant issues that have for the most part been resolved isnt that right lorraine she forced a weary smile exactly thats what ive been trying to say this isnt the time to panic but to buckle down and do our work and alnow the smile came to bloomfor a minute there you sounded like you were channeling dominic i think after eight years he may have rubbed off some well keep him around if you can al showed some of his own teeth i intend to the bell indicating the first period of the school day sounded and al more or less naturally fell into step beside hess as she headed back toward her office when theyd cleared the lounge she took his arm and leaned in toward him thank you for that in there he shrugged theyre just worried its a hard time tell me about it but im still very grateful for your help speaking up it gets tiresome talking about it and then she was opening her office door and they were inside hess went around her desk and sighing lowered herself into her chair i wanted to ask you al began any word on when we get the limo back she shook her head shouldnt be too long why do you ask well nobodys noticed too much yet but i dont seem to have a job ive been filling the hours distributing pledge cards but he trailed off with a hopeful smile but thats hardly the most productive use of your time well yes that but more i was wondering about later in what sense i mean when you move up the whole question of the limo if youd be doing the job the same way dominic did in that way from her reaction it might have been the first time shed considered that question she cocked her head to one side let the beginning of a small thoughtful smile hover at her lips for a moment if youre asking me will i be needing a driver she said i cant imagine doing the job without one and i also cant imagine it being anyone but you al does that answer your question he didnt want to appear either too grateful or too needy so he simply nodded yes maam it does thank you so great was hunts fury that he didnt trust himself to come out of his office and face mickey again after first verifying that mickey had independent transportation around towntamaras volkswagenhe gave his orders to tamara by intercom that mickey was to get the identity of everybody whod been at the monday night communities of opportunity meeting at city hall and then get all of their alibis what theyd done after theyd left the meeting that ought to take mickey the rest of the day and maybe then some hunt thought and it might possibly though not definitely keep hunt from killing or maiming his young gullible dumbshit associate when he was sure mickey had gone hunt stood up opened his door went into the outer office and put a haunch on the corner of tamaras desk did he tell you uhhuh basically shes at your place if she hasnt stolen my goods and lit out for the border already but did he also tell you about her lying to the police her brow clouded i think he left out that part hunt filled her in and you know what this means dont you im not sure well forgetting the obvious obstruction of justice and lets do that this is the one bit of information that if she tells it to devin or sarah puts her in jail why because getting fired on the last day of dominics life counts believe me if we only know about that from ellen como its just what she thinks dominic intended to do if we get it from carter its what he thinks he overheard but if its an admission we get directly from alicia guess what its a fact he slammed a palm on her desk shit pardon the language its okay she said you should have heard me last night what were you swearing at the idiots at the hospital you dont want to know oh and then jim he never came home hunt took a long beat jim didnt come home till when so far till the last time i tried to reach him which is like ten minutes ago she gave hunt the excuses shed fed herself last night he had been planning on going to the como memorial after that he might or he might finally she ran out of steam he just could have picked a better night she concluded thats all lets hope thats all as soon as hed said them he regretted the words and tamara called him on it what do you mean lets hope thats all hunt hesitated wanting to avoid coming out with it directly but there didnt seem to be any other way i mean if he went to the memorial tam maybe he met somebody there among our group of possible suspects which i wouldnt want to think but you know i was there and i never saw him maybe he never got there or couldnt get in the place was packed okay she assayed a lowwattage smile now we can say lets hope thats all i just wish hed turn up hunt slid off the edge of her desk me too hon me too back in his office again hunt couldnt seem to get himself focused as long as there was a question about whether alicia had actually been fired that tuesday morning he could live with the presumption of her innocence knowing that dominic had in fact fired her and that shed lied about it washed a great portion of his personal doubt away and now this woman was staying at his home also he had to call juhle but how was he going to talk to him knowing what he now knew the subject would come up and then hunt would be withholding evidence in a murder investigation talk about losing his license but beyond that how did he justify it how could he live with himself his brain kept running back to alicia having free run of his place try as he might he couldnt remember if hed turned the combination lock on his gun safe when hed closed it up after taking out the gun he was carrying what if she did a thorough search had he folded the throw rug back down over the loosened board had he even made sure that the board was flush and secure no matter what he told himself hed have to go home and check that he had tamara call and verify that she was still there yep and now the phone on his desk chimed gingerly he picked up the receiver whats up he asked tamara theres two gentlemen out here to see you sir mr len turner and an associate he doesnt have an appointment but says youll want to talk to him hes right hunt said quickly without conscious thought he reached around and checked the weight of his gun tucked into a holster attached to the center of his belt at his back send him in turners africanamerican associate whom he introduced first thing as battalion colonel keydrion mugisa looked to be about twentyfive he stood about six foot three and certainly weighed less than a hundred and seventy pounds this lack of heft did not make him less intimidating though his handshake was cool and in spite of its brevity apparent effortlessness and the polite accompanying nod for a greeting it was crushing under his classic trench coat he was welldressed in light green slacks a light brown dress shirt a thin darkbrown tie and an olive sport coat he wore his hair obamastyle the skin of his face was very black and smooth his eyes dark brown flat unexpressive a welltrimmed goatee surrounded a thin mouth that stayed closed in a thousanddollar pinstripe business suit turner took hunts hand in both of his as though they were by now old friends one of the flaws of hunts office was lack of seating space but tamara brought in the chair from outside then closed the door behind her on her way out so hunt began when everybody was comfortable how can i help you actually turner said i thought i might be able to help you that would be great i can use all the help i can get i think we all can but after our discussion yesterday i really came away with the impression that you may be widening the scope of your involvement in this matter in a way that nobody really intended when we decided to bring you on board when we originally spoke as im sure you remember the idea was that your function would be to help the police analyze the quality of the information that came in on the reward hotline and then turn the valid or promising leads over to them does that ring a bell hunt smiled cooperatively thats pretty much it turner smiled back at him thats what id understood and in fact its why i agreed on behalf of the reward participants to take you on board it seemed a valuable service worth the fee you were charging thank you i think weve already saved the police a lot of needless legwork and frankly weve turned up some valuable evidence in the process the probable murder weapon for example from one of our callers they seem pretty happy with what were doing so farno complaints anyway yes but well turner crossed a leg the hostile tone hed adopted the day before was nowhere to be seen although the presence of mugisa to hunt lent a tone of unstated threat to the meeting it seemed to me that yesterday you had taken that initial assignment and expanded it to include suspicions of some of us in the charitable community hunt said nothing he sat up straight with his hands clasped lightly on the desk in front of him he adopted an inquisitive air staring at turner my point turner said at last is that your fees for assisting us in this reward endeavor are adequate and acceptable to us but that if you are diluting your efforts on our behalf in an independent investigation perhaps we will have to reconsider our agreement we need somebody whose loyalty is undivided mr hunt and whose concentration is totally focused on the job for which were paying you if you cant give us that loyalty and focus well need to find someone who can he held up his hand i am responsible for the administration of this reward fund its my responsibility to see that the integrity of the process is uncompromised after this little speech hunt nodded thoughtfully nancy neshek was one of the very first calls on the reward line mr turner she was killed that same night just after a meeting of your communities of opportunity my staff and i are simply following up on her call to this office a call that might have indirectly or directly led to her murder the police think this is a reasonable assumption and further that her death is probably related in some way to mr comos i would think mr turner that it would be in the interests of those who put up the reward to have us ensure not only that information is appropriately transmitted to the police but that also they are not personally at risk because of their inadvertent connection to these terrible events but of course if it is your instruction that we not consider that possibility then naturally well do as we are instructed do you think it would be better if i explain the situation personally to the people whove put up the largest parts of the reward turner gave it a minute before responding i dont think so no i can take care of that if you come upon anything that concerns you in this regard you communicate it to me first and ill make the decision on who if anyone we need to contact hows that sound sounds like a stalemate hunt thought to himself he couldnt do anything turner told him not to do but turner couldnt very well tell him to ignore any possible threat to the people who had put up the reward in other words he could keep doing what hed been doing all along and remain on the payroll it sounds like it ought to work he said and then losing his stomach for this circumlocution hunt cut back to his point so did como and neshek have a personal relationship i dont know about not that im aware of they were professional colleagues no more so the two of them being killed within a week of one another and she on the day she called our reward line about his murder that was a coincidence possibly though youre right it doesnt seem likely but looking for an answer among the professional community i work with is not going to get you anywhere i can guarantee you what im doing is looking for an answer anywhere and everywhere and to that end heres one id like now if you can give it to me what did you do last monday night after your coo meeting turners eyes flared briefly he glanced over at mugisa who during this entire discussion might as well have been a block of stone finally back at hunt he shook his head in apparent disappointment i dont think youve heard a word ive said mr hunt but for the record i stayed on at city hall with some members of my staff including keydrion here he turned to the young man we left at about what time key nine nine so nine i live with my wife and two children on seventeenth avenue near california i got home at ninefifteen ninetwenty at the latest my oldest ben had five friends over making a float for their homecoming parade in my living room and all of them greeted me when i got home hows that thats good hunt said then he looked to turners companion how about you keydrion you go straight home after you dropped him off turner shook his head again in apparent disgust lets go key he said hunt brought the visitors chair out of his office after theyd gone he put it in its normal place across from tamara by the window any word about jim he asked mute she shook her head hell turn up this isnt normal this late hunt sighed scratched at his cheek what do you want to do you want to go home and wait no what good would that do probably none but if you want its an option no ill just wait here maybe if mickey checks in i can send him out looking at the usual haunts after hes done with your stuff i mean thats okay tam you could call him now if youre that worried no i cant he doesnt have his cell phone hes got to call in well if he does hunt looked down at her so you know i mostly just sent him out on these errands to get him out of my sight youre really that mad at him pretty much yeah hes trying to do what he thinks is right if i didnt think that hed already be fired but hes got me in a potentially terrible bind with devin and sarah just when were getting back in their reasonably good graces and also not so good a place in my own home i really dont like feeling that i could open my door and be looking down the barrel of one of my own guns wyatt come on shes not going to do that well as i said to mickey when he said the same thing i hope youre right but i wont know for sure though will i until it happens or not it wont hunt shrugged it either would or it wouldnt and talking about it wasnt going to make any difference so listen he said i was supposed to call gloria white twenty minutes ago and then turner showed up so i need to touch base with her now or sooner meanwhile can i bother you to call devin set up a time we can get together i dont think they know yet about the monday night meeting before neshek got killed and it wouldnt hurt if they were following up on that too plus that gets them off alicia for a while secondarily i thought you might notice that softie she said with an approving smile dont get your hopes up he told her its probably temporary anyway see if devin can run some kind of a sheet on a keydrion mugisa hell have to guess on the spelling but thats why they pay him the big bucks hell do it in any event the kid said exactly one word that whole time you realize that which makes me think he wasnt really there to add to the meeting why then to let me know turner could do more than just fire me if i got too far out of line aside from his physical pains which remained substantial mickey felt sick to his stomach at hunts response to what hed done driving out through the rain once again to the ortega campus shifting the volkswagen an inordinately difficult task with his steering arm in the cast he kept revisiting his decisionmaking process from the time alicia had appeared at his bedside maybe the vicodin had played a role and affected his judgment he told himself nevertheless he wished hed brought some of them with him from the hospital his head pounded with every beat of his pulse every bump in the road and then there was the psychic pain as well mickey knew that hunt was an experienced and intelligent guy not given to extremes of emotion or flights of fancy and hunt didnt think much of alicias basic story clearly hunt had read alicias admission of her lie to the police completely differently than mickey had to mickey it had been the baring of a burdened soul utterly believable to hunt on the other hand this confession had pretty much sealed the deal that she should be considered the prime suspect in comos death and in nesheks although every fiber in his being rebelled at that thought mickey couldnt get it out of his mind what if she was just playing him for a lovesick dope he kept hearing himself explaining to hunt replaying the words in his head that he could tell when someone was a good person if anyone else had said them mickey knew what his response would be because it was the same one he had to his own wordswhat a tool of course you couldnt tell when someone was a good person or a bad person or anything you just saw enough of someone that over time you came to trust what appeared to be their essential character and even mickey would not argue that once you had the essentialcharacter thing down anomalies could occur good people did bad things all the time sometimes by mistake sometimes because theyd lost track of themselves in an altered chemical or alcoholic state sometimes because smart good people do foolish wrong things so to say that you could tell if someone was a good person was not only inherently idiotic it was irrelevant to anything it certainly couldnt explain or predict guilt or innocence that said though he could intellectually give his assent to a slightly different though related proposition alicia thorpe might be a good or a bad person and shed at least told one big whopper of a lie in a crucial setting but there was no way in the world he could imagine her brutally killing not just one but two people and with that he kept returning to another fundamental question why would she have come back to him instead of just simply blowing dodge what he asked himself would be in it for her mickeys involvement with her could not keep her from getting arrested if the cops came to that if anything he reasoned the fact that she had come back to mickey argued that she desperately wanted the killer to be found otherwise why wouldnt she have fled after her last interview with juhle and russo instead shed found out he was in the hospital and shed come running to him why would she have done that if she didnt believe he could save her she was truly innocent and she would put her trust in the one person who absolutely believed in her thats why of course there were other more disturbing possible answers but let wyatt hunt agonize over them mickey wasnt going to even if it meant infuriating his boss and it did even if it meant his job and it might the bottom line was that it was a matter of faith and for good or ill mickey believed her he believed in her if she were lying and betrayed him but he shook his head that wasnt happening he wasnt going to go there russo and juhle were parked outside of alicias house again ive got this amazing sense of déjà vu juhle said wasnt she not home yesterday at this time too it was later but yes where does she go this is probably mostly when she kills her victims except those days shes surfing she kills people before she goes to work right usually if shes not too busy surfing or if the waves suck and then remember shes got to get cleaned up afterward either from the killings or the surfing or both if shes got to be dressed up to greet the carnivores juhle nodding sagely looked at his watch how long you want to give it theyd already been parked here for nearly a half hour they had been on their way out to nancy nesheks to canvass the neighborhood but the idea of slogging to mostly empty houses through the rain to try to talk to rich people who didnt look out their windows had persuaded them both to take another stab at interviewing alicia thorpe after the scarf identification yesterday both of them thought she was close to breaking and now russo was of the opinion that even though they didnt know definitely whose semen it was they could drop the news which theyd held back yesterday about its presence on the scarf and see if they could break her at last yesterday shed remained strong in her insistence that shed lost the scarf a few week ago but that too was something they had on tape that she could possibly contradict and once that happened their leverage would increase exponentially neither of them had much doubt about her factual guilt and they felt that they needed just one small break to have an excuse to put on the handcuffs and take her downtown and once that happened the confession was pretty much just going to be a matter of time ten more minutes russo said then we get something to eat and come back one time on our way out to seacliff the quality of decisiveness juhle said is not strained what russo asked at that moment the cell phone on juhles belt went off with a ringtone from an oldfashioned telephone that was so loud it made them both jump you gotta change that russo said but juhle already on the call didnt even hear her yeah he said and then again yeah but well be in the field most of the day nothing so far but if hes interested he can catch us down at the hall when we get back in ill be on this phone right he listened for another few seconds then said you could tell him that maybe he ought to be checking those himself but i wouldnt waste too much time on it if i were him he rolled his eyes over at russo because weve already got a person of interest with no alibi for that night as he knows no no no we like thorough thats fine all right just a sec i need something to write with resting the phone against his ear he pulled out his little notebook and the pen from his pocket okay shoot you want to spell that all right youre not sure its phonetic got it well try okay fine later hitting the disconnect button he said to russo that was hunts girl and you mean his secretary yes of course what could have gotten into me that i said girl youd think that after all those weeks of sensitivity training what i meant to say was that was hunts executive assistant is what i was saying he wanted us to know that turners communities of opportunity including neshek had a meeting at city hall on monday night before she was killed okay and he wanted us to check everybodys alibi i told her to tell him we already had alicias lack of one and liked it a lot but if he got a better one he should let us know i heard you so whatd she have you write down a guys name juhle looked down at his pad keydrion mugisa or something like that hell have a sheet somewhere well find him one of len turners people im thinking probably not irish what about him i dont know thats what hunts asked me to find out we gonna do it might as well i dont see how it could hurt al carter was sitting in the lobby at a foldup lunchstyle table among a large group of what mickey had come to recognize as battalion membersmostly young men but some young women as well all reasonably welldressed and wellgroomed a hum of comfortable loose banter floated out across the lobby all the way to the door where mickey entered he was here mostly to see lorraine hess about her whereabouts and activities on monday night but when he saw carter mickey thought of a question he wanted to ask him and headed over that way first they were working from boxes filled with perforated formspledge cardsthat they were tearing into thirds organizing in some way and then sending the oblong mailing through a pitney bowes automatic postage machine when theyd gone through that another few of the battalion kids packed them into a growing pile of opentopped white cardboard boxes that mickey guessed would soon be on their way to the nearest post office or possibly even all the way down to the main station at rincon annex if the mass mailing was big enough mickey got about twothirds of the way there when carter saw him after an infinitesimally brief look of confusion or maybe impatience the older man rearranged his face into its natural and neutral expression and pushed himself back from his folding chair closing the nowsmall distance between them he extended his hand al carter he said reintroducing himself yes sir i remember mickey dade well mickey dade what happened to you i got hit by a car or rather my car got hit by a car it looks worse than it is im glad to hear that cause if it was as bad as it looks youd be dead at least twice you want to sit down a minute thatd be good they got over to the wall by the administrative offices and sat down where a few extra foldup chairs had been set up i met your boss yesterday at mr comos memorial carter began hunt so what brings you down here to these environs again ive got a few more questions for ms hess but then i saw you and i thought id ask carter stopped him by replying i already told your mr hunt about mr como firing alicia that last morning i dont know what i can add to that thats not an issue mickey said or not the issue i was talking about all right he cocked his head to one side a question last time i was here you told me youd known my grandfather jim parr i did reasonably well well i know there were a lot of people at that memorial but you didnt by any chance run into jim there did you as a matter of fact i did why mickey took a deep breath and released it he hasnt come home he didnt come home last night carter straightened up his face now thoughtful his frown pronounced what mickey asked well i didnt just see your grandfather yesterday i dont know if you heard about mrs como when she saw alicia she kicked her out yes she did or rather she asked that she be removed i dont know if youd heard that i stepped in and became the remover no i dont think so i went over to her put an arm around her got her outside and the two of us ran into your grandfather i was surprised that they knew each other yeah wed had her and her brother over the night before so i gathered he paused and looked sideways over at mickey obviously conflicted about going on you know he said when we first talked about the reward last time you were up here i didnt want any part of it i didnt want to make any profit out of dominics death but since then well its a hell of a lot of money its lifechanging money it might be but i dont see what youre getting at im getting at what i told your boss yesterday about alicia getting fired if that turns out to be what the police need for her arrest i mean id just want you and mr hunt to remember where you heard it theres no chance wed forget sir but i dont see what alicia being fired has to do with her and my grandfather i dont see that either not specifically but i just have the same feeling i had yesterday when i felt like i was pointing the finger at her i dont mean to do that i like the young woman very much but but i know what i know his vision lasered into mickeys face she told jim shed drive him home alicia did he nodded thats who were talking about isnt it jim had come down on the bus and was going to take it home but she said she was going by his way and shed take him wouldnt hear otherwise he shook his head uncomprehending and now youre telling me he never made it home you hear what im saying the sudden pounding of his heart into his broken ribs threatened to double mickey over with pain just as an explosive throbbing expanded behind his eyes he brought his good right hand up to his forehead and squeezed at both temples give me a minute drythroated he barely got the words out i just need another minute it took him more like fifteen minutes and when he got his breathing and the pain back under control he was still at a complete loss as to how he was supposed to proceed al carter having made sure he was basically all right and with nothing else to tell him left mickey and went back to his supervision of the pledgecard mailing when his head had sufficiently cleared mickeys first inclination was to call alicia and simply ask her but he found that he couldnt do it some psychic barrier had arisen he didnt know what it meant yet but for the first time now the weight of all the evidence against this woman he had believed and cared for had tipped the scales out of her favor he didnt immediately leap to the conclusion that something bad or god forbid tragic had happened to jim or even that if something had alicia had played a role in it but the possibility loomed large and ate at his guts along with the stark reality that so far as he now knew alicia had been the last person to have been with jim whod known where he was and with all of that suddenlyvery suddenlyhe found himself reluctant to give her any more benefit of his doubt and that more than anything shook him to his depths he found himself unwittingly back in hunts camp reinterpreting not only alicias confession but nearly everything shed told him about herself and about her relationship with dominic como doubting was she truly the kind of person mickey had heard about but never met a bona fide psychopathnerveless emotionless a consummate actor absolutely capable of coldblooded murder whenever it suited her convenience doubting and doubting in the cascading maelstrom of his thoughts his next idea was to call tamara and hunt and tell them the basic facts even to warn them about his suspicions such as they were although he realized that the warning would be something hunt wouldnt need he was already on his guard still this new information was too important to ignore how could alicia have been with him all that time last night and never mentioned the fact that shed driven jim back from the memorial granted they were engrossed in his strategy for her safety mickey himself had never been out of pain they hadnt exactly been chatting aimlessly about life and its vicissitudes but hed have thought that the bare fact of jims transportation would have come up at least tangentially casually oh by the way i saw your grandfather today and but there had been nothing gradually the pain subsided and his head cleared he told himselfa thin whisper in the howling storm of his cogitationsthat this latest information about alicia need not have any sinister element it was entirely within the realm of possibility that shed dropped jim off at the apartment or evenmore likelyat the shamrock or another of the neighborhood bars once there as hed done quite recently hed gotten himself loaded and pitied by a barman or amazingly enough some lonely woman and that he was even now as mickey fretted sleeping it all off meanwhile mickey was here to do a job in the time it took him to talk to lorraine hess about her mondaynight activities jim could be back home and the fact that alicia had driven him yesterday would simply be a favor shed done the new information had taken him by surprise that was all hed take a figurative deep breath not do anything out of panic so he stood and walked across the lobby and knocked on hesss door and a womans voice told him to come in she clearly couldnt place him immediately so he said his name again and the light came on looking fatigued and haggard hess nevertheless put her empathy for mickey on her sleevethe cast the black eye she stood up matronlike clucking and asking questions about his injuries coming partway around her desk to make sure he got settled into his chair asking if hed like anything to drink or eatthey might have doughnuts left over in the lounge mickey somewhat to his own surprise since he normally didnt eat two doughnuts in a year told her he wouldnt mind some coffee black and maybe a doughnut and she placed the order to someone over her intercom in a moment someone knocked on the door and it opened to one of the battalion membersa young teenage girlbringing in coffee in a paper cup and a couple of round sugared mounds of doughnut on a paper plate looking for permission from hess and getting a nod she placed the items on the front edge of the desk then actually curtsied and left closing the door behind her mickey pulled his chair up to be within reach and took a bite of the pastry oh my god he said custardfilled im in heaven his enthusiasm brought a small smile to hesss face theyre my favorite too mickey washed down his bite of heaven with a sip of coffee then held the paper plate out to her have the other one she shook her head no cant ive already had two this morning which is one over my limit and should be two over it a beat so you should be in the hospital but youve got too much work to do and youre here so your work has to do with me actually with all the people who were at the communities of opportunity meeting at city hall a couple of nights ago just basic legwork to eliminate people really how many of you were there by the way her face became contemplative all told lets see maybe twenty do you want just the professionals or everybody some of us had staff with us i think just the professionals unless you think one of the staff might have had issues with nancy neshek oh of course she said she sat straighter abruptly suddenly struggling against a wave of emotion this is about her isnt it was that the night she was killed yes so after the meeting thats right were going on that assumption although it could have been the next morning she was down close to room temperature when she was discovered so it had to be fifteen maybe twenty hours before but hess was holding her one hand putting the other over her mouth please she said i dont mean to be squeamish but she exhaled heavily closed her eyes came back to him these details i go a bit light headed when i think about the reality of them of nancy i mean the person who was nancy to think of her as lying there at room temperature she shook her head from side to side im sorry mickey waved it off its all right i shouldnt have been so descriptive but the point is were trying to eliminate individuals who the police wont have to interrogate at all and the best way to do that is establish who had alibis and who didnt alibis for what the night nancy was killed right as i say in most cases just a formality the confusion on hesss face gave way to a frown but at the service yesterday your mr hunt said they were assuming that the same person killed dominic and nancy thats right but that means you think i mean on any level do you think i might have done these things that theres even the remotest possibility no maam it only means that if you can account for your time when either one of the murders was committed youre automatically and completely eliminated probably from both of them have the police asked you about the night of dominics death yet a hand pressing into the scalp at her hairline she was still shaking her head slowly back and forth she seemed about to break into tears i cant believe this taking a breath getting herself together she finally looked across her desk at mickey i dont know about the individual days one by one but i have a twelve yearold boy gary hes a special needs child hes just started seventh grade and hes not having an easy time of it with his medical bills and the economy being what it is i had to let go one of his tutors so weve been doing homework together every school night for at least the past three weeks a lot of homework every single school night sunday through thursday and even a little bit on the weekends ive also had to cut his caregiver back to halftime but im sorry this isnt about me you can ask gary if you need to hell remember i know hell remember its been grueling he wont need any reminding so you went to this meeting on monday night i did but it was over at eight or so and i was home by eightthirty not much later im sure where does nancy live do you know not exactly mickey said somewhere out in seacliff hess spread her hands palms out i live on lower telegraph hill i would have had to drive pretty fast well there you go that wasnt so hard was it she put both hands over her mouth for a moment then lowered them so she could speak its just that im so lost over this over everything thats happened it just doesnt seem possible i know mickey said its hard he placed his coffee cup back on the desk while im here could i trouble you to write me down a list of everybody you remember at that monday meeting it looks like im going to have a long day she sighed all right ill try to do that but i cant really believe it was anybody who was there i mean everybody loved nancy im sure they did mickey said im sure they did armed with his list of names many with phone numbers of those whod been at the meeting mickey sat with hesss permission in one of the free cubicles in the large open staff room at the ortega campus making conversation while shed drawn up the list hed let drop that he didnt have a telephone and shed offered him the use of theirs save him a lot of driving beyond the five hed heard ofturner hess neshek and the two sanchezesthere were seven other nonprofit professional executives his first call wasnt to any of these people though but back to his own apartment where he listened to the answering machine next he called the office and got his sister on the first ring any word on jim he asked still nothing maybe i should drop by the apartment hed pick up the phone i think if he were there and ive called about ten times already yeah i just did too im really worried here mick i know me too he took a beat is wyatt still there you think hell talk to me if i told you it might be important hell talk to you mick you got something important i dont know maybe you tell me he told her hunt listened on the telephone as mickey gave him the play byplay on his interview with lorraine hess such as it was down to the cute battalionmember who delivered the custardfilled doughnuts through her essentially rocksolid alibis and her son garys homework load by the time mickey relayed hesss degree of her upset about being considered any kind of a suspect her question about where neshek had lived and her joking comment about how fast she had to drive from there to telegraph hill after the mondaynight meeting hunt knew that mickey was stalling and interrupted not that all this isnt fascinating mick but tam said you had something important mickey had already practiced the casual tone he wanted to use when hed told tamara and now he said well i dont really know how important it is but i ran into al carter down here and asked him if hed seen jim at the memorial yesterday and he told me he had when he took alicia outside after mrs como i know all about this hunt said well maybe not he hesitated carter told me that alicia offered to drive jim back home to our place after some seconds of silence mickey said wyatt you still there youre saying that your alicia drove jim home she offered to anyway i dont know if she actually did have you asked her about this then id know wouldnt i dont be a wiseass have you talked to her or not no hunt let out a breath youre sure mickey didnt respond more silence wyatt im thinking you havent talked to her about anything since we left her this morning including this i just said i didnt i know you did i didnt want there to be a misunderstanding between us again again you know like the last time i told you i didnt think you should be hanging out too much with her just to be on the safe side since she was a potential murder suspect and the next thing youd moved with her into my place that kind of misunderstanding i havent talked to her i called you yes you did good move do you think youll be able to keep yourself from talking to her until i get a chance to if thats what you want thats what i want so when are you going to do that pretty damn soon okay mick yeah tell me the truth i know you want to believe her and loyaltys a wonderful thing as far as it goes but is this doing anything to your worldview it took mickey some moments to answer its trying to hunt paused too and let out a sigh if it does just let it happen dont fight it the way your sister did with craig put it someplace you can deal with now then bring it into the open and sort it all out later all right thats my advice we may have to do something about her sooner than the next three days and i may need you with me for that if it comes to it you hear what im saying i think so i want you to more than think it this is not me making stuff up this is not anybody wanting to believe something that didnt happen did she tell you about the scarf juhle found her scarf yeah in the limo thats when she decided to get out of her house she thought they might come back for her but shed lost that scarf a couple of weeks before thats what she told devin too you dont believe that either some things are harder to believe than others what makes that one hard well mainly because she left out one little teeny tiny part you know shes always said she didnt have an intimate relationship with como i do believe that she didnt im sure she didnt so she says just like she said he didnt fire her that morning huh and she wasnt intimate with anybody else out there at sunset either was she theres no sign of that wyatt like who like anybody but in fact im guessing como and so is devin and whats that got to do with her scarf this is another thing youre not going to want to tell her and another reason you shouldnt talk to her at all were clear there right right weve already done that i wont talk to her at least until you do promise but what what is that somebody came on that scarf mickey thats what when hunt hung up he raised his head tamara was standing in his open doorway just because alicia dropped jim off that doesnt mean she began dont start i dont know what it means or doesnt mean but if on top of everything else were looking for jim too im going to ask her what she knows if only to get some kind of a timeline on him in facthe checked his watch started to push away from his deskenough of this im going over there right now at least find out where we stand i need to go with you he shook his head im not going to let you do that tam if youre really worried about her that way wyatt you should just call her if i do that and spook her which any of my questions just might do she runs again and were lost arent we i still really dont think shes going to do that i dont think any of thats going to happen good for you but its my call okay i dont like even the remote chance of something happening to you not now that ive just got you back he patted her on the arm and gave her a quick buss on the cheek you just hold down the fort okay i predict the willard white gang is going to be calling in all day needing your guidance meanwhile ill call you the minute i know something she sighed all right oh and wyatt she said also jim dont forget about him no chance tam he was putting on his coat hes at the top of my list that was that same detective with the hunt club lola sanchez told her husband after shed shut the door to his private office at the mission street coalition he wanted to know what we did after the coo meeting and then he asked about last tuesday a week ago the night dominic was killed he didnt say so but im sure hell be calling you maybe next lola tightly wound even when she was at her most relaxed was in nowhere near any kind of a calm state at the moment the color was high in her strong attractive aztec face her black hair normally swept back and up had come out where shed pulled at it during her call with mickey jaime was up and around his desk before shed even finished he got her down on the couch against the side wall and sat next to her holding both her hands in both of his you dont need to worry love len will not let anything happen to us we have an understanding yes but weve had understandings with him before he really looks out for no one but himself you know this we know it weve seen it jaime pokerfaced squeezed his wifes hands without question lola was right and len turners character worried him deeply but the ugly truth was that if you wanted to be in the game in san francisco turner was your goto guy he controlled much of the money and enforced most of its distribution but of more immediate concern was his wifes propensity to panic jaime himself didnt necessarily believe that because a private investigator wanted to know what theyd been doing on the nights of the two murders he had any actual suspicions and beyond that a private investigator was not local or federal law enforcement no one had any real reason to be looking at anything he or his wife had done but lolas temperament was always a consideration according to plan she was going to be running mission here in a few more weeks or months and by the time that happenedif it was going to happenshe was going to have to learn to carry the weight of that responsibility without letting it crush her sometimes in this business jaime knew you had to play fast and loose with some of the rules you had to work with the len turners and even the dominic comos of the world difficult though they could be this was the big leagues and coolness in the face of challenge and adversity was one of the hallmarks of leadership and success he leaned in and gave her a light kiss just forget about len turner he said the main thing is that you and i dont contradict anything that either of us says we have a consistent story and no one will even think to question it so what did you tell this person youd exactly done monday after the meeting so that i can say the same thing i do hope and trust that whatever it was you said you were with me the whole time sí the rain had stopped as hunt drove back to his place he caught sight of a line of blue in the sky to the west normally the coming improvement in the weather would have elevated his mood but today it could have suddenly turned balmy bright and warm and he might not have noticed at all instead as he drove with his jaw clamped shut he couldnt help but be aware of the dampness of his palms a dry mouth the pinch of the gun he still had tucked into his belt at the small of his back at some point he reached behind him got ahold of the gun and laid it on the passenger seat beside him by the time he pressed the button to open his garage he was breathing deeply through his nose all of his senses on full alert his world closed down in an immediacy to the here and now that would have surprised and possibly embarrassed him if hed been aware of it which he was not even before he actually entered just as he was turning off brannan he saw that alicias car was still parked up against the right wall of the building where it had been when hed come in this morning he sucked in a lungful of air and let it out in relief again his eyes scanned the space in front of him seeing no movement or even a shadow that he could not account for he shut off the cars engine at the same time pressing the button on his visor to lower the garage door again he opened the door to the cooper and listened for a moment nothing the screen savers on his three computers all beach and ocean scenes glowed over across his basketball court grabbing the gun he stepped out of the car and closed the door behind him taking off the safety he started walking to the house his gun hand in his jacket pocket it occurred to him now much too late that maybe he should have called to see if devin and sarah were nearby at the hall of justice and could come byit was only a few blocksto accompany him when he went in gone from his mind was the slightest thought of providing her sanctuary from the police any longer but hed already announced his presence by opening his garage there was nothing for him to do now but press ahead when he got to the door that led to the part of the warehouse he lived in he knocked and almost at the same instant the door flew open in front of him oh god alicias hand at her mouth her eyes wide thank god its you she said i heard the garage and was just standing here inside afraid to move scared to death really hunt released the tightness of his grip on the gun in his pocket you and me both he said i can understand me being frightened she said but what are you afraid of lots of things but right up there at the top is coming into my home when i know its not empty yeah that could be creepy i could see that im sure you could but in this case its not hypothetical when hunts meaning hit her her face clouded over youre not saying youre really afraid of me are you i dont know if afraid is exactly the right word for the time being lets go with cautious but that doesnt make sense by the same token its not something that youre going to talk me out of you cant think i killed dominic i cant why not just because because you cant i didnt thats what mickey says too well mickeys right you ought to believe him if not me its not a question of believing its not what is it then its opportunity motive access to the murder weapon or weapons a brittle small laugh escaped into the space between them oh so im a suspect in two murders now dominic and nancy i suppose while were at it hunt said maybe three sure why not she snapped out then shook her head in a very convincing show of disgust please but hunt wasnt in any kind of conciliatory mood you want to step back and let me in then we can continue this discussion she backed away from the door pulling it along with her hunt stepped over the threshold threw a quick glance first over her shoulder down the hallway to the right then over to his left okay he said reaching for the doorknob and closing it behind them whos the third murder victim she asked well get to that hunt said meanwhile what id like you to do is go down to the tv room and sit there for a minute and wait for me ill be right with you has someone else been killed she asked if somebody was killed last night i was with mickey the whole time i couldnt have killed anybody maybe not hunt said he pointed tv room please she crossed her arms and stared at his face with illdisguised hostility for a couple of seconds then let out a frustrated and angry guttural sound and turned back down the hallway disappearing where hunt had asked her to go as soon as shed gone hunt went to his bedroom where with a mixture of chagrin and relief he saw that his rug had apparently not been disturbed nevertheless he crossed to the corner of it pulled it up and lifted out the board that covered his safe he twirled the combination wheel which turned easily signifying that it was locked but wanting to be sure he dialed the combination and opened it again saw his second gun where hed left it earlier and then closed and made sure hed locked it up one more time before he stood and reversed his actions with the board and the rug as soon as he appeared in the doorway to the television room she looked up scrunched over as though she had a stomachache her elbows on her knees and her hands clasped in front of her she appeared suddenly small waiflike and all the more beautiful for her apparent vulnerabilityher doe eyes threatening to overflow the color high on her cheeks for a moment even in his highly skeptical antagonistic state hunt felt something akin to awe at the power she could wield over men if only she knew but of course she knew he thought how could she not know has someone else died she asked please tell me no one else has died taking her very seriously indeed wishing to minimize the chance that she would try to play him by mere proximity hunt sat in the chair farthest from her across the room al carter says that you offered to take jim parr home from the memorial yesterday he said is that true she dropped her head as though someone had cut the tendons in her neck when she looked back up the tears had broken from her eyes is jim all right no one knows hunt said he never made it home she closed her eyes shook her head back and forth a couple of times i didnt take him home she said he didnt want to go home he wanted to go out to ortega thats where i dropped him off this news whether or not it was true sent a jolt of electricity up hunts back what time was this he asked im not sure exactly one onefifteen somewhere in there what did he say he wanted to do there at ortega he didnt say specifically he just wanted to walk around and talk to people he still knew a lot of people out there one of them might have heard something or seen something or just knew something that might help mickey and you he really wanted to help get the guy whod killed dominic if he could and he thought there might be some chance up there but when we got there the place was all closed upwe realized for the memorial of course the staff was downtown so whatd you do with jim i mean i told him id take him home but he wanted to stay out there in the rain theres a pizza place down on irving near nineteenth i dropped him down there he said hed wait it out and go back down to ortega when the building reopened i tried to talk him out of it that he should just go home but no luck so you left him at this pizza place youre saying somebody might remember seeing him there i dont know how long he would have stayed but somebodyd probably remember one of the workers maybe you could call there and ask if an old guy came in alone a little after lunchtime see how long he stayed she met his gaze with a hard one of her own and i know you could say that i hung around and picked him up when he came out but i didnt do that mr hunt i went home and got ambushed by juhle and russo and then when they left i threw my clothes into my car and called in sick to work and got out of my apartment and went to find mickey thats what i did i left jim at the pizza place hunt had to admire her skill and tenacity this was another perfectly plausible scenarioalbeit a very difficult one to verify definitively that shed pulled together on the spot all the while flawlessly acting out her part as a damaged and falsely accused victim on the other hand it might after all be the truth hunt found himself fighting against the temptation to believe her do you remember the name of this pizza place he asked im going to guess irving pizza and creativity still flourishes hunt said he pulled his cell phone out punched in and in a moment had gotten connected though it was lunchtime and there was a lot of background noise the manager found time to come to the phone and listen to hunts question preamble and all yeah he said the old guy was here all right came in a little after the lunch rush ate a small pepperoni and had most of a pitcher of beer nice guy jim something i think we shot the shit for an hour or so he left under his own power is he all right were trying to run him down hunt said thanks for your help when he hung up he looked across at alicia thorpe im not lying she said not about any of this hunt said you lied about dominic firing you did you forget that one she shook her head i was afraid but i told mickey about that i told him why i did it id never gotten grilled by the police before i thought theyd arrest me because it might give me a motive to have killed dominic no might about it but it wasnt like that and it wasnt like i even needed the job ive already got a job you know i mean a real paying job not that its making me rich but im okay with that for now besides dominic didnt just kick me out he explained the whole thing about ellen to me he was really sorry but he just couldnt deal with his home life anymore with our relationship making ellen so crazy even though there was nothing sexual to it nothing sexual thats right ian can tell you i whos ian my brother he can tell you i dont do sexual with older guys anymore especially married older guys in fact i dont do much sexual anymore period it screws everybody up not to mention that it screws me up im kind of hoping i get an actual boyfriend someday then maybe start over with that stuff but nobody seems to want to take the time find out if we get along first you know ive heard stories hunt said but this was what hed steeled himself against this urge to connect to believe her and before he got to that place he was going to take another shot at breaking her story but let me ask you something else if there was nothing sexual going on with you and dominic how do you explain the fact that there was semen on your scarf again if this was acting it was brilliant she straightened up her face a mask of confusion is that true yes the police didnt tell me that no they sometimes dont tell you everything they know all at once theyre hoping maybe youll slip and tell them first before you were supposed to know well she did not hesitate did not even seem overly concerned i dont have any idea about that how am i supposed to know what happened to my scarf after i lost it doesnt that make sense that i dont hunt realized that her relentless apparent guilelessness was wearing him down she had either thought all of this through to a degree that would have been unique in his experience or she was in fact telling the truth mickey believed her jim parr had believed her tamara couldnt bring herself to think ill of her you know what i wish she asked him whats that that id just never met ellen then im sure none of us would be going through this at least certainly not me hunt felt an unexpected little frisson of interest at these words they made him recall his first meeting with ellen como when shed set his own mindand by extension juhles and russos since hunt had passed it along to themonto the idea that dominic had been in love with alicia certainly a believable scenario given his reputation and her desirability but what had never quite registered with hunt was he had accepted this bare factdominics love of aliciabecause hed taken ellens word for it the other bare factfrom hunts personal experiencewas ellens enmity toward her husband and her rage and jealousy at alicia for being young and beautiful how did you even meet her hunt asked id heard she didnt have much to do with dominics work she didnt but one of the causes she did believe in was the sanctuary housebattered women and their kids and back when i first came on nancy neshek had their big yearly do at her place and it was my night off and i thoughtwell dominic thought also since i was just starting to work on my networkingthat i ought to go besides the rest of the sunset professional staff was going too so i wouldnt be all alone with just people i didnt know it would be fun and great foodalways a good thing but then dominic just being his usual charming self you know he kind of pulled me away from lorraine and the other sunset women and escorted me over specially to introduce me to ellen as one of his new drivers trying to make me feel at home and i could just tell from the second she laid eyes on me that she was going to make trouble if she could i mean i was wearing this nice simple black cocktail dresstotally appropriate since its this like formal partyand ellen looks me up and down and says something like oh hello dear is that the new drivers uniform or some such bullshit i could tell she wanted to scratch my eyes out and this was long before dominic and i had any relationship at all so later when we got to be friends i guess hed mention me sometimes and she didnt forget she wasnt going to be happy until i was toast as he listened to this hunts eyes had gone vacant and faraway for one thing almost without his conscious assent he found that he had crossed over the line regarding alicia she sat facing him with no agenda and no sense of drama just telling him what she knew as an unadorned truth and something else besides mr hunt im here is everything all right no he said not everything do you think jim went to sunset after he got finished at irving pizza absolutely if he made it but its only a few blocks so he should have hunt made the quick count in his head san franciscos easttowest streets run south through the avenues in alphabetical order irving at nineteenth was therefore only six blocks from ortega at nineteenth an easy walk even for an old man with a beer buzz in a light rain mickeys out there now hunt said at sunset using their phone to check some alibis ive got to make another phone call im here with her now hunt told mickey shes fine did she drive jim home yesterday no hunt paused she drove him out there where where you are right now sunset but he promised me mickey stopped midthought a promise might be a promise but another cliché holds that a promise is made to be broken and mickey knew which one jim had accessed yesterday that wily bastard so where is he now thats what im calling you about we still dont know he hasnt come home as of a half hour ago the campus was closed when they got there him and alicia so she dropped him off at a place called irving pizza hunt filled him in on it and you believe that it happened hunt said i called the place the manager corroborates it he remembers him mickey hesitated so you believe her starting to maybe whoa rein in that enthusiasm wyatt its under control but what would really help is i need to talk to al carter as soon as you can find him is he up there today he was he might still be okay so find him first then see if anybody up there saw jim no lorraine hess was in the middle of a celeryandcarrotstick lunch at her desk i never saw him and i would have loved to have seen him since apparently i missed him at the memorial too hes a wonderful man are you sure he was here mickey shook his head no i know where he was at around two maybe twothirty but not if he ever actually made it down here would you mind if i ask around not at all do whatever you need to do she took a quick nibble of carrot most of the staff didnt get back here until closer to three though just so you know we opened up again at around threefifteen so maybe he got here and didnt want to wait especially if he was outside in yesterdays weather i realize that mickey said and all of this may be a false alarm anyway jims been known to stay out overnight before he also promised me he wouldnt come out here asking questions and bothering people so maybe on his way his conscience started to eat at him a little though knowing him thats unlikely he always did have a mind of his own hess spread her palms gave him a sympathetic smile well if theres anything i can do anything you need youre sure youre up to all this running around mickey tried without much success to put on a reassuring face my heads felt better but ill be fine somebody out in the cubicles might have some painkiller i appreciate that maybe ill just go and see what i can find he walked out into the lobby and noticed that the makeshift table where theyd earlier been preparing the pledgecard mailing was now doubling as a kind of study hall for half a dozen pairs of tutors and their students limping over to them head truly pounding again he knocked at one end of the table excuse me he said as twelve pairs of eyes turned to him did any of you notice an older guy hanging around here yesterday afternoon inside the building or out about six feet skinny maybe seventy years old a sea of blank faces stared back at him not much of a surprise on his phone call hunt had told mickey to locate al carter if he could and ask him to give a call after hed done that mickey was to abandon his alibi search and phone calls to coo members and devote his time to trying to discover what had happened to jim his disappearance hunt had made clear was now looking more and more as though it might be somehow related to this investigation and this was anything but good news in fact the new development had seemed so immediate and important to mickey that hed totally forgotten that his boss had told himfirstto find carter and give him the message to call hunt then mickey was to start looking for jim getting a line on where hed gone after irving pizza if he could suddenly mickey realized hed forgotten the first part of the assignment back in the administrative cubicles where hed been making his phone calls he got some aspirin and learned that carter was back in the parking lotthe city had returned the limo and he had gone out to make sure they hadnt damaged it too badly mickey found him sitting alone behind the wheel apparently sleeping in the newminted and welcome sunshine the front windows were down and mickey hesitated then started to walk with his halting steps up to the drivers side when he was about five feet away carter spoke through his closed eyes the sound of your walking gives you away tell me i got the reward sorry not yet but my boss would like you to give him a call you might be getting close mickey punched in hunts number on carters cell phone and handed the instrument back he then moved away out of earshot and sat on the asphalt his back up against the building and settled into a drowsy seminumbness in the warming sunshine in spite of himself he dozed off seconds or minutes later he started awake with carter still on the phone his side of the discussion consisting mostly of a series of yeses and noes except for his closing phrase when carter said i never thought of that then carter walked over to where mickey sat and with a shrug handed the phone down to him hunts voice shimmered with intensity as he gave mickey his new marching orders and whether it was that or the short nap hed slipped into or the aspirin kicking in mickey felt a sudden sense of clarity and purpose hunt knew that jim had already been drinking when he left irving pizza then the rain had come on at least close to the time that he was supposed to have started walking down to ortega it wasnt unreasonable to assume that a shower had caught up with him and driven him inside again to another bar on the way hunt had googled bars in the neighborhood and had located seventeen of them within walking distance of the ortega campus and now he gave mickey those names and addresses at least these were places to look when he rang off mickey looked up at carter and asked so whatd he say to you and carter replied he told me not to tell you devin juhle sarah russo and wyatt hunt met at lou the greeks where they took an empty booth in the back during their lunch in their car sarah had decided to phone mortons that call had revealed that alicia thorpe had called in sick with the flu shed be out at least through the weekend which with her normal days off meant until the following wednesday to both juhle and russo this was a good enough sign that shed gone underground or fled and so the inspectors canceled their canvassing of nesheks neighborhood and arranged this meet with hunt now the priority was to turn up the burners under thorpe and bring her in for questioning if they could find her hey hunt said people get sick russo a deep frown in place took a good pull at her lemonade true she said but shes not home in bed trying to get better shes not at her brothers shes not in the hospital were assuming shes not with your boy mickey either hunt kept his head down and refrained from comment so whats that leave juhle asked shes on the run maybe you scared her off yesterday hunt said she knew you had the scarf it was only a matter of time juhle was tearing his cocktail napkins into tiny pieces shit russo nodded shit is right we had her shell turn up juhle said maybe in our lifetime russo retorted hunt noticed the obvious tension between the two inspectors perhaps brought about by juhles reluctancedue to his recent history mostly with gina roaketo haul alicia downtown to talk to her in one of the homicide interrogation rooms where due to the intimidating setting results were often easier to obtain so we wanted to get you and mickey and even his sister on it too russo added all of them know a lot of the same people dont they we need you to put out the word absolutely hunt said well get right on that then changing the subject meanwhile while were all here having such fun together you manage to dig up anything on keydrion ah keydrion juhle said how did you get to him hunt shrugged hes a colonel or something in the battalion out of sunset but hes hanging around with len turner and i was kind of wondering what his role was you get anything on him hes clean juhle said then added as an adult course hes only been out off the youth farm for seven months so hes barely had time to get his sea legs back as a kid though he was reasonably badass went in for manslaughter when he was sixteen though there was some question about maybe it should have gone down as murder one the da almost charged him as an adult but i hear our friend mr turner applied some influence and suddenly keydrion needed rehab and consolation you think keydrion is somehow involved in all this russo asked not impossible hunt said but i wouldnt mind knowing for sure i wouldnt mind knowing anything for sure juhle said hunt didnt miss a beat anthony he said whats anthony my middle name something you can be sure of juhle just shook his head while russo gave hunt a dead eye i appreciate that youre worried about him wyatt but keydrions a low priority for us she said were looking for alicia thorpe and if you want to be any help to us youll be doing that too you putting out a bulletin hunt asked russos head slowly tracked its way back and forth cant not yet not officially officially we just want to talk to her again juhle said but first weve got to find her hunt nodded all right im with you guys well see what we can do hunt sat in his office with his stomach in a knot after the last half hour if juhle and russo ever found out even after the fact that alicia was or had been at his place he was dog meat it was not impossible that he could face charges for obstructing justice or anything else they wanted to throw at him and earn himself some jail time and thats if he was right if he was wrongif the inspectors were right and alicia was in fact a multiple murderer as he himself had believed until only a couple of hours agoit might be much worse than that but he hadnt been able to come clean with them he couldnt even include them in his slowly forming plan because that plan depended on what mickey discoveredon what he had to discoverand hunt hadnt yet heard back from him from where hunt sat right now from what alicia and then al carter had told him he only had a strong inkling of the truth not a forged linkage that could withstand any assault he had to wait he could only wait and the waiting was doubly excruciating because if mickey came back with the answer hunt was hoping for the result he expected it was the last thing he actually wanted because it almost assuredly meant that jim parr was dead come on mickey he said aloud come on another cleverly named place on noriega avenue the noriega lounge was the closest bar north of the ortega campus only one block away unfortunately it wasnt on nineteenth avenue and couldnt be seen from that main thoroughfare and mickey had decided to be his usual thorough self and start all the way south by san francisco state university and move north to golden gate park hed already made eight stops by the time he got to the noriega at four oclock mickey thought that although it was rather generally unsung the place might in fact be the location of san franciscos happiest happy hour which would formally begin in a half hourtwoforone drinks nothing over two bucks and free hors doeuvres a decent mixed crowd was getting itself in the mood to get more in the mood a loud sound system with a very strong bass boost played disco music and two silent televisionsone featuring oprah and the other espnvied for space and attention over the bar every stool was taken mickey found a spot suitable for standing between two stools and sidled himself up into it his cast brushed up against his lefthand neighbor a blackleatherjacketed bearded biker with chains hanging off his belt loops whirling on his stool he started with hey watch and then caught sight of mickeys eye the cast scuse me he said moving down a few inches and giving mickey a little more room you okay dude hanging in there mickey said car wreck fucking blind fourwheelers the biker said never watchin out for the other guy hey claudio he yelled down the bar set my pal up here he stuck out his hand im ivan what are you drinking mickey just a cokes fine im working ivan laughed heartily youre working here i want your job i just about live here man and nobodys offering to pay me the bartender appeared across the smooth cherry plank claudio ivan said this heres mickey hes working give him a coke then back to mickey what are you working on trying to find somebody he said he pulled out his wallet and flipped to the one picture of jim that he happened to have it was eight years old taken at tamaras graduation all three of them in the photo ill take the babe on the right ivan said shes not missing mickey said shes my sister all the better and i mean it ivan persisted ill meet her anytime ill give her the message mickey said but who im looking for is the old guy in the middle might have stopped by in here for a drink yesterday about this time maybe a little earlier maybe alone maybe with somebody ivan turned on his stool and took the picture out of mickeys hand held it up to catch a little more light from the window behind them i cant really say for sure hes a little familiar but hey half of us in here today were here yesterday too so he yelled again down the bar hey claudio get your ass down here check out this picture in the middle isnt this the guy got all fucked up in here yesterday mrs como hello this is wyatt hunt whats happened tell me theyve arrested her if you mean alicia no maam not yet hunt heard her sigh i cant imagine whats taking them so long when its so clear to me well thats why im calling the inspectors share your frustration especially when they think theyve got almost everything they need to get it sewn up then whats the delay about thats the question i saw them this afternoon and they thought maybe they could move things along a bit more quickly if you and some of the other witnesses would agree to meet with them again in one place and all of you go over the information youve given in a little more detail i dont know what that would be ive already told you everything i know i realize that but as you say you told me which means the police got it secondhand i might not have asked you all the right questions or put together the information from all the other sources hunt paused were not talking much more than an hour or two and what other witnesses al carter lorraine hess jimi and lola sanchez what about them well theyve all cooperated with the police to some degree or another with information against the thorpe girl you mean i cant absolutely confirm that until the arrest is a done deal mrs como the inspectors dont want to have the news get out before the suspects in custody which i think youll agree is understandable well yes i suppose it is hunt wasnt sure that he had her yet and thought he saw a way to sweeten the deal theres also the issue of the reward he said a silence hung on the line what about the reward she asked youll remember that in our interview you said that if the information you provided proved useful to the investigation you wanted to be sure you were in line to stake a claim to the reward well it turns out it looks like there are going to be multiple claimants you know len turner is administering the distribution of course i gave him my money too you might recall thats right well mr turner thought and i agree that it would be worthwhile if the major potential claimants talked on the record with the inspectors present so there wouldnt be any dispute later about the relative value of the respective contributions to solving the case but where i dont agree with mr turner is that he didnt seem to think that your information about ms thorpes relationship with your husband and her subsequent firing on that last day rose to the level of real evidence thats ridiculous she said what could be more real than that of course hunt said thats my feeling too which is why i thought youd want to be down here to defend your position maybe i shouldnt tell you this but i think you need to be aware that mr carter corroborated the fact that your husband fired ms thorpe on that last day so hell be making a reward claim on much of the same information you gave us first thats just not right no maam its not so where is this meeting and what time he told her and then he hung up and looked around his kitchen table at the group hed assembledalicia mickey al carter and gina roake to act as alicias attorney should the need arise well he said thats number three two to go then devin sometimes it worries me wyatt roake said how easily you manipulate cheat and lie the comment was simply meant to break the tension and to some degree it worked at least it brought the beginning of a grin to hunts face its a concern he said but i try not to let it get me down hunt said pick up devin its important after a few seconds the inspectors voice came on in the middle of dinner wyatt this better be good good enough hunt said what if i were to tell you ive found alicia have you im asking you what if id say keep an eye on her until i can get to where she is and put some cuffs on her where is she youd arrest her even without the dna on the scarf we got that just before i went home today its comos so we got her except as it turns out you still dont know where she is but you do i never said that dont get wise wyatt where is she i could get her to come here again where here home the warehouse okay so do that i will try hunt paused provided you promise you wont arrest her juhles laugh exploded in the phone and why pray would i agree to that because im also going to have your murderer you are are you and whos that i could tell you but it wouldnt do me or alicia any good shes alicia now is she shes also my client shes what you heard me when did that happen that doesnt matter either not to you what matters is you promise you dont arrest her until when until i get you the murderer another small bark of humor well im going to say hell no to that wyatt i have evidence against thorpe and if i see her im going to arrest her then all bets are off juhle paused for a long beat youre saying you know who the killer is i am i do and im saying if you want to find out you promise no arrest end of story and what if youre wrong im not wrong so we take alicia downtown then if you prove were wrong we let her go nice try dev but what really happens is once you get her booked its almost impossible to arrest anybody else why because not only have you just given your second suspect a builtin defenseoh it was alicia thorpe last week your honor but this week its really my client x who did itbut also because a second arrest for the same crime makes you and sarah both look stupid no that wouldnt bullshit listen to me you arrest her now alicias charged with specialsmultiple murder special circumstancesand gets no bail the da says she can argue some other dude did it at her trial but meanwhile once alicias in jail your real killer is tipped to all the evidence and can make their own story tighter if in fact they dont leave town thats what really happens dev and you damn well know it so i cant tell you who the murderer is youll just say thanks for playing and arrest my client ive got to show you and i can do that but first i need your word no arrest nonnegotiable a long silence then last best and only offer wyatt you get your dog and pony show ill come over but if i do somebodys going to jail im thinking its thorpe but ill give you a chance to convince me its someone else after another short pause he asked where is she now doesnt matter hunt said a secret place mickey found her but the point is ive got him bringing her down here why would she do that come down there because mickeys convinced her this is the safest place she could be she believes mickey shit you keep saying that you know why it keeps being appropriate shit shit shit what am i supposed to do about sarah im not sure she could agree to the conditions so now i cut my partner out of it i know youre not a cop wyatt but that kind of behavior is frowned upon down at the hall yeah well i appreciate that but whats happening is happening now this is all the warning i can give you wyatt heard the soft exhale of resignation and decision okay juhle said twenty minutes half hour that ought to work hunt said by eightthirty hunt had the place arranged the way he wanted it with a nice democratic circle of eleven folding chairs set up on his basketball court in the end hed cajoled connived or otherwise convinced all of the principals to converge on his warehouse at nine oclock so that depending on what hunt had told them they could provide more detailed information or argue for their portion of the reward or fortify their alibis or simply get caught up on the progress of the investigation to date or finally in the case of devin juhle to arrest the real murderer now hunt went back into the residential side to his kitchen where roake carter alicia and mickey remained seated at the table with a palpable air of tension surrounding them almost time hunt said lightly his own nerves were stretched to the breaking point but he couldnt show that not now everybody still loose and ready to have some fun in fact nobody looked that way they all looked like theyd been talking about deadly serious issues among themselves while he set up his chairs roake the groups obvious spokesperson looked around the table then up at him weve been thinking it might be better after all if alicia wasnt here wyatt hunt drew a short breath if shes not here hunt said in as reasonable a tone as he could dredge up she gets herself arrested anyplace they find her outside here ive got devins word he wont touch her and you believe that carter asked absolutely with a deep frown carter shook his head just imagine though wyatt roake said what if he called russo and told her she didnt make you any promise she comes in with him and he just shrugs and says its out of his control thats not whats going to happen but what if it does wyatt and alicia goes downtown as her lawyer i dont know if i can in good conscience let her stay here as her lawyer hunt said youve got to let her stay here its her best chance to stay out of jail but wyatt mickey put in she wont get arrested if we go hide out again someplace else guys understand the second shes not here shes back as the prime suspect and then its only a matter of time hunt straightened up to his full height weve been through this already he said i appreciate all of your concerns but alicia has to be here for this to work if juhle gets here and shes gone he walks out and the whole exercise becomes futile the only reason he stays is because if my idea doesnt work then and only then he handcuffs alicia swell mickey said but thats not going to happen hunt said if everybody shows up this is a lock and if they dont alicia finally found her voice what then ive motivated them all sufficiently hunt said they cant not come thats the other thing gina said if youre right one of these people youve invited here tonight has already killed twice you dont think theres an element of risk theres an element of risk to crossing the street ive got to believe weve got strength in numbers here if any one person starts to get out of hand and remember juhle will be armed and he added so will i roake rolled her eyes so you do think something could happen i know something might happen gina something unexpected could always happen but here tonight i doubt its going to be violence im carrying my gun because i want to make sure its as close to foolproof as it can be just covering the bases making sure weve got these contingencies thought through thinking a plan through doesnt necessarily prevent it from falling apart no hunt said i know that of course not but this is our best chance to get alicia out from under this cloud of suspicion and get on with her life we all agreed on this a couple of hours ago this is the way it has to go down and it has to be now aliciahe turned to herare you still with us she forced a weak smile with everything youve said i dont see that i have another choice thats the right answer hunt said the buzzer at the back door sounded loud as a klaxon in the enclosed space of the kitchen everyone at the table reacted with a starteven hunt had a reflexive jump and then smiled at his nerves here we go he said walking across to check the peephole and then opening the door to devin juhle all by himself juhle hated this he imagined himself in front of the police commission explaining how he had gotten involved in this halfassed operation and without his partner or any other backup this was not how it was done fraught with risk and uncertainty for everyone involved he wondered and sincerely doubted if any other cop he knew would make the kind of promise hed made to hunt if any other homicide inspector with an imminent arrest of his prime suspect in his pocket would have postponed the moment and agreed to this amateurhour charade his only consolation was that when hunts scenario failedas it surely wouldhe would then pick up the thorpe woman of course the fact that hunt had invited roake along would complicate that arrest but not impossibly so still it galled juhle that hunt had never even mentioned roakes presence here as thorpes attorney during their phone call in fact everything about this felt wrong to him but he told himself thats what happened when you believed your friends and people wondered why cops grew so jaded over time it was because you were either in the brotherhood or you were not you played by the rules or you didnt somehow hunt had persuaded him that he had no choice and that more than anything else added to his fury and frustration almost as soon as juhle had arrived hunt suggested that they all come out now to the basketball court now roake thorpe mickey dade and carter sat together in consecutive chairs while juhle stood behind them arms crossed and his shoulder holster unbuttoned where he could keep his eye on them as well as on whoever entered through the brannan street door the lights were up the temperature fairly cool in the midsixties the way hunt liked to keep it they werent in there and settled for more than three or four minutes when the doorbell for this side of the warehouse rang and hunt crossed to the door by the garage entrance opened it up and said hello to len turner and a tall thin welldressed young black man that juhle guessed must be keydrion mugisa inside his jacket juhles hand went to the butt of his duty weapon hunt hadnt invited keydrion to attend this meeting with turner so they had to bring another chair over to add to the circle turner after a barely cordial greeting to hunt fell into the role of his voluble and friendly self after he recognized carter and juhle lorraine hess had met up with jaime and lola sanchez outside on the street and they came in together a few minutes after turner the last arrival and the only one to make any kind of a stinkwhen she saw that alicia thorpe was in attendancewas ellen como but hunt got her calmed down and seated her next to him on his right juhle took the left seat so around the circle it went juhle roake alicia mickey al carter lorraine hess jaime and lola sanchez turner keydrion ellen como and wyatt hunt in the relative chill all of the latter arrivals kept their coats on the low hum of conversation gradually faded to silence and all eyes went to hunt i would thank all of you for coming down here tonight he began but the truth is that none of you actually did so because i asked you to in fact youre all here for your own very good reasons and theyre all about your own selfinterest some of youmr carter mrs como ms hesswant to make your claim to all or a portion of the reward some of youmr turner mr mugisa mr and mrs sanchez and again mr carter want to make sure that the police understand and believe your alibis for the night of the two murders and lets make no mistake the same person killed dominic como and nancy neshek thats right and shes right here ellen como blurted out we all know that looking across to juhle she pointed at alicia i dont know why youre not arresting her inspector why you havent done it already can there be any doubt we all know what she did and why hunt held out a hand toward her mrs como please no shes right hunt jaime sanchez said what the hell hunt shot his gaze around the circle inspector juhle is here to make an arrest tonight all right but hes promised its not going to be alicia thorpe unless we fail to provide him with somebody else what are you saying turner demanded that one of us i think you can figure that out for yourself sir hunt said next to him ellen como stood up i didnt come down here to have to take this kind of abuse im the victim here my husband was the one who was killed doesnt anybody care about that im not going to be any party to this she turned toward the door and pushed her chair out of her way mrs como hunt spoke up no ones accusing you of anything sit back down please we need every one of you here if were going to get to the truth straight across from hunt lorraine hess said are you really saying that one of us killed dominic and nancy too yes maam hunt said one of you but i was i was with my son i didnt say you ms hesshunt took in the groupor all of you i said one of you and you intend to prove this turner said to juhles satisfaction right here right now how do you intend to do that by comparing the stories youve told and seeing where they dont agree but also a little bit hunt replied by the process of elimination you for example mr turner mr mugisa drove you home right after the coo meeting on the night nancy neshek was killed youve got your son and your wife and the other kids who were there building their homecoming float who will swear that you were with them until you went to bed no ones suggested that youve done anything different and you can prove that so you didnt kill ms neshek and therefore you didnt kill dominic turner sat back shaking his head in derision well of course i didnt the ideas ridiculous the whole concept is ridiculous jaime sanchez said lola and i went to dinner after that meeting and then home together where did you go to dinner hunt asked the hayes valley grill we walked there from city hall they know us there im sure ill even have a credit card receipt and after that jesus christ turner raised his hands as if in exhortation inspector juhle is this the kind of questioning that mr hunt thinks is going to get us anywhere do you have any reason to believe that jimi and lola sanchez are any kind of even potential suspects in either of these murders juhle said no sir no i dont he turned to hunt if this is your idea of breaking the case wyatt maybe you should send these good people home and let me go about doing my job which is arresting my suspect hunt kept his cool mr sanchez he said my apologies to you and your wife i was using you as an example of mr turners point about the process of elimination which i think we can all agree is not too satisfying far better is the question of the information weve received and where what one person told us is contradicted by somebody else now hunt turned in his chair for example mrs como you told me that your husband was in love with ms thorpe and that ellen cut him off and snapped back at him he was he told me there wasnt any doubt about that no not about that bare fact your husband was in love with her okay but alicia swears that they didnt have a physical relationship well shes lying what do you expect im not lying alicia said as roake put a restraining hand on her arm hunt turned to ellen and went on how do you know alicias lying because they were caught in the office making love you mean fucking is what i mean fucking is what they were doing not making love dont try to dignify it and where were they doing this what what do you mean i mean physically where were they having sex in the office when they were caught i dont know how would i know so how did you know about it in the first place well her brow clouded then cleared lorraine told me i think i even told you that didnt i mr hunt yes you did so ms hess he came around to face her let me ask you where in the office did you discover mr como and alicia having sex hess had straightened in her seat her hands on her lap i dont know she shook her head i wasnt the one who saw them it was one of my people one of the young women do you remember who exactly no it seemed like everybody knew kind of all at once you know how offices are so you ms hess didnt really know for sure firsthand about this physical side to alicias and dominics relationship no not firsthand no and yet you gave this information to mrs como i thought she needed to know ellen como spoke up again i did need to know god damn it yes well and ms hess made sure that you did didnt she shes a friend of course she did of course hunt took a breath shifted again in his chair mr carter as dominics driver you must have been privy to many of his private thoughts and even secrets isnt that true i like to think so did you ever have occasion to hear him talk about alicia thorpe yes frequently since she started driving him mornings was he in love with her yes at least thats what he told me and did he also tell you any details about his love life if any with her carter came out with a dry chuckle only the fact that he didnt have any love life with her thats not true mrs como exclaimed i know he no maam it is true as i know it warming to his topic carter brought in the rest of the circle he laughed about it how he had this pure love that neither of them were going to do anything about they talked about it how seeing her every day not being able to touch her knowing he was never going to be able to touch her it was just breaking his heart again ellen como couldnt take it bullshit al she said thats just bullshit no maam thats what he told me okay al hunt said let me ask you this in your eight years driving dominic did you ever know him to see other women at this carter hesitated looking first at ellen como then over to lorraine hess yes he said many times shit that bastard that fucking bastard hunt pressed anybody else at sunset another pause this one lengthy finally carter looked over to his left again and shrugged when i first came on he and lorraine were in the middle of a thing ellen como exploded what lorraine and stood up hess shot out of her seat held her arm out as though fending ellen off thats a lie ellen thats a damn lie al juhle was on his feet arms out to either side as though he were a referee at a boxing match he pointed to hess sit down and over to como you too please maam right now but neither woman sat down instead they stared at each other across the circle lorraine ellen como asked in a nearwhisper is this true she turned al the driver nodded somberly hess was shaking her head no no no pointing at alicia her voice quivering with rage lorraine hess went on the attack shes the one who was sleeping with him they were screwing in the car i know they were if you look youll know im telling the truth if you mean look in the limo for evidence lorraine hunt said the police already did that and they found what you planted there i didnt plant anything what are you talking about hunt didnt respond to her but turned to carter al whats the first thing you do every day at work carter nodded like i told you today we clean out that limo for my shift polish the car wash the seats vacuum the rugs and that includes under the seats doesnt it yes sir and did you do that the day after you dropped off mr como for the last time yes sir and was there a condom in the car or a scarf no sir nothing like that butand here hunt came back to hessin fact those items are exactly what the police did find so the reason you were so sure there was evidence in the car lorraine was that you put it there didnt you hess seemed rooted to the floor unable to reply my only question hunt went on is if you stole the scarf intending to kill dominic or if you simply found it later and decided to use it to frame alicia lorraine ellen como asked a last time its you could it really have been you hunt standing next to juhle took a step in hesss direction do you want to tell us about the federal money too lorraine dominics private safe he not only broke it off with you he discovered youd been taking the money too didnt he he was going to let you go out at sunset as well this is all wrong hess said you dont know this you cant prove any of it i dont have to prove it lorraine the police will have all the proof they need when they get a search warrant for your bank account wont they when they find all the unexplained cash deposits and when they talk to all the extra help you hired for your son theyre going to find you paid with a lot more cash than you can explain arent they and even if youve got more cash stashed in other bank accounts theyre going to find that too arent they lorraine hess put her hands in the pockets of the ski parka she was wearing then lifted out her right hand in which she was holding a revolver juhle caught completely offguard went to reach for his shoulder holster hunt motioned for juhle to stop then turned and spoke calmly to hess what are you going to do now lorraine kill us all and then go on the run whos going to take care of your son and how long do you think its going to take the police to find you hess stood holding the gun in both of her hands aiming it squarely at hunts chest her eyes flitted over to ellen como to juhle to carter and alicia and then back to hunt no one seemed to be breathing but then at last something shifted in hesss position and she slowly began to lower the gun then finally dropped it with a clatter onto the basketball courts flooring at her feet now staring with a pathetically blotched face at juhle she hung her head wagged it disconsolately from side to side then looked back at him thank god she said thank god its finally over she met juhles eyes i never meant but it doesnt matter what i meant now does it hunt had crossed the circle and gotten his hands on the weapon now that threat removed he looked up at her lorraine he said jim parr wheres jim parr for an answer hess turned vaguely almost wistfully to juhle i wonder if you could send somebody to see if my son garys all right i always worry about those pills i give him when i need him to sleep that i might have given him too many juhle hated this he imagined himself in front of the police commission explaining how he had gotten involved in this halfassed operation and without his partner or any other backup this was not how it was done fraught with risk and uncertainty for everyone involved he wondered and sincerely doubted if any other cop he knew would have made the kind of promise hed made to hunt if any other homicide inspector with an imminent arrest of his prime suspect in his pocket would have postponed the moment and agreed to this amateurhour charade his only consolation was that when hunts scenario failedas it surely wouldhe would then pick up the thorpe woman of course the fact that hunt had invited roake along would complicate that arrest but not impossibly so still it galled juhle that hunt had never even mentioned roakes presence here as thorpes attorney during their phone call in fact everything about this felt wrong to him but he told himself thats what happened when you believed your friends and people wondered why cops grew so jaded over time it was because you were either in the brotherhood or you were not you played by the rules or you didnt somehow hunt had persuaded him he had no choice and that more than anything else added to his fury and frustration almost as soon as juhle had arrived hunt suggested that they all come out now to the basketball court now roake thorpe and dade sat together in consecutive chairs while juhle stood behind them arms crossed and his shoulder holster unbuttoned where he could keep his eye on them as well as on whoever entered through the brannan street door the lights were up the temperature fairly cool in the midsixties the way hunt liked to keep it they werent in there and settled for more than three or four minutes when the doorbell for this side of the warehouse rang and al carter who for some reason hunt had designated to greet the guests crossed to the door by the garage entrance opened it up and said hello to len turner and a tall thin welldressed young black man that juhle guessed must be keydrion mugisa inside his jacket juhles hand went to the butt of his duty weapon the doorbell rang again as instructed carter opened the door again quite clearly juhle heard him say hello lorraine and then he heard the voice of lorraine hess as she said hi al you dumb shit and then the enormous boom of the shot hunt was over by the residence side of the warehouse and broke for the door jumping over carters prone form he got outside just as lorraine hess was running to get to her car sitting and idling there at the curb fifty feet up the street a couple of seconds after the unmistakable report hold it he yelled stop stopping and turning in her tracks but without any hesitation she raised her arm and fired another shot hunt seeing her arm coming up dove sideways away from the building and heard the bullet ricochet off something back at the corner hunt by this time was lying on the pavement leveling his gun out in front of him but he found that he could not fire she was not then firing at him and it was bad luck to shoot in the back even an escaping murderer to say nothing of the fact that under those conditions it was nearly impossible to claim selfdefense even if it was even if shed just shot at you lorraine hess got to the door of her car and again he saw her extend her arm and again he rolled as the shot pinged off the pavement behind him still on the ground he squeezed off a round in the general direction of her tires off to his left coming out his door juhle had his own weapon out extended in both hands he got off two quick shots that cracked the windshield before hess got the car moving and then juhle had to jump backward inside the warehouse as she slammed it into gear and tried to run him down smashing her front bumper into the side of the building then bouncing off and coming on faster now and off the curb hunt in her path now as well rolled out into the street and the car passed him missing him by no more than a few inches he turned to see her disappear around the corner with a squeal of her tires heard the diminishing roar of the engine as she sped away and lying there on the street then heard juhles professional voice talking urgently into his cell phone im calling to report a shooting victim at around sixth and brannan ambulance required immediately urgent repeat urgent and then as he closed up the phone son of a bitch it was one week to the day after the arrest of lorraine hess wyatt hunt put down the pages and looked across ginas small living room to where she sat with her oban her legs tucked up under her a twentytwo doesnt make an enormous boom he said more like a pop everybodys a critic and besides hunt went on thats not what happened i realize that but its damn sure what very easily could have happened and forcing you to take a good hard look at the other possibilities was kind of my point in doing the exercise because actually it could have been much worse even than this in my first draft of this she runs you over and you die too but then youd be out of your misery and i didnt want that you wanted me to suffer just a little more i wanted you to see where this so easily could have gone her smile was fleeting laced with portent but just for fun let me count the ways she held up a finger first lorraine doesnt confess and goes home and realizes that shes finished and she shoots her son while he sleeps and then takes her own life and meanwhile of course devin arrests alicia dont be such a softie hunt said have something bad happen something bad is coming right up she said because maybe youve forgotten about it but that first shot lorraines first shot as soon as al carter opened the door in my little version of the story it killed him and hes lying dead on the floor of your place and guess who the mildly angry inspector juhle is going to blame for that homicidehint its not just lorraine but the person who set up the encounter in the first place so the good news is that nobody cares what he thinks because hes going to lose his job for getting involved in this at all but the bad news is you cant give him a job because you lose your license at least your shop gets closed up and you maybe even go to jail next in her ongoing rage and plain old embarrassment at having somebody shot to death in her partners presence when he was right there to stop it and she would have been there if you hadnt sandbagged him sarah russo comes after me for conspiracy or obstructing justice or some trumpedup charge and i lose my license too and hunt added we become another of san franciscos prominent homeless couples living out of a dumpster laugh if you want wyatt but all of this was this close to happening and i dont see you realizing that thats because it didnt oh and the last thing because lorraine killed herself when she got home see above she never could have told us where she had dumped jim parr at lake merced after she shot him and he would have undoubtedly died too and still may true but maybe dead or as billy crystal would put it mostly dead is far preferable to completely and officially dead theyve done studies all right hunt crossed a leg and sat back in his chair yep those all would have been bad things i agree but what else would you have had me do in some future case where ill be able to apply all these important lessons youre trying to teach me from this one how about you just call juhleor whoever the relevant police figure may be in the futureand tell him what youd figured out and then what in the first place he doesnt believe me he thinks im blowing smoke at him to protect alicia then even if he buys what im telling him hes still got no evidence so hes going to play it by the book he shows up with twenty five cops the swat team a tank and a helicopter and scares lorraine away or worse he simply goes and talks to her and she denies it and not only is she on her guard because she knows shes a possible suspect but juhles back at square one not exactly he could have found witnesses at that noriega bar or after they found jim dead by this time he could have gotten a warrant to look for the gun but once she knows theyre looking at her she ditches it theyd eventually have gotten to her wyatt im not so sure and in any event it wouldnt have been soon enough all of his focus and russos too was on alicia you remember at the very least they would have brought her downtowneven with you there lawyering her upand put her through a very bad time and she was our client she was my first responsibility thats another thing wyatt how did she get to be your client mickey brought her on he committed us for how much retainer i know he said so how weak is that very admittedly but its what i acted on which in my defense worked out okay i grant that but what im trying to tell you is you didnt have to take all those risks to bring all of us together like that i did i needed alicia for devin carter for hess you for alicia ellen for hesss lie about seeing alicia and dominic doing it turner and the sanchez couple for verisimilitude and to convince hess it was a charity business meeting me and mickey for the party favors id probably do the same thing again under the same conditions which luckily are not likely to recur she tipped up her scotch set the glass down on the end table next to her then got up and crossed the room where she leaned down and kissed him id just like you to try to think about it is that asking so much with a straight face he held up his right hand i hereby promise to think about it he tapped the pages he still held in his lap these words have not been in vain still leaning over him her arms on the arms of his chair she looked him full in the face i believe ive mentioned she said how it worries me that you lie so easily im in therapy for it hunt grinned honest jim parr in an extremely drunken haze by the reedlined waters edge at lake merced and thinking they had gotten themselves to this private place so he could get himself fellated by the still reasonablyhotbyhisstandards lorraine hess had taken the brassjacketed bullet pointblank in the chest it had passed through his heavy peacoat slowed down considerably nicked his sternum and been deflected down and slightly to the right where it had missed a lung and lodged behind a front rib it had not hit any of his major organs or more importantly any arteries nevertheless between the drink and the bullet he had gone down like a dead manenough to fool hess anywayfalling back into the muddy reeds where he lay unmoving and progressively more comatose for the next twentyeight hours until a police unit found him exactly where hess had told juhle hed be his pulse was a bare flicker his body temperature ninetytwo and the paramedics had to resuscitate him twice in the ambulance when he flatlined on the way to the er at the kaiser hospital on masonic and geary his doctor said that his survival was a flatout miracle but offered his theory that the exposure and low body temperature had probably saved him he didnt even have a theory about how he survived the gunshot wound for the first few days tamara and mickey had come in to visit him every day and night but he remained in the icu basically unresponsive and mickey had stopped coming by at every opportunity since he truly hated hospitals and jim wouldnt know he was there anyway tamara though wanted to be around for when her grandfather woke up as she believed he would and she visited whenever she could now thursday six days after jims admittance during the later evening visiting hours tamara was sitting by her grandfathers bed a few blocks from their apartment holding one of his cold hands in both of hers when he opened his eyes for the first time saw her squeezed her hand and smiled feebly he started to say something but could only manage a guttural gurgle its okay jim tamara whispered through her enthusiasm its tam youre going to be okay he closed his eyes again for a moment and in that time tamara pressed the call button by the head of the bed almost immediately a nurse was next to her checking his vitals glancing with concern at the monitor hes awake tamara said he just tried to talk to me and jim opened his eyes again maybe he could have some water waters always good the nurse said she poured a glassful from the pitcher near his bed put in a straw and directed it to jims mouth after swallowing two or three times he lifted his head slightly and the straw came out where are we he asked kaiser tamara said you got shot do you remember shaking his head no jim closed his eyes again his chest rose and fell under his blankets when he opened his eyes again tamara thought she detected some vestigial sign of his old spark i thought she hit people on the head he said you do remember an infinitesimal nod lorraine right he sighed como and her yep i thought i remembered that but i didnt want to say until i was sure you remembered right mickey told me not to go but i had to find out thats all right dont worry about that now hes gonna bust my ass probably he paused to take a weary breath or two but a gun her exhusbands after the first two she thought it would be cleaner a small ripple of what might have been laughter or at least ironic amusement shook him and look at me how do you like that a lot jim i like it a lot he closed his eyes as if savoring the moment so where is she now in jail again he nodded closed his eyes hes tired the nurse said maybe thats enough for today okay tamara wasnt going to push it she squeezed his hand again and felt the small but definite response his mouth creased upward marginally she stood up and leaned in to plant a kiss on his cheek ill bring in mickey tomorrow she whispered meanwhile you keep getting better she started to take her hand out from under his but suddenly he squeezed hard enough to hold her and opened his eyes one more time tam yeah you still eating every day jim every day good dont stop that again i wont he patted her hand thats my big favorite girl with a final small nod he closed his eyes once again and the pressure of his hand holding hers went away watching him she stood still long enough to see his chest rise and fall a few times then pulled her hand out from under his and turned for the door various legal technicalities and the perennially overcrowded san francisco court docket held up the arraignment of lorraine hess but hunt was in the department courtroom that friday morning and listened to her plead not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity to two counts of first degree murder one count of attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon just after she was led back to the holding cells hunt walked across the lobby of the hall of justice outside he stood on the steps in the windy sunshine and debated with himself whether he should go back inside and try to talk to juhle but he was reluctant to put himself in the position of seeming to apologize for his unorthodox ways after all in spite of even ginas concerns that hed acted recklessly he had delivered dominic comos and nancy nesheks murderer into juhles hands without even a minor scuffle in the process hed saved his friend and russo as well from another false or at best deeply flawed arrest if juhle didnt like the way hunt had done that job that was just too bad when youre at the table and your hand comes in youve got to bet it and play it now and thats what hunt had done sure it could have gone differently granted there were more risks involved than juhle and even gina felt comfortable with but the fact was that hunt was not a cop he was a private investigator and didnt have to abide by the written and unwritten rules of the police force if juhle didnt like that hed have to get over it he checked his watch scanned the traffic as it flowed by him on bryant then descended the steps and jaywalked across the street to where lou the greeks was probably just starting to serve the days first orders of the special whatever that might turn out to be if hunt went right down now he could get a table with no wait he was halfway through his yeanling clay bowl sitting at a twotop that faced away from the entrance and the bar when a shadow crossed his table and in the next second juhle was in the chair across from him i saw you in there juhle said without preamble i love that she pleaded not guilty hunt shrugged how does she do that after she confessed happens all the time juhle said youd be surprised he pointed at hunts food yeanling clay bowl hunt nodded and the yeanling today is especially fresh and tasty do i have time to get some and talk to you or are you running out to solve another crime ive got no crimes on the agenda im back to litigation work not that im complaining theres suddenly a ton of it getting your name in the paper never hurts yeah theres that hunt shrugged again twisted a forkful of the noodle contingent of his dish what else do you want to talk about ive been thinking about it for a week now its driving me crazy i dont know how you knew hunt chewed i didnt not till the last minute before that i was wrong on every guess turner ellen alicia i was all over the money i never even looked at hess so what changed she snagged herself at comos memorial she pretended she had barely heard of nesheks death but then a few minutes later before anybody had said anything about it she asked me if the cops had found anything at nesheks house juhle spoke up and she shouldnt have known that soon that neshek had been killed in her own home see you can figure things out after all but i didnt figure it out at least not then i just thought somebody might have included that detail before i went over to talk to them you know did you hear nancy got killed at her house last night kind of thing so i didnt put too much on it she possibly could have known so i gave her the benefit okay okay so the next day mickeys up at sunset talking to her about her alibi for monday night and she tells him shes got a son shes helping with homework all night but then she lets drop that she doesnt even know where neshek lived so i get this little ding ding ding in my brain and wonder how likely that is i mean shes worked with dominic like for a decade and all these execs go to the same functions he raised a hand and stopped one of the waiters going by you ordering juhle nodded and told the waiter he was going to walk on the wild side and have the special and a diet coke and then he came back to hunt so she said she didnt know where neshek lived right at the same time she tells mickey how shes hurting for money big bills medical stuff but somehow before that she had the money for a fulltime caregiver and a tutor anyway that sticks with me a little bit but still i mean possible i suppose and shes still got her kid as an alibi plus theres absolutely no hint of a motive so i let it pass again strike two all right the oh two pitch im talking with alicia thorpe trying to bust her story wide open and she tells me that shed met ellen como at a sanctuary house benefit at nesheks place ellen como am i missing something no hang on so alicias talking about this first meeting with ellen and then she lets slipi mean really just an aside pure luckthat dominic pulled her away from the sunset staff to introduce her to ellen and she mentions hess specifically at nesheks house better getting there then it occurs to me that the reason ellen is sure that dominic is screwing alicia is because hess told her so she said she caught them in the act a couple of times now theres no doubt that dominic was screwing around how likely is it hes going to get caught in his office not once but a few times so im starting to wonder if hess isnt telling ellen the truth whats she got against alicia bringing me of course to the oldest motive in the world you got her not yet ive got some thoughts and some definite issues but nothing solid for como and no reason in the world for neshek so im stuck until until i remember al carter whos worked there for eight years and presumably knows everything and hes uptight because hes black and hes got a record and thinks you guys are going to come after him thats bogus wyatt we dont do that we never even gave him more than a passing look im not the guy youve got to convince dev anyway whatever al wants to help us find whoever did como if he can and not just for the reward either so i have mickey find him and we have a talk and i ask him one if back in the day did lorraine and como have a thing and guess what not just back in the day evidently but back up until a few months after alicia came on in other words until a few weeks ago and carter didnt think to mention that to anybody he thought lorraine had no problem with it ending she was cool it wasnt like passion anymore he didnt think shed gotten old juhles diet coke arrived and he took a long drink thats pretty much what she told us motive wise and you might like to know that what happened monday night with neshek is that she came up to hess after the coo meeting and actually asked hess if she should talk to you wyatt did she say why she was in dominics office one time and saw a concealed safe full of money wouldnt it be better for coo she asked hess if they came forward with the money the feds claimed was missing or would it just tarnish dominics reputation and the work they were trying to do hess thought that what neshek was really saying was that she knew that hess had taken the money so she killed her so that would be the money you found in hesss house five hundred eightyseven thousand six hundred and eighty dollars but whos counting not by the way in small bills juhle drank again but i still dont see you making your call to hess even if you had all of thatthe contradiction about nesheks house the motive right still not enough so i had a hunch i knew that jim parr was on his way to sunset but either he never got there or he got there and ran into somebody he knew who got him away hess hunt nodded hess so i asked carter if hess had come back to sunset that day after the memorial hed definitely been there and hed know and he told me she hadnt but shed told mickey she had there you go well again there was a luck element mickey found the bar she took him to like a block around the corner from sunset okay but why kill parr juhle asked basically same as neshek jim knew from the old days that she had been doing como and he knew about the cash and the safe from his driving days too but al carter knew all of that too and she knew it so why didnt she kill him too i dont know lack of opportunity or maybe she thought shed convinced himin fact i think she hadthat she had nothing going with como anymore if its any consolation gina thinks that she would have gotten around to al next by this time she was ready to go off on anybody who got close actually wyatt when you look at what she did why she killed these people maybe the insanity plea isnt so farfetched after all why do you say that well the blunt instrument murders argue that shes crazy i mean women dont kill people with blunt instruments theyre too unpredictable plus youve got to swing really hard hunt chewed a moment actually ive thought about that dev and it seems to me its more an argument for premeditation than insanity how do you figure that well i couldnt figure out if hess had a gun why shed use a tire iron i mean on the face of it as you say thats insane but its not insane if you want to kill dominic and at the same time make it look like alicia did it because you hate her for stealing him from you tire iron limo scarf bingo alicias access to all of them and by the way it almost worked but not quite juhle said hunt let juhle have his small facesaving moment and still you know he added it came to getting her down to my place she might have just blown off everything and waited it out let you arrest alicia maybe get out of dodge with her boy it was then or never i had to move dev had to ever breathe a word of this to my partner wyatt and ill deny it to my dying day but im secretly glad as hell that you did wyatt hunt heard what appeared to be lighthearted conversation as he mounted the stairs that led up to his office just after his first appointment of the day which had been over at gina roakes firm now it was close to ten oclock and he had no appointments that he knew of scheduled for his office opening the outer door he caught tamara in midlaugh at something across the room from her two middleaged africanamerican men in black suits white shirts and black ties filled up the tiny reception area they both stood when he entered and now he was shaking both of their hands mr carter how you doin good to see you again mr rand welcome to the hunt club such as it is what can i do for you gentlemen the visit by these two men was a surprise and far from an unpleasant one hunt had last seen them together during the small but very wellcovered ceremony at city hall where the mayor had presented the reward distribution moneytwo hundred thousand dollars to al carter and fifty thousand each to ellen como cecil rand and linda colores though lorraine hess was still a long way from actually being convicted there was no doubt that she had killed dominic como and on this basis len turner decided to release the reward funds before he was technically committed to do so it seemed that al carter was the spokesman for the two of them and after a few more pleasantries catching up on life they sat again on their chairs while hunt perched himself on the side of tamaras desk but no sooner had he sat than al carter halfstood again so that he could get at his wallet which he extracted and from which he then produced a couple of business cards which he handed over to hunt hunt looked down at the beautifully designed card light blue with a colorful logo of a toucan and the words toucan limousine service we realize that this is short notice but we were hoping cecil and i that since this is the first formal day of our new businessi dont know if youve heard weve gone into partnership with two brandnew town carsmaybe we could drive you and your lovely associate here to the place of your choice and take you both to lunch we go by convoy rand added all the way out to the cliff house you want hunt half turned back to tamara this is a tough call but im thinking we need to close up for the afternoon tam hows that sound to you she made a mock pout youre the boss if we have to hunt straightened off the desk you drive a hard bargain but you gentlemen have got yourselves a deal when do we go tout de suite carter said as soon as youre all ready tamara was on her feet ill be right back just let me go and freshen up as she disappeared back through hunts inner office carter said theres one other thing mr hunt weve discussed this cecil and i and wed like to offer you free service in town if you need it whenever were not driving paying clients hunt sat back down on the desk his first thought being that this was like the old deal hed had with mickey when hed been driving a cab but better and his second that he couldnt accept it guys he said thats extremely generous but youll need your clients and well get them carter said but in the meanwhile were at your service would you let me at least pay for gas the two men exchanged a glance and a quick nod gas would not compromise our position too badly carter said you can pay for gas thank you hunt shook hands with them again so whats with the name both men smiled and rand said toucan right hunt still not seeing it mr hunt and then carter said slowly two con mickey had missed six weeks of cooking school because of his broken arm hed had the last soft cast finally removed earlier this week and though he was still stiff he could at least raise it and move things around in the kitchen and this morning he was so anxious to get started that he woke himself up at a few minutes after six had his coffee and started his cuttingonions celery fennel root why not hed thought green beans brussels sprouts potatoesa cornucopia of justpurchased fresh produce overflowing the counter on both sides of the sink hed gone down to the ferry building last week and ordered a fourteenpound diestel family heirloom turkey that hed picked up yesterday and soaked in the chronicles famous best turkey brine truth be told there really wasnt much to cooking a turkey as long as you didnt overcook it and even that was easy to time and guarantee with an instantread thermometer to his mind the trick to the great thanksgiving dinner was the stuffing and since everybody had different tastes he was making several kindsprune chestnut oyster bread and sausage and what he and tamara had always called plain old with celery onions stock and poultry seasoning he was cutting the onions when he heard a scratching noise and he stopped and listened again there it was again a scratch and a soft tap going out into the living room he went over to the front door and opened it i know its too early alicia said and then added all in a rush and the last thing i want to do is intrude on you or your kitchen but i know how much you were doing today and i figured that since we were going to be eating here our combined families i mean what there are of them the least i could do would be to help you out a little even if its early although i havent really had much practice with exactly what to do on thanksgiving i mean theyve all been so different when weve even had them at all and since ian and i havent really ever had one exactly together this ones going to be at least one we can remember even if its the last one we ever she stopped talking and just stood in front of him with her hands down by her sides she took a deep breath and let it out her eyes beginning to go glassy now and one other thing she reached up a hand behind his neck ive been waiting for the right time she said and i so dont want to be wrong and im not completely sure if this is it yet she took another breath but unless you tell me not to im going to kiss you he beat her to it acknowledgments while casting about for an idea that would drive this book i was hoping to be able to include an element or two that was more or less pure fun i have found that when youre writing about very serious issues such as abuse of charity funds and murder it adds to a books readability and enjoyment if theres something else going on besides the heavy stuff my muse aka my wife lisa sawyer suggested i include a whole bunch of restaurants san francisco being such a great restaurant town this struck me as such a good idea that i considered naming this book thirty restaurants and setting every scene in an eating establishment fortunately i didnt carry the conceit that far but i did decide that my main character mickey dade wanted to be not a private eye but a chef since cooking has long been one of my own passions i knew i could bring a certain authority and definitely some fun to that approach but there is a nearly unbridgeable chasm between recreational cooks and professional chefs since i am definitely one of the former i didnt have a good idea of the mindset and ambitions demanded of the latter i was mentioning this to a friend laurie lovely her real name at my workout club and she suggested i take a look at michael ruhlmans the making of a chef it was a terrific book and set me well on the way to knowing who mickey dade was and what he was made of i wish i could have incorporated more of the fascinating life of a chefintraining in this book but my story was after all about murder and corporate malfeasance and i didnt want to burden my readers with too many distractions serendipity then intervened again in the guise of an article by terri hardy that ran in the sacramento bee about some questionable practices with the bookkeeping and business practices of a wellknown charity that i wont name here but i did call terri and speak to her at length about her research and discoveries and id like to thank her for providing the key that unlocked the door to the real meat of this novel id also like to thank another journalist michelle durand columnist and reporter for the san mateo daily journal who contributed some anecdotal information on ducks and ground squirrels really that got the book off and running as in all of my books al giannini continues to contribute mightily from the planning stages right up through the final editing al knows just about everything about criminal law that there is to know and is unstinting in his generosity in sharing that knowledge with me if these novels read like theyre written by somebody who knows the ins and outs of the criminal justice system and i hope they do it is due largely to als efforts and insights other friends who added to this novel in one way or the other include max byrd john m poswall don matheson peter j and donna diedrich dr mark detzer and bob zaro peter s dietrich md mph has once again vetted the book for medical issues and my assistant anita boone continues to lighten my days and my workload by being among the most competent efficient and cheerful people on the planet in ways too numerous and too intangible to mention my two children
