vagabond book of the grail quest by bernard cornwell part one england october arrows on the hill it was october the time of the years dying when cattle were being slaughtered before winter and when the northern winds brought a promise of ice the chestnut leaves had turned golden the beeches were trees of flame and the oaks were made from bronze thomas of hookton with his woman eleanor and his friend father hobbe came to the upland farm at dusk and the farmer refused to open his door but shouted through the wood that the travellers could sleep in the byre rain rattled on the mouldering thatch thomas led their one horse under the roof that they shared with a woodpile six pigs in a stout timber pen and a scattering of feathers where a hen had been plucked the feathers reminded father hobbe that it was st galluss day and he told eleanor how the blessed saint coming home in a winters night had found a bear stealing his dinner he told the animal off father hobbe said he gave it a right talkingto he did and then he made it fetch his firewood ive seen a picture of that eleanor said didnt the bear become his servant thats because gallus was a holy man father hobbe explained bears wouldnt fetch firewood for just anyone only for a holy man a holy man thomas put in who is the patron saint of hens thomas knew all about the saints more indeed than father hobbe why would a chicken want a saint he enquired sarcastically gallus is the patron of hens eleanor asked confused by thomass tone not hears of hens father hobbe confirmed indeed of all poultry but why eleanor wanted to know because he once expelled a wicked demon from a young girl father hobbe broadfaced hair like a sticklebacks spines peasantborn stocky young and eager liked to tell stories of the blessed saints a whole bundle of bishops had tried to drive the demon out he went on and they had all failed but the blessed gallus came along and he cursed the demon he cursed it and it screeched in terror father hobbe waved his hands in the air to imitate the evil spirits panic and then it fled from her body it did and it looked just like a black hen a pullet a black pullet ive never seen a picture of that eleanor remarked in her accented english then gazing out through the byre door but id like to see a real bear carrying firewood she added wistfully thomas sat beside her and stared into the vet dusk which was hazed by a small mist he was not sure it really was st galluss day for he had lost his reckoning while they travelled perhaps it was already st audreys day it was october he knew that and he knew that one thousand three hundred and fortysix years had passed since christ had been born but he was not sure which day it was it was easy to lose count his father had once recited all the sunday services on a saturday and he had had to do them again the next day thomas surreptitiously made the sign of the cross he was a priests bastard and that was said to bring bad luck he shivered there was a heaviness in the air that owed nothing to the setting sun nor to the rain clouds nor to the mist god help us he thought but there was an evil in this dusk and he made the sign of the cross again and said a silent prayer to st gallus and his obedient bear there had been a dancing bear in london its teeth nothing but rotted yellow stumps and its brown flanks matted with blood from its owners goad the street dogs had snarled at it slunk about it and shrank back when the bear swung on them how far to durham eleanor asked this time speaking french her native language tomorrow i think thomas answered still gazing north to where the heavy dark was shrouding the land she asked he explained in english to father hobbe when we would reach durham tomorrow pray god the priest said tomorrow you can rest thomas promised eleanor in french she was pregnant with a child that god willing would be born in the springtime thomas was not sure how he felt about being a father it seemed too early for him to become responsible but eleanor was happy and he liked to please her and so he told her he was happy as well some of the time that was even true and tomorrow father hobbe said we shall fetch our answers tomorrow thomas corrected him we shall ask our questions god will not let us come this far to be disappointed father hobbe said and then to keep thomas from arguing he laid out their meagre supper thats all thats left of the bread he said and we should save some of the cheese and an apple for breakfast he made the sign of the cross over the food blessing it then broke the hard bread into three pieces we should eat before nightfall darkness brought a brittle cold a brief shower passed and after it the wind dropped thomas slept closest to the byre door and sometime after the wind died he woke because there was a light in the northern sky he rolled over sat up and he forgot that he was cold forgot his hunger forgot all the small nagging discomforts of life for he could see the grail the holy grail the most precious of all christs bequests to man lost these thousand years and more and he could see it glowing in the sky like shining blood and about it bright as the glittering crown of a saint rays of dazzling shimmer filled the heaven thomas wanted to believe he wanted the grail to exist he thought that if the grail were to be found then all the worlds evil would be drained into its depths he so wanted to believe and that october night he saw the grail like a great burning cup in the north and his eyes filled with tears so that the image blurred yet he could see it still and it seemed to him that a vapour boiled from the holy vessel beyond it in ranks rising to the heights of the air were rows of angels their wings touched by fire all the northern sky was smoke and gold and scarlet glowing in the night as a sign to doubting thomas oh lord he said aloud and he threw off his blanket and knelt in the byres cold doorway oh lord thomas eleanor beside him had awoken she sat up and stared into the night fire she said in french cest un grand incendie her voice was awed cest un incendie thomas asked then came fully awake and saw there was indeed a great fire on the horizon from where the flames boiled up to light a cupshaped chasm in the clouds there is an army there eleanor whispered in french look she pointed to another glow farther off they had seen such lights in the sky in france flamelight reflected from cloud where englands army blazed its way across normandy and picardy thomas still gazed north but now in disappointment it was an army not the grail thomas eleanor was worried its just rumour he said he was a priests bastard and he had been raised on the sacred scriptures and in matthews gospel it had been promised that at the end of time there would be battles and rumours of battles the scriptures promised that the world would come to its finish in a welter of war and blood and in the last village where the folk had watched them suspiciously a sullen priest had accused them of being scottish spies father hobbe had bridled at that threatening to box his fellow priests ears but thomas had calmed both men down and then spoken with a shepherd who said he had seen smoke in the northern hills the scots the shepherd said were marching south though the priests woman scoffed at the tale claiming that the scottish troops were nothing but cattle raiders bar your door at night she advised and theyll leave you alone the far light subsided it was not the grail thomas eleanor frowned at him i had a dream he said just a dream i felt the child move she said and she touched his shoulder will you and i be married in durham he promised her he was a bastard and he wanted no child of his to carry the same taint we shall reach the city tomorrow he reassured eleanor and you and i will marry in a church and then we shall ask our questions and he prayed let one of the answers be that the grail did not exist let it be a dream a mere trick of fire and cloud in a night sky for else thomas feared it would lead to madness he wanted to abandon this search he wanted to give up the grail and return to being what he was and what he wanted to be an archer of england bernard de taillebourg frenchman dominican friar and inquisitor spent the autumn night in a pig pen and when dawn came thick and white with fog he went to his knees and thanked god for the privilege of sleeping in fouled straw then mindful of his high task he said a prayer to st dominic begging the saint to intercede with god to make this days work good as the flame in thy mouth lights us to truth he spoke aloud so let it light our path to success he rocked forward in the intensity of his emotion and his head struck against a rough stone pillar that supported one corner of the pen pain jabbed through his skull and he invited more by forcing his forehead back against the stone grinding the skin until he felt the blood trickle down to his nose blessed dominic he cried blessed dominic god be thanked for thy glory light our way the blood was on his lips now and he licked it and reflected on all the pain that the saints and martyrs had endured for the church his hands were clasped and there was a smile on his haggard face soldiers who the night before had burned much of the village to ash and raped the women who failed to escape and killed the men who tried to protect the women now watched the priest drive his head repeatedly against the bloodspattered stone dominic bernard de taillebourg gasped oh dominic some of the soldiers made the sign of the cross for they recognized a holy man when they saw one one or two even knelt though it was awkward in their mail coats but most just watched the priest warily or else watched his servant who sitting outside the sty returned their gaze the servant like bernard de taillebourg was a frenchman but something in the younger mans appearance suggested a more exotic birth his skin was sallow almost as dark as a moors and his long hair was sleekly black which with his narrow face gave him a feral look he wore mail and a sword and though he was nothing but a priests servant he carried himself with confidence and dignity his dress was elegant something strange in this ragged army no one knew his name no one even wanted to ask just as no one wanted to ask why he never ate or chatted with the other servants but kept himself fastidiously apart now the mysterious servant watched the soldiers and in his left hand he held a knife with a very long and thin blade and once he knew enough men were looking at him he balanced the knife on an outstretched finger the knife was poised on its sharp tip which was prevented from piercing the servants skin by the cutoff finger of a mail glove that he wore like a sheath then he jerked the finger and the knife span in the air blade glittering to come down tip first to balance on his finger again the servant had not looked at the knife once but kept his darkeyed gaze fixed on the soldiers the priest oblivious to the display was howling prayers his thin cheeks laced with blood dominic dominic light our path the knife span again its wicked blade catching the foggy mornings small light dominic guide us guide us on your horses mount up move yourselves a greyhaired man a big shield slung from his left shoulder pushed through the onlookers weve not got all day what in the name of the devil are you all gawking at jesus christ on his goddamn cross what is this eskdale bloody fair for christs sake move move the shield on his shoulder was blazoned with the badge of a red heart but the paint was so faded and the shields leather cover so scarred that the badge was hard to distinguish oh suffering christ the man had spotted the dominican and his servant father were going now right now and i dont wait for prayers he turned back to his men mount up move your bones theres devils work to be done douglas the dominican snapped the greyhaired man turned back fast my name priest is sir william and youll do well to remember it the priest blinked he seemed to be suffering a momentary confusion still caught up in the ecstasy of his paindriven prayer then he gave a perfunctory bow as if acknowledging his fault in using sir williams surname i was talking to the blessed dominic he explained ave well i hope you asked him to shift this damn fog and he will lead us today he will guide us then hed best get his damn boots on sir william douglas knight of liddesdale growled at the priest for were leaving whether your saint is ready or not sir williams chain mail was battletorn and patched with newer rings rust showed at the hem and at the elbows his faded shield like his weatherbeaten face was scarred he was fortysix now and he reckoned he had a sword arrow or spear scar for each of those years that had turned his hair and short beard white now he pulled open the stys heavy gate on your trotters father ive a horse for you i shall walk bernard de taillebourg said picking up a stout staff with a leather thong threaded through its tip as our lord walked then youll not get wet crossing the streams eh is that it sir william chuckled youll walk on water will you father you and your servant alone among his men he did not seem impressed by the french priest or wary of the priests wellarmed servant but sir william douglas was famously unafraid of any man he was a border chieftain who employed murder fire sword and lance to protect his land and some fierce priest from paris was hardly likely to impress him sir william indeed was not overfond of priests but his king had ordered him to take bernard de taillebourg on this mornings raid and sir william had grudgingly consented all around him soldiers pulled themselves into their saddles they were lightly armed for they expected to meet no enemies a few like sir william carried shields but most were content with just a sword bernard de taillebourg his friars robes mudspattered and damp hurried alongside sir william will you go into the city of course ill not go into the bloody city theres a truce remember but if theres a truce if theres a bloody truce then we leave them be the french priests english was good but it took him a few moments to work out what sir williams last three words had meant therell be no fighting not between us and the city no and theres no goddamned english army within a hundred miles so therell be no fighting all were doing is looking for food and forage father food and forage feed your men and feed your animals and thats the way to win your wars sir william as he spoke climbed onto his horse which was held by a squire he pushed his boots into the stirrups plucked the skirts of his mail coat from under his thighs and gathered the reins ill get you close to the city father but after that youll have to shift for yourself shift bernard de taillebourg asked but sir william had already turned away and spurred his horse down a muddy lane that ran between low stone walls two hundred mounted menatarms grim and grev on this foggy morning streamed after him and the priest buffeted by their big dirty horses struggled to keep up the servant followed with apparent unconcern he was evidently accustomed to being among soldiers and showed no apprehension indeed his demeanour suggested he might be better with his weapons than most of the men who rode behind sir william the dominican and his servant had travelled to scotland with a dozen other messengers sent to king david ii by philip of valois king of france the embassy had been a cry for help the english had burned their way across normandy and picardy they had slaughtered the french kings army near a village called crecy and their archers now held a dozen fastnesses in brittany while their savage horsemen rode from edward of englands ancestral possessions in gascony all that was bad but even worse and as if to show all europe that france could be dismembered with impunity the english king was now laying siege to the great fortress harbour of calais philip of valois was doing his best to raise the siege but winter was coming his nobles grumbled that their king was no warrior and so he had appealed for aid to scotlands king david son of robert the bruce invade england the french king had pleaded and thus force edward to abandon the siege of calais to protect his homeland the scots had pondered the invitation then were persuaded by the french kings embassy that england lay defenceless how could it be otherwise edward of englands army was all at calais or else in brittany or gascony and there was no one left to defend england and that meant the old enemy was helpless it was asking to be raped and all the riches of england were just waiting to fall into scottish hands and so the scots had come south it was the largest army that scotland had ever sent across the border the great lords were all there the sons and grandsons of the warriors who had humbled england in the bloody slaughter about the bannockburn and those lords had brought their menatarms who had grown hard with incessant frontier battles but this time smelling plunder they were accompanied by the clan chiefs from the mountains and islands chiefs leading wild tribesmen who spoke a language of their own and fought like devils unleashed they had come in their thousands to make themselves rich and the french messengers their duty done had sailed home to tell philip of valois that edward of england would surely raise his siege of calais when he learned that the scots were ravaging his northern lands the french embassy had sailed for home but bernard de taillebourg had stayed he had business in northern england but in the first days of the invasion he had experienced nothing except frustration the scottish army was twelve thousand strong larger than the army with which edward of england had defeated the french at crecy yet once across the frontier the great army had stopped to besiege a lonely fortress garrisoned by a mere thirtyeight men and though the thirtyeight had all died it had wasted four days more time was spent negotiating with the citizens of carlisle who had paid gold to have their city spared and then the young scottish king frittered away three more davs pillaging the great priory of the black canons at hexham now ten days after they had crossed the frontier and after wandering across the northern english moors the scottish army had at last reached durham the city had offered a thousand golden pounds if they could be spared and king david had given them two days to raise the money which meant that bernard de taillebourg had two days to find a way to enter the city to which end slipping in the mud and half blinded by the fog he followed sir william douglas into a valley across a stream and up a steep hill which way is the city he demanded of sir william when the fog lifts father ill tell you theyll respect the truce theyre holy men in durham father sir william answered wryly but better still theyre frightened men it had been the monks of the city who had negotiated the ransom and sir william had advised against acceptance if monks offered a thousand pounds he reckoned then it would have been better to have killed the monks and taken two thousand but king david had overruled him david the bruce had spent much of his youth in france and so considered himself cultured but sir william was not thus hampered by scruples youll be safe if you can talk your way into the city sir william reassured the priest the horsemen had reached the hilltop and sir william turned south along the ridge still following a track that was edged with stone walls and which led after a mile or so to a deserted hamlet where four cottages so low that their shaggy thatched roofs seemed to swell out of the straggling turf clustered by a crossroads in the centre of the crossroads where the muddy ruts surrounded a patch of nettles and grass a stone cross leaned southwards sir william curbed his horse beside the monument and stared at the carved dragon encircling the shaft the cross was missing one arm a dozen of his men dismounted and ducked into the low cottages but they found no one and nothing though in one cottage the embers of a fire still glowed and so they used the smouldering wood to fire the four thatched roofs the thatch was reluctant to catch the fire for it was so damp that mushrooms grew on the mossy straw sir william took his foot from the stirrup and tried to kick the broken cross over but it would not shift he grunted with the effort saw bernard de taillebourgs disapproving expression and scowled its not holy ground father its only bloody england he peered at the carved dragon its mouth agape as it stretched up the stone shaft ugly bastard thing isnt it dragons are creatures of sin things of the devil bernard de taillebourg said so of course it is ugly a thing of the devil eh sir william kicked the cross again my mother he explained as he gave the cross a third futile kick always told me that the bloody english buried their stolen gold beneath dragons crosses two minutes later the cross had been heaved aside and a halfdozen men were peering disappointedly into the hole it had left smoke from the burning roofs thickened the fog swirled over the road and vanished into the greyness of the morning air no gold sir william grunted then he summoned his men and led them southwards out of the choking smoke he was looking for any livestock that could be driven back to the scottish army but the fields were empty the fire of the burning cottages was a hazed gold and red in the fog behind the raiders a glow that slowly faded until only the smell of the fire was left and then suddenly hugely filling the whole world with the alarm of its noise a peal of bells clanged about the sky sir william presuming the sound came from the east turned through a gap in the wall into a pasture where he checked his horse and stood in the stirrups he was listening to the sound but in the fog it was impossible to tell where the bells were or how far away they were being tolled and then the sound stopped as suddenly as it had began the fog was thinning now shredding away through the orange leaves of a stand of elms white mushrooms dotted the empty pasture where bernard de taillebourg dropped to his knees and began to pray aloud quiet father sir william snapped the priest made the sign of the cross as though imploring heaven to forgive sir williams impiety in interrupting a prayer you said there was no enemy he complained im not listening for any bloody enemy sir william said but for animals im listening for cattle bells or sheep bells yet sir william seemed strangely nervous for a man who sought only livestock he kept twisting in his saddle peering into the fog and scowling at the small noises of curb chains or hooves stamping on damp earth he snarled at the menatarms closest to him to be silent he had been a soldier before some of these men had even been born and he had not stayed alive by ignoring his instincts and now in this damp fog he smelt danger sense told him there was nothing to fear that the english army was far away across the sea but he smelt death all the same and quite unaware of what he was doing he pulled the shield off his shoulder and pushed his left arm through its carrying loops it was a big shield one made before men began adding plates of armour to their mail a shield wide enough to screen a mans whole body a soldier called out from the pastures edge and sir william grasped his swords hilt then he saw that the man had only exclaimed at the sudden appearance of towers in the fog which was now little more than a mist on the ridges top though in the deep valleys either side the fog flowed like a white river and across the eastern river way off to the north where they emerged from the spectral whiteness of another hill crest was a great cathedral and a castle they towered through the mist vast and dark like buildings from some doomladen wizards imagination and bernard de taillebourgs servant who felt he had not seen civilization in weeks stared entranced at the two buildings blackrobed monks crowded the tallest of the cathedrals two towers and the servant saw them pointing at the scottish horsemen durham sir william grunted the bells he reckoned must have been summoning the faithful to their morning prayers i have to go there the dominican climbed from his knees and seizing his staff set off towards the mistshrouded city sir william spurred his horse in front of the frenchman whats your hurry father he demanded and de taillebourg tried to dodge past the scotsman but there was a scraping sound and suddenly a blade cold and heavy and grey was in the dominicans face i asked you father what the hurry was sir williams voice was as cold as his sword then alerted by one of his men he glanced over and saw that the priests servant had half drawn his own weapon if your bastard man doesnt sheathe his blade father sir william spoke softly but there was a terrible menace in his voice ill have his collops for my supper de taillebourg said something in french and the servant reluctantly pushed the blade fully home the priest looked up at sir william have you no fear for your mortal soul he asked sir william smiled paused and looked about the hilltop but he saw nothing untoward in the shredding fog and decided his earlier nervousness had been the result of imagination the result perhaps of too much beef pork and svine the previous night the scots had feasted in the captured home of durhams prior and the prior lived well judging by his larder and cellar but rich suppers gave men premonitions i keep my own priest to worry about my soul sir william said then raised the tip of his sword to force de taillebourgs face upwards why does a frenchman have business with our enemies in durham he demanded it is church business de taillebourg said firmly i dont give a damn whose business it is sir william said i still wish to know obstruct me de taillebourg said pushing the sword blade away and i shall have the king punish you and the church condemn you and the holy father send your soul to eternal perdition i shall summon shut your goddamned bloody face sir william said do you think priest that you can frighten me our king is a puppy and the church does what its paymasters tell it to do he moved the blade back this time resting it against the dominicans neck now tell me your business tell me why a frenchman stays with us instead of going home with his countrymen tell me what you want in durham bernard de taillebourg clutched the crucifix that hung about his neck and held it towards sir william in another man the gesture might have been taken as a display of fear but in the dominican it looked rather as though he threatened sir williams soul with the powers of heaven sir william merely gave the crucifix a hungry glance as if appraising its value but the cross was of plain wood while the little figure of christ twisted in deaths agony was only made of yellowed bone if the figure had been made of gold then sir william might have taken the bauble but instead he spat in derision a few of his men fearing god more than their master made the sign of the cross but most did not care they watched the servant closely for he looked dangerous but a middleaged cleric from paris however fierce and gaunt he might be did not scare them so what will you do de taillebourg asked sir william scornfully kill me if i must sir william said implacably the presence of the priest with the french embassy had been a puzzle and his staying on when the others left only compounded the mystery but a garrulous manatarms one of the frenchmen who had brought two hundred suits of plate armour as a gift to the scots had told sir william that the priest was pursuing a great treasure and if that treasure was in durham then sir william wanted to know he wanted a share ive killed priests before he told de taillebourg and another priest sold me an indulgence for the killings so dont think i fear you or your church theres no sin that cant be bought off no pardon that cant be purchased the dominican shrugged two of sir williams men were behind him their swords drawn and he understood that these scotsmen would indeed kill him and his servant these men who followed the red heart of douglas were border ruffians bred to battle as a hound was raised to the chase and the dominican knew there was no point in continuing to threaten their souls for they gave no thought to such things i am going into durham de taillebourg said to find a man what man sir william asked his sword still at the priests neck he is a monk de taillebourg explained patiently and an old man now so old that he may not even be alive he is a frenchman a benedictine and he fled paris many years ago why did he run because the king wanted his head a monks head sir william sounded sceptical he was not always a benedictine de taillebourg said but was once a templar ah sir william began to understand and he knows de taillebourg continued where a great treasure is hidden the templar treasure it is said to be hidden in paris de taillebourg said hidden for all these years but it was only last year that we discovered the frenchman was alive and in england the benedictine you see was once the sacrist of the templars you know what that is dont patronize me father sir william said coldly de taillebourg inclined his head to acknowledge the justice of the reproof if any man knows where the templar treasure is he went on humbly it is the man who was their sacrist and now we hear that man lives in durham sir william took the sword away everything the priest said made sense the knights templar an order of monkish soldiers who were sworn to protect the pilgrims roads between christendom and jerusalem had become rich beyond the dreams of kings and that was foolish for it made kings jealous and jealous kings make bad enemies the king of france was just such an enemy and he had ordered the templars destroyed to which end a heresy had been cooked up lasvvers had effortlessly distorted truths and the templars had been suppressed their leaders had been burned and their lands confiscated but their treasures the fabled treasures of the templars had never been found and the orders sacrist the man responsible for keeping those treasures safe would surely know their fate when were the templars disbanded sir william asked twentynine years ago de taillebourg answered so the sacrist could yet be alive sir wiliam thought he would be an old man but alive sir william sheathed his sword utterly convinced by de taillebourgs tale yet none of it was true except that there was an old monk in durham but he was not french and he had never been a templar and in all probability knew nothing of any templar treasure but bernard de taillebourg had spoken persuasively and the story of the missing hoard was one that echoed through europe spoken of whenever men gathered to exchange tales of marvels sir william wanted the story to be true and that more than anything persuaded him it was if you find this man he said to de taillebourg and if he lives and if you then find the treasure then it will be because ice made it possible it will be because eye brought you here and because we protected you on your journey to durham true sir william de taillebourg said sir william was surprised by the priests ready agreement he frowned shifted in his saddle and stared down at the dominican as if gauging the priests trustworthiness so we must share in the treasure he demanded of course de taillebourg said instantly sir william was no fool let the priest go into durham and he would never see the man again sir william twisted in his saddle and stared north towards the cathedral the templar treasure was said to be the gold from jerusalem more gold than men could dream of and sir william was honest enough to know that he did not possess the resources to divert some of that golden trove to liddesdale the king must be used david ii might be a weak lad scarce breeched and too softened by having lived in france but kings had resources denied to knights and david of scotland could talk to philip of france as a near equal while any message from william douglas would be ignored in paris jamie he snapped at his nephew who was one of the two men guarding de taillebourg you and dougal will take this priest back to the king you must let me go bernard de taillebourg protested sir william leaned from his saddle you want me to cut off your priestly balls to make myself a purse he smiled at the dominican then looked back to his nephew tell the king this french priest has news that concerns us and tell him to hold him safe till i return sir william had decided that if there was an ancient french monk in durham then he should be questioned by the king of scotlands servants and the monks information if he had any could then be sold to the french king take him jamie he commanded and watch that damned servant take his sword james douglas grinned at the thought of a mere priest and his servant giving him trouble but he still obeyed his uncle he demanded that the servant yield his sword and when the man bridled at the order jamie half drew his own blade de taillebourg sharply instructed his servant to obey and the sword was sullenly handed over jamie douglas grinned as he hung the sword from his own belt theyll not bother me uncle away with you sir william said and watched as his nephew and his companion both well mounted on fine stallions captured from the percy lands in northumberland escorted the priest and his servant back towards the kings encampment doubtless the priest would complain to the king and david so much weaker than his great father would worry about the displeasure of god and the french but david would worry a great deal more about sir williams displeasure sir william smiled at that thought then saw that some of his men on the far side of the field had dismounted who the devil told you to unhorse he shouted angrily then he saw they were not his men at all but strangers revealed by the shredding mist and he remembered his instincts and cursed himself for wasting time on the priest and as he cursed so the first arrow flickered from the south the sound it made was a hiss feather in air then it struck home and the noise was like a poleaxe cleaving flesh it was a heavy thump edged with the tearing of steel in muscle and ending with the harsh scrape of blade on bone and then a grunt from the victim and a heartbeat of silence and after that the scream thomas of hookton heard the bells deeptoned and sonorous not the sound of bells hung in some village church but bells of thunderous power durham he thought and he felt a great weariness for the journey had been so long it had begun in picardy on a field stinking of dead men and horses a place of fallen banners broken weapons and spent arrows it had been a great victory and thomas had wondered why it left him dulled and nervous the english had marched north to besiege calais but thomas duty bound to serve the earl of northampton had received the earls permission to take a wounded comrade to caen where there was a doctor of extraordinary skill then however it was decreed that no man could leave the army without the kings permission and so the earl approached the king and thus edward plantagenet heard of thomas of hookton and how his father had been a priest who had been born to a family of french exiles called vexille and how it was rumoured that the vexille family had once possessed the grail it was only a rumour of course a wisp of a story in a hard world yet the story was of the holy grail and that was the most precious thing that had ever existed if indeed it had existed and the king had questioned thomas of hookton and thomas had tried to scorn the truth of the grail story but then the bishop of durham who had fought in the shield wall that broke the french assaults told how thomass father had once been imprisoned in durham he was mad the bishop explained to the king wits flown to the winds so they locked him up for his own good did he talk of the grail the king asked and the bishop of durham had answered that there was one man left in his diocese who might know an old monk called hugh collimore who had nursed the mad ralph vexille thomass father the king might have dismissed the tales as so much churchly gossip had not thomas recovered his fathers heritage the lance of st george in the battle that had left so many dead on the green slope above the village of crecy the battle had also left thomass friend and commander sir william skeat wounded and he wanted to take skeat to the doctor in normandy but the king had insisted that thomas go to durham and speak with brother collimore so eleanors father had taken sir william skeat to caen and thomas eleanor and father hobbe had accompanied a royal chaplain and a knight of king edwards household to england but in london the chaplain and the knight had both fallen sick with an early winter fever and so thomas and his companions had travelled north alone and now they were close to durham on a foggy morning listening to the cathedrals bells eleanor like father hobbe was excited for she believed that discovering the grail would bring peace and justice to a world that stank of burned cottages there would be no more sorrow eleanor thought and no more war and perhaps even no more sickness thomas wanted to believe it he wanted his night vision to be real not flame and smoke vet if the grail existed at all he thought that it would be in some great cathedral guarded by angels or else it was gone from this world and if there was no grail on earth then thomass faith was in a war bow made of italian yew painted black strung with hemp that drove an arrow made of ash fledged with goose feathers and tipped with steel on the bows belly where his left hand gripped the yew there was a silver plate engraved with a yale a fabulous beast of claws and horns and tusks and scales that was the badge of his fathers family the vexilles the vale held a cup and thomas had been told it was the grail always the grail it beckoned him mocked him bent his life changed all yet never appeared except in a dream of fire it was mystery just as thomass family was a mystery but perhaps brother collimore could cast light on that mystery and so thomas had come north he might not learn of the grail but he expected to discover more about his family and that at least made the journey worthwhile which way father hobbe asked god knows thomas said fog shrouded the land the bells sounded that way father hobbe pointed north and east he was energetic full of enthusiasm and naively trusting in thomass sense of direction though in truth thomas did not know where he was earlier they had come to a fork in the road and he had randomly taken the lefthand track that now faded to a mere scar on the grass as it climbed mushrooms grew in the pasture which was wet and heavy with dew so that their horse slipped as it climbed the horse was thomass mare and it was carrying their small baggage and in one of the sacks hanging from the saddles pommel was a letter from the bishop of durham to john fossor the prior of durham most beloved brother in christ the letter began and went on to instruct fossor to allow thomas of hookton and his companions to question brother collimore concerning father ralph vexille whom you will not remember for he was kept closed up in your house before you came to durham indeed before i came to the see but there will be some who know of him and brother collimore if it pleases god that he yet lives will have certain knowledge of him and of the great treasure that he concealed we request this in the name of the king and in the service of almighty god who has blessed our arms in this present endeavour questce que cest eleanor asked pointing up the hill where a dull reddish glow discoloured the fog what father hobbe the only one who did not speak french asked quiet thomas warned him holding up his hand he could smell burning and see the flicker of flames but there were no voices he took his bow from where it hung from the saddle and he strung it bending the huge stave to loop the hemp string over the piece of nocked horn he pulled an arrow from the bag and then motioning eleanor and father hobbe to stay where they were he edged up the track to the shelter of a deep hedge where larks and finches flitted through the dying leaves the fires were roaring suggesting they were newly set he crept closer the bow half drawn until he could see there had been three or four cottages about a crossroads and their rafters and thatch were well ablaze and sending sparks whirling up into the damp grey the fires looked recent but there was no one in sight no enemy no men in mail so he beckoned eleanor and father hobbe forward and then over the sound of the fire he heard a scream it was far off or perhaps it was close but muffled by fog and thomas stared through the smoke and the fog and past the seething flames and suddenly two men in mail both mounted on black stallions cantered into view the horsemen had black hats black boots and black scabbarded swords and they were escorting two other men who were on foot one was a priest a dominican judging by his black and white garb and he had a bloodied face while the other man was tall dressed in mail and had long black hair and a narrow intelligent face the two followed the horsemen through the smoky fog then paused at the crossroads where the priest dropped to his knees and made the sign of the cross the leading horseman seemed irritated by the priests prayer for he turned his horse back and drawing his sword prodded the blade at the kneeling man the priest looked up and to thomass astonishment suddenly rammed his staff up into the stallions throat the beast twitched away and the priest slammed the staff hard at the riders sword arm the horseman unbalanced by his stallions jerking motion tried to cut down across his body with his long blade the second horseman was already unsaddled though thomas had not seen him fall and the blackhaired man in mail was astride his body with a long knife drawn thomas just stared in puzzlement for he was convinced that neither the two horsemen nor the priest nor the blackhaired man had uttered the scream vet no other folk were in sight one of the two horsemen was already dead and the other now fought the priest in silence and thomas had a sense that the conflict was unreal that he was dreaming that in truth this was a morality play in dumb show the blackclad horseman was the devil and the priest was gods will and thomass doubts about the grail were about to be resolved by whoever won and then father hobbe seized the great bow from thomas we must help yet the priest hardly needed help he used the staff like a sword parrying his opponents cut lunging hard to bruise the riders ribs then the man with the long black hair rammed a sword up into the horsemans back and the man arched shivered and his own sword dropped he stared down at the priest for a moment then he fell backwards from his saddle his feet were momentarily trapped in the stirrups and the horse panicking galloped uphill the killer wiped the blade of his sword then took a scabbard from one of the dead men the priest had run to secure the other horse and now sensing he was being watched he turned to see two men and a woman in the fog one of the men was a priest who had an arrow on a bowstring they were going to kill me bernard de taillebourg protested in french the blackhaired man turned fast the sword rising in threat its all right thomas said to father hobbe and he took the black bow away from his friend and hung it on his shoulder god had spoken the priest had won the fight and thomas was reminded of his night vision when the grail had loomed in the clouds like a cup of fire then he saw that under the bruises and blood the strange priests face was hard and lean a martyrs face with the look of a man who had hungered for god and achieved an evident saintliness and thomas almost fell to his knees who are you he called to the dominican i am a messenger bernard de taillebourg snatched at any explanation to cover his confusion he had escaped from his scottish escort and now he wondered how he was to escape from the tall young man with the long black bow but then a flight of arrows hissed from the south and one thumped into a nearby elm trunk while a second skidded along the wet grass and a horse shrieked nearby and men were shouting in disorder father de taillebourg called to his servant to catch the second horse which was trotting uphill and by the time it was caught de taillebourg saw that the stranger with the bow had forgotten him and was staring south to where the arrows flew so he turned towards the city called his servant to follow him and kicked back his heels for god for france for st denis and for the grail sir william douglas cursed arrows were hissing all about him horses were screaming and men were lying dead or injured on the grass for a heartbeat he felt bewildered then he realized that his forage party had blundered into an english force but what kind of force there was no english army nearby the whole english army was in france not here which meant surely that the citizens of durham had broken their truce and that thought filled sir william with a terrible anger christ he thought but there would not be one stone left on another when he had finished with the city and he tugged the big shield to cover his body and spurred south towards the bowmen who were lining a low hedge he reckoned there were not so many of them maybe only fifty and he still had nearly two hundred men mounted and so he roared the order to charge swords scraped from scabbards kill the bastards sir william shouted kill them he was savaging his horse with his spurs and thrusting other confused horsemen aside in his eagerness to reach the hedge he knew the charge would be ragged knew some of his men must die but once they were over the blackthorn and in among the bastards they would kill them all bloody archers he thought he hated archers he especially hated english archers and he detested traitorous trucebreaking durham archers above all others on on he shouted douglas douglas he liked to let his enemies know who was killing them and who would be raping their wives when they were dead if the city had broken the truce then god help that city for he would sack rape and burn the whole of it he would fire the houses plough the ashes and leave the bones of its citizens to the winter blight and for years men would see the bare stones of the ruined cathedral and watch the birds nesting in the castles empty towers and they would know that the knight of liddesdale had worked his revenge douglas he shouted douglas and he felt the thump of arrows smacking into his shield and then his horse screamed and he knew more arrows must have driven deep into its chest for he could feel the beast stumbling he kicked his feet from the stirrups as the horse slewed sideways men charged past him screaming defiance then sir william threw himself out of the saddle and onto his shield that slid along the wet grass like a sledge and he heard his horse screaming in pain but he himself was unhurt hardly even bruised and he pushed himself up found his sword that he had dropped when he fell and ran on with his horsemen a rider had an arrow sticking from his knee a horse went down eyes white teeth bared blood flecking from the arrow wounds the first horsemen were at the hedge and some had found a gap and were spurring through and sir william saw that the damned english bowmen were running away bastards he thought cowardly bloody english rotten whoreson bastards then more bows sounded harsh to his left and he saw a man fall from a horse with an arrow through his head and the fog lifted enough to show that the enemy archers had not run away but had merely joined a solid mass of dismounted menatarms the bowstrings sounded again a horse reared in pain and an arrow sliced into its belly a man staggered was struck again and fell back with a crash of mail sweet christ sir william thought but there was a damned army here a whole damned army back back he bellowed haul off back he yelled till he was hoarse another arrow drove into his shield its point whipping through the leathercovered willow and in his rage he slapped at it breaking the ash shaft uncle uncle a man shouted and sir william saw it was robbie douglas one of his eight nephews who rode with the scottish army bringing him a horse but a pair of english arrows struck the beasts quarter and enraged by pain it broke away from robbies grasp go north sir william shouted at his nephew go on robbie instead robbie rode to his uncle an arrow struck his saddle another glanced off his helmet but he leaned down took sir williams hand and dragged him northwards arrows followed them but the fog swirled thick and hid them sir william shook off his nephews grip and stumbled north made clumsy by his shield stuck with arrows and by his heavy mail god damn it god damn it mind left mind left a scottish voice cried and sir william saw some english horsemen coming from the hedgerow one saw sir william and thought he would be easy pickings the english had been no more ready for battle than the scotsmen a few wore mail but none was properly armoured and none had lances but sir william reckoned they must have detected his presence long before they loosed their first arrows and the anger at being so ambushed made him step towards the horseman who was holding his sword out like a spear sir william did not even bother to try and parry he just thrust his heavy shield up punching it into the horses mouth and he heard the animal whinny in pain as he swept his sword at its legs and the beast twisted away and the rider was flailing for balance and was still trying to calm his horse when sir williams sword tore up under his mail and into his guts bastard sir william snarled and the man was whimpering as sir william twisted the blade and then robbie rode up on the mans far side and chopped his sword down onto his neck so that the englishmans head was all but severed as he fell from the saddle the other horsemen had mysteriously shied away but then arrows flew again and sir william knew the fickle fog was thinning he dragged his sword free of the corpse scabbarded the wet blade and hauled himself into the dead mans saddle away he shouted at robbie who seemed inclined to take on the whole english force singlehanded away boy come on by god he thought but it hurt to run from an enemy yet there was no shame in two hundred men fleeing six or seven hundred and when the fog lifted there could be a proper battle a murderous clash of men and steel and sir william would teach these bastard english how to fight he kicked his borrowed horse on intent on carrying news of the english to the rest of the scottish army but then saw an archer lurking in a hedge a woman and a priest were with the man and sir william put a hand to his sword hilt and thought about swerving aside to take some revenge for the arrows that had ripped into his forage party but behind him the other englishmen were shouting their war cry st george st george and so sir william left the isolated archer alone he rode on leaving good men on the autumn grass they were dead and dying wounded and frightened but he was a douglas he would come back and he would have his revenge a rush of panicked horsemen galloped past the hedge where thomas eleanor and father hobbe crouched half a dozen horses were riderless while at least a score of others were bleeding from wounds out of which the arrows jutted with their white goose feathers spattered red the riders were followed by thirty or forty men on foot some limping some with arrows stuck in their clothes and a few carrying saddles they hurried past the burning cottages as a new volley of arrows hastened their retreat then the thump of hooves made them look back in panic and some of the fugitives broke into a clumsy run as a score of mailclad horsemen thundered from the mist great clods of wet earth spewed up from the horses hooves the stallions were being curbed forced to take brief steps as their riders took aim at their victims then the spurs went back as the horses were released to the kill and eleanor cried aloud in anticipation of the carnage the heavy swords chopped down one or two of the fugitives dropped to their knees and held their hands up in surrender but most tried to escape one dodged behind a galloping horseman and fled towards the hedge saw thomas and his bow and turned straight back into the path of another rider who drove the edge of his heavy sword into the mans face the scotsman went onto his knees mouth open as though he would scream but no sound came only blood seeping between the fingers that were clasped over his nose and eves the horseman who had no shield or helmet turned his stallion and then leaned out of the saddle to chop his sword into his victims neck killing the man as if he were a cow being poleaxed and that was oddly appropriate because thomas saw that the mounted killer was wearing the badge of a brown cow on his jupon which was a short jerkinlike coat half covering his mail hauberk the jupon was torn bloodstained and the cow badge had faded so that at first thomas thought it was a bull then the horseman swerved towards thomas raised his bloody sword in threat and then noticed the bow and checked his horse english and proud of it father hobbe answered for thomas a second horseman this one with three black ravens embroidered on his white jupon reined in beside the first three prisoners were being pushed towards the two horsemen how the devil did you get this far in front the newly arrived man asked thomas in front thomas asked of the rest of us we walked thomas said from france or at least from london from southampton father hobbe corrected thomas with a pedantry that was utterly out of place on this smokestinking hilltop where a scotsman writhed in his death agonies france the first man tanglehaired brownfaced and with a northern accent so thick that thomas found it hard to understand sounded as if he had never heard of france you were in france he asked with the king youre with us now the second man said threateningly then looked eleanor up and down did you bring the doxie back from france yes thomas replied curtly he lies he lies a new voice said and a third horseman pushed himself forward he was a lanky man maybe thirty years old with a face so red and raw that it looked as though he had scraped his skin off with the bristles when he shaved his sunken cheeks and long jaw his dark hair was worn long and tied at the nape of his neck with a leather lace his horse a scarred roan was as thin as the rider and had white nervous eyes i hate goddamn liars the man said staring at thomas then he turned and gave a baleful glance at the prisoners one of whom wore the red heart badge of the knight of liddesdale on his jupon almost as much as i hate goddamn douglases the newcomer wore a padded gambeson in place of a hauberk or haubergeon it was the kind of protection an archer might wear if he could afford nothing better yet this man plainly outranked archers for he wore a gold chain about his neck a mark of distinction reserved for the gentry and above a battered pigsnouted helmet as scarred as the horse hung from his saddles pommel a sword plainly scabbarded in leather was at his hip while a shield painted white with a black axe hung from his left shoulder he also had a coiled whip hanging at his belt the scots have archers the man said looking at thomas then his unfriendly gaze moved on to eleanor and they have women im english thomas insisted were all english father hobbe said firmly forgetting that eleanor was a norman a scotsman would say he was english if it stopped him from being gutted the rawfaced man said caustically the other two horsemen had fallen back evidently wary of the thin man who now uncoiled the leather whip and with a casual skill flicked it so that the tip snaked out and cracked the air an inch or so from eleanors face is she english shes french thomas said the horseman did not answer straightaway but just stared at eleanor the whip rippled as his hand trembled he saw a fair slight girl with golden hair and large frightened eves her pregnancy did not show yet and there was a delicacy to her that spoke of luxury and rare delight scot welsh french what does it matter the man asked shes a woman do you care where a horse was born before you ride it his own scarred and thin horse became frightened just then because the veering wind blew a sour gust of smoke to its nostrils it stepped sideways in a series of small nervous steps until the man drove his spurs back so savagely that he pierced the padded trapper and made the destrier stand shivering in fear what she is the man spoke to thomas and pointed his whip handle at eleanor dont matter but youre a scot im english thomas said again a dozen other men wearing the badge of the black axe had come to gaze at thomas and his companions the men surrounded the three scottish prisoners who seemed to know who the horseman with the whip was and did not like the knowledge more bowmen and menatarms watched the cottages burning and laughed at the panicked rats that scrambled from what was left of the collapsed mossy thatch thomas took an arrow from his bag and immediately four or five archers wearing the blackaxe livery put arrows on their own strings the other men in the axe livery grinned expectantly as if they knew this game and enjoyed it but before it could be played out the horseman was distracted by one of the scottish prisoners the man wearing sir william douglass badge who taking advantage of his captors interest in thomas and eleanor had broken free and run northwards he had not gone twenty paces before he was ridden down by one of the english menatarms and the thin man amused by the scotsmans desperate bid for freedom pointed at one of the burning cottages warm the bastard up he ordered dickon beggar he spoke to two dismounted menatarms look after those three he nodded towards thomas watch em close dickon the younger of the two was roundfaced and grinning but beggar was an enormous man a shambling giant with a face so bearded that his nose and eyes alone could be seen through the tangled crusted hair beneath the brim of the rusted iron cap that served as a helmet thomas was six feet in height the length of a bow but he was dwarfed by beggar whose vast chest strained at a leather jerkin studded with metal plates at the giants waist suspended by two lengths of rope were a sword and a morningstar the sword had no scabbard and its edge was chipped while one of the spikes on the big metal ball of the morningstar was bent and smeared with blood and hair the weapons threefoot haft banged against the giants bare legs as he lurched towards eleanor pretty he said pretty beggar down boy down dickon ordered cheerfully and beggar dutifully twitched away from eleanor though he still gazed at her and made a low growling noise in his throat then a scream made him look towards the nearest burning cottage where the scotsman stripped naked now had been thrust in and out of the fire the prisoners long hair was alight and he frantically beat at the flames as he ran in panicked circles to the amusement of his english captors two other scottish prisoners were squatting nearby held on the ground by drawn swords the thin horseman watched as an archer swathed the prisoners hair in a piece of sacking to extinguish the flames how many of you are there the thin man asked thousands the scotsman answered defiantly the horseman leaned on his saddles pommel how many thousands culls the scotsman his beard and hair smoking and his naked skin blackened by embers and lacerated by cuts did his best to look defiant more than enough to take you back home in a cage he shouldnt say that to scarecrow dickon said amused he shouldnt say that scarecrow thomas asked it seemed an appropriate nickname for the horseman with the black axe badge was lean poor and frightening he be sir geoffrey carr to you cully dickon said watching the scarecrow admiringly and who is sir geoffrey carr thomas asked he be scarecrow and he be lord of lackby dickon said in a tone which suggested everyone knew who sir geoffrey carr was and he be having his scarecrow games now dickon grinned because sir geoffrey the whip coiled at his waist again had dropped down from his horse and with a drawn knife approached the scottish prisoner hold him down sir geoffrey ordered the archers hold him down and spread his legs non eleanor cried in protest pretty beggar said in his voice that rumbled deep inside his huge chest the scotsman screamed and tried to pull himself away but he was tripped then held down by three archers while the man evidently known throughout the north as the scarecrow knelt between his legs somewhere in the clearing fog a raven cawed a handful of archers was staring north in case the scots returned but most were watching the scarecrow and his knife you want to keep your shrivelled collops sir geoffrey asked the scotsman then tell me how many there are of you fifteen thousand sixteen the scotsman was suddenly eager to talk he means ten or eleven thousand sir geoffrey announced to the listening archers which is more than enough for our few arrows and is your bastard king here the scotsman bridled at that but a touch of the knife blade to his groin reminded him of his predicament david bruce is here aye who else the desperate scotsman named his armys other leaders the kings nephew and heir to his throne lord robert stewart was with the invading army as were the earls of moray of march of wigtown fife and menteith he named others clan chiefs and wild men from the wastelands of the far north but carr was more interested in two of the earls fife and menteith he asked theyre here aye sir they are but they swore fealty to king edward sir geoffrey said evidently disbelieving the man they march with us now the scotsman insisted as does douglas of liddesdale that ripe bastard sir geoffrey said that shit of hell he stared northwards through the fog shredding from the ridge which was being revealed as a narrow and rocky plateau running north and south the pasture on the plateau was thin and the ridges weathered stone protruded through the grass like the ribs of a starving man off to the northeast beyond the valley of mist the cathedral and castle of durham reared up on their riverlapped crag while to the west were hills and woods and stonewalled fields cut with small streams two buzzards sailed above the ridge going towards the scottish army that was still concealed by the fog which lingered to the north but thomas was thinking that it would not be long before troops came to find the men who had run their fellow scots away from the crossroads sir geoffrey leaned back and went to return his knife to its scabbard then seemed to remember something and grinned at the prisoner you were going to take me back to scotland in a cage is that right no but you were and why would i want to see scotland i can peer down a jakes whenever i want he spat at the prisoner then nodded at the archers hold him no the scotsman shouted then the shout turned to a terrible scream as sir geoffrey leaned forward with the knife again the prisoner twitched and heaved as the scarecrow the front of his padded gambeson now sheeted with blood stood up the prisoner was still screaming hands clutched to his bloody groin and the sight brought a smile to the scarecrows lips throw the rest of him into the fire he said then turned to look at the other two scottish prisoners who is your master he demanded of them they hesitated then one licked his lips we serve douglas he said proudly i hate douglas i hate every douglas that ever dropped out of the devils backside sir geoffrey shuddered then turned to his horse burn them both he ordered thomas looking away from the sudden blood had seen a stone cross fallen at the crossroads centre he stared at it not seeing the carved dragon but hearing the echoes of the noise and then the new screams as the prisoners were hurled into the flames eleanor ran to him and held his arm tight pretty beggar said here beggar here sir geoffrey called hoist me the giant made a step with his hands and sir geoffrey used it to climb into his saddle then he kicked the horse towards thomas and eleanor im always hungry sir geoffrey said after a gelding he turned to watch the fire where one of the scotsmen hair flaming tried to escape but was prodded back into the inferno by a dozen bowstaves the mans howl was abruptly cut short as he collapsed im in the mood to geld and burn scotsmen today sir geoffrey said and you look like a scot to me boy im not a boy thomas said the anger rising in him you look like a bloody boy to me boy a scots boy maybe sir geoffrey plainly amused by thomass temper grinned at his newest victim who did indeed look young though thomas was twentytwo summers old and had fought for the last four of them in brittany normandy and picardy you look scots boy the scarecrow said daring thomas to defy him again all the scots are black he appealed to the crowd to judge thomass complexion and it was true that thomas had a sundarkened skin and black hair but so did a score or more of the scarecrows own archers and though thomas looked young he also looked hard his hair was cropped close to his skull and four years of war had hollowed his cheeks but there was still something distinctive in his looks a handsomeness that attracted the eye and served to spur sir geoffrey carrs jealousy whats on your horse sir geoffrey jerked his head towards thomass mare nothing of yours thomas said whats mine is mine boy and whats yours is mine if i want it mine to take or mine to give beggar you want that girl beggar grinned behind his beard and jerked his head up and down pretty he said he scratched at the lice in his beard beggar likes pretty i reckon you can have the pretty when im through with her sir geoffrey said with a grin and he took the whip from where it hung at his waist and cracked it in the air thomas saw that the long leather thong had a small iron claw at its end sir geoffrey grinned at thomas again then drew back the whip as a threat strip her beggar he said lets give the boys a bit of pleasure and he was still grinning as thomas swung his heavy bowstave hard into the teeth of sir geoffreys horse and the animal reared up screaming as thomas knew it would and the scarecrow unready for the motion fell backwards flailing for balance and his men who should have protected him were so intent on the burning scottish prisoners that not one drew a bow or a blade before thomas had dragged sir geoffrey down from the saddle and had him on the ground with a knife at his throat ive been killing men for four years thomas said and not all of them were frenchmen thomas eleanor screamed take her beggar take her sir geoffrey shouted he heaved up but thomas was an archer and years of drawing his big black bow had given him extraordinary strength in the arms and chest and sir geoffrey could not budge him so he spat at thomas instead take her beggar he yelled again the scarecrows men ran towards their master but checked when they saw that thomas had a knife at his captives throat strip her beggar strip the pretty well all have her sir geoffrey bawled apparently oblivious of the blade at his gullet who reads here who reads father hobbe bellowed the odd question checked everyone even beggar who had already snatched off eleanors hat and now had his huge left arm around her neck while his right hand gripped the neckline of her frock who in this company can read father hobbe demanded again as he brandished the parchment he had taken from one of the sacks on the back of thomass horse this is a letter from my lord the bishop of durham who is with our lord the king in france and it is sent to john fossor prior of durham and only englishmen who have fought with our king would carry such a letter we have brought it from france it proves nothing sir geoffrey shouted then spat at thomas again as the blade was pressed hard into his throat and in what language is this letter written a new horseman had spurred through the scarecrows men he wore no surcoat or jupon but the badge on his battered shield was a scallop shell on a cross and it proclaimed that he was not one of sir geoffreys followers what language he asked once more latin thomas said his knife still pressing hard into sir geoffreys neck let sir geoffrey up the newcomer commanded thomas and i shall read the letter tell him to let my woman go thomas snarled the horseman looked surprised at being given an order by a mere archer but he did not protest instead he urged his horse towards beggar let her go he said and when the big man did not obey he half drew his sword you want me to crop your ears beggar is that it two ears gone then your nose then your cock is that what you want beggar you want to be shorn like a summer ewe trimmed down like an elf let her go beggar sir geoffrey said sullenly beggar obeyed and stepped back and the horseman leaned down from his saddle to take the letter from father hobbe let sir geoffrey go the newcomer ordered thomas for we shall have peace between englishmen today at least for a day the horseman was an old man at least fifty years old with a great shock of white hair that looked as though it had never been close to a brush or comb he was a large man tall and bigbellied on a sturdy horse that had no trapper but only a tattered saddle cloth the mans fulllength mail coat was sadly rusted in places and torn in others while over the coat he had a breastplate that had lost two of its straps a long sword hung at his right thigh he looked to thomas like a yeoman farmer who had ridden to war with whatever equipment his neighbours could lend him but he had been recognized by sir geoffreys archers who had snatched off their hats and helmets when he appeared and who now treated him with deference even sir geoffrey seemed cowed by the whitehaired man who frowned as he read the letter thesaurus eh he was speaking to himself and a fine kettle of fish that is a thesaurus indeed thesaurus was latin but the rest of his words were spoken in norman french and he was evidently confident that no archer would understand him mention of treasure thomas used the same language which had been taught to him by his father makes men excited overexcited good lord above good lord indeed you speak french miracles never cease thesaurus it does mean treasure doesnt it my latin is not what it was when i was young i had it flogged into me by a priest and it seems to have mostly leaked out since a treasure eh and you speak french the horseman showed genial surprise that thomas spoke the language of aristocrats though sir geoffrey who did not speak french looked alarmed for it suggested thomas might be a good deal better born than he had thought the horseman gave the letter back to father hobbe then spurred to sir geoffrey you were picking a squabble with an englishman sir geoffrey a messenger no less from our lord the king how do you explain that i dont have to explain anything sir geoffrey said my lord the last two words were added reluctantly i should fillet you now his lordship said mildly then have you stuffed and mounted on a pole to scare the crows away from my newly born lambs i could show you at skipton fair sir geoffrey as an example to other sinners he seemed to consider that idea for a few heartbeats then shook his head just get on your horse he said and fight the scots today instead of quarrelling with your fellow englishman he turned in his saddle and raised his voice so all the archers and menatarms could hear him all of you back down the ridge and quick before the scots come and drive you off you want to join those rascals in the fire he pointed to the three scottish prisoners who were now nothing but dark shrivelled shapes in the bright flames then he beckoned thomas and changed his language to french youve really come from france yes my lord then do me the courtesy my dear fellow of speaking with me they went south leaving a broken stone cross burned men and arrowstruck corpses in a thinning mist where the army of scotland had come to durham bernard de taillebourg took the crucifix from about his neck and kissed the writhing figure of christ that was pinned to the small wooden cross god be with you my brother he murmured to the old man lying on the stone bench cushioned by a palliasse of straw and a folded blanket a second blanket just as thin covered the old man whose hair was white and wispy it is cold brother hugh collimore said feebly so cold he spoke in french though to de taillebourg the old monks accent was barbarous for it was the french of normandy and of englands norman rulers winter comes de taillebourg said you can smell it on the wind i am dying brother collimore turned his redrimmed eyes on his visitor and can smell nothing who are you take this de taillebourg said and gave his crucifix to the old monk then he stoked up the wood fire put two more logs on the revived blaze and sniffed a jug of mulled wine that sat in the hearth it was not too rank and so he poured some into a horn cup at least you have a fire he said stooping to peer through the small window no bigger than an arrow slit that faced west across the encircling wear the monks hospital was on the slope of durhams hill beneath the cathedral and de taillebourg could see the scottish menatarms carrying their lances through the straggling remnants of mist on the skyline few of the mailclad men had horses he noticed suggesting that the scots planned to fight on foot brother collimore his face pale and his voice frail gripped the small cross the dying are allowed a fire he said as though he had been accused of indulging himself in luxury who are you i come from cardinal bessieres de taillebourg said in paris and he sends you his greetings drink this it will warm you he held the mulled wine towards the old man collimore refused the wine his eyes were cautious cardinal bessieres he asked his tone implying that the name was new to him the popes legate in france de taillebourg was surprised that the monk did not recognize the name but thought perhaps the dying mans ignorance would be useful and the cardinal is a man the dominican went on who loves the church as fiercely as he loves god if he loves the church collimore said with a surprising force then he will use his influence to persuade the holy father to take the papacy back to rome the statement exhausted him and he closed his eyes he had never been a big man but now beneath his liceridden blanket he seemed to have shrunk to the size of a tenyearold and his white hair was thin and fine like a small infants let him move the papacy to rome he said again though feebly for all our troubles have worsened since it was moved to avignon cardinal bessieres wants nothing more than to move the holy father back to rome de taillebourg lied and perhaps you brother can help us achieve that brother collimore appeared not to hear the words he had opened his eyes again but just lay gazing up at the whitewashed stones of the arched ceiling the room was low chill and white sometimes when the summer sun was high he could see the flicker of reflected water on the white stones in heaven he thought he would be forever within sight of crystal rivers and under a warm sun i was in rome once he said wistfully i remember going down some steps into a church where a choir sang so beautiful the cardinal wants your help de taillebourg said there was a saint there collimore was frowning trying to remember her bones were yellow so the cardinal sent me to see you brother de taillebourg said softly his servant darkeyed and elegant watched from the door cardinal bessieres brother collimore said in a whisper he sends you his greetings in christ brother what bessieres wants collimore said still in a whisper he takes with whips and scorpions de taillebourg half smiled so collimore did know of cardinal bessieres after all and no wonder but perhaps fear of bessieres would be sufficient to elicit the truth the monk had closed his eyes again and his lips were moving silently suggesting he was praying de taillebourg did not disturb the prayers but just gazed through the small window to where the scots were making their battle line on the far hill the invaders faced southwards so that the left end of their line was nearest to the city and de taillebourg could see men jostling for position as they tried to take the places of honour closest to their lords the scots had evidently decided to fight on foot so that the english archers could not destroy their menatarms by cutting down their horses there was no sign of those english yet though from all de taillebourg had heard they could not have assembled a great force their army was in france outside calais not here so perhaps it was merely a local lord leading his retainers yet plainly there were enough men to persuade the scots to form a battle line and de taillebourg did not expect davids army to be delayed for long which meant that if he wanted to hear the old mans story and be away from durham before the scots entered the city then he had best make haste he looked back at the monk cardinal bessieres wants only the glory of the church and of god and he wants to know about father ralph vexille dear god collimore said and his fingers traced the bone figure on the small crucifix as he opened his eyes and turned his head to stare at the priest the monks expression suggested it was the first time he had really noticed de taillebourg and he shuddered recognizing in his visitor a man who believed suffering gave merit a man collimore reflected who would be as implacable as his master in paris vexille collimore said as though he had almost forgotten the name and then he sighed it is a long tale he said tiredly then i will tell you what i know of it de taillebourg said the gaunt dominican was pacing the room now turning and turning again in the small space under the highest part of the arched ceiling you have heard he demanded that a battle was fought in picardy in the summer edward of england fought his cousin of france and a man came from the south to fight for france and on his banner was the device of a yale holding a cup collimore blinked but said nothing his eyes were fixed on de taillebourg who in turn stopped his pacing to look at the priest a yale holding a cup he repeated i know the beast collimore said sadly a yale was an heraldic animal unknown in nature clawed like a lion horned like a goat and scaled like a dragon he came from the south de taillebourg said and he thought that by fighting for france he would wash from his familys crest the ancient stains of heresy and of treason brother collimore was far too sick to see that the priests servant was now listening intently almost fiercely or to notice that the dominican had raised his voice slightly to make it easier for the servant who still stood in the doorway to overhear this man came from the south riding in pride believing his soul to be beyond reproof but no man is beyond gods reach he thought he would ride in victory into the kings affections but instead he shared frances defeat god will sometimes humble us brother before raising us to glory de taillebourg spoke to the old monk but his words were for his servants ears and after the battle brother when france wept i found this man and he talked of you brother collimore looked startled but said nothing he talked of you father de taillebourg said to me and i am an inquisitor brother collimores fingers fluttered in an attempt to make the sign of the cross the inquisition he said feebly has no authority in england the inquisition has authority in heaven and in hell and you think little england can stand against us the fury in de taillebourgs voice echoed in the hospital cell to root out heresy brother we will ride to the ends of the earth the inquisition like the dominican order of friars was dedicated to the eradication of heresy and to do it they employed fire and pain they could not shed blood for that was against the law of the church but any pain inflicted without bloodletting was permitted and the inquisition knew well that fire cauterized bleeding and that the rack did not pierce a heretics skin and that great weights pressed on a mans chest burst no veins in cellars reeking of fire fear urine and smoke in a darkness shot through with flamelight and the screams of heretics the inquisition hunted down the enemies of god and by the application of bloodless pain brought their souls into a blessed unity with christ a man came from the south de taillebourg said to collimore again and the crest on his shield was a yale holding a cup a vexille collimore said a vexille de taillebourg said who knew your name now why brother would a heretic from the southern lands know the name of an english monk in durham brother collimore sighed they all knew he said tiredly the whole family knew they knew because ralph vexille was sent to me the bishop thought i could cure him of madness but his family feared he would tell me secrets instead they wanted him dead but we locked him away in a cell where no one but i could reach him and what secrets did he tell you de taillebourg asked madness brother collimore said just madness the servant stood in the doorway and watched him tell me of the madness the dominican ordered the mad speak of a thousand things brother collimore said they speak of spirits and phantoms of snow in summer and darkness in the daylight but father ralph spoke to you of the grail de taillebourg said flatly he spoke of the grail brother collimore confirmed the dominican let out a sigh of relief what did he tell you of the grail hugh collimore said nothing for a while his chest rose and fell so feebly that the motion was scarcely visible then he shook his head he told me that his family had owned the grail and that he had stolen and hidden it but he spoke of a hundred such things a hundred such things where would he have hidden it de taillebourg enquired he was mad mad it was my job you know to look after the mad we starved or beat them to drive the devils out but it did not always work in winter we would plunge them into the river through the ice and that worked devils hate the cold it worked with ralph vexille or mostly it worked we released him after a while the demons were gone you see where did he hide the grail de taillebourgs voice was harder and louder brother collimore stared at the flicker of reflected water light on the ceiling he was mad he whispered but he was harmless harmless and when he left here he was sent to a parish in the south in the far south at hookton in dorset at hookton in dorset brother collimore agreed where he had a son he was a great sinner you see even though he was a priest he had a son father de taillebourg stared at the monk who had at last given him some news a son what do you know of the son nothing brother collimore sounded surprised that he should be asked and what do you know of the grail de taillebourg probed i know that ralph vexille was mad collimore said in a whisper de taillebourg sat on the hard bed how mad collimores voice became even softer he said that even if you found the grail then you would not know it not unless you were worthy he paused and a look of puzzlement almost amazement showed briefly on his face you had to be worthy he said to know what the grail was but if you were worthy then it would shine like the very sun it would dazzle you de taillebourg leaned close to the monk you believed him i believe ralph vexille was mad brother collimore said the mad sometimes speak truth de taillebourg said i think brother collimore went on as though the inquisitor had not spoken that god gave ralph vexille a burden too great for him to bear the grail de taillebourg asked could you bear it i could not so where is it de taillebourg persisted where is it brother collimore looked puzzled again how would i know it was not at hookton de taillebourg said guy vexille searched for it guy vexille brother collimore asked the man who came from the south brother to fight for france and ended in my custody poor man the monk said father de taillebourg shook his head i merely showed him the rack let him feel the pincers and smell the smoke then i offered him life and he told me all he knew and he told me the grail was not at hookton the old monks face twitched in a smile you did not hear me father if a man is unworthy then the grail would not reveal itself guy vexille could not have been worthy but father ralph did possess it de taillebourg sought reassurance you think he really possessed it i did not say as much the monk said but you believe he did de taillebourg asked and when brother collimore said nothing he nodded to himself you do believe he did he slipped off the bed going to his knees and a look of awe came to his face as his linked hands clawed at each other the grail he said in a tone of utter wonder he was mad brother collimore warned him de taillebourg was not listening the grail he said again le graal he was clutching himself now rocking back and forth in ecstasy le graal the mad say things brother collimore said and they do not know what they say or god speaks through them de taillebourg said fiercely then god sometimes has a terrible tongue the old monk replied you must tell me de taillebourg insisted all that father ralph told you but it was so long ago it is le graal de taillebourg shouted and in his frustration he shook the old man it is le graal dont tell me you have forgotten he glanced through the window and saw raised on the far ridge the red saltire on the yellow banner of the scottish king and beneath it a mass of greymailed men with their thicket of lances pikes and spears no english foe was in sight but de taillebourg would not have cared if all the armies of christendom were come to durham for he had found his vision it was the grail and though the world should tremble with armies all about him he would pursue it and an old monk talked the horseman with the rusted mail brokenstrapped breastplate and scallopdecorated shield named himself as lord outhwaite of witcar do you know the place he asked thomas witcar my lord ive not heard of it not heard of witcar dear me and its such a pleasant place very pleasant good soil sweet water fine hunting ah there you are this last was to a small boy mounted on a large horse and leading a second destrier by the reins the boy wore a jupon that had the scalloped cross emblazoned in yellow and red and tugging the warhorse behind him he spurred towards his master sorry my lord the boy said but hereward do haul away he do hereward was evidently the destrier he led and he hauled me clean away from you give him to this young man here lord outhwaite said you can ride he added earnestly to thomas yes my lord hereward is a handful though a rare handful kick him hard to let him know whos master a score of men appeared in lord outhwaites livery all mounted and all with armour in better repair than their masters lord outhwaite turned them back south we were marching on durham he told thomas just minding our own affairs as good christians should and the wretched scots appeared we wont make durham now i was married there you know in the cathedral thirtytwo years ago can you credit it he beamed happily at thomas and my dear margaret still lives god be praised shed like to hear your tale you really were at wadicourt i was my lord fortunate you fortunate you lord outhwaite said then hailed yet more of his men to turn them about before they blundered into the scots thomas was rapidly coming to realize that lord outhwaite despite his ragged mail and dishevelled appearance was a great lord one of the magnates of the north country and his lordship confirmed this opinion by grumbling that he had been forbidden by the king to fight in france because he and his men might be needed to fend off an invasion by the scots and he was quite right lord outhwaite sounded surprised the wretches have come south did i tell you my eldest boy was in picardy thats why im wearing this he plucked at a rent in the old mail coat i gave him the best armour we had because i thought we wouldnt need it here young david of scotland always seemed peaceable enough to me but now englands overrun by his fellows is it true that the slaughter at wadicourt was vast it was a field of dead my lord theirs not ours god and his saints be thanked his lordship looked across at some archers straggling southwards dont dawdle he called in english the scots will be looking for you soon enough he looked back to thomas and grinned so what would you have done if i hadnt come along he asked still using english cut the scarecrows throat if i had to and had your own slit by his men lord outhwaite observed cheerfully hes a poisonous tosspot god only knows why his mother didnt drown him at birth but then she was a goddamned turdhearted witch if ever there was one like many lords who had grown up speaking french lord outhwaite had learned his english from his parents servants and so spoke it coarsely he deserves a slit throat the scarecrow does but hes a bad enemy to have he holds a grudge better than any man alive but he has so many grudges that maybe he dont have room for one more he hates sir william douglas most of all why because willie had him prisoner mind you willie douglas has held most of us prisoner at one time or another and one or two of us have even held him in return but the ransom near killed sir geoffrey hes down to his last score of retainers and id be surprised if hes got more than three halfpennies in a pot the scarecrows a poor man very poor but hes proud and that makes him a bad enemy to have lord outhwaite paused to raise a genial hand to a group of archers wearing his livery wonderful fellows wonderful so tell me about the battle at wadicourt is it true that the french rode down their own archers they did my lord genoese crossbowmen so tell me all that happened lord outhwaite had received a letter from his eldest son that told of the battle in picardy but he was desperate to hear of the fight from someone who had stood on that long green slope between the villages of wadicourt and crecy and thomas now told how the enemy had attacked late in the afternoon and how the arrows had flown down the hill to cut the king of frances great army into heaps of screaming men and horses and how some of the enemy had still come through the line of newly dug pits and past the arrows to hack at the english menatarms and how by the battles end there were no arrows left just archers with bleeding fingers and a long hill of dying men and animals the very sky had seemed rinsed with blood the telling of the tale took thomas down off the ridge and out of sight of durham eleanor and father hobbe walked behind leading the mare and sometimes interjecting with their own comments while a score of lord outhwaites retainers rode on either side to listen to the battles tale thomas told it well and it ryas plain lord outhwaite liked him thomas of hookton had always possessed a charm that had protected and recommended him even though it sometimes made men like sir geoffrey carr jealous sir geoffrey had ridden ahead and when thomas reached the water meadows where the english force gathered the knight pointed at him as if he were launching a curse and thomas countered by making the sign of the cross sir geoffrey spat lord outhwaite scowled at the scarecrow i have not forgotten the letter your priest showed me he spoke to thomas in french now but i trust you will not leave us to deliver it to durham yourself not while we have enemies to fight can i stand with your lordships archers thomas asked eleanor hissed her disapproval but both men ignored her lord outhwaite nodded his acceptance of thomass offer then gestured that the younger man should climb down from the horse one thing does puzzle me though he went on and that is why our lord the king should entrust such an errand to one so young and so base born thomas asked with a smile knowing that was the real question lord outhwaite had been too fastidious to ask his lordship laughed to be found out you speak french young man but carry a bow what are you base or well born well enough my lord but out of wedlock ah and the answer to your question my lord is that our lord the king sent me with one of his chaplains and a household knight but both caught a sickness in london and that is where they remain i came on with my companions because you were eager to speak with this old monk if he lives yes because he can tell me about my fathers family my family and he can tell you about this treasure this thesaurus you know of it i know something of it my lord thomas said cautiously which is why the king sent you eh lord outhwaite queried but did not give thomas time to answer the question he gathered his reins fight with my archers young man but take care to stay alive eh i would like to know more of your thesaurus is the treasure really as great as the letter says thomas turned away from the raggedhaired lord outhwaite and stared up the ridge where there was nothing to be seen now except the brightleaved trees and a thinning plume of smoke from the burnedout hovels if it exists my lord he spoke in french then it is the kind of treasure that is guarded by angels and sought by demons and you seek it lord outhwaite asked with a smile thomas returned the smile i merely seek the prior of durham my lord to give him the bishops letter you want prior fossor eh lord outhwaite nodded towards a group of monks thats him over there the one in the saddle he had indicated a tall whitehaired monk who was astride a grey mare and surrounded by a score of other monks all on foot one of whom carried a strange banner that was nothing but a white scrap of cloth hanging from a painted pole talk to him lord outhwaite said then seek my flag god be with you he said the last four words in english and with your lordship thomas and father hobbe answered together thomas walked towards the prior threading his way through archers who clustered about three wagons to receive spare sheaves of arrows the small english army had been marching towards durham on two separate roads and now the men straggled across fields to come together in case the scots descended from the high ground menatarms hauled mail coats over their heads and the richer among them buckled on whatever pieces of plate armour they owned the armys leaders must have had a swift conference for the first standards were being carried northwards showing that the english wanted to confront the scots on the higher ground of the ridge rather than be attacked in the water meadows or try to reach durham by a circuitous route thomas had become accustomed to the english banners in brittany normandy and picardy but these flags were all strange to him a silver crescent a brown cow a blue lion the scarecrows black axe a red boars head lord outhwaites scallopemblazoned cross and gaudiest of all a great scarlet flag showing a pair of crossed keys thickly embroidered in gold and silver threads the priors flag looked shabby and cheap compared to all those other banners for it was nothing but a small square of frayed cloth beneath which the prior was working himself into a frenzy go and do gods work he shouted at some nearby archers for the scots are animals animals cut them down kill them all god will reward each death go and smite them kill them he saw thomas approaching you want a blessing my son then god give strength to your how and add bite to your arrows may your arm never tire and your eye never dim god and the saints bless you while you kill thomas crossed himself then held out the letter i came to give you this sir he said the prior seemed astonished that an archer should address him so familiarly let alone have a letter for him and at first he did not take the parchment but one of his monks snatched it from thomas and seeing the broken seal raised his eyebrows my lord the bishop writes to you he said they are animals the prior repeated still caught up in his peroration then he realized what the monk had said my lord bishop writes to you brother the monk said the prior seized the painted pole and dragged the makeshift banner down so it hung near to thomass face you may kiss it he said grandly kiss it thomas was quite taken aback the ragged cloth now it was close by his nose smelt musty it is st cuthberts corporax cloth the prior said excitedly taken from his tomb my son the blessed st cuthbert will fight for us the very angels of heaven will follow him into the battle thomas faced with the saints relic went to his knees and drew the cloth to his lips it was linen he thought and now he could see it was embroidered about its edge with an intricate pattern in faded blue thread in the centre of the cloth which was used during mass to hold the wafers was an elaborate cross embroidered in silver threads that scarcely showed against the frayed white linen it is really st cuthberts cloth he asked his alone the prior exclaimed we opened his tomb in the cathedral this very morning and we prayed to him and he will fight for us today the prior jerked the flag up and waved it towards some menatarms who spurred their horses northwards perform gods work kill them all dung the fields with their noxious flesh water it with their treacherous blood the bishop wants this young man to speak with brother hugh collimore the monk who had read the letter now told the prior and the king wishes it too his lordship says there is a treasure to be found the king wishes it the prior looked in astonishment at thomas the king wishes it he asked again and then he came to his senses and realized there was great advantage in royal patronage and so he snatched the letter and read it himself only to find even more advantage than he had anticipated you come in search of a great thesaurus he asked thomas suspiciously so the bishop believes sir thomas responded what treasure the prior snapped and all the monks gaped at him as the notion of a treasure momentarily made them forget the proximity of the scottish army the treasure sir thomas avoided giving a truthful answer is known to brother collimore but why send you the prior asked and it was a fair question for thomas looked young and possessed no apparent rank because i have some knowledge of the matter too thomas said wondering if he had said too much the prior folded the letter inadvertently tearing off the seal as he did so and thrust it into a pouch that hung from his knotted belt we shall talk after the battle he said and then and only then i shall decide whether you may see brother collimore he is sick you know ailing poor soul maybe he is dying it may not be seemly for you to disturb him we shall see we shall see he plainly wanted to talk to the old monk himself and so be the sole possessor of whatever knowledge collimore might have god bless you my son the prior dismissed thomas then hoisted his sacred banner and hurried north most of the english army was already climbing the ridge leaving only their wagons and a crowd of women children and those men too sick to walk the monks making a procession behind their corporax cloth began to sing as they followed the soldiers thomas ran to a cart and took a sheaf of arrows which he thrust into his belt he could see that lord outhwaites menatarms were riding towards the ridge followed by a large group of archers maybe the two of you should stay here he said to father hobbe no eleanor said and you should not be fighting not fight thomas asked it is not your battle eleanor insisted we should go to the city we should find the monk thomas paused he was thinking of the priest who in the swirl of fog and smoke had killed the scotsman and then spoken to him in french i am a messenger the priest had said je suis un avantcoureur had been his exact words and an avantcoureur was more than a mere messenger a herald perhaps an angel even thomas could not drive away the image of that silent fight the men so ill matched a soldier against a priest yet the priest had won and then had turned his gaunt bloodied face on thomas and announced himself je suis un avantcoureur it was a sign thomas thought and he did not want to believe in signs and visions he wanted to believe in his bow he thought perhaps eleanor was right and that the conflict with its unexpected victor was a sign from heaven that he should follow the avantcoureur into the city but there were also enemies up on the hill and he was an archer and archers did not walk away from a battle well go to the city he said after the fight why she demanded fiercely but thomas would not explain he just started walking climbing a hill where larks and finches flitted through the hedges and fieldfares brown and grey called from the empty pastures the fog was all gone and a drying wind blew across the wear and then from where the scots waited on the higher ground the drums began to beat sir william douglas knight of liddesdale prepared himself for battle he pulled on leather breeches thick enough to thwart a sword cut and over his linen shirt he hung a crucifix that had been blessed by a priest in santiago de compostela where st james was buried sir william douglas was not a particularly religious man but he paid a priest to look after his soul and the priest had assured sir william that wearing the crucifix of st james the son of thunder would ensure he received the last rites safe in his own bed about his waist he tied a strip of red silk that had been torn from one of the banners captured from the english at bannockburn the silk had been dipped in the holy water of the font in the chapel of sir williams castle at hermitage and sir william had been persuaded that the scrap of silk would ensure victory over the old and much hated enemy he vore a haubergeon taken from an englishman killed in one of sir williams many raids south of the border sir william remembered that killing well he had seen the quality of the englishmans haubergeon at the very beginning of the fight and he had bellowed at his men to leave the fellow alone then he had cut the man down by striking at his ankles and the englishman on his knees had made a mewing sound that had made sir williams men laugh the man had surrendered but sir william had cut his throat anyway because he thought any man who made a mewing sound was not a real warrior it had taken the servants at hermitage two weeks to wash the blood out of the fine mesh of the mail most of the scottish leaders were dressed in hauberks which covered a mans body from neck to calves while the haubergeon was much shorter and left the legs unprotected but sir william intended to fight on foot and he knew that a hauberks weight wearied a man quickly and tired men were easily killed over the haubergeon he wore a fulllength surcoat that showed his badge of the red heart his helmet was a sallet lacking any visor or face protection but in battle sir william liked to see what his enemies to the left and right were doing a man in a full helm or in one of the fashionable pigsnouted visors could see nothing except what the slit right in front of his eyes let him see which was why men in visored helmets spent the battle jerking their heads left and right left and right like a chicken among foxes and they twitched until their necks were sore and even then they rarely saw the blow that crushed their skulls sir william in battle looked for men whose heads were jerking like hens back and forth for he knew they were nervous men who could afford a fine helmet and thus pay a finer ransom he carried his big shield it was really too heavy for a man on foot but he expected the english to loose their archery storm and the shield was thick enough to absorb the crashing impact of yardlong steelpointed arrows he could rest the foot of the shield on the ground and crouch safe behind it and when the english ran out of arrows he could always discard it he carried a spear in case the english horsemen charged and a sword which was his favourite killing weapon the swords hilt encased a scrap of hair cut from the corpse of st andrew or at least that was what the pardoner who had sold sir william the scrap had claimed robbie douglas sir williams nephew wore mail and a sallet and carried a sword and shield it had been robbie who had brought sir william the news that jamie douglas robbies older brother had been killed presumably by the dominican priests servant or perhaps father de taillebourg had done the killing certainly he must have ordered it robbie douglas twenty years old had wept for his brother how could a priest do it robbie had demanded of his uncle you have a strange idea of priests robbie sir william had said most priests are weak men given gods authority and that makes them dangerous i thank god no douglas has ever put on a priests robe were all too honest when this day s done uncle robbie douglas said youll let me go after that priest sir william smiled he might not be an overtly religious man but he did hold one creed sacred and that was that any family members murder must be avenged and robbie he reckoned would do vengeance well he was a good young man hard and handsome tall and straightforward and sir william was proud of his youngest sisters son well talk at days end sir william promised him but till then robbie stay close to me vagabondpartfm i will uncle well kill a good few englishmen god willing sir william said then led his nephew to meet the king and to receive the blessing of the royal chaplains sir william like most of the scottish knights and chieftains was in mail but the king wore frenchmade plate a thing so rare north of the border that men from the wild tribes came to stare at this sunreflecting creature made of moving metal the young king seemed just as impressed for he took off his surcoat and walked up and down admiring himself and being admired as his lords came for a blessing and to offer advice the earl of moray whom sir william believed was a fool wanted to fight on horseback and the king was tempted to agree his father the great robert the bruce had beaten the english at the bannockburn on horseback and not just beaten them but humiliated them the flower of scotland had ridden down the nobility of england and david king now of his fathers country wanted to do the same he wanted blood beneath his hooves and glory attached to his name he wanted his reputation to spread through christendom and so he turned and gazed longingly at his red and yellow painted lance propped against the bough of an elm sir william douglas saw where the king was looking archers he said laconically there were archers at the bannockburn the earl of moray insisted aye and the fools didnt know how to use them sir william said but you cant depend on the english being fools for ever and how many archers can they have the earl asked there are said to be thousands of bowmen in france hundreds more in brittany and as many again in gascony so how many can they have here they have enough sir william growled curtly not bothering to hide the contempt he felt for john randolph third earl of moray the earl was just as experienced in war as sir william but he had spent too long as a prisoner of the english and the consequent hatred made him impetuous the king young and inexperienced wanted to side with the earl whose friend he was but he saw that his other lords were agreeing with sir william who though he held no great title nor position of state was more battlehardened than any man in scotland the earl of moray sensed that he was losing the argument and he urged haste charge now sir he suggested before they can make a battle line he pointed southwards to where the first english troops were appearing in the pastures cut the bastards down before theyre ready that the earl of menteith put in quietly was the advice given to philip of valois in picardy it didnt serve there and it wont serve here besides which sir william douglas remarked caustically we have to contend with stone walls he pointed to the walls which bounded the pastures where the english were beginning to form their line maybe moray can tell us how armoured knights get past stone walls he suggested the earl of moray bridled you take me for a fool douglas i take you as you show yourself john randolph sir william answered gentlemen the king snapped he had not noticed the stone walls when he formed his battle line beside the burning cottages and the fallen cross he had only seen the empty green pastures and the wide road and his even wider dream of glory now he watched the enemy straggle from the far trees there were plenty of archers coming and he had heard how those bowmen could fill the sky with their arrows and how their steel arrow heads drove deep into horses and how the horses then went mad with pain and he dared not lose this battle he had promised his nobles that they would celebrate the feast of christmas in the hall of the english king in london and if he lost then he would lose their respect and encourage some to rebellion he had to win and being impatient he wanted to win quickly if we charge fast enough he suggested tentatively before they all reach their lines then youll break your horses legs on the stone walls sir william said with scant respect for his royal master if your majestys horse even gets that far you cant protect a horse from arrows sir but you can weather the storm on foot put your pikes up front but mix them with menatarms who can use their shields to protect the pikeholders shields up heads down and hold hard thats how we win this the king tugged at the espalier which covered his right shoulder and had an annoying habit of riding up on the top edge of the breastplate traditionally the defence of scottish armies was in the hands of pikemen who used their monstrously long weapons to hold off the enemy knights but pikemen needed both hands to hold their unwieldy blades and so became easy targets for english bowmen who liked to boast that they carried the lives of scottish pikemen in their arrow bags so protect the pikemen with the shields of the menatarms and let the enemy waste their arrows it made sense but it still irked david bruce that he could not lead his horsemen in an earthshaking assault while the trumpets screamed at the heavens sir william saw his kings hesitation and pressed his argument we have to stand sir and we have to wait and we have to let our shields take the arrows but in the end sir theyll tire of wasting shafts and theyll come to the attack and thats when well chop them down like dogs a growl of assent greeted this the scottish lords hard men all armed and armoured bearded and grim were confident that they could win this fight because they so outnumbered the enemy but they also knew there was no short cut to victory not when archers opposed them and so they would have to do what sir william said endure the arrows goad the enemy then give them slaughter the king heard his lords agree with sir william and so reluctantly he abandoned his dream of breaking the enemy with mounted knights that was a disappointment but he looked about his lords and thought that with such men beside him he could not possibly lose we shall fight on foot he decreed and chop them down like dogs we shall slaughter them like whipped puppies and afterwards he thought when the survivors were fleeing southwards the scottish cavalry could finish the slaughter but for now it would be footman against footman and so the war banners of scotland were carried forward and planted across the ridge the burning cottages were mere embers now that cradled three shrunken bodies black and small as children and the king planted his flags close to those dead he had his own standard red saltire on yellow field and the banner of scotlands saint white saltire on blue in the lines centre and to left and right the flags of the lesser lords flew the lion of stewart brandished its blade the randolph falcon spread its wings while to east and west the stars and axes and crosses snapped in the wind the army was arrayed in three divisions called sheltrons and the three sheltrons were so large that the men on the far flanks jostled in towards the centre to keep themselves on the flatter ground of the ridges summit the rearmost ranks of the sheltrons were composed of the tribesmen from the islands and the north men who fought barelegged without metal armour wielding vast swords that could club a man to death as easily as cut him down they were fearsome fighters but their lack of armour made them horribly vulnerable to arrows and so they were placed at the rear and the leading ranks of the three sheltrons were filled by menatarms and pikemen the menatarms carried swords axes maces or warhammers and most important the shields that could protect the pikemen whose weapons were tipped with a spike a hook and an axehead the spike could hold an enemy at bay the hook could haul an armoured man out of the saddle or off his feet and the axe could smash through his mail or plate the line bristled with the pikes that made a steel hedge to greet the english and priests walked along the hedge consecrating the weapons and the men who held them soldiers knelt to receive their blessings a few of the lords like the king himself were mounted but only so that they could see over the heads of their army and those men stared south to see the last of the english troops come into view so few of them such a small army to beat to the left of the scots was durham its towers and ramparts thick with folk watching the battle and in front was this small army of englishmen who did not possess the sense to retreat south towards york they would fight on the ridge instead and the scots had the advantage of position and numbers if you hate them sir william douglas shouted at his men on the right of the scottish battle line then let them hear you the scots bellowed their hatred they clashed swords and spears against their shields they shrieked to the sky and in the lines centre where the kings sheltron waited under the banners of the cross a troop of drummers began to beat huge goatskin drums each drum was a big ring of oak over which was stretched two goat skins that were tightened with ropes until an acorn dropped onto a skin would bounce as high as the hand that had let it go and the drums beaten with withies made a sharp almost metallic sound that filled the sky they made an assault of pure noise if you hate the english let them know the earl of march shouted from the left of the scottish line that lay closest to the city if you hate the english let them know and the roar became louder the clash of spear stave on shield was stronger and the noise of scotlands hate spread across the ridge so that nine thousand men were howling at the three thousand who were foolish enough to confront them we shall cut them down like stalks of barley a priest promised we shall soak the fields with their stinking blood and fill all hell with their english souls their women are yours sir william told his men their wives and their daughters will be your toys tonight he grinned at his nephew robbie youll have your pick of durhams women robbie and londons women robbie said before christmas aye them too sir william promised in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost the kings senior chaplain shouted send them all to hell each and every foul one of them to hell for every englishman you kill today means a thousand less weeks in purgatory if you hate the english lord robert stewart steward of scotland and heir to the throne called let them hear and the noise of that hate was like a thunder that filled the deep valley of the wear and the thunder reverberated from the crag where durham stood and still the noise swelled to tell the whole north country that the scots had come south and david king of those scots was glad that he had come to this place where the dragon cross had fallen and the burning houses smoked and the english waited to be killed for this day he would bring glory to st andrew to the great house of bruce and to scotland thomas father hobbe and eleanor followed the prior and his monks who were still chanting though the brothers voices were now ragged for they were breathless from hurrying st cuthberts corporax cloth swayed to and fro and the banner attracted a straggling procession of women and children who not wanting to wait out of sight of their men carried spare sheaves of arrows up the hill thomas wanted to go faster to get past the monks and find lord outhwaites men but eleanor deliberately hung back until he turned on her angrily you can walk faster he protested in french i can walk faster she said and you can ignore a battle father hobbe leading the horse understood the tone even though he did not comprehend the words he sighed thus earning himself a savage look from eleanor you do not need to fight she went on im an archer thomas said stubbornly and theres an enemy up there your king sent you to find the grail eleanor insisted not to die not to leave me alone me and a baby she had stopped now hands clutching her belly and with tears in her eyes i am to be alone here in england i wont die here thomas said scathingly you know that eleanor was even more scathing god spoke to you perhaps you know what other men do not you know the day of your dying thomas was taken aback by the outburst eleanor was a strong girl not given to tantrums but she was distraught and weeping now those men thomas said the scarecrow and beggar they wont touch you ill be here it isnt them eleanor wailed i had a dream last night a dream thomas put his hands on her shoulders his hands were huge and strengthened by hauling on the hempen string of the big bow i dreamed of the grail last night he said knowing that was not quite true he had not dreamed of the grail rather he had woken to a vision which had turned out to be a deception but he could not tell eleanor that it was golden and beautiful he said like a cup of fire in my dream eleanor said gazing up at him you were dead and your body was all black and swollen what is she saying father hobbe asked she had a bad dream thomas said in english a nightmare the devil sends us nightmares the priest asserted it is well known tell her that thomas translated that for her then he stroked a wisp of golden hair away from her forehead and tucked it under her knitted cap he loved her face so earnest and narrow so catlike but with big eyes and an expressive mouth it was just a nightmare he reassured her un cauchemar the scarecrow eleanor said with a shudder he is the cauchemar thomas drew her into an embrace he wont come near you he promised her he could hear a distant chanting but nothing like the monks solemn prayers this was a jeering insistent chant heavy as the drumbeat that gave it rhythm he could not hear the words but he did not need to the enemy he said to eleanor are waiting for us they are not my enemy she said fiercely if they get into durham thomas retorted then they will not know that they will take you anyway everyone hates the english do you know that the french hate you the bretons hate you the scots hate you every man in christendom hates you and why because you love fighting you do everyone knows that about the english and you you have no need to fight today it is not your quarrel but you cant wait to be there to kill again thomas did not know what to say for there was truth in what eleanor had said he shrugged and picked up his heavy bow i fight for my king and theres an army of enemies on the hill here they outnumber us do you know what will happen if they get into durham i know eleanor said firmly and she did know for she had been in caen when the english archers disobeying their king had swarmed across the bridge and laid the town waste if we dont fight them and stop them here thomas said then their horsemen will hunt us all down one after the other you said you would marry me eleanor declared crying again i dont want my baby to be fatherless i dont want it to be like me she meant illegitimate i will marry you i promise when the battle is done we shall be married in durham in the cathedral yes he smiled at her we can be married in the cathedral eleanor was pleased with the promise but too furious to show her pleasure we should go to the cathedral now she snapped we would be safe there we should pray at the high altar you can go to the city thomas said let me fight my kings enemies and you go to the city you and father hobbe and you find the old monk and you can both talk to him and afterwards you can go to the cathedral and wait for me there he unstrapped one of the big sacks on the mares back and took out his haubergeon which he hauled over his head the leather lining felt stiff and cold and smelt of mould he forced his hands down the sleeves then strapped the sword belt about his waist and hung the weapon on his right side go to the city he told eleanor and talk to the monk eleanor was crying you are going to die she said i dreamed it i cant go to the city father hobbe protested youre a priest thomas barked not a soldier take eleanor to durham find brother collimore and talk to him the prior had insisted that thomas wait and suddenly it seemed very sensible to send father hobbe to talk to the old monk before the prior poisoned his memories both of you thomas insisted talk to brother collimore you know what to ask him and i shall see you there this evening in the cathedral he took his sallet with its broad rim to deflect the downward stroke of a blade and tied it onto his head he was angry with eleanor because he sensed she was right the imminent battle was not his concern except that fighting was his trade and england his country i will not die he told eleanor with an obstinate irrationality and you will see me tonight he tossed the horses reins to father hobbe keep eleanor safe he told the priest the scarecrow wont risk anything inside the monastery or in the cathedral he wanted to kiss eleanor goodbye but she was angry with him and he was angry with her and so he took his bow and his arrow bag and walked away she said nothing for like thomas she was too proud to back away from the quarrel besides she knew she was right this clash with the scots was not thomass fight whereas the grail was his duty father hobbe caught between their obstinacy walked in silence but did note that eleanor turned more than once evidently hoping to catch thomas looking back but all she saw was her lover climbing the path with the great bow across his shoulder it was a huge bow taller than most men and as thick about its belly as an archers wrist it was made from yew thomas was fairly sure it was italian yew though he could never be certain because the raw stave had drifted ashore from a wrecked ship he had shaped the stave leaving the centre thick and he had steamed the tips to curve them against the way the bow would bend when it was drawn he had painted the bow black using svax oil and soot then tipped the two ends of the stave with pieces of pocked antler horn to hold the cord the stave had been cut so that at the belly of the bow where it faced thomas when he drew the hempen string there was hard heartwood which was compressed when the arrow was hauled back while the outer belly was springy sapwood and when he released the cord the heartwood snapped out of its compression and the sapwood pulled it back into shape and between them they sent the arrow hissing with savage force the belly of the bow where his left hand gripped the yew was whipped with hemp and above the hemp which had been stiffened with hoof glue he had nailed a scrap of silver cut from a crushed mass vessel that his father had used in hookton church and the piece of silver cup showed the yale with the grail in its clawed grip the yale came from thomass familys coat of arms though he had not known that when he grew up for his father had never told him the tale he had never told thomas he was a vexille from a family that had been lords of the cathar heretics a family that had been burned out of their home in southern france and which had fled to hide themselves in the darkest corners of christendom thomas knew little of the cathar heresy he knew his bow and he knew how to select an arrow of slender ash or birch or hornbeam and he knew how to fledge the shaft with goose feathers and how to tip it with steel he knew all that yet he did not know how to drive that arrow through shield mail and flesh that was instinct something he had practised since childhood practised till his string fingers were bleeding practised until he no longer thought when he drew the string back to his ear practised until like all archers he was broad across the chest and hugely muscled in his arms he did not need to know how to use a bow it was just an instinct like breathing or waking or fighting he turned when he reached a stand of hornbeams that guarded the upper path like a rampart eleanor was walking stubbornly away and thomas had an urge to shout to her but knew she was already too far off and would not hear him he had quarrelled with her before men and women it seemed to thomas spent half their lives fighting and half loving and the intensity of the first fed the passion of the second and he almost smiled for he recognized eleanors stubbornness and he even liked it and then he turned and walked through the trampled drifts of fallen hornbeam leaves along the path between stonewalled pastures where hundreds of saddled stallions were grazing these were the warhorses of the english knights and menatarms and their presence in the pastures told thomas that the english expected the scots to attack because a knight was far better able to defend himself on foot the horses were kept saddled so that the mailed menatarms could either retreat swiftly or else mount up and pursue a beaten enemy thomas could still not see the scottish army but he could hear their chanting which was given force by the hellish beat of the big drums the sound was making some of the pastured stallions nervous and three of them pursued by pageboys galloped beside the stone wall with their eves showing white more pages were exercising destriers just behind the english line which was divided into three battles each battle had a knot of horsemen at the centre of its rear rank the mounted men being the commanders beneath their bright banners while in front of them were four or five rows of menatarms carrying swords axes spears and shields and ahead of the menatarms and crowded thick in the spaces between the three battles were the archers the scots two arrow shots away from the english were on slightly higher ground and also divided into three divisions which like the english battles were arrayed beneath their clusters of commanders banners the tallest flag the red and yellow royal standard was in the centre the scottish knights and menatarms like the english were on foot but each of their sheltrons was much larger than its opposing english battle three or four times larger but thomas tall enough to look over the english line could see there were not many archers in the enemy ranks here and there along the scottish line he could see some long bow staves and there were a few crossbows visible among the thicket of pikes but there were not nearly so many bowmen as were in the english array though the english in turn were hugely outnumbered by the scottish army so the battle if it ever started would be between arrows and scottish pikes and menatarms and if there were not enough arrows then the ridge must become an english graveyard lord outhwaites banner of the cross and scallop shell was in the lefthand battle and thomas crossed to it the prior dismounted now was in the space between the left and centre divisions where one of his monks swung a censer and another brandished the mass cloth on its painted pole the prior himself was shouting though thomas could not tell whether he called insults at the enemy or prayers to god for the scottish chanting was so loud thomas could not distinguish the enemys words either but the sentiment was plain enough and it was sped on its way by the massive drums thomas could see the huge drums now and observe the passion with which the drummers beat the great skins to make a noise as sharp as snapping bone loud rhythmic and reverberating an assault of earpiercing thunder and in front of the drums at the centre of the enemy line some bearded men whirled in a wild dance they came darting from the rear of the scottish line and they wore no mail or iron but were draped in thick folds of cloth and brandished longbladed swords about their heads and had small round leather shields scarce larger than serving platters strapped to their left forearms behind them the scottish menatarms beat the flats of their sword blades against their shields while the pikemen thumped the ground with the butts of their long weapons to add to the noise of the huge drums the sound was so great that the priors monks had abandoned their chanting and now just gazed at the enemy what they do lord outhwaite on foot like his men had to raise his voice to make himself heard is try to scare us with noise before they kill us his lordship limped whether through age or some old wound thomas did not like to ask it was plain he wanted somewhere he could pace about and kick the turf and so he had come to talk with the monks though now he turned his friendly face on thomas and you want to be most careful of those scoundrels he said pointing at the dancing men because theyre wilder than scalded cats its said they skin their captives alive lord outhwaite made the sign of the cross you dont often see them this far south them thomas asked theyre tribesmen from the farthest north one of the monks explained he was a tall man with a fringe of grey hair a scarred face and only one eye scoundrels they are the monk went on scoundrels they bow down to idols he shook his head sadly ive never journeyed that far north but i hear their land is irouded in perpetual fog and that if a man dies with wound to his back then his woman eats her own jung and throws herself off the cliffs for the shame it truly thomas asked its what ive heard the monk said making the sign the cross they live on birds nests seaweed and raw fish lord outhwaite took up the tale then smiled mind you some of my people in witcar do that but at least they pray to god as well at least i think they do but your folk dont have cloven hooves the monk said staring at the enemy the scots do a much younger monk with a face left horribly scarred by smallpox asked anxiously the clansmen do lord outhwaite said theyre scarcely human he shook his head then held out a hand to the older monk its brother michael isnt it your lordship flatters to remember me the monk answered pleased he was once a manatarms to my lord percy lord outhwaite explained to thomas and a good one before i lost this to the scots brother michael said raising his right arm so that the sleeve of his robe fell to reveal a stump at his wrist and this he pointed to his empty eye socket so now i pray instead of fight turned and gazed at the scottish line they are noisy day he grumbled theyre confident lord outhwaite said placidly and so they should be when was the last time a sottish army outnumbered us they might outnumber us brother michael said but theyve picked a strange place to do it they should have gone to the southern end of the ridge and so they should brother lord outhwaite agreed but let us be grateful for small mercies what brother michael meant was the scots were sacrificing their advantage of numbers by fighting on the narrow ridge top where the english line though thinner and with far fewer men could not be overlapped if the scots had gone further south where the ridge widened as it fell away to the water meadows they could have outflanked their enemy their choice of ground might have been a mistake that helped the english but that was small consolation when thomas tried to estimate the size of the enemy army other men were doing the same and their guesses ranged from six to sixteen thousand though lord outhwaite reckoned there were no more than eight thousand scots which is only three or four times our number he said cheerfully and not enough of them are archers god be thanked for english archers amen brother michael said the smallpoxscarred younger monk was staring in fascination at the thick scottish line ive heard that the scots paint their faces blue i cant see any though lord outhwaite looked astonished you heard what that they paint their faces blue my lord the monk said embarrassed now or maybe they only paint half the face to scare us to scare us his lordship was amused to make us laugh more like ive never seen it nor i brother michael put in its just what ive heard the young monk said theyre frightening enough without paint lord outhwaite pointed to a banner opposite his own part of the line i see sir williams here sir william thomas asked willie douglas lord outhwaite said i was a prisoner of his for two years and im still paying the bankers because of it he meant that his family had borrowed money to pay the ransom i liked him though hes a rogue and hes fighting with moray moray brother michael asked john randolph earl of moray lord outhwaite nodded at another banner close to the redheart flag of douglas they hate each other god knows why theyre together in the line he stared again at the scottish drummers who leaned far back to balance the big instruments against their bellies i hate those drums he said mildly paint their faces blue i never heard such nonsense he chuckled the prior was haranguing the nearest troops now telling them that the scots had destroyed the great religious house at hexham they defiled gods holy church they killed the brethren they have stolen from christ himself and put tears onto the cheeks of god wreak his vengeance show no mercy the nearest archers flexed their fingers licked lips and stared at the enemy who were showing no sign of advancing you will kill them the prior shrieked and god will bless you for it he will shower blessings on you they want us to attack them brother michael remarked drily he seemed embarrassed by his priors passion aye lord outhwaite said and they think well attack on horseback see the pikes theyre good against men on foot too my lord brother michael said that they are that they are lord outhwaite agreed nasty things pikes he fidgeted with some of the loose rings of his mail coat and looked surprised when one of them came away in his fingers i do like willie douglas he said we used to hunt together when i was his prisoner we caught some very fine boar in liddesdale i remember he frowned such noisy drums will we attack them the young monk summoned up the courage to enquire dear me no i do hope not lord outhwaite said were outnumbered much better to hold our ground and let them come to us and if they dont come thomas asked then theyll slink off home with empty pockets lord outhwaite said and they wont like that they wont like it at all theyre only here for plunder thats why they dislike us so much dislike us because theyre here for plunder thomas had not understood his lordships thinking theyre envious young man plain envious we have riches they dont and there are few things more calculated to provoke hatred than such an imbalance i had a neighbour in witcar who seemed a reasonable fellow but then he and his men tried to take advantage of my absence when i was douglass prisoner they tried to ambush the coin for my ransom if you can believe it it was just envy it seems for he was poor and now hes dead my lord thomas asked amused dear me no his lordship said reprovingly hes in a very deep hole in the bottom of my keep deep down with the rats i throw him coins every now and then to remind him why hes there he stood on tiptoe and gazed westwards where the hills were higher he was looking for scottish menatarms riding to make an assault from the south but he saw none his father he said meaning robert the bruce wouldnt be waiting there hed have men riding around our flanks to put the fear of god up our arses but this young pup doesnt know his trade does he hes in the wrong place altogether hes put his faith in numbers brother michael said and perhaps their numbers will suffice lord outhwaite replied gloomily and made the sign of the cross thomas now that he had a chance to see the ground between the armies could understand why lord outhwaite was so scornful of the scottish king who had drawn up his army just south of the burned cottages where the dragon cross had fallen it was not just that the narrowness of the ridge confined the scots denying them a chance to outflank the numerically inferior english but that the illchosen battlefield was obstructed by thick blackthorn hedges and at least one stone wall no army could advance across those obstacles and hope to hold its line intact but the scottish king seemed confident that the english would attack him for he did not move his men shouted insults in the hope of provoking an attack but the english stayed stubbornly in their ranks the scots jeered even louder when a tall man on a great horse rode out from the centre of the english line his stallion had purple ribbons twisted into its black mane and a purple trapper embroidered with goldenkeys that was so long that it swept the ground behind the horses rear hooves the stallions head was protected by a leather face plate on which was mounted a silver horn twisted like a unicorns weapon the rider wore plate armour that was polished bright and had a sleeveless surcoat of purple and gold the same colours displayed by his page standardbearer and the dozen knights who followed him the tall rider had no sword but instead was armed with a great spiked morningstar like the one beggar carried the scottish drummers redoubled their efforts the scots soldiers shouted insults and the english cheered until the tall man raised a mailed hand for silence were to get a homily from his grace lord outhwaite said gloomily very fond of the sound of his own voice is his grace the tall man was evidently the archbishop of york and when the english ranks were silent he again raised his mailed right hand high above his purple plumed helmet and made an extravagant sign of the cross dolninus rohisum he called dominus rohiscum he rode down the line repeating the invocation you will kill gods enemy today he called after each promise that god would be with the english he had to shout to make himself heard over the din of the enemy god is with you and you will do his work by making many widows and orphans you will fill scotland with grief as a just punishment for their godless impiety the lord of hosts is with you gods vengeance is your task the archbishops horse stepped high its head tossing up and down as his grace carried his encouragement out to the flanks of his army the last wisps of mist had long burned away and though there was still a chill in the air the sun had warmth and its light glinted off thousands of scottish blades a pair of onehorse wagons had come from the city and a dozen women were distributing dried herrings bread and skins of ale lord outhwaites squire brought an empty herring barrel so his lordship could sit a man player a reed pipe nearby and brother michael sang an old country song about the badger and the pardoner and lord outhwaite laughed at the words then nodded his head towards the ground between the armies where two horsemen one from each army were meeting i see were being courteous today he remarked an english herald in a gaudy tabard had ridden towards the scots and a priest hastily appointed as scotlands herald had come to greet him the two men bowed from their saddles talked a while then returned to their respective armies the englishman coming near the line spread his hands in a gesture that said the scots were being stubborn they come this far south and wont fight the prior demanded angrily they want us to start the battle lord outhwaite said mildly and we want them to do the same the heralds had met to discuss how the battle should be fought and each had plainly demanded that the other side begin by making an assault and both sides had refused the invitation so now the scots tried again to provoke the english by insult some of the enemy advanced to within bowshot and shouted that the english were pigs and their mothers were sows and when an archer raised his bow to reward the insults an english captain shouted at him dont waste arrows on words he called cowards a scotsman dared to come even closer to the english line well within half a bowshot you bastard cowards your mothers are whores who suckled you on goat piss your wives are sows whores and sows you hear me you bastards english bastards youre the devils turds the fury of his hatred made him shake he had a bristling beard a ragged jupon and a coat of mail with a great rent in its backside so that when he turned round and bent over he presented his naked arse to the english it was meant as an insult but was greeted by a roar of laughter theyll have to attack us sooner or later lord outhwaite stated calmly either that or go home with nothing and i cant see them doing that you dont raise an army of that size without hope of profit they sacked hexham the prior observed gloomily and got nothing but baubles lord outhwaite said dismissively the real treasures of hexham were taken away for safekeeping long ago i hear carlisle paid them well enough to be left alone but well enough to make eight or nine thousand men rich he shook his head those soldiers dont get paid he told thomas theyre not like our men the king of scotland doesnt have the cash to pay his soldiers no they want to take some rich prisoners today then sack durham and york and if theyre not to go home poor and emptyhanded then theyd best hitch up their shields and come at us but still the scots would not move and the english were too few to make an attack though a straggle of men were constantly arriving to reinforce the archbishops army they were mostly local men and few had any armour or any weapons other than farm implements like axes and mattocks it was close to midday now and the sun had chased the chill off the land so that thomas was sweating under his leather and mail two of the priors lay servants had arrived with a horsedrawn cart loaded with casks of small beer sacks of bread a box of apples and a great cheese and a dozen of the younger monks carried the provisions along the english line most of the army was sitting now some were even sleeping and many of the scots were doing the same even their drummers had given up laying their great instruments on the pasture a dozen ravens circled overhead and thomas thinking their presence presaged death made the sign of the cross then was relieved when the dark birds flew north across the scottish troops a group of archers had come from the city and were cramming arrows into their quivers a sure sign that they had never fought with the bow for a quiver was a poor instrument in battle quivers were likely to spill arrows when a man ran and few held more than a score of points archers like thomas preferred a big bag made of linen stretched about a withy frame in which the arrows stood upright their feathers kept from being crushed by the frame and their steel heads projecting through the bags neck which was secured by a lace thomas had selected his arrows carefully rejecting any with warped shafts or kinked feathers in france where many of the enemy knights possessed expensive plate armour the english would use bodkin arrows with long narrow and heavy heads that lacked barbs and so were more likely to pierce breastplates or helmets but here they were still using the hunting arrows with their wicked barbs that made them impossible to pull out of a wound they were called flesh arrows but even a flesh arrow could pierce mail at two hundred paces thomas slept for a time in the early afternoon only waking when lord outhwaites horse almost stepped on him his lordship along with the other english commanders had been summoned to the archbishop and so he had called for his horse and accompanied by his squire rode to the armys centre one of the archbishops chaplains carried a silver crucifix along the line the crucifix had a leather bag hanging just below the feet of christ and in the bag the chaplain claimed were the knuckle bones of the martyred st oswald kiss the bag and god will preserve you the chaplain promised and archers and menatarms jostled for a chance to obey thomas could not get close enough to kiss the bag but he did manage to reach out and touch it many men had amulets or strips of cloth given them by their wives lovers or daughters when they left their farms or houses to march against the invaders they touched those talismans now as the scots sensing that something was about to happen at last climbed to their feet one of their great drums began its awful noise thomas glanced to his right where he could just see the tops of the cathedrals twin towers and the banner flying from the castles ramparts eleanor and father hobbe should be in the city by now and thomas felt a pang of regret that he had parted from his woman in such anger then he gripped his bow so that the touch of its wood might keep her from evil he consoled himself with the knowledge that eleanor would be safe in the city and tonight when the battle was won they could make up their quarrel then he supposed they would marry he was not sure he really wanted to marry it seemed too early in his life to have a wife even if it was eleanor whom he was sure he loved but was equally sure she would want him to abandon to yew bow and settle in a house and that was the very last thing thomas wanted what he wanted was be a leader of archers to be a man like will skeat he wanted to have his own band of bowmen that he could hire out to great lords there was no shortage of opportunity rumour said that the italian states would pay a fortune for english archers and thomas wanted part of it but eleanor must be looked after and he did not want their child to be a bastard there were enough bastards in the world without adding another the english lords talked for a while there were a dozen of them and they glanced constantly at the enemy and thomas was close enough to see the anxiety a their faces was it worry that the enemy was too many or that the scots were refusing battle and in the next mornings mist might vanish northwards brother michael came and rested his old bones on the herring barrel that had served lord outhwaite as a seat theyll send you archers forward thats what id do send you archers forward to provoke the bastards either that or drive them off but you dont drive scotsmen off that easily theyre brave bastards brave then why arent they attacking because theyre not fools they can see these brother michael touched the black stave of thomass bow theyve learned what archers can do youve heard of halidon hill he raised his eyebrows in surprise when thomas shook his head of course youre from the south christ could come again in the north and you southerners would never hear about it or believe it if you did but it was thirteen years ago now and they attacked us by berwick and we cut them down in droves or our archers did and they wont be enthusiastic about suffering the same fate here brother michael frowned as a small click sounded what was that something had touched thomass helmet and he turned to see the scarecrow sir geoffrey carr who had cracked his whip just glancing the metal claw at its tip off the crest of thomass sallet sir geoffrey coiled his whip as he jeered at thomas sheltering behind monks skirts are we brother michael restrained thomas go sir geoffrey the monk ordered before i call down a curse onto your black soul sir geoffrey put a finger into a nostril and pulled out something slimy that he flicked towards the monk you think you frighten me you oneeyed bastard you who lost your balls when your hand was chopped off he laughed then looked back to thomas you picked a fight with me boy and you didnt give me a chance to finish it not nosy brother michael snapped sir geoffrey ignored the monk fighting your betters boy you can hang for that no he shuddered then pointed a long bony finger at thomas you will hang for that you hear me you will hang for it he spat at thomas then turned his roan horse and spurred it back down the line how come you know the scarecrow brother michael asked we just met an evil creature brother michael said making the sign of the cross born under a waning moon when a storm was blowing he was still watching the scarecrow men say that sir geoffrey owes money to the devil himself he had to pay a ransom to douglas of mesdale and he borrowed deep from the bankers to do it his manor his fields everything he owns is in danger if he cant pay and even if he makes a fortune today hell just throw it away at dice the scarecrows fool but a dangerous one he turned his one eye on thomas did you really pick a fight with him he wanted to rape my woman aye thats our scarecrow so be careful young man because he doesnt forget slights and he never forgives them the english lords must have come to some agreement r they reached out their mailed fists and touched metal knuckle on metal knuckle then lord outhwaite turned his horse back towards his men john john he called to the captain of his archers well not wait for them to make up their minds he said as he dismounted but be provocative it seemed brother michaels prognostication was right the archers would be sent forward to annoy the scots the plan was to enrage them with arrows and so spur them into a hasty tack a squire rode lord outhwaites horse back to the walled pasture as the archbishop of york rode his destrier out in front of the army god will help you he called to the men of the central division that he commanded the scots fear us he shouted they know that with gods help we will make many children fatherless in their blighted land they stand and watch us because they fear us so we must go to them that sentiment brought a cheer the archbishop raised a hand to silence his men i want the archers to go forward he called only the archers sting them kill them and god bless you all god bless you mightily so the archers would begin the battle the scots were stubbornly refusing to move in hope that the english would make the attack for it was much easier to defend ground than assault a formed enemy but now the english archers would go forward to goad sting and harass the enemy until they either ran away or more likely advanced to take revenge thomas had already selected his best arrow it was new so new that the greentinted glue that was pasted about the thread holding the feathers in place was still tacky but it had a breasted shaft one that was slightly wider behind the head and then tapered away towards the feathers such a shaft would hit hard and it was a lovely straight piece of ash a third as long again as thomass arm and thomas would not waste it even though his opening shot would be at very long range it would be a long shot for the scottish king was at the rear of the big central sheltron of his army but it would not be an impossible shot for the black bow was huge and thomas was young strong and accurate god be with you brother michael said aim true lord outhwaite called god speed your arrows the archbishop of york shouted the drummers heat louder the scots jeered and the archers of england advanced bernard de taillebourg already knew much of what the old monk told him but now that the story was flowing he did not interrupt it was the tale of a family that had been lords of an obscure county in southern france the county was called astarac and it lay close to the cathar lands and in time became infected with the heresy the false teaching spread brother collimore had said like a murrain from the inland sea to the ocean and northwards into burgundy father de taillebourg knew all this but he had said nothing just let the old man go on describing how when the cathars were burned out of the land and the fires of their deaths had sent the smoke pouring to heaven to tell god and his angels that the true religion had been restored to the lands between france and aragon the vexilles among the last of the nobility to be contaminated by the cathar evil had fled to the farthest corners of christendom but before they left brother collimore said gazing up at the white painted arch of the ceiling they took the treasures of the heretics for safekeeping and the grail was among them so they said but who knows brother collimore turned his head and frowned at the dominican if they possessed the grail why did it not help them i have never understood that he closed his eyes sometimes when the old man was pausing to draw breath and almost seemed asleep de taillebourg would look through the window to see the two armies on the far hill they did not move though the noise they made was like the crackling and roaring of a great fire the roaring was the noise of mens voices and the crackling was the drums and the twin sounds rose and fell with the vagaries of the wind gusting in the rocky defile above the river wear father de taillebourgs servant still stood in the doorway where he was half hidden by one of many piles of undressed stone that was stacked in the open space between the castle and the cathedral scaffolding hid the cathedrals nearest tower and small boys eager to get a glimpse of the fightil were scrambling up the web of lashed poles the masons had abandoned their work to watch the two armies now after questioning why the grail had not helped the vexilles brother collimore did fall into a brief sleep and de taillebourg crossed to his blackdressed servant do you believe him the servant shrugged and said nothing has anything surprised you de taillebourg asked that father ralph has a son the servant answere that was new to me we must speak with that son the dominican said grimly then turned back because the old monk had woken where was i brother collimore asked a small trickle of spittle ran from a corner of his lips you were wondering why the grail did not help the vexilles bernard de taillebourg reminded him it should have done the old monk said if they possessed the grail why did they not become powerful father de taillebourg smiled suppose he said to the old monk that the infidel muslims were to gain possession of the grail do you think god would grant them its power the grail is a great treasure brother the greatest of all the treasures upon the earth but is not greater than god no brother collimore agreed and if god does not approve of the grailkeeper then the grail will be powerless yes brother collimore acknowledged you say the vexilles fled they fled the inquisitors brother collimore said with a sly glance at de taillebourg and one branch of the family came here to england where they did some service to the king not our present king of course the old monk made clear but his greatgrandfather the last henry what service de taillebourg asked they gave the king a hoof from st georges horse the monk spoke as though such things were commonplace a hoof set in gold and capable of working miracles at least the king believed it did for his son vas cured of a fever by being touched with the hoof i am told the hoof is still in westminster abbey the family had been rewarded with land in cheshire collimore went on and if they were heretics they did not show it but lived like any other noble family their downfall he said had come at the beginning of the present reign when the young kings mother aided by the mortimer family had tried to keep her son from taking power the vexilles had sided with the queen and when she lost they had fled back to the continent all of them except one son brother collimore said the eldest son and that was ralph of course poor ralph but if his family had fled back to france why did ou treat him de taillebourg asked puzzlement marring the face that had blood scabs on the abrasions vhere he had beaten himself against the stone that norning why not just execute him as a traitor he had taken holy orders collimore protested he could not be executed besides it was known he hated his father and he had declared himself for the king so he was not all mad de taillebourg put in drily he also possessed money collimore went on he was noble and he claimed to know the secret of the vexilles the cathar treasures but the demon was in him even then he declared himself a bishop and preached wild sermons in the london streets he said he would lead a new crusade to drive the infidel from jerusalem and promised that the grail would ensure success so you locked him up he was sent to me brother collimore said reprovingly because it was known that i could defeat the demons he paused remembering in my time i scourged hundreds of them hundreds but you did not fully cure ralph vexille the monk shook his head he was like a man spurred and whipped by god so that he wept and screamed and beat himself till the blood ran brother collimore unaware that he could have been describing de taillebourg shuddered and he was haunted by women too i think we never cured him of that but if we did not drive the demons clean out of him we did manage to make them hide so deep that they rarely dared show themselves was the grail a dream given to him by demons the dominican asked that was what we wanted to know brother collimore replied and what answer did you find i told my masters that father ralph lied that he had invented the grail that there was no truth in his madness and then when his demons no longer made him a nuisance he was sent to a parish in the far south where he could preach to the gulls and to the seals he no longer called himself a lord he was simply father ralph and we sent him away to be forgotten to be forgotten de taillebourg repeated yet you had news of him you discovered he had a son the old monk nodded we had a brother house near dorchester and they sent me news they told me that father ralph had found himself a woman a housekeeper but what country priest doesnt and he had a son and he hung an old spear in his church and said it was st georges lance de taillebourg peered at the western hill for the noise had become much louder it looked as though the english who were by far the smaller army were advancing and that meant they would lose the battle and that meant father de taillebourg had to be out of this monastery indeed out of this city before sir william douglas arrived seeking vengeance you told your masters that father ralph lied did he the old monk paused and to de taillebourg it seemed as if the firmament itself held its breath i dont think he lied collimore whispered so why did you tell them he did because i liked him brother collimore said and i did not think we could whip the truth out of him or starve it from him or pull it out by trying to drown him in cold water i thought he was harmless and should be left to god de taillebourg gazed through the window the grail he thought the grail the hounds of god were on the scent he would find it one of the family came back from france the dominican said and stole the lance and killed father ralph i heard but they did not find the grail god be thanked for that brother collimore said faintly de taillebourg heard a movement and saw that his servant who had been listening intently was now watching the courtyard the servant must have heard someone approaching and de taillebourg leaning closer to brother collimore lowered his voice so he would not be overheard how many people know of father ralph and the grail brother collimore thought for a few heartbeats no one has spoken of it for years he said until the new bishop came he must have heard rumours for he asked me about it i told him that ralph vexille was mad he believed you he was disappointed he wanted the grail for the cathedral of course he did de taillebourg thought for any cathedral that possessed the grail would become the richest church in christendom even genoa which had its gaudy piece of green glass that they claimed was the grail took money from thousands of pilgrims but put the real grail in a church and folk would come to it in their hundreds of thousands and they would bring coins and jewels by the wagonload kings queens princes and dukes would throng the aisle and compete to offer their wealth the servant had vanished slipping soundlessly behind one of the piles of building stone and de taillebourg waited watching the door and wondering what trouble would show there then instead of trouble a young priest appeared he wore a rough cloth gown had unruly hair and a broad guileless sunburned face a young woman pale and frail was with him she seemed nervous but the priest greeted de taillebourg cheerfully a good day to you father and to you father de taillebourg responded politely his servant had reappeared behind the strangers preventing them from leaving unless de taillebourg gave his permission i am taking brother collimores confession de taillebourg said a good one i hope father hobbe said then smiled you dont sound english father i am french de taillebourg said as am i eleanor said in that language and we have come to talk with brother collimore talk with him de taillebourg asked pleasantly the bishop sent us eleanor said proudly and the king did too which king child edouard dangleterre eleanor boasted father hobbe who spoke no french was looking from eleanor to the dominican why would edward send you de taillebourg asked and when eleanor looked flustered he repeated the question why would edward send you i dont know father eleanor said i think you do my child i think you do he stood and father hobbe sensing trouble took eleanors wrist and tried to pull her from the room but de taillebourg nodded at his servant and gestured towards father hobbe and the english priest was still trying to understand why he was suspicious of the dominican when the knife slid between his ribs he made a choking noise then coughed and the breath rattled in his throat as he slid down to the flagstones eleanor tried to run but she was not nearly fast enough and de taillebourg caught her by the wrist and jerked her roughly back she screamed and the dominican silenced her by clapping a hand over her mouth whats happening brother collimore asked we are doing gods work de taillebourg said soothingly gods work and on the ridge the arrows flew thomas advanced with the archers of the lefthand battle and they had not gone more than twenty yards when just beyond a ditch a bank and some newly planted blackthorn saplings they were forced to their right because a great scoop had been taken out of the ridges flank to leave a hollow of ground with sides too steep for the plough the hollow was filled with bracken that had turned yellow and at its far side was a lichencovered stone wall and thomass arrow bag caught and tore on a rough piece of the coping as he clambered across only one arrow fell out but it dropped into a mushroom fairy ring and he tried to work out whether that was a good or a had omen but the noise of the scottish drums distracted him he picked up the arrow and hurried on all the enemy drummers were working now rattling their skins in a frenzy so that the air itself seemed to vibrate the scottish menatarms were hefting their shields making sure they protected the pikemen and a crossbowman was working the ratchet that dragged back his cord and lodged it on the triggers hook the man glanced up anxiously at the advancing english bowmen then discarded the ratchet handles and laid a metal quarrel in the crossbows firing trough the enemy had begun to shout and thomas could distinguish some words now if you hate the english he heard then a crossbow bolt hummed past him and he forgot about the enemy chant hundreds of english archers were advancing through the fields most of them running the scots only had a few crossbows but those weapons outranged the longer war bows of the english who were hurrying to close that range an arrow slithered across the grass in front of thomas not a crossbow bolt but an arrow from one of the few scottish yew bows and the sight of the arrow told him he was almost in range the first of the english archers had stopped and drawn back their cords and then their arrows flickered into the sky a bowman in a padded leather jerkin fell backwards with a crossbow bolt embedded in his forehead blood spurted skywards where his last arrow shot almost vertically soared uselessly aim at the archers a man in a rusted breastplate bellowed kill their archers first thomas stopped and looked for the royal standard it was off to his right a long way off but he had shot at further targets in his time and so he turned and braced himself and then in the name of god and st george he put his chosen arrow onto the string and drew the white goose feathers back to his ear he was staring at king david ii of scotland saw the sun glint gold off the royal helmet saw too that the kings visor was open and he aimed for the chest nudged the bow right to compensate for the wind and loosed the arrow went true not vibrating as a badly made arrow would and thomas watched it climb and saw it fall and saw the king jerk backwards and then the courtiers closed about him and thomas laid his second arrow across his left hand and sought another target a scottish archer was limping from the line an arrow in his leg the menatarms closed about the wounded man sealing their line with heavy shields thomas could hear hounds baying deep among the enemy formation or perhaps he was hearing the war howl of the tribesmen the king had turned away and men were leaning towards him the sky was filled with the whisper of flying arrows and the noise of the bows was a steady deep music the french called it the devils harp music there were no scottish archers left that thomas could see they had all been made targets by the english bowmen and the arrows had ripped the enemy archers into bloody misery so now the english turned their missiles on the men with pikes swords axes and spears the tribesmen all hair and beard and fury were beyond the menatarms who were arrayed six or eight men deep so the arrows rattled and clanged on armour and shields the scottish knights and menatarms and pikecarriers were sheltering as best they could crouching under the bitter steel rain but some arrows always found the gaps between the shields while others drove clean through the leathercovered willow boards the thudding sound of the arrows hitting shields was rivalling the sharper noise of the drums forward boys forward one of the archers leaders encouraged his men to go twenty paces nearer the enemy so that their arrows could bite harder into the scottish ranks kill them lads two of his men were lying on the grass proof that the scottish archers had lone some damage before they were overwhelmed with english arrows another englishman was staggering as hough he were drunk weaving back towards his own le and clutching his belly from which blood trickled town his leggings a bows cord broke squirting the arrow sideways as the archer swore and reached under his tunic to find a spare the scots could do nothing now they had no archers eft and the english edged closer and closer until they were driving their arrows in a flat trajectory that whipped the steel heads through shields mail and even the rare suit of plate armour thomas was scarce seventy yards from the enemy line and choosing his targets with old deliberation he could see a mans leg showing under a shield and he put an arrow through the thigh the drummers had fled and two of their instruments their skins split like rotten fruit lay discarded on the turf a noblemans horse was close behind the dismounted ranks and thomas put a missile deep into the destriers chest and when he next looked the animal was down and there was a flurry of panicking men trying to escape its thrashing hooves and all of those men exposing themselves by letting their shields waver went down under the sting of the arrows and then a moment later a pack of a dozen hunting dogs longhaired yellowfanged and howling burst out of the cowering ranks and were tumbled down by the slicing arrows is it always this easy a boy evidently at his first battle asked a nearby archer if the other side dont have archers the older man answered and so long as our arrows last then its easy after that its shit hard thomas drew and released shooting at an angle across the scottish front to whip a long shaft behind a shield and into a bearded mans face the scottish king was still on his horse but protected now by four shields that were all bristling with arrows and thomas remembered the french horses labouring up the picardy slope with the feathertipped shafts sticking from their necks legs and bodies he rummaged in his torn arrow bag found another missile and shot it at the kings horse the enemy was under the flail now and they would either run from the arrow storm or else enraged charge the smaller english army and judging by the shouts coming from the men behind the arrowstuck shields thomas suspected they would attack he ryas right he had time to shoot one last arrow and then there was a sudden terrifying roar and the whole scottish line seemingly without anyone giving an order charged they ran howling and screaming stung into the attack by the arrows and the english archers fled thousands of enraged scotsmen were charging and the archers even if they shot every arrow they possessed into the advancing horde would be overwhelmed in a heartbeat and so they ran to find shelter behind their own menatarms thomas tripped as he climbed the stone wall but he picked himself up and ran on then saw that other archers had stopped and were shooting at their pursuers the stone wall was holding up the scots and he turned round himself and put two arrows into defenceless men before the enemy surged across the barrier and forced him back again he was running towards the small gap in the english line where st cuthberts mass cloth waved but the space was choked with archers trying to get behind the armoured line and so thomas went to his right aiming for the sliver of open ground that lay between the armys flank and the ridges steep side shields forward a grizzled warrior his helmet visor pushed up shouted at the english menatarms brace hard brace hard the english line only four or five ranks deep steadied to meet the wild attack with their shields thrust forward and right legs braced back st george st george a man called hold hard now thrust hard and hold hard thomas was on the flank of the army now and he turned to see that the scots in their precipitate charge had widened their line they had been arrayed shoulder to shoulder in their first position but now running they had spread out and that meant their westernmost sheltron had been pushed down the ridges slope and into the deep hollow that so unexpectedly narrowed the battle ground they were down in the hollows bottom staring up at the skyline doomed archers thomas shouted thinking himself back in france and responsible for a troop of will skeats bowmen archers he bellowed advancing to the hollows lip now kill them men came to his side yelped in triumph and drew back their cords now was the killing time the archers time the scottish right wing was down in the sunken ground and the archers were above them and could not miss two monks were bringing spare sheaves of arrows each sheaf holding twentyfour shafts evenly spaced about two leather discs that kept the arrows apart and so protected their feathers from being crushed the monks cut the twine holding the arrows and spilt the missiles on the ground beside the archers who drew again and again and killed again and again as they shot down into the pit of death thomas heard the deafening crash as the menatarms collided in the fields centre but here on the english left the scots would never come to their enemys shields because they had spilled into the low yellow bracken of deaths kingdom thomass childhood had been spent in hookton a village on englands south coast where a stream coming to the sea had carved a deep channel in the shingle beach the channel curved to leave a hook of land that protected the fishing boats and once a year when the rats became too thick in the holds and bilges of the boats the fishermen would strand their craft at the bottom of the stream fill their bilges with stones and let the incoming tide flood the stinking hulls it was a holiday for the village children who standing on the top of the hook waited for the rats to flee the boats and then with cheers and screams of delight they would stone the animals the rats would panic and that would only lncrease the childrens glee as the adults stood around and laughed applauded and encouraged it was like that now the scots were in the low ground the archers were on the lip of the hill and death was their dominion the arrows were flashing straight down the slope scarce am arc in their flight and striking home with the sound of cleavers hitting flesh the scots writhed and died in the hollow and the yellow autumn bracken turned red some of the enemy tried to climb towards their tormentors but they became the easiest targets some attempted to escape up the far side and were struck in the back while some fled down the hill in ragged disarray sir thomas rokeby sheriff of yorkshire and commander of the english left saw their escape and ordered two score of his men to mount their horses and scour the valley the mailed riders swung their swords and morningstars to finish the archers bloody work the base of the hollow was a writhing bloody mass a man in plate armour a plumed helmet on his head tried to climb out of the carnage and two arrows whipped through his breastplate and a third found a slit in his visor and he fell back twitching a thicket of arrows jutted from the falcon on his shield the arrows became fewer now for there were not many scotsmen left to kill and then the first archers scrambled down the slope with drawn knives to pillage the dead and kill the wounded who hates the english now one of the archers jeered come on you bastards lets hear you who hates the english now then a shout sounded from the centre archers to the right to the right the voice had a note of sheer panic to the right for gods sake now the menatarms of the english left were scarcely engaged in the fight because the archers were slaughtering the scots in the low bracken the english centre was holding firm for the archbishops men were arrayed behind a stone wall which though only waist high was a more than adequate barrier against the scottish assault the invaders could stab lunge and hack over the walls coping and they could try to climb it and they could even try to pull it down stone by stone but they could not push it over and so they were checked by it and the english though far fewer were able to hold even though the scots were lunging at them with their heavy pikes some english knights called for their horses and once mounted and armed with lances pressed up close behind their beleaguered comrades and rammed the lances at scottish eyes other menatarms ducked under the unwieldy pikes and hacked with swords and axes at the enemy and all the while the long arrows drove in from the left the noise in the centre was the shouting of men in the rearward ranks the screaming of the wounded the clangour of blade on blade the crack of blade on shield and the clatter of lance on pike but the wall meant that neither side could press the other back and so crammed against the stones and encumbered by the dead they just lunged hacked suffered bled and died but on the english right where lord neville and lord percy commanded the wall was unfinished nothing more than a pile of stones that offered no obstacle to the assault of the scottish left wing that was commanded by the earl of march and by the kings nephew lord robert stewart their sheltron closest to the city was the largest of the three scottish divisions and it came at the english like a pack of wolves who had not fed in a month the attackers wanted blood and the archers fled from their howling charge like sheep scattering before fangs and then the scots struck the english right and the sheer momentum of their assault drove the defenders back twenty paces before somehow the menatarms managed to hold the scots who were now stumbling over the bodies of the men they had wounded or killed the english cramming themselves shoulder to shoulder crouched behind their shields and shoved back stabbing swords at ankles and faces and grunting with the effort of holding the vast pressure of the scottish horde it was hard to fight in the front ranks men shoved from behind so that englishmen and scotsmen were close as lovers too close to wield a sword in anything except a rudimentary stab the ranks behind had more room and a scotsman chopped down with a pike that he wielded like a giant axe its blade crunching down into an enemys head to split helmet leather liner scalp and skull as easily as an unboiled egg blood fountained across a dozen men as the dead soldier fell and other scots pushed into the gap his death had caused and a clansman tripped on the body and screamed as an englishman sawed at his exposed neck with a blunt knife the pike dropped again killing a second man and this time when it was lifted up the dead mans crumpled visor was caught on the pikes bloody spike the drums those that were still whole had begun their noise again and the scots heaved to their rhythm the bruce the bruce some chanted while others called on their patron st andrew st andrew lord robert stewart gaudy in his blue and yellow colours and with a thin fillet of gold about the brow of his helmet used a twohanded sword to chop at the english menatarms who cowered from the rampant scots lord robert safe from arrows at last had lifted his visor so he could see the enemy come on he screamed at his men come on hard into them kill them kill them the king had promised that the christmas feast would be in london and there seemed only a small screen of frightened men to break before that promise could come true the riches of durham york and london were just a few sword strokes away all the wealth of norwich and oxford of bristol and southampton was only a handful of deaths from scottish purses scotland scotland scotland lord robert called scotland and the pikeman because the trapped visor was obstructing his blade was beating on a mans helmet with the hook side of his weapons head not chopping through the metal but smashing it hammering the broken helmet into the dying mans brain so that blood and jelly oozed from the visors slits an englishman screamed as a scottish pike struck through his mail into his groin a boy perhaps a page reeled back with his eves bloodied from a sword slash scotland lord robert could smell the victory now so close he shoved on felt the english line jar and move hack saw how thin it was fended off a lunge with his shield stabbed with his sword to kill a fallen and wounded enemy shouted at his squires to keep a watch for any rich english nobleman whose ransom could enrich the house of stewart men grunted as they stabbed and hacked a tribesman reeled from the fight gasping for breath trying to hold his guts inside his slashed belly a drummer was beating the scots on bring my horse lord robert called to a squire he knew that the beaten english line had to break in a moment and then he would mount take his lance and pursue the beaten enemy on on he shouted on and the man wielding the longhafted pike the huge scotsman who had driven a gap into the english front rank and who seemed to be carving a bloody path south all by himself suddenly made a mewing noise his pike high in the air where it was still fouled with the bent visor faltered the man jerked and his mouth opened and closed opened and closed again but he could not speak because an arrow its white feathers bloodied jutted from his head an arrow lord robert saw and suddenly the air was thick with them and he pulled down the visor of his helmet so that the day went dark the damned english archers were back sir william douglas had not realized how deep and steepsided was the brackencovered saddle in the ridges flank until he reached its base and there under the flail of the archers found he could neither go forward nor back the front two ranks of scottish menatarms were all either dead or wounded and their bodies made a heap over which he could not climb in his heavy mail robbie was screaming defiance and trying to scramble over that heap but sir william unceremoniously dragged his nephew back and thrust him down into the bracken this isnt a place to die robbie bastards they may be bastards but were the fools sir william crouched beside his nephew covering them both with his huge shield to go back was unthinkable for that would be running from the enemy yet he could not advance and so he just marvelled at the force of the arrows as they thumped into the shields face a rush of bearded tribesmen more nimble than the menatarms because they refused to wear metal armour seethed past him howling their wild defiance as they scrambled barelegged across the heap of dying scots but then the english arrows began to strike and hurl the clansmen back the arrows made sounds like bladders rupturing as they struck and the clansmen mewed and groaned twitching as more arrows thumped home each missile provoked a spurt of blood so that sir william and robbie douglas unscathed beneath their heave shield were spattered with gore a sudden tumult among the nearby menatarms provoked more arrows and sir william bellowed angrily at the soldiers to lie down hoping that stillness would persuade the english archers that no scotsmen lived but the menatarms called back that the earl of moray had been hit not before time sir william growled to robbie he hated the earl more than he hated the english and he grinned when a man shouted that his lordship was not just hit but dead and then another hail of arrows silenced the earls retainers and sir william heard the missiles clanging on metal thumping into flesh and striking the willow boards of shields and when the rattle of arrows was done there was just the moaning and weeping the hissing of breath and the creak of leather as men died or tried to extricate themselves from under the piles of dying what happened robbie asked we didnt scout the land properly sir villiam answered we outnumber the bastards and that made us confident ominously in the arrowless quiet he heard laughter and the thump of boots a scream sounded and sir william who was old in war knew that the english troops were coming down into the bowl to finish off the injured were going to run back soon he told robbie theres no choice in it cover your arse with your shield and run like the devil were running away robbie asked appalled sir william sighed robbie you damned fool you can run forward and you can die and ill tell your mother you died like a brave man and a halfwit or you can get the hell back up the hill with me and try to win this battle robbie did not argue but just looked back up the scottish side of the hollow where the bracken was flecked with whitefeathered arrows tell me when to run he said a dozen archers and as many english menatarms were using knives to cut scottish throats they would pause before finishing off a manatarms to discover whether he had any value as a source of ransom but few men had such value and the clansmen had none the latter hated above all the scots because they were so different were treated as vermin sir william cautiously raised his head and decided this was the moment to retreat it was better to scramble out of this bloody trap than be captured and so ignoring the indignant shouts of the english he and his nephew scrambled hack up the slope to sir williams surprise no arrows came he had expected the grass and bracken to be thrashed with arrows as he clambered out of the hollow but he and robbie were left alone he turned halfway up the slope and saw that the english bowmen had vanished leaving only menatarms on this flank of the field at their head watching him from the hollows farther lip was lord outhwaite who had once been sir williams prisoner outhwaite who was lame was using a spear as a stave and seeing sir william he raised the weapon in greeting get yourself some proper armour willie sir william shouted lord outhwaite like the knight of liddesdale had been christened william were not done with you yet i fear not sir william i do indeed fear not lord outhwaite called back he steadied himself with his spear i trust youre well of course im not well you bloody fool half my men are down there my dear fellow outhwaite said with a grimace and then waved genially as sir william pushed robbie on up the hill and followed him to safety sir william once back on the high ground took stock he could see that the scots had been beaten here on their right but that had been their own fault for charging headlong into the low ground where the archers had been able to kill with impunity those archers had mysteriously vanished but sir william guessed they had been pulled clear across the field to the scottish left flank that had advanced a long way ahead of the centre he could tell that because lord robert stewarts blue and yellow banner of the lion was so far ahead of the kings red and yellow flag so the battle was going well on the left but sir william could see it was going nowhere in the centre because of the stone wall that obstructed the scottish advance well achieve nothing here he told robbie so lets be useful he turned and raised his bloody sword douglas he shouted douglas his standardbearer had disappeared and sir william supposed that the man with his redhearted flag was dead in the low ground douglas he called again and when sufficient of his men had come to him he led them to the embattled central sheltron we fight here he told them then pushed his way to the king who was on horseback in the second or third rank fighting beneath his banner that was thick stuck with arrows he was also fighting with his visor raised and sir william saw that the kings face was half obscured with blood put your visor down he roared the king was trying to stab a long lance across the stone wall but the press of men made his efforts futile his blue and yellow surcoat had been torn to reveal the bright plate metal beneath an arrow thudded into his right espalier that had again ridden up on the breastplate and he tugged it down just as another arrow ripped open the left ear of his stallion he saw sir william and grinned as though this was fine sport pull your visor down sir william bellowed and he saw that the king was not grinning but rather a whole flap of his cheek had been torn away and the blood was still welling from the wound and spilling from the helmets lower rim to soak the torn surcoat have your cheek bandaged sir william shouted over the din of fighting the king let his frightened horse hack away from the wall what happened on the right his voice was made indistinct by his wound they killed us sir william said curtly inadvertently jerking his long sword so that drops of blood sprayed from its tip no they murdered us he growled there was a break in the ground and it snared us our left is winning well break them there the kings mouth kept filling with blood which he spat out but despite the copious bleeding he did not seem overconcerned with the wound it had been inflicted at the very beginning of the battle when an arrow had hissed over the heads of his army to rip a gouge in his cheek before spending itself in his helmets liner well hold them here he told sir william john randolphs dead sir william told him the earl of moray he added when he saw that the king had not understood his first words dead king david blinked then spat more blood hes dead not a prisoner another arrow slapped at his flag but the king was oblivious of the danger he turned and stared at his enemys flags well have the archbishop say a prayer over his grave then the bastard can say grace over our supper he saw a gap in the front scottish rank and spurred his horse to fill it then lunged with his lance at an english defender the kings blow broke the mans shoulder mangling the bloody wound with the debris of torn mail bastards the king spat were winning he called to his men then a rush of douglass followers pushed between him and the wall the newcomers struck the stone wall like a great wave but the wall proved stronger and the wave broke on its stones swords and axes clashed over the coping and men from both sides dragged the dead out of their paths to clear a passage to the slaughter well hold the bastards here the king assured sir william and turn their right but sir william his ears ever attuned to the noise of battle had heard something new for the last few minutes he had been listening to shouts clangour screams and drums but one sound had been missing and that was the devils harp music the deeptoned pluck of bowstrings but he heard it again now and he knew that though scores of the enemy might have been killed few of those dead were archers and now the bows of england had begun their awful work again you want advice sire of course the king looked brighteyed his destrier wounded by several arrows took small nervous steps away from the thickest fighting that raged just paces away put your visor down sir william said and then pull back pull back the king wondered if he had misheard pull back sir william said again and he sounded hard and sure yet he was not certain why he had given the advice it was another damn premonition like the one he had experienced in the fog at dawn yet he knew the advice was good pull back now pull all the way back to scotland where there were great castles that could withstand a storm of arrows yet he knew he could not explain the advice he could find no reason for it a dread had seized his heart and filled him with foreboding from any other man the advice would have been reckoned cowardice but no one would ever accuse sir william douglas the knight of liddesdale of cowardice the king thought the advice was a bad jest and he gave a snorting laugh were winning he told sir william as more blood spilt from his helmet and slopped down to his saddle is there any danger on the right he asked none sir william said the hollow in the ground would be as effective at stopping an english advance as it had been at foiling the scottish attack then well win this battle on our left the king declared then hauled on his reins to turn away pull back indeed the king laughed then took a piece of linen from one of his chaplains and pushed it between his cheek and his helmet were winning he said to sir william again then spurred to the east he was riding to bring scotland victory and to show that he was a worthy son of the great bruce st andrew he shouted through thick blood st andrew you think we should pull back uncle robbie douglas asked he was as confused as the king but were winning are we sir william listened to the music of the bows best say your prayers robbie he said best say your bloody prayers and ask god to let the devil take the bloody archers and pray that god or the devil was listening sir geoffrey carr was stationed on the english left where the scots had been so decisively rebuffed by the terrain and his few menatarms were now down in the bloodreeking hollow in search of prisoners the scarecrow had watched the scots trapped in the low ground and he had grinned with feral delight as the arrows had slashed down into the attackers one enraged tribesman his thick folds of swathing plaid stuck with arrows as thick as a hedgehogs spines had tried to fight up the slope he had been swearing and cursing repeatedly struck by arrows one was even sticking from his skull which was smothered in tangled hair and another was caught in the thicket of his beard yet still he had come bleeding and ranting so filled with hate that he did not even know he should be dead and he managed to struggle within five paces of the bowmen before sir geoffrey had flicked his whip to take the mans left eye from its socket clean as a hazel from its shell and then an archer had stepped forward and casually split the mans arrowspitted skull with an axe the scarecrow coiled the whip and fingered the damp on the tips iron claw i do enjoy a battle he had said to no one in particular once the attack was stalled he had seen that one of the scottish lords all gaudy in blue and silver was lying dead among the heap of corpses and that was a pity that was a real pity there was a fortune gone with that death and sir geoffrey remembering his debts had ordered his men down into the pit to cut throats pillage corpses and find any prisoner worth a halfdecent ransom his archers had been taken off to the other side of the field but his menatarms were left to find some cash hurry beggar sir geoffrey shouted hurry prisoners and plunder look for gentlemen and lords not that there are any gentlemen in scotland this last observation made only to himself amused the scarecrow so that he laughed aloud the joke seemed to improve as he thought about it and he almost doubled over in merriment gentlemen in scotland he repeated and then he saw a young monk staring cvorriedly at him the monk was one of the priors men distributing food and ale to the troops but he had been alarmed by sir geoffrey s wild cackle the scarecrow going abruptly silent stared videeyed at the monk and then silently let the coils of the whip fall from his hand the soft leather made no sound as it rippled down then sir geoffrey moved his right arm at lightning speed and the whip struck to loop itself about the young monks neck sir geoffrey jerked the lash come here boy he ordered the jerk made the monk stumble so that he dropped the bread and apples he had been carrying then he was standing close beside sir geoffreys horse and the scarecrow was leaning down from the saddle so that the monk could smell his fetid breath listen you pious little turd sir geoffrey hissed if you dont tell me the truth ill cut off what you dont need and what you dont use except to piss through and feed it to my swine do you understand me boy the monk terrified just nodded sir geoffrey looped the whip one more time round the young mans neck and gave it a good tug just to let the monk know who was in charge an archer fellow with a black bow had a letter for your prior he did sir yes sir and did the prior read it yes sir he did sir and did he tell you what was in it the monk instinctively shook his head then saw the rage in the scarecrows eye and in his panic he blurted out the word he had first overheard when the letter was opened thesaurus sir thats whats in it thesaurus thesaurus sir geoffrey said stumbling over the foreign word and what you gelded piece of weasel shit what in the name of a thousand virgins is a thesaurus treasure sir treasure latin sir thesaurus sir is latin for the monks voice trailed away treasure he finished lamely treasure sir geoffrey repeated the word flatly the monk half choking was suddenly eager to repeat the gossip that had circulated amongst the brethren since thomas of hookton had encountered the prior the king sent him sir his majesty himself and my lord the bishop too sir from france and theyre looking for a treasure sir but no one knows what it is the king or where it is sir yes sir the king himself sir he sent him sir sir geoffrey looked into the monks eyes saw no guile and so unlooped the whip you dropped some apples boy i did sir i did sir yes feed one to my horse he watched the monk retrieve an apple then his face suddenly contorted with anger wipe the mud off it first you toadspawn clean it he shuddered then stared northwards but he was not seeing the surviving scots of the enemys right wing scramble out of the low ground and he did not even notice the escape of his hated enemy sir william douglas who had impoverished him he saw none of these things because the scarecrow was thinking of treasure of gold of heaps of gold of his hearts desire of money and jewels and coins and plate and women and everything a heart could ever want the sheltron on the scottish left rampant and savage forced the english right so far back that a great gap appeared between the english centre behind its stone wall and the retreating division on its right that retreat meant that the right flank of the central division was now exposed to scottish attack indeed the rear of the archbishops battle was exposed to the scots but then from all across the ridge the archers came to the rescue they came to make a new line that protected the archbishops flank a line that faced sideways onto the triumphant scottish assault and the swarm of archers drove their arrows into lord robert stewarts sheltron they could not miss these were bowmen who started their archery practice at a hundred paces and finished over two hundred paces from the strawfilled targets and now they were shooting at twenty paces and the arrows flew with such force that some pierced through mail body and mail again men in armour were being spitted by the arrows and the righthand side of the scottish advance crumpled in blood and pain and every man who fell exposed another victim to the bowmen who were shooting as fast as they could lay their arrows on the cords the scots were dying by the score they were dying and they were screaming some men instinctively tried to charge the archers but were immediately cut down no troops could stand that assault of feathered steel and suddenly the scots were pulling back tripping over the dead left by their charge stumbling back across the pasture to where they had begun their charge and they were pursued every step of the way by the hissing arrows until at last an english voice ordered the archers to rest their bows but stay here the man ordered wanting the archers who had come from the left wing to stay on the beleaguered right thomas was among the archers he counted his arrows finding only seven left in his bag and so he began hunting in the grass for shot arrows that were not badly damaged but then a man nudged him and pointed to a cart that was trundling across the field with spare sheaves thomas was astonished in france we were ever running out of arrows not here the man had a hare lip which made him hard to understand they keep em in durham in the castle three counties send em here he scooped up two new sheaves the arrows were made all across england and wales some folk cut and trimmed the shafts others collected the feathers women span the cords and men boiled the hide hoof and verdigris glue while smiths forged the heads and then the separate parts were carried to towns where the arrows were assembled bundled and sent on to london york chester or durham where they awaited an emergency thomas broke the twine on two sheaves and put the new arrows in a bag he had taken from a dead archer he had found the man lying behind the archbishops troops and thomas had left his old torn bag beside the mans body and now had a new bag filled with fresh arrows he flexed the fingers of his right hand they were sore proof he had not shot enough arrows since the battle in picardy his back ached as it always did after he had shot the bow twenty or more times each draw was the equivalent of lifting a man onehanded and the effort of it dug the ache deep into his spine but the arrows had driven the scottish left wing clean back to where it had started and where like their english enemies they now drew breath the ground between the two armies was littered with spent arrows dead men and wounded some of whom moved slowly as they tried to drag themselves back to their comrades two dogs sniffed at a corpse but skittered away when a monk shied a stone at them thomas unlooped the string of his bow so that the stave straightened some archers liked to leave their weapons permanently strung until the stave had taken on the curve of a tensioned bow and were said to have followed the string the curve was supposed to show that the bow was well used and thus that its owner was an experienced soldier but thomas reckoned a bow that had followed the string was weakened and so he unstrung his as often as he could that also helped to preserve the cord it was difficult to fashion a cord of exactly the right length and inevitably it stretched but a good hempen string soaked with glue could last the best part of a year if it was kept dry and not subjected to constant tension like many archers thomas liked to reinforce his bowcords with womens hair because that was meant to protect the strings from snapping in a fight that and praying to st sebastian thomas let the string hang from the top of the bow then squatted in the grass where he took the arrows from his bag one by one and span them between his fingers to detect any warping in their shafts the bastards will be back a man with a silver crescent on his surcoat strode down the line theyll be back for more but youve done well the silver crescent was half obscured by blood an archer spat and another impulsively stroked his unstrung bow thomas thought that if he lay down he would probably sleep but he was assailed by the ridiculous fear that the other archers would retreat and leave him there sleeping and the scots would find and kill him the scots though were resting like the english some men were bent over as if they caught their breath others were sitting on the grass while a few clustered round a barrel of water or ale the big drums were silent but thomas could hear the scrape of stone on steel as men sharpened blades blunted by the battles first clash no insults were being shouted on either side now men just eyed each other warily priests knelt beside dying men praying their souls into heaven while women shrieked because their husbands lovers or sons were dead the english right wing its numbers thinned by the ferocity of the scottish attack had moved back to its original place and behind them were scores of dead and dying men the scottish casualties left behind by the precipitate retreat were being stripped and searched and a fight broke out between two men squabbling over a handful of tarnished coins two monks carried water to the wounded a small child played with broken rings from a mail coat while his mother attempted to prise a broken visor off a pike that she reckoned would make a good axe a scotsman thought dead suddenly groaned and turned over and a manatarms stepped to him and stabbed down with his sword the enemy stiffened relaxed and did not move again aint resurrection day yet you bastard the manatarms said as he dragged his sword free goddamn son of a whore he grumbled wiping his sword on the dead mans ragged surcoat waking up like that gave me a turn he was not speaking to anyone in particular but just crouched beside the man he had killed and began searching his clothes the cathedral towers and castle walls were thick with spectators a heron flew beneath the ramparts following the looping river that sparkled prettily under the autumn sun thomas could hear corncrakes down the slope butterflies surely the last of the year flew above the bloodslicked grass the scots were standing stretching pulling on helmets pushing their forearms into their shield loops and hefting newly sharpened swords pikes and spears some glanced over to the city and imagined the treasures stored in the cathedral crypt and castle cellars they dreamed of chests crammed with gold vats overflowing with coin rooms heaped with silver taverns running with ale and streets filled with women in the name of the father and of the son a priest called and of the holy ghost st andrew is with you you fight for your king the enemy are godless imps of satan god is with us up boys up an archer called on the english side men stood strung their bows and took the first arrow from the bag some crossed themselves oblivious that the scots did the same lord robert stewart mounted on a fresh grey stallion pushed his way towards the front of the scottish left wing theyll have few arrows left he promised his men few arrows we can break them his men had so nearly broken the damned english last time so nearly and surely another howling rush would obliterate the small defiant army and open the road to the opulent riches of the south for st andrew lord robert called and the drummers began their beating for our king for scotland and the howling began again bernard de taillebourg went to the cathedral when his business in the monasterys small hospital was finished his servant was readying the horses as the dominican strode down the great nave between the vast pillars painted in jagged stripes of red yellow green and blue he went to the tomb of st cuthbert to say a prayer he was not certain that cuthbert was an important saint he was certainly not one of the blessed souls who commanded the ear of god in heaven but he was much revered locally and his tomb thickly decorated with jewels gold and silver testified to that devotion at least a hundred women were gathered about the grave most of them crying and de taillebourg pushed some out of his way so he could get close enough to touch the embroidered pall that shrouded the tomb one woman snarled at him then realized he was a priest and seeing his bloodied bruised face begged his forgiveness bernard de taillebourg ignored her stooping instead to the tomb the pall was tasselled and the women had tied little shreds of cloth to the tassels each scrap a prayer most prayers were for health for the restoration of a limb for the gift of sight or to save a childs life but today they were begging cuthbert to bring their menfolk safely down from the hill bernard de taillebourg added his own prayer go to st denis he beseeched cuthbert and ask him to speak to god cuthbert even if he could not hold gods attention could certainty find st denis who being french was bound to be closer to god than cuthbert beg denis to pray that gods speed attend my errand and that gods blessing be upon the search and that gods grace give it success and pray god to forgive us our sins but know that our sins grievous though they be are committed only in gods service he moaned at the thought of this days sins then he kissed the pall and took a coin from the purse under his robe he dropped the coin in the great metal jar where pilgrims gave what they could to the shrine and then he hurried back down the cathedrals nave a crude building he thought its coloured pillars so fat and gross and its carvings as clumsy as a childs scratchings so unlike the new and graceful abbeys and churches that were rising in france he dipped his fingers in the holy water made the sign of the cross and went out into the sunlight where his servant was waiting with their mounts you could have left without me he said to the servant it would be easier the servant said to kill you on the road and then go on without you but you wont do that de taillebourg said because the grace of god has come into your soul thanks be to god the servant said the man was not a servant by birth but a knight and gently born now at de taillebourgs pleasure he was being punished for his sins and for the sins of his family there were those and cardinal bessieres was among them who thought the man should have been stretched on the rack that he should have been pressed by great weights that the burning irons should have seared into his flesh so that his back arched as he screamed repentance at the ceiling but de taillebourg had persuaded the cardinal to do nothing except show this man the instruments of the inquisitions torture then give him to me de taillebourg had said and let hint lead me to the grail kill him afterwards the cardinal had instructed the inquisitor all will be different when we have the grail de taillebourg had said evasively he still did not know whether he would have to kill this thin young man with the sundark skin and the black eyes and the narrow face who had once called himself the harlequin he had adopted the name out of pride because harlequins were lost souls but de taillebourg believed he might well have saved this harlequins soul the harlequins real name was guy vexille count of astarac and it had been guy vexille whom de taillebourg had been describing when he spoke to brother collimore about the man who had come from the south to fight for france in picardy vexille had been seized after the battle when the french king had been looking for scapegoats and a man who dared display the crest of a family declared heretic and rebel had made a good scapegoat vexille had been given to the inquisition in the expectation that they would torture the heresy out of him but de taillebourg had liked the harlequin he had recognized a fellow soul a hard man a dedicated man a man who knew that this life meant nothing because all that counted was the next and so de taillebourg had spared vexille the agonies he had merely shown him the chamber where men and women screamed their apologies to god and then he had questioned him gently and vexille had revealed how he had once sailed to england to find the grail and though he had killed his uncle thomass father he had not found it now with de taillebourg he had listened to eleanor tell thomass story did you believe her the dominican now asked i believed her vexille said but was she deceived the inquisitor wondered eleanor had told them that thomas had been charged to seek the grail but that his faith was weak and his search halfhearted we shall still have to kill him de taillebourg added of course de taillebourg frowned you do not mind killing guy vexille sounded surprised that de taillebourg should even ask killing is my job father the harlequin said cardinal bessieres had decreed that everyone who sought the grail should be killed all except those who sought it on the cardinals own behalf and guy vexille had willingly become gods murderer he certainly had no qualms about slitting his cousin thomass throat you want to wait here for him he asked the inquisitor the girl said he would be in the cathedral after the battle de taillebourg looked across to the hill the scots would win he was sure and that made it doubtful that thomas of hookton would come to the city more likely he would flee southwards in panic we shall go to hookton i searched hookton once guy vexille said then you will search it again de taillebourg snapped yes father guy vexille humbly lowered his head he was a sinner it was required of him that he show penitence and so he did not argue he just did de taillebourgs bidding and his reward he had been promised would be reinstatement he would be given back his pride allowed to lead men to war again and forgiven by the church we shall leave now de taillebourg said he wanted to go before william douglas came in search of them and even more urgently before anyone discovered the three bodies in the hospital cell the dominican had closed the door on the corpses and doubtless the monks would believe collimore was sleeping and so would not disturb him but de taillebourg still wanted to be free of the city when the bodies were found and so he pulled himself into the saddle of one of the horses they had stolen from jamie douglas that morning it seemed a long time ago now he pushed his shoes into the stirrups then kicked a beggar away the man had been clawing at de taillebourgs leg whining that he was hungry but now reeled away from the priests savage thrust the noise of battle swelled the dominican looked at the ridge again but the fight was none of his business if the english and the scots wished to maul each other then let them he had greater matters on his mind matters of god and the grail and of heaven and hell he had sins on his conscience too but they would be shriven by the holy father and even heaven would understand those sins once he had found the grail the gates of the city though strongly guarded were open so that the wounded could be brought inside and food and drink carried to the ridge the guards were older men and had been ordered to make certain that no scottish raiders tried to enter the city but they had not been charged to stop anyone leaving and so they took no notice of the haggard priest with the bruised face mounted on a warhorse nor of his elegant servant so de taillebourg and the harlequin rode out of durham turned towards the york road put back their heels and as the sound of battle echoed from the citys crag rode away southwards it was midafternoon when the scots attacked a second time but this assault unlike the first did not come hard on the heels of fleeing archers instead the archers were drawn up ready to receive the charge and this time the arrows flew thick as starlings those on the scottish left who had so nearly broken the english line were now faced by twice as many archers and their charge which had begun so confidently slowed to a crawl and then stopped altogether as men crouched behind shields the scottish right never advanced at all while the kings central sheltron was checked fifty paces from the stone wall behind which a crowd of archers sent an incessant shower of arrows the scots would not retreat they could not advance and for a time the longshafted arrows thumped onto shields and into carelessly exposed bodies then lord robert stewarts men edged back out of range and the kings sheltron followed and so another pause came over the redearthed battlefield the drums were silent and no more insults were being shouted across the littered pastureland the scottish lords those who still lived gathered under their kings saltire banner and the archbishop of york seeing his enemies in council called his own lords together the englishmen were gloomy the enemy they reasoned would never expose themselves to what the archbishop described as a third baptism of arrows the bastards will slink off northwards the archbishop predicted god damn their bloody souls then we follow them lord percy said they move faster than us the archbishop said he had taken off his helmet and its leather liner had left an indentation in his hair circling his skull well slaughter their foot another lord said wolfishly damn their infantry the archbishop snapped impatient with such foolery he wanted to capture the scottish lords the men mounted on the swiftest and most expensive horses for it was their ransoms that would make him rich and he especially wanted to capture those scottish nobles like the earl of menteith who had sworn fealty to edward of england and whose presence in the enemy army proved their treachery such men would not be ransomed but would be executed as an example to other men who broke their oaths but if the archbishop was victorious today then he could lead this small army into scotland and take the traitors estates he would take everything from them the timber from their parks the sheets from their beds the beds themselves the slates off their roofs their pots their pans their cattle even the rushes from their streambeds but they wont attack again the archbishop said then we shall have to be clever lord outhwaite put in cheerfully the other lords looked suspiciously at outhwaite cleverness was not a quality they prized for it hunted no boars killed no stags enjoyed no women and took no prisoners churchmen could be clever and doubtless there were clever fools at oxford and even women could be clever so long as they did not flaunt it but on a battlefield cleverness clever lord neville asked pointedly they fear our archers lord outhwaite said but if our archers are seen to have few arrows then that fear will go and they might well attack again indeed indeed the archbishop began and then stopped for he was quite as clever as lord outhwaite clever enough indeed to hide how clever he was but how would we convince them he asked lord outhwaite obliged the archbishop by explaining what he suspected the archbishop had already grasped i think your grace that if our archers are seen scavenging the field for arrows then the enemy will draw the correct conclusion or in this case the archbishop laid it on broadly for the benefit of the other lords the incorrect conclusion oh thats good one of those other lords said warmly it could be made even better your grace lord outhwaite suggested diffidently if our horses were brought forward the enemy might then assume we were readying ourselves to flee the archbishop did not hesitate bring all the horses up he said but a lord was frowning archers to scavenge for arrows squires and pages to bring up the horses for the menatarms the archbishop snapped understanding completely what lord outhwaite had in mind and eager to put it into effect before the enemy decided to withdraw northwards lord outhwaite gave the orders to the bowmen himself and within a few moments scores of archers were out in the space between the armies where they gathered spent arrows some of the archers grumbled calling it tomfoolery because they felt exposed to the scottish troops who once again began to jeer them one archer farther forward than most was struck in the chest by a crossbow quarrel and he fell to his knees a look of astonishment on his face and choked up blood into his cupped palm then he began weeping and that only made the choking worse and then a second man going to help the first was hit in the thigh by the same crossbow the scots were howling their derision at the wounded men then cowered as a dozen english archers loosed arrows at the lone crossbowman save your arrows save your arrows lord outhwaite mounted on his horse roared at the bowmen he galloped closer to them save your arrows for gods sake save them he was bellowing loud enough for the enemy to hear him then a group of scotsmen tired of sheltering from the archers ran forward in an evident attempt to cut off lord outhwaites retreat and all the english scampered for their own line lord outhwaite put back his spurs and easily evaded the rush of men who contented themselves with butchering the two wounded archers the rest of the scots seeing the english run laughed and jeered lord outhwaite turned and gazed at the two dead bowmen we should have brought those lads in he chided himself no one answered some of the archers were looking resentfully at the menatarms supposing that their horses had been brought up to aid their flight but then lord outhwaite barked at groups of archers to get behind the menatarms line up at the back not all of you were trying to make them believe were short of arrows and if you didnt have arrows you wouldnt be standing out in front now would you hold the horses where they are he shouted this last order to the squires pages and servants who had brought up the destriers the menatarms were not to mount yet the horses were simply being held at the back of the line just behind the place where half the archers now formed the enemy seeing the horses must conclude that the english short of arrows were contemplating flight and so the simple trap was baited a silence fell on the battlefield except that the wounded were moaning ravens calling and some women crying the monks began to chant again but they were still on the english left and to thomas now on the right the sound was faint a bell rang in the city i do fear were being too clever outhwaite remarked to thomas his lordship was not a man who could keep silent and there was no one else in the righthand division convenient for conversation and so he selected thomas he sighed it doesnt always work being clever it worked for us in brittany my lord you were in brittany as well as picardy lord outhwaite asked he was still mounted and was gazing over the menatarms towards the scots i served a clever man there my lord and who was that lord outhwaite was pretending to be interested perhaps regretting that he had even begun the conversation will skeat my lord only hes sir william now the king knighted him at the battle will skeat lord outhwaite was engaged now you served will by the good lord you did dear william i havent heard that name in many a year how is he not well my lord thomas said and he told how will skeat a commoner who had become the leader of a band of archers and menatarms vho were feared wherever men spoke french had been grievously wounded at the battle in picardy he was taken to caen my lord lord outhwaite frowned thats back in french hands surely a frenchman took him there my lord thomas explained a friend because theres a doctor in the city who can work miracles at the end of the battle when men could at last think they had lived through the horror skeats skull had been opened to the sky and when thomas had last seen him skeat had been dumb blind and powerless i dont know why the french make better physicians lord outhwaite said in mild annoyance but it seems they do my father always said they did and he had much trouble with his phlegm this mans jewish my lord and with his shoulders jewish did you say jewish lord outhwaite sounded alarmed i have nothing against jews he vvent on though without conviction but i can think of a dozen good reasons why one should never resort to a jewish physician truly my lord my dear fellow how can they harness the power of the saints or the healing properties of relics or the efficacy of holy water even prayer is a mystery to them my mother rest her soul had great pain in her knees too much praying i always thought but her physician ordered her to wrap her legs in cloths that had been placed on the grave of st cuthbert and to pray thrice a day to st gregory of nazianzus and it worked it worked but no jew could prescribe such a cure could he and if he did it would be blasphemous and bound to fail i must say i think it most ill advised to have placed poor will into a jews hands he deserves better indeed he does he shook his head reprovingly will served my father for a time but was too smart a fellow to stay cooped up on the scottish border not enough plunder you see went off on his own he did poor will the jewish doctor thomas said stubbornly cured me we can only pray lord outhwaite ignored thomass claim and spoke in a tone which suggested that prayer though needful would almost certainly prove useless then he cheered up suddenly ah i think our friends are stirring the scottish drums had begun to beat and all along the enemys line men were hitching up shields dropping visors or hefting swords they could see that the english had brought their horses closer presumably to aid their retreat and that the enemy line was apparently stripped of half its archers so they must have believed that those bowmen were perilously short of missiles yet the scots still chose to advance on foot knowing that even a handful of arrows could madden their horses and throw a mounted charge into chaos they shouted as they advanced as much to hearten themselves as put fear in the english but they became more confident when they reached the place where the bodies lay from their last charge and still no arrows flew not yet lads not yet lord outhwaite had taken command of the archers on the right wing the lords percy and neville commanded here yet both were content to allow the older man give orders to the bowmen while they waited with their menatarms lord outhwaite glanced constantly across the field to where the scots advanced on the english left wing where his own men were but he was satisfied that the hollow of ground would go on protecting them just as the stone wall shielded the centre it was here on the side of the ridge closest to durham where the scots were strongest and the english most vulnerable let them get closer he warned the archers we want to finish them off once and for all poor fellows he began tapping his fingers on his saddles pommel keeping time with the few remaining big scottish drums and waiting until the front rank of scots was only a hundred paces away foremost archers he called when he judged the enemy was close enough thats you fellows in front of the line start shooting about half the archers were in plain sight in the armys front and they now drew their bows cocked the arrows up into the air and loosed the scots seeing the volley coming began to run hoping to close the range quickly so that only a handful of the arrows would hurt all archers lord outhwaite boomed fearing he had waited too long and the archers who had been concealed behind the menatarms began to shoot over the heads of the troops in front the scots were close now close enough so that even the worst archer could not fail to hit his mark so close that the arrows were again piercing through mail and bodies and strewing the ground with more wounded and dying men thomas could hear the arrows striking home some clanged off armour some thumped into shields but many made a sound like a butchers axe when it slaughtered cattle at winters coming he aimed at a big man whose visor was raised and sent an arrow down his throat another arrow into a tribesman whose face was contorted with hate then an arrows pock split on him spinning the broken missile away when he released the string he plucked the feathered scraps from the string took a new arrow and drove it into another bearded tribesman who was all fury and hair a mounted scotsman was encouraging his men forward and then he was flailing in the saddle struck by three arrows and thomas loosed another shaft striking a manatarms clean in the chest so that the point ripped through mail leather bone and flesh his next arrow sank into a shield the scots were floundering trying to force themselves into the rain of death steady boys steady an archer called to his fellows fearing they were snatching at the strings and thus not using the full force of their bows keep shooting lord outhwaite called his fingers still tapped the pommel of his saddle though the scottish drums were faltering lovely work lovely work horses lord percy ordered he could see that the scots were on the edge of despair for the english archers were not after all short of arrows horses he bellowed again and his menatarms ran back to haul themselves into saddles pages and squires handed up the big heavy lances as men fiddled armoured feet into stirrups glanced at the suffering enemy and then snapped down their visors shoot shoot lord outhwaite called thats the way lads the arrows were pitiless the scottish wounded cried to god called for their mothers and still the feathered death hammered home one man wearing the lion of stewart spewed a pink mist of blood and spittle he was on his knees but managed to stand took a step fell to his knees again shuffled forward blew more bloodstained bubbles and then an arrow buried itself in his eye and went through his brain to scrape against the back of his skull and he went backwards as though hit by a thunderbolt then the great horses came for england edward and st george lord percy called and a trumpeter took up the challenge as the great destriers charged they unceremoniously thrust the archers aside as the lances dropped the turf shook only a few horsemen were attacking but the shock of their charge struck the enemy with stunning force and the scots reeled back lances were relinquished in mens bodies as the knights drew swords and hacked down at frightened cowering men who could not run because the press of bodies was too great more horsemen were mounting up and those menatarms who did not want to wait for their stallions were running fonvard to join the carnage the archers joined them drawing swords or swinging axes the drums were at last silent and the slaughter had begun thomas had seen it happen before he had seen how in an egeblink a battle could change the scots had been pressing all day they had so nearly shattered the english they were rampant and winning yet now they were beaten and the men of the scottish left who had come so close to giving their king his victory were the ones who broke the english warhorses galloped into their ranks to make bloody lanes and the riders swung swords axes clubs and morningstars at panicked men the english archers joined in mobbing the slower scots like packs of hounds leaping onto deer prisoners lord percy shouted at his retainers i want prisoners a scotsman swung an axe at his horse missed and was chopped down by his lordships sword an archer finished the job with a knife and then slit the mans padded jerkin to search for coins two carpenters from durham hacked with woodworkers adzes at a struggling manatarms bludgeoning his skull killing him slowly an archer reeled back gasping his belly cut open and a scot followed him screaming in rage but then was tripped by a bowstave and went down under a swarm of men the trappers of the english horses were dripping with blood as their riders turned to cut their way back through the scottish host they had ridden clean through and now spurred back to meet the next wave of english menatarms who fought with visors open for the panicking enemy was not offering any real resistance yet the scottish right and centre were intact the right had again been pushed into the low ground but now instead of archers fighting them from the rim they faced the english menatarms who were foolish enough to go down into the hollow to meet the scottish charge mailed men clashed over the bodies of the scottish dead clambering awkwardly in their metal suits to swing swords and axes against shields and skulls men grunted as they killed they snarled attacked and died in the muddy bracken yet the fight was futile for if either side gained an advantage they only pressed their enemy back up the slope and immediately the losing side had the ground as their ally and they would press back downhill and more dead joined the corpses in the hollows bottom and so the fight surged forward and back each great swing leaving men weeping and dying calling on jesus cursing their enemy bleeding beggar was there a great rock of a man who stood astride the corpse of the earl of moray mocking the scots and inviting them to fight and half a dozen came and were killed before a pack of highland clansmen came screaming to kill him and he roared at them swinging his huge spiked mace and to the scarecrow watching from above he looked like a great shaggy bear assailed by mastiffs sir william douglas too canny to be caught a second time in the low ground also watched from the opposing rim and was amazed that men would go willingly down to the slaughter then knowing that the battle would neither be won nor lost in that pit of death he turned back to the centre where the kings sheltron still had a chance of gaining a great victory despite the disaster on the scottish left for the kings men had got past the stone wall in places they had pulled it down and in others it had at last collapsed before the press of men and though the fallen stones still presented a formidable obstacle to soldiers cumbered by heavy shields and coats of mail they were clambering across and thrusting back the english centre the scots had charged into the arrows endured them and even trapped a score of archers whom they slaughtered gleefully and now they hacked and stabbed their way towards the archbishops great banner the king his visor sticky with blood from his wounded cheek was in the forefront of the sheltron the kings chaplain was beside his master wielding a spiked club and sir william and his nephew joined the attack sir william was suddenly ashamed of the premonition that had made him advise a retreat this was how scotsmen fought with passion and savagery the english centre was reeling back scarce holding its ranks sir william saw that the enemy had fetched their horses close up to the battle line and he surmised they were readying themselves to flee and so he redoubled his efforts kill them he roared if the scots could break the line then the english would be in chaos unable to reach their horses and mere meat for the butchers kill kill the king conspicuous on horseback shouted at his men prisoners the earl of monteith more sensible called take prisoners break them break them now sir william roared he slammed his shield forward to receive a sword stroke stabbed beneath it and felt his blade pierce a mail coat he turned the sword and jerked it free before the flesh could grip the steel he pushed with his shield unable to see over its top rim felt the enemy stagger back lowered the shield in anticipation of a lunge underneath then rammed it forward again throwing the enemy back he stumbled forward almost losing his footing by tripping on the man he had wounded but he caught his weight by dropping the bottom edge of the shield on the ground pushed himself upright and thrust the sword into a bearded face the blade glanced off the cheekbone taking an eye and that man fell backwards mouth agape abandoning the fight sir william half ducked to avoid an axe blow caught another sword on his shield and stabbed wildly towards the two men attacking him robbie swearing and cursing killed the axeman then kicked a fallen manatarms in the face sir william lunged underhand and felt his sword scrape on broken mail and he twisted to stop the blade being trapped and yanked it back so that a gush of blood spilled through the metal rings of the wounded mans armour that man fell gasping and twitching and more englishmen came from the right desperate to stop the scottish attack that threatened to pierce clean through the archbishops line douglas sir william roared douglas he was calling on his followers to come and support him to shove and to gouge and to hack the last enemy down he and his nephew had carved a bloody path deep into the archbishops ranks and it would take only a moments fierce fighting to break the english centre and then the real slaughter could begin sir william ducked as another axe flailed at him robbie killed that man driving his sword through the axemans throat but robbie immediately had to parry a spear thrust and in doing it he staggered back against his uncle sir william shoved his nephew upright and hammered his shield into an enemys face where the hell were his men douglas sir william thundered again douglas and just then a sword or spear tangled his feet and he fell and instinctively he covered himself with the shield men pounded past him and he prayed that they were his followers who were breaking the last english resistance and he waited for the enemys screaming to begin but instead there was an insistent tap on his helmet the tapping stopped then started again sir william a gentle voice enquired the screaming had begun so sir william could scarcely hear but the gentle tapping on the crown of his helmet persuaded him it was safe to lower his shield it took him a moment to see what was happening for his helmet had been wrenched askew when he fell and he had to pull it round gods teeth he said when the world came into view dear sir william the kindly voice said i assume you yield of course you do and is that young robbie my how youve grown young man i remember you as a pup oh gods teeth sir william said again looking up at lord outhwaite can i give you a hand lord outhwaite asked solicitously reaching down from his saddle and then we can talk ransoms jesus sir william said god damn it for he understood now that the feet pounding past had been english feet and that the screaming was coming from the scots the english centre had held after all and for the scots the battle had turned to utter disaster it was the archers again the scots had lost men all day and still they outnumbered their enemy but they had no answer to the arrows and when the scottish centre broke down the wall and surged across its remains so the scottish left had retreated and exposed the flank of the kings sheltron to the english arrows it took a few moments for the bowmen to realize their advantage they had joined the pursuit of the broken scottish left and were unaware how close to victory was the scottish centre but then one of lord nevilles men understood the danger archers his roar could be heard clear across the wear in durham archers men broke off their plundering and pulled arrows from the bags the bows began sounding again each deep harp note driving an arrow into the flank of the rampaging scots davids sheltron had forced the central english battle back across a pasture they had stretched it thin and they were closing on the archbishops great banner and then the arrows began to bite and after the arrows came the menatarms from the english right wing the retainers of lord percy and of lord neville and some were already mounted on their big horses that were trained to bite rear and kick with their ironshod hooves the archers discarding their bows yet again followed the horsemen with axes and swords and this time their women came as well with knives unsheathed the scottish king hacked at an englishman saw him fall then heard his standardbearer shout in terror and he turned to see the great banner falling the standardbearers horse had been hamstrung it screamed as it collapsed and a rabble of archers and menatarms clawed at man and beast snatched at the banner and hauled the standardbearer down to a ghastly death but then the royal chaplain seized the reins of the kings horse and dragged david bruce out of the melee more scotsmen gathered about their king escorting him away and behind them the english were hacking down from saddles chopping with their swords cursing as they killed and the king tried to turn back and continue the fight but the chaplain forced his horse away ride sir ride the chaplain shouted frightened men blundered into the kings horse that trampled on a clansman then stumbled on a corpse there were englishmen in the scottish rear now and the king seeing his danger put back his spurs an enemy knight took a swing at him but the king parried the blow and galloped past the danger his army had disintegrated into groups of desperate fugitives he saw the earl of menteith try to mount a horse but an archer seized his lordships leg and hauled him back then sat on him and put a knife to his throat the earl shouted that he yielded the earl of fife was a prisoner the earl of strathearn was dead the earl of wigtown was being assailed by two english knights whose swords rang on his plate armour like blacksmiths hammers one of the big scottish drums its skins split and tattered rolled down the hill going faster and faster as the slope steepened thumping hollow on the rocks until at last it fell sideways and slid to a halt the kings great banner was in english hands now as were the standards of a dozen scottish lords a few scots galloped north lord robert stewart who had so nearly won the day was free and clear on the eastern side of the ridge while the king plunged down the western side going into shadow because the sun was now lower than the hills towards which he rode in desperate need of refuge he thought of his wife was she pregnant he had been told that lord robert had hired a witch to lay a spell on her womb so that the throne would pass from bruce to stewart sir sir one of his men was screaming at him and the king came out of his reverie to see a group of english archers already down in the valley how had they headed him off he pulled on the reins leaned right to help the horse round and felt the arrow thump into the stallions chest another of his men was down tumbling along the stony ground that was tearing his mail into bright shreds a horse screamed blood fanned across the dusk and another arrow slammed into the kings shield that was slung on his back a third arrow was caught in his horses mane and the stallion was slowing plunging up and down as it laboured for breath the king struck back with his spurs but the horse could not go faster he grimaced and the gesture opened the crusted wound on his cheek so that blood spilled from his open visor down his ripped surcoat the horse stumbled again there was a stream ahead and a small stone bridge and the king marvelled that anyone should make a masonry bridge over so slight a watercourse and then the horses front legs just collapsed and the king was rolling on the ground miraculously free of his dying mount and without any broken bones and he scrambled up and ran to the bridge where three of his men waited on horseback one with a riderless stallion but even before the king could reach the three men the arrows flickered and hammered home each one making the horses stagger sideways from the shock of its impact the stallion screamed tore itself free of the mans grasp and galloped eastwards with blood dripping from its belly another horse collapsed with an arrow deep in its rump two in its belly and another in its jugular under the bridge the king shouted there would be shelter under the arch a place to hide and when he had a dozen men he would make a break for it dusk could not be far off and if they waited for nightfall and then walked all night they might be in scotland by dawn so four scotsmen one of them a king huddled under the stone bridge and caught their breath the arrows had stopped flying their horses were all dead and the king dared to hope that the english archers had gone in search of other prey we wait here he whispered he could hear screams from the high ground he could hear hooves on the slope but none sounded close to the little low bridge he shuddered realizing the magnitude of the disaster his army was gone his great hopes were nothing the christmas feast would not be in london and scotland lay open to its enemies he peered northwards a group of clansmen splashed through the stream and suddenly six english horsemen appeared and drove their destriers off the high bank and the big swords hacked down and there was blood swirling downstream to run around the kings mailed feet and he shrank back into the shadows as the menatarms spurred westwards to find more fugitives horses clattered over the bridge and the four scotsmen said nothing dared not even look at each other until the sound of the hooves had faded a trumpet was calling from the ridge and its note was hateful triumphant and scornful the king closed his eyes because he feared he would shed tears you must see a physician sir a man said and the king opened his eyes to see it was one of his servants who had spoken this cant be cured the king said meaning scotland the cheek will mend sir the servant said reassuringly the king stared at his retainer as though the man had spoken in some strange foreign tongue and then terribly and suddenly his badly wounded cheek began to hurt there had been no pain all day but now it was agony and the king felt tears well from his eyes not from pain but shame and then as he tried to blink the tears away there were shouts falling shadows and the splash of boots as men jumped from the bridge the attackers had swords and spears and they plunged under the bridges arch like otterhunters come to the kill and the king roared his defiance and leaped at the man who was in front and his rage was such that he forgot to draw his sword and instead punched the man with his armoured fist and he felt the englishmans teeth crunch under the blow saw the blood spurt and he drove the man down into the stream hammering him and then he could not move because other men were pinioning him the man beneath him half drowned with broken teeth and bloodied lips began to laugh for he had taken a prisoner and he would be rich he had captured the king part two england and normandy the winter siege it was dark in the cathedral so dark that the bright colours painted on the pillars and walls had faded into blackness the only light came from the candles on the side altars and from beyond the rood screen where flames shivered in the choir and blackrobed monks chanted their voices wove a spell in the dark twining and falling surging and rising a sound that would have brought tears to thomass eyes if he had possessed any tears left to shed libera me domine de morte aeterna the monks intoned as the candle smoke twisted up to the cathedrals roof deliver me lord from everlasting death and on the flagstones of the choir lay the coffin in which brother hugh collimore lay undelivered his hands crossed on his tunic his eves closed and unknown to the prior a pagan coin placed beneath his tongue by one of the other monks who feared the devil would take collimores soul if the ferryman who carried the souls of the departed across the river of the afterworld was not paid requiem aeternam dona eis domine the monks chanted requesting the lord to give brother collimore eternal rest and in the city beneath the cathedral in the small houses that clung to the side of the rock there was weeping for so many durham men had been killed in the battle but the weeping was as nothing to the tears that would be shed when the news of the disaster returned to scotland the king was taken prisoner and so was sir william douglas and the earls of fife and of menteith and of wigtown and the earl of moray was dead as was the constable of scotland and the kings marshal and the kings chamberlain all of them butchered their bodies stripped naked and mocked by their enemies and with them were hundreds of their countrymen their white flesh laced bloody and food now for foxes and wolves and dogs and ravens the gorestained scottish standards were on the altar of durhams cathedral and the remnants of davids great army were fleeing through the night and on their heels were the vengeful english going to ravage and plunder the lowlands to take back what had been stolen and then to steal some more et lux perpetua lucent cis the monks chanted praying that eternal light would shine upon the dead monk while on the ridge the other dead lay beneath the dark where the white owls shrieked you must confide in me the prior hissed at thomas at the back of the cathedral small candles flickered on the scores of side altars where priests many of them refugees from nearby villages sacked by the scots said masses for the dead the latin of those rural priests was often execrable a source of amusement to the cathedrals own clergy and to the prior who sat beside thomas on a stone ledge i am your superior in god the prior insisted but still thomas stayed silent and the prior became angry the king has commanded you the bishops letter says so so tell me what you seek i want my woman back thomas said and he was glad it was dark in the cathedral for his eyes were red from crying eleanor was dead and father hobbe was dead and brother collimore was dead all of them knifed and no one knew by whom though one of the monks spoke of a dark man a servant who had come with the foreign priest and thomas was remembering the messenger he had seen in the dawn and eleanor had been alive then and they had not quarrelled and now she was dead and it was his fault his fault the sorrow came to him overwhelmed him and he howled his misery at the cathedrals nave be quiet said the prior shocked at the noise i loved her there are other women hundreds of them disgusted he made the sign of the cross what did the king send you to find i order you to tell me she was pregnant thomas said gazing up into the roof and i was going to marry her his soul felt as empty and dark as the space above him i order you to tell me the prior repeated in the name of god i order you if the king wishes you to know what i seek thomas spoke in french though the prior had been using english then the king will be pleased to tell you the prior stared angrily towards the rood screen the french language tongue of aristocrats had silenced him making him wonder who this archer was two menatarms their mail clinking slightly walked across the flagstones on their way to thank st cuthbert for their survival most of the english army was far to the north resting through the dark hours before resuming their pursuit of the beaten enemy but some knights and menatarms had come to the city where they guarded the valuable prisoners who had been placed in the bishops residence in the castle perhaps the prior thought the treasure that thomas of hookton sought was no longer important after all a king had been captured along with half the earls of scotland and their ransoms would wring that wretched country dry yet he could not rid himself of the word thesaurus a treasure and the church was ever in need of money he stood you forget he said coldly that you are my guest i do not forget thomas said he had been given space in the monks guest quarters or rather in their stables for there were greater men who needed the warmer rooms i do not forget he said again tiredly the prior now gazed up into the roofs high darkness perhaps he suggested you know more of brother collimores murder than you pretend thomas did not answer the priors words were nonsense and the prior knew it for he and thomas had both been on the battlefield when the old monk had been killed and thomass grief over eleanors murder was heartfelt but the prior was angry and frustrated and he spoke unthinkingly hopes of treasure did that to a man you will stay in durham the prior commanded until i give you permission to leave i have given instructions that your horse is to be kept in my stables you understand me i understand you thomas said tiredly then he watched the prior walk away more menatarms were entering the cathedral their heavy swords clattering against pillars and tombs in the shadows behind one of the side altars the scarecrow beggar and dickon watched thomas they had been shadowing him since the battles end sir geoffrey was wearing a fine coat of mail now which he had taken from a dead scotsman and he had debated whether to join the pursuit but instead had sent a sergeant and a halfdozen men with orders to take whatever they could when the pillage of scotland began sir geoffrey himself was gambling that thomass treasure because it had interested a king would be worthy of his own interest and so he had decided to follow the archer thomas oblivious of the scarecrows gaze bent forward eves tight shut thinking he would never be whole again his back and arm muscles burned from a day of drawing a bow and the fingers of his right hand were scraped raw by the cord if he closed his eyes he saw nothing but scotsmen coming towards him and the bow making a dark line down memorys picture and the white of the arrows feathers dwindling in their flight and then that picture would vanish and he would see eleanor writhing under the knife that had tortured her they had made her speak yet what did she know that thomas had doubted the grail that he was a reluctant searcher that he only wanted to be a leader of archers and that he had let his woman and his friend go to their deaths a hand touched the back of his head and thomas almost hurled himself aside in the expectation of something worse a blade perhaps but then a voice spoke and it was lord outhwaite come outside young man he ordered thomas somewhere that the scarecrow cant overhear us he said that loudly and in english then softened his tone and used french ive been looking for you he touched thomass arm encouraging him i heard about your girl and i was sorry she was a pretty thing she was my lord her voice suggested she was well born lord outhwaite said so her family will doubtless help you exact revenge her father is titled my lord but she was his bastard ah lord outhwaite stumped along helping his limping gait with the spear he had carried for most of the day then he probably wont help will he but you can do it on your own you seem capable enough his lordship had taken thomas into a cold fresh night a high moon flirted with silveredged clouds while on the western ridge great fires burned to plume a veil of redtouched smoke above the city the fires lit the battlefield for the men and women of durham who searched the dead for plunder and knifed the scottish wounded to make them dead so they could also be plundered im too old to join a pursuit lord outhwaite said staring at the distant fires too old and too stiff in the joints its a young mans hunt and theyll pursue them all the way to edinburgh have you ever seen edinburgh castle no my lord thomas spoke dully not caring if he ever saw edinburgh or its castle oh its fine very fine lord outhwaite said enthusiastically sir william douglas captured it from us he smuggled men past the gate inside barrels great big barrels a clever man eh and now hes my prisoner lord outhwaite peered at the castle as though he expected to see sir william douglas and the other highborn scottish captives shinning down from the battlements two torches in slanting metal cressets lit the entrance where a dozen menatarms stood guard a rogue our william a rogue why is the scarecrow following you ive no idea my lord i think you do his lordship rested against a pile of stone the area by the cathedral was heaped with stone and timber for the builders were repairing one of the great towers he knows you seek a treasure so he now seeks it too thomas paid attention to that looking sharply at his lordship then looking back at the cathedral sir geoffrey and his two men had come to the door but they evidently dared not venture any closer for fear of lord outhwaites displeasure how can he know thomas asked how can he not know lord outhwaite asked the monks know about it and thats as good as asking a herald to announce it monks gossip like market wives so the scarecrow knows you might be the source of great wealth and he wants it what is this treasure just treasure my lord though i doubt it has great intrinsic worth lord outhwaite smiled he said nothing for a while but just stared across the dark gulf above the river you told me did you not he said finally that the king sent you in the company of a household knight and a chaplain from the royal household yes my lord and they fell ill in london they did a sickly place i was there twice and twice is more than enough noxious my pigs live in cleaner conditions but a royal chaplain eh no doubt a clever fellow not a country priest eh not some ignorant peasant tricked out with a phrase or two of latin but a rising man a fellow wholl be a bishop before long if he survives his fever now why would the king send such a man you must ask him my lord a royal chaplain no less lord outhwaite went on as though thomas had not spoken then he fell silent a scatter of stars showed between the clouds and he gazed up at them then sighed once he said a long time ago i saw a crystal vial of our lords blood it was in flanders and it liquefied in answer to prayer theres another vial in gloucestershire im told but ive not seen that one i did once stroke the beard of st jerome in nantes ive held a hair from the tail of balaams ass ive kissed a feather from the wing of st gabriel and brandished the very jawbone with which samson slew so many philistines i have seen a sandal of st paul a fingernail from mary magdalene and six fragments of the true cross one of them stained by the very same holy blood that i saw in flanders i have glimpsed the bones of the fishes with which our lord fed the five thousand i have felt the sharpness of one of the arrow heads that felled st sebastian and smelt a leaf from the apple tree of the garden of eden in my own chapel young man i have a knuckle bone of st thomas and a hinge from the box in which the frankincense was given to the christ child that hinge cost me a great deal of money a great deal so tell me thomas what relic is more precious than all those i have seen and all those i hope to see in the great churches of christendom thomas stared at the fires on the ridge where so many dead lay was eleanor in heaven already or was she doomed to spend thousands of years in purgatory that thought reminded him that he had to pay for masses to be said for her soul you stay silent lord outhwaite observed but tell me young man do you think i really possess a hinge from the christ childs tov box of frankincense i wouldnt know my lord i sometimes doubt it lord outhwaite said genially but my wife believes and thats what matters belief if you believe a thing possesses gods power then it will work its power for you he paused his great shaggy head raised to the darkness as if he smelt for enemies i think you search for a thing of gods power a great thing and i believe that the devil is trying to stop you satan himself is stirring his creatures to thwart you lord outhwaite turned an anxious face on thomas this strange priest and his dark servant are the devils minions and so is sir geoffrey he is an imp of satan if ever there was one he threw a glance towards the cathedrals porch where the scarecrow and his two henchmen had retreated into the shadows as a procession of cowled monks came into the night satan is working mischief lord outhwaite said and you must fight it do you have sufficient funds after the talk of the devil the commonplace question about funds surprised thomas do i have funds my lord if the devil fights you young man then i would help you and few things in this world are more helpful than money you have a search to make you have journeys to finish and you will need funds so do you have enough no my lord thomas said then permit me to help you lord outhwaite placed a bag of coins on the pile of stones and perhaps you would take a companion on your search a companion thomas asked still bemused not me not me im much too old lord outhwaite chuckled no but i confess i am fond of willie douglas the priest who i think killed your woman also killed douglass nephew and douglas wants revenge he asks no he begs that the dead mans brother be permitted to travel with you hes a prisoner surely i suppose he is but young robbies hardly worth ransoming i suppose i might fetch a few pounds for him but nothing like the fortune i intend to exact for his uncle no id rather robbie travelled with you he wants to find the priest and his servant and i think he could help you lord outhwaite paused and when thomas did not answer he pressed his request hes a good young man robbie i know him i like him and hes capable a good soldier too im told thomas shrugged at this moment he did not care if half scotland travelled with him he can come with me my lord he said if im allowed to go anywhere what do you mean allowed im not permitted to travel thomas sounded bitter the prior has forbidden me to leave the city and hes taken my horse thomas had found the horse brought into durham by father hobbe tied at the monasterys gate lord outhwaite laughed and you will obey the prior i cant afford to lose a good horse my lord thomas said i have horses lord outhwaite said dismissiyely including two good scottish horses that i took today and at dawn tomorrow the archbishops messengers will ride south to take news of this day to london and three of my men will accompany them i suggest you and robbie go with them that will get the two of you safe to london and after that where will you go after that im going home my lord thomas said to hookton to the village where my father lived and will that murderous priest expect you to go there i cant say he will search for you doubtless he considered waiting for you here but that was too dangerous yet hell want your knowledge thomas and hell torment you to find it sir geoffrey will do the same that wretched scarecrow will do anything for money but i suspect the priest is the more dangerous so i keep my eyes open and my arrows sharp i would be cleverer than that lord outhwaite said i have always found that if a man is hunting you then its best that he finds you in a place of your own choosing dont be ambushed but be ready to ambush him thomas accepted the wisdom of the advice but sounded dubious all the same and how will they know where i go because i will tell them lord outhwaite said or rather when the prior complains that you have disobeyed him by leaving the city i shall tell him and his monks will then inform anyone whose ears they can reach monks are garrulous creatures so where would you like to face your enemies young man at your home no my lord thomas said hastily then thought for a few heartbeats at la rochederrien he went on in brittany lord outhwaite sounded surprised is what you seek in brittany i dont know where it is my lord but i have friends in brittany ah and i trust you will also see me as a friend he pushed the bag of coins towards thomas take it i shall repay you my lord you will repay me his lordship said standing by bringing me the treasure and letting me touch it just once before it goes to the king he glanced at the cathedral where sir geoffrey lurked i think you had better sleep in the castle tonight i have men there who can keep that wretched scarecrow at bay come sir geoffrey carr watched the two men go he could not attack thomas while lord outhwaite was with him for lord outhwaite was too powerful but power the scarecrow knew came from money and it seemed there was treasure adrift in the world treasure that interested the king and now interested lord outhwaite too so the scarecrow come hell or the devil to oppose him intended to find it first thomas was not going to la rochederrien he had lied naming the town because he knew it and because he did not mind if his pursuers went there but he planned to be elsewhere he would go to hookton to see if his father had hidden the grail there and afterwards for he did not expect to find it he would go to france for it was there that the english army laid siege to calais and it was there that his friends were and there that an archer could find proper employment will skeats men were in the siege lines and wills archers had wanted thomas to be their leader and he knew he could do the job he could lead his own band of men be as feared as will skeat was feared he thought about it as he rode southwards though he did not think consistently or well he was too obsessed with the deaths of eleanor and father hobbe and torturing himself with the memory of his last look back at eleanor and his remembrance of that glance meant that he saw the country through which he rode distorted by tears thomas was supposed to ride south with the men carrying the news of the english victory to london but he got no further than york he was supposed to leave york at dawn but robbie douglas had vanished the scotsmans horse was still in the archbishops stables and his baggage was where he had dropped it in the yard but robbie was gone for a moment thomas was tempted to leave the scot behind but some vague sense of resented duty made him stay or perhaps it was that he did not much care for the company of the menatarms who rode with their triumphant news and so he let them go and went to look for his companion he found the scot gaping up at the gilded bosses of the minsters ceiling were supposed to be riding south thomas said aye robbie answered curtly otherwise ignoring thomas thomas waited after a short while i said that were supposed to be riding south so we are robbie agreed and im not stopping you he waved a magnanimous arm ride on youre giving up the hunt for de taillebourg thomas asked he had learned the priests name from robbie no robbie still had his head back as he stared at the magnificence of the transepts ceiling ill find him and then ill gralloch the bastard thomas did not know what gralloch meant but decided the word was bad news for de taillebourg so why the hell are you here robbie frowned he had a shock of curling brown hair and a snub face that at first glance made him look boyish though a second look would detect the strength in his jawline and the hardness of his eyes he at last turned those eyes on thomas what i cant stand he said are those damned laddies those bastards it took a couple of heartbeats before thomas realized he meant the menatarms who had been their companions on the ride from durham to york the men who were now two hours south on the road to london what was wrong with them did you hear them last night did you robbies indignation flared attracting the attention of two men who were on a high trestle where they were painting the feeding of the five thousand on the naves wall and the night before robbie went on they got drunk thomas said but so did we telling how they fought the battle robbie said and to hear the bastards youd think we ran away you did thomas said robbie had not heard him youd think we didnt fight at all boasting they were and we nearly won you hear that he poked an aggressive finger into thomass chest we damn nearly won and those bastards made us sound like cowards you lost thomas said robbie stared at thomas as though he could not believe his ears we drove you back halfway to bloody london had you running we did pissing in your breeks we damn nearly won we did and those bastards are gloating just gloating i wanted to murder the pack of them a score of folk were listening two pilgrims making their way on their knees to the shrine behind the high altar were staring openmouthed at robbie a priest was frowning nervously while a child sucked its thumb and gazed aghast at the shockheaded man who was shouting so loudly you hear me robbie yelled we damn nearly won thomas walked away where are you off to robbie demanded south thomas said he understood robbies embarrassment the messengers carrying news of the battle could not resist embellishing the story of the fight when they were entertained in castle or monastery and so a hardfought savage piece of carnage had become an easy victory no wonder robbie was offended but thomas had small sympathy he turned and pointed at the scotsman you should have stayed at home robbie spat in disgust then became aware of his audience had you running he said hotly then leaped over to catch up with thomas he grinned and there was a sudden and appealing charm in his face i didnt mean to shout at you he said i was just angry me too thomas said but his anger was at himself and it was mingled with guilt and grief that did not lessen as the two rode south they took to the road in mornings heavy with dew rode through autumn mists hunched under the lash of rain and for almost every step of the journey thomas thought of eleanor lord outhwaite had promised to bury her and have masses said for her soul and thomas sometimes wished he was sharing her grave so why is de taillebourg chasing you robbie asked on the day they rode away from york they spoke in english for though robbie was from the noble house of douglas he spoke no french for a time thomas said nothing and just when robbie thought he would not answer at all he gave a snort of derision because he said the bastard believes that my father possessed the grail the grail robbie crossed himself i heard it was in scotland in scotland thomas asked astonished i know genoa claims to have it but scotland and why not robbie bristled mind you he relented ive heard theres one in spain too spain and if the spanish have one robbie said then the french will have to have one as well and for all i know the portuguese too he shrugged then looked back to thomas so did your father have another thomas did not know what to answer his father had been wayward mad brilliant difficult and tortured he had been a great sinner and for all that he might well have been a saint as well father ralph had laughed at the wider reaches of superstition he had mocked the pig bones sold by pardoners as relics of the saints yet he had hung an old blackened and bent spear in his churchs rafters and claimed it was the lance of st george he had never mentioned the grail to thomas but since his death thomas had learned that the history of his family was entwined with the grail in the end he elected to tell robbie the truth i dont know he said i simply dont know robbie ducked under a branch that grew low across the road are you telling me this is the real grail if it exists thomas said and he wondered again if it did he supposed it was possible but wished it was not yet he had been charged with the duty of finding out and so he would seek his fathers one friend and he would ask that man about the grail and when he received the expected answer he would go back to france and join skeats archers will skeat himself his onetime commander and friend was stranded in caen and thomas had no knowledge whether will still lived or if he did whether he could speak or understand or even walk he could find out by sending a letter to sir guillaume devecque eleanors father and will could be given safe passage in return for the release of some minor french nobleman thomas would repay lord outhwaite with money plundered from the enemy and then he told himself he would find his consolation in the practice of his skill in archery in the killing of the kings enemies perhaps de taillebourg would come and find him and thomas would kill him like he would put down a rat as for robbie thomas had decided he liked the scotsman but he did not care whether he stayed or went robbie only understood that de taillebourg would seek thomas and so he would stay at the archers side until he could kill the dominican he had no other ambition just to avenge his brother that was a family duty you touch a douglas he told thomas and well fillet you well skin you alive its a blood feud see even if the killer is the priest its either him or his servant robbie said and the servant obeys the master either way the priests responsible so he dies ill slit his bloody throat he rode for a while in silence then grinned and then ill go to hell but at least therell be plenty of douglases keeping the devil company he laughed it took ten days to reach london and once there robbie pretended to be unimpressed as though scotland had cities of this size in every other valley but after a while he dropped the pretence and just stared in awe at the great buildings crowded streets and serried market stalls thomas used lord outhwaites coins so they could lodge in a tavern just outside the city walls beside the horse pond in smithfield and close to the green where more than three hundred traders had their stalls and its not even market day robbie exclaimed then snatched at thomass sleeve look a juggler was spinning half a dozen balls in the air that was nothing unusual for any county fair would show the same but this man was standing on two swords using them as stilts with his bare feet poised on the swords points how does he do it robbie asked and look a dancing bear was shuffling to the tune of a flute just beneath the gibbet where two bodies hung this was the place where londons felons were brought to be sent on their swift way to hell both corpses were encased in chains to hold the rotting flesh to their bones and the stench of the decaying corpses mingled with the smell of smoke and the reek of the frightened cattle who were bought and sold on the green which stretched between londons wall and the priory of st bartholomew where thomas paid a priest to say masses for the souls of eleanor and father hobbe thomas pretending to robbie that he was far more familiar with london than was the truth had chosen the tavern in smithfield for no other reason than its sign was two crossed arrows this was only his second visit to the city and he was as impressed confused dazzled and surprised as robbie they wandered the streets gaping at churches and noblemens houses and thomas used lord outhwaites money to buy himself some new boots calfskin leggings an oxhide coat and a fine woollen cloak he was tempted by a sleek french razor in an ivory case but not knowing the razors value feared he was being cheated he reckoned he could steal himself a razor from a frenchmans corpse when he reached calais instead he paid a barber to shave him and then dressed in his new finery spent the cost of the unbought razor on one of the taverns women and afterwards lay with tears in his eyes because he was thinking of eleanor is there a reason were in london robbie asked him that night thomas drained his ale and beckoned the girl to bring more its on our way to dorset thats as good a reason as any london was not really on the way from durham to dorchester but the roads to the capital were so much better than those that wandered across the country and so it was quicker to travel through the great city however after three davs thomas knew they must move on and so he and robbie rode westwards they skirted westminster and thomas thought for an idle heartbeat of visiting john prvke the royal chaplain sent to accompany him to durham who had fallen ill in london and now either lived or died in the abbeys hospital but thomas had no stomach to talk of the grail and so he rode on the air became cleaner as they went deeper into the country it was not reckoned safe to travel these roads but thomass face was so grim that other travellers reckoned he was the danger rather than the prey he was unshaven and he dressed as he always had in black and the misery of the last days had put deep lines on his thin face with robbies mass of unkempt hair the two of them looked like any other vagabonds who wandered the roads except these two were fearsomely armed thomas carried his sword bow and arrow bag while robbie had his uncles sword with the scrap of st andrews hair encased in its hilt sir william had reckoned he would have small use for the sword in the next few years while his family attempted to find the vast ransom and so he had lent it to robbie with the encouragement to use it well you think de taillebourg will be in dorset robbie asked thomas as they rode through a stinging rain shower i doubt it so why are we going because he may go there eventually thomas said him and his damn servant he knew nothing about the servant except what robbie had told him that the man was fastidious elegant dark in looks and mysterious but robbie had never heard his name thomas finding it hard to believe that a priest would have killed eleanor had persuaded himself that the servant was the killer and so planned to make the man suffer in agony it was late afternoon when they ducked under the arch of dorchesters east gate a guard there alarmed by their weapons challenged them but backed down when thomas answered in french it suggested he was an aristocrat and the guard sullenly let the two horsemen pass then watched as they climbed east street past all saints church and the county jail the houses grew more prosperous as they neared the towns centre and close to st peters church the woolmerchants homes might not have been out of place in london thomas could smell the shambles behind the houses where the butchers worked their trade then he led robbie into cornhill past the shop of the pewterer who had a stammer and a wall eye then past the blacksmith where he had once bought some arrow heads he knew most of these folk the dogman a legless beggar who had come by his nickname because he lapped water from the river cerne like a dog was heaving down south street on the wooden bricks strapped to his hands dick adyn brother of the towns jailer was driving three sheep up the hill and paused to deliver a genial insult to willie palmer who was closing up his hosiery shop a young priest hurried into an alley with a book wrapped in his arms and averted his eyes from a woman squatting in the gutter a gust of wind blew woodsmoke low into the street dorcas galton brown hair drawn up into a bun shook a rug out of an upstairs window and laughed aloud at something dick adyn said they all spoke in the local accent soft and broad and buzzing like thomass own and he almost curbed the horse to speak with them but dick advn glanced at him and then looked swiftly away and dorcas slammed the window shut robbie looked formidable but thomass gaunt looks were even more frightening and none of the townsfolk recognized him as the bastard son of hooktons last priest they would know him if he introduced himself but war had changed thomas it had given him a hardness that repelled strangers he had left dorset a boy but come back as one of edward of englands prized killers and when he left the town by the south gate a constable gave both him and robbie good riddance and told them to stay away be lucky the pair of you aint in jail the man called emboldened by his municipal coat of mail and ancient spear thomas stopped his horse turned in the saddle and just stared at the man who suddenly found reason to duck back into the alley beside the gate thomas spat and rode on your home town robbie asked caustically not now thomas said and he wondered where home was these days and for some odd reason la rochederrien came unbidden to his thoughts and he found himself remembering jeanette chenier in her great house beside the river jaudy and that recollection of an old love made him feel guilty yet again for eleanor wheres your home town he asked robbie rather than dwell on memories i grew up close to langholm wheres that on the river esk robbie said not far north of the border its a hard country so it is not like this this is a good countryside thomas said mildly he looked up at the high green walls of maiden castle where the devil played on all hallows eve and where the corncrakes now made their harsh song there were ripe blackberries in the hedgerows and as the shadows lengthened fox cubs skittering at the edge of the fields a few miles on and the evening had almost shaded to night but he could smell the sea now and he imagined that he could hear it sucking and surging on the dorset shingle this was the ghost time of day when the souls of the dead flickered at the edges of mens sight and when good folk hurried home to their fire and to their thatch and to their bolted doors a dog howled in one of the villages thomas had thought to ride to down mapperley where sir giles marriott the squire of hookton among other villages had his hall but it was late and he did not think it wise to arrive at the hall after dark besides thomas wanted to see hookton before he spoke with sir giles and so he turned his tired horse towards the sea and led robbie under the high dark loom of lipp hill i killed my first men up on that hill he boasted with the bow four of them thomas said with four arrows that was not entirely true for he must have shot seven or eight arrows maybe more but he had still killed four of the raiders who had come across the channel to pillage hookton and now he was deep in the twilight shadow of hooktons sea valley and he could see the fret of breaking waves flashing white in the late dusk as he rode down beside the stream to the place where his father had preached and died no one lived there now the raiders had left the village dead the houses had been burned the church roof had fallen and the villagers were buried in a graveyard choked by nettles thorn and thistles it was four and a half years since that raiding party had landed at hookton led by thomass cousin guy vexille the count of astarac and by eleanors father sir guillaume devecque thomas had killed four of the crossbowmen and that had been the beginning of his life as an archer he had abandoned his studies at oxford and until this moment had never returned to hookton this was home he told robbie what happened the french happened thomas said and gestured at the darkling sea they sailed from normandy jesus robbie for some reason was surprised he knew that the borderlands of england and scotland were places where buildings were burned cattle stolen women raped and men killed but he had never thought it happened this far south he slid down from his horse and walked to a heap of nettles that had been a cottage there was a village here a fishing village thomas said and he strode down what was once the street to where the nets had been mended and the women had smoked fish his fathers house was a heap of burnedout timbers choked with bindweed now the other cottages were the same their thatch and wattle reduced to ash and soil only the church to the west of the stream was recognizable its gaunt walls open to the sky thomas and robbie tied their horses to hazel saplings in the graveyard then took their baggage into the ruined church it was already too dark to explore yet thomas could not sleep and so he went down to the beach and he remembered that easter morning when the norman ships had grounded on the shingle and the men had come shrieking in the dawn with swords and crossbows axes and fire they had come for the grail guy vexille believed it to be in his uncles possession and so the harlequin had put the village of hookton to the sword he had burned it destroyed it and gone from it without the grail the stream made its little noise as it twisted inside the shingle hook on its way to meet the great sound of the sea thomas sat down on the hook swathed in his new cloak with the great black bow beside him the chaplain john prvke had talked of the grail in the same awed tones that father hobbe had used when he spoke of the relic the grail father pryke said was not just the cup from which christ had drunk wine at the last supper but the vessel into which christs dying blood had poured from the cross longinus father prvke had said in his excitable manner was the centurion beneath the cross and when the spear struck the dolorous blow he raised the dish to catch the blood how thomas wondered did the cup go from the upper room where christ had eaten his last meal into the possession of a roman centurion and stranger still how had it reached ralph vexille he closed his eyes swaying back and forwards ashamed of his disbelief father hobbe had always called him doubting thomas you mustnt seek explanations father hobbe had said again and again because the grail is a miracle it transcends explanations cest une tasse magique eleanor had added implicitly adding her reproof to father hobbes thomas so wanted to believe it was a magic cup he wanted to believe that the grail existed just beyond human sight behind a veil of disbelief a thing half visible shimmering wonderful poised in light and glowing like pale fire he wanted to believe that one day it would take on substance and that from its bowl which had held the wine and the blood of christ would flow peace and healing yet if god wanted the world to be at peace and if he wanted sickness defeated why did he hide the grail father hobbes answer had been that mankind was not worthy to hold the cup and thomas wondered if that was true was anyone worthy and perhaps thomas thought if the grail had any magic then it was to exaggerate the faults and virtues of those who sought it father hobbe had become more saintlike in his pursuit and the strange priest and his dark servant more malevolent it was like one of those crystal lenses that jewellers used to magnify their work only the grail was a crystal that magnified character what thomas wondered did it reveal of his own he remembered his unease at the thought of marrying eleanor and suddenly he began to weep to heave with sobs to cry more than he had already cried since her murder he rocked to and fro his grief as deep as the sea that beat on the shingle and it was made worse by the knowledge that he was a sinner unshriven his soul doomed to hell he missed his woman he hated himself he felt empty alone and doomed and so in his fathers dead village he wept it began to rain later a steady rain that soaked through the new cloak and chilled thomas and robbie to the bone they had lit a fire that flickered feebly in the old church hissing under the rain and giving them a small illusion of warmth are there wolves here robbie asked supposed to be thomas said though i never saw one we have wolves in eskdale robbie said and at night their eyes glow red like fire there are monsters in the sea here thomas said their bodies wash ashore sometimes and you can find their bones in the cliffs sometimes even on calm days men wouldnt come back from fishing and youd know the monsters had taken them he shivered and crossed himself when my grandfather died robbie said the wolves circled the house and howled is it a big house robbie seemed surprised by the question he considered it for a moment then nodded aye he said my fathers a laird a lord like a lord robbie said he wasnt at the battle he lost a leg and an arm at berwick so we boys have to fight for him he said he was the youngest of four sons three now he said crossing himself and thinking of jamie they half slept woke shivered and in the dawn thomas walked back to the hook to watch the new day seep grey along the seas ragged edge the rain had stopped though a cold wind shredded the wavetops the grey turned a leprous white then silvery as the gulls called over the long shingle where at the top of the hooks bank he found the weathered remnants of four posts they had not been there when he left but beneath one of them half buried in stones was a yellowish scrap of skull and he guessed this was one of the crossbowmen he had killed with his tall black bow on that easter day four posts four dead men and thomas supposed that the four heads had been placed on the poles to gaze out to sea till the gulls pecked out their eyes and flensed the flesh back to the bare skulls he stared into the ruined village but could see no one robbie was still inside the church from which a tiny wisp of smoke drifted but otherwise thomas was alone with the gulls there were not even sheep cattle or goats on lipp hill he walked back inland his feet crunching on the shingle then realized he still held the broken curve of skull and he hurled it into the stream where the fishing boats had been flooded to rid them of rats and then feeling hungry he went and took the piece of hard cheese and dark bread from the saddlebag that he had dumped beside the church door the walls of the church now he could see them properly in the daylight appeared lower than he remembered probably because local folk had come with carts and taken the stones away for barns or sties or house walls inside the church there was only a tangle of thorns nettles and a few gnarled lengths of charred timber that had long been overgrown by grass i was almost killed in here he told robbie and he described how the raiders had beaten on the church door as he had kicked out the horn panes of the east window and jumped down into the graveyard he remembered how his foot had crushed the silver mass cup as he scrambled over the altar had that silver cup been the grail he laughed aloud at the thought the mass cup had been a silver goblet on which was incised the badge of the vexilles and that badge cut from the crushed cup was now pinned to thomass bow it was all that was left of the old goblet but it had not been the grail the grail was much older much more mysterious and much more frightening the altar was long gone but there was a shallow clay bowl in the nettles where it had stood thomas kicked the plants aside and picked up the bowl remembering how his father would fill it with wafers before the mass and cover it with a piece of linen cloth and then hurry it to the church getting angry if any of the villagers did not take off their hats and bow to the sacrament as he passed thomas had kicked the bowl as he climbed onto the altar to escape the frenchmen and here it still was he smiled ruefully thought about keeping the bowl but tossed it back into the nettles archers should travel light someones coming robbie warned him running to fetch his uncles sword thomas picked up the bow and took an arrow from his bag and just then he heard the thump of hooves and the baying of hounds he went to the ruins of the door and saw a dozen great deerhounds splashing through the stream with tongues lolling between their fangs he had no time to run from them only to flatten himself against the wall as the hounds streaked for him argos maera back off now mind your goddamn manners the horseman bellowed at his hounds reinforcing his commands with the crack of a whip over their heads but the beasts surrounded thomas and leaped up at him yet it was not in threat they were licking his face and wagging their tails orthos the huntsman snapped at one dog then he stared hard at thomas he did not recognize him but the hounds obviously knew him and that gave the huntsman pause jake thomas said sweet jesus christ jake said sweet jesus look what the tide brought in orthos argos off and away you bastards off and away the whip cracked loud and the hounds still excited backed away jake shook his head its thomas isnt it how are you jake older jake churchill said gruffly then climbed down from the saddle pushed through the hounds and greeted thomas with an embrace it was your damned father who named these dogs he thought it was a joke its good to see you boy jake was greybearded his face dark as a nut from the weather and his skin scarred from countless brushes with thorns he was sir giles marriotts chief huntsman and he had taught thomas how to shoot a bow and how to stalk a deer and how to go hidden and silent through country good christ almighty boy he said but youve fair grown up look at the size of you boys do grow up jake thomas said then gestured at robbie hes a friend jake nodded at the scotsman then hauled two of the hounds away from thomas the dogs named for hounds from greek and latin myth whined excitedly and what the hell are you two doing down here jake wanted to know you should have come up to the hall like christians we got here late thomas explained and i wanted to see the place nothing to see here jake said scornfully nothing but hares here now youre hunting hare now i dont bring ten brace of hounds to snaffle hares boy no lally goodens boy saw the pair of you sneaking in here last night and so sir giles sent me down to see what evil was brewing we had a pair of vagabonds trying to set up home here in the spring and they had to be whipped on their way and last week there was a pair of foreigners creeping about foreigners thomas asked knowing that jake could well mean nothing more than that the strangers had come from the next parish a priest and his man jake said and if he hadnt been a priest id have loosed the dogs on him i dont like foreigners dont see no point to them those horses of yours looks hungry so do the two of you you want breakfast or are you going to stand there and spoil those damned hounds by patting them half to death they rode back to down mapperley following the hounds through the tiny village thomas remembered the place as big twice the size of hookton and as a child he had thought it almost a town but now he saw how small it was small and low so that on horseback he towered above the thatched cottages that had seemed so palatial when he was a child the dungheaps beside each cottage were as high as the thatch sir giles marriotts hall just beyond the village was also thatched the mossthick roof sweeping almost to the ground hell be pleased to see you jake promised and so sir giles was he was an old man now a widower who had once been wary of thomass wildness but now greeted him like a lost son youre thin boy too thin aint good for a man to be thin youll have breakfast the two of you pease pudding and small ale is what weve got there was bread yesterday but not today when do we bake more bread gooden this was demanded of a servant todays wednesday sir the servant said reprovingly tomorrow then sir giles told thomas bread tomorrow no bread today its bad luck to bake bread on wednesday it poisons you wednesdays bread i must have eaten mondays you say youre scottish this was to robbie i am sir i thought all scotsmen had beards sir giles said there was a scotsman in dorchester wasnt there gooden you remember him he had a beard he played the gittern and danced well you must remember him he was from the scilly isles the servant said thats what i just said but he had a beard didnt he he did sir giles a big one there you are then sir giles spooned some pease pudding into a mouth that only had two teeth left he was fat whitehaired and redfaced and at least fifty years old cant ride a horse these days thomas he admitted aint good for anything now except sitting about the place and watching the weather did jake tell you there be foreigners scuttling about he did sir a priest black and white robes like a magpie he wanted to talk about your father and i said there was nothing to talk about father ralphs dead i said and god rest his poor soul did the priest ask for me sir thomas asked sir giles grinned i said i hadnt seen you in years and hoped never to see you again and then his servant asked me where he might look for you and i told him not to talk to his betters without permission he didnt like that he chuckled so then the magpie asked about your father and i said i hardly knew him that was a lie of course but he believed me and took himself off put some logs on that fire gooden a man could freeze to death in his own hall if it was left to you so the priest left sir robbie asked it seemed unlike de taillebourg just to accept a denial and meekly go away he was frightened of dogs sir giles said still amused i had some of the hounds in here and if he hadnt been dressed like a magpie id have let them loose but it dont do to kill priests theres always trouble afterwards the devil comes and plays his games if you kill a priest but i didnt like him and i told him i wasnt sure how long i could keep the dogs heeled theres some ham in the kitchen would you like some ham thomas no sir i do hate winter sir giles stared into the fire which now blazed huge in his wide hearth the hall had smoke blackened beams supporting the huge expanse of thatch at one end a carved timber screen hid the kitchens while the private rooms were at the other end though since his wife had died sir giles no longer used the small chambers but lived ate and slept beside the hall fire i reckon thisll be my last winter thomas i hope not sir hope what you damned well like but i wont last it through not when the ice comes a man cant keep warm these days thomas it bites into you the cold does bites into your marrow and i dont like it your father never liked it either he was staring at thomas now your father always said youd go away not to oxford he knew you didnt like that like whipping a destrier between the shafts he used to say he knew youd run off and be a soldier he always said you had wild blood in you sir giles smiled remembering but he also said youd come home one day he said youd come back to show him what a fine fellow youd become thomas blinked back tears had his father really said that i came back this time he said to ask you a question sir the same question i think that the french priest wanted to ask you questions sir giles grumbled i never did like questions they need answers see of course you want some ham what do you mean no gooden ask your daughter to unwrap that ham will you sir giles heaved himself to his feet and shuffled across the hall to a great chest of dark polished oak he raised the lid and groaning with the effort of bending over began to rummage through the clothes and boots that were jumbled inside i find now thomas he went on that i dont need questions i sit in the manor court every second week and i know whether theyre guilty or innocent the moment theyre fetched into the hall mind you we have to pretend otherwise dont we now where is it ah he found whatever he sought and brought it back to the table there thomas damn your question and thats your answer he pushed the bundle across the table it was a small object wrapped in ancient sacking thomas had an absurd premonition that this was the grail itself and was ridiculously disappointed when he discovered the bundle contained a book the books front cover was a soft leather flap four or five times larger than the pages which could be used to wrap the volume that when thomas opened it proved to be written in his fathers hand however being by his father nothing in it was straightforward thomas leafed through the pages swiftly discovering notes written in latin greek and a strange script which he thought must be hebrew he turned back to the first page where only three words were written and reading them felt his blood run cold calix mews inebrians is it your answer sir giles asked yes sir sir giles peered at the first page its latin that isnt it yes sir thought it was i looked of course but couldnt make head nor tail of it and i didnt like to ask sir john sir john was the priest of st peters in dorchester or that lawyer fellow whats his name the one who dribbles when he gets excited he speaks latin or he says he does what does it mean my cup makes me drunk thomas said my cup makes me drunk sir giles thought that was splendidly funny aye your fathers wits were well off the wind a good man a good man but dear me my cup makes me drunk its from one of the psalms thomas said turning to the second page which was written in the script he thought was hebrew though there was something odd about it one of the recurrent symbols looked like a human eye and thomas had never seen that in a hebrew script before though in all honesty he had seen little hebrew its from the psalm sir he went on that begins by saying god is our shepherd hes not my shepherd sir giles grumbled im not some damned sheep nor me sir robbie declared i did hear sir giles looked at robbie that the king of scotland was taken prisoner he was sir robbie asked innocently probably nonsense sir giles replied then he began telling a long tale about meeting a bearded scotsman in london and thomas ignored the story to look through the pages of his fathers book he felt a kind of strange disappointment because the book suggested that the search for the grail was justified he wanted someone to tell him it was nonsense to release him from the cups thrall but his father had taken it seriously enough to write this book but his father thomas reminded himself had been mad mary goodens daughter brought in the ham thomas had known mary since they were both children playing in puddles and he smiled a greeting at her then saw that robbie was gazing at her as though she was an apparition from heaven she had dark long hair and a full mouth and thomas was sure robbie would be discovering more than a few rivals in down mapperley he waited until mary had gone then held up the book did my father ever talk to you about this sir he talked of everything sir giles said talked like a woman he did never stopped i was your fathers friend thomas but i was never much of a man for religion if he talked of it too much i fell asleep he liked that sir giles paused to cut a slice of ham but your father was mad you think this is madness sir thomas held up the book again your father was mad for god but he was no fool i never knew a man with so much common sense and i miss it i miss the advice does that girl work here robbie asked gesturing at the screen behind which mary had disappeared all her life sir giles said you remember mary thomas i tried to drown her when we were both children thomas said he turned the pages of his fathers book again though he had no time now to tease any meanings from the tangled words you do know what this is sir dont you sir giles paused then nodded i know thomas that many men want what your father claims to have possessed so he did make that claim another pause he hinted at it sir giles said heavily and i dont envy you me because he gave me that book thomas and he said that if anything happened to him i was to keep it until you were old enough and man enough to take up the task thats what he said sir giles stared at thomas and saw his old friends son flinch but if the two of you want to stay for a while he said then youd be welcome jake churchill needs help he tells me hes never seen so many fox cubs and if we dont kill some of the bastards then therell be some rare massacres among the lambs next year thomas glanced at robbie their task was to find de taillebourg and avenge the deaths of eleanor father hobbe and robbies brother but it was unlikely he thought that the dominican would come back here robbie however plainly wanted to stay mary gooden had seen to that and thomas was tired he did not know where to seek the priest and so the chance to stay in this hall was welcome it would be an opportunity to study the book and thus follow his father down the long tortuous path of the grail well stay sir thomas said for a while it was the first time that thomas had ever lived like a lord not a great lord perhaps not as an earl or a duke with scores of men to command but still in privilege ensconced in the manor even if the manor was a thatched timber hall with a beaten earth floor the davs his to wile away as other people did lifes hard work of cutting firewood drawing water milking cows churning butter pounding dough and washing clothes robbie was more used to it but reckoned life was much easier in dorset back home he said theres always some damn english raiders coming over the hill to steal your cattle or take your grain whereas you thomas said would never dream of riding south and stealing from the english why would i even think of such a thing robbie asked grinning so as winter closed down on the land they hunted sir giles marriotts acres to make the fields safe for the lambing season and to bring back venison to sir giless table they drank in the dorchester taverns and laughed at the mummers who came for the winter fair thomas found old friends and told them stories of brittany normandy and picardy some of which were true and he won the golden arrow at the fairs archery competition and he presented it to sir giles who hung it in the hall and declared it the finest trophy he had ever seen my son could shoot a good arrow a very good arrow id like to think he could have won this trophy himself sir giless only son had died of a fever and his only daughter was married to a knight who held land in devon and sir giles liked neither soninlaw nor daughter theyll inherit the property when i die he told thomas so you and robbie may as well enjoy it now thomas persuaded himself that he was not ignoring the search for the grail because of the hours he spent poring over his fathers book the pages were thick vellum expensive and rare which showed how important these notes had been to father ralph but even so they made small sense to thomas much of the book was stories one told how a blind man caressing the cup had received his sight but then disappointed in the grails appearance lost it again another told how a moorish warrior had tried to steal the grail and been turned into a serpent for his impiety the longest tale in the book was about perceval a knight of antiquity who went on crusade and discovered the grail in christs tomb this time the latin word used to describe the grail was crater meaning bowl whereas on other pages it was calix a cup and thomas wondered if there was any significance in the distinction if his father had possessed the grail would he not have known whether it was a cup or a bowl or perhaps there was no real difference whatever the long tale told how the bowl had sat on a shelf of christs tomb in plain view of all who entered the sepulchre both christian pilgrims and their pagan enemies yet not till sir perceval entered the grotto on his knees was the grail actually seen by anyone for sir perceval was a man of righteousness and thus worthy of having his eyes opened sir perceval removed the bowl bringing it back to christendom where he planned to build a shrine worthy of the treasure but the tale laconically recorded he died thomass father had written beneath this abrupt conclusion sir perceval was count of astarac and was known by another name he married a vexille sir perceval sir giles was impressed he was a member of your family eh your father never mentioned that to me at least i dont think he did i did sleep through a lot of his tales he usually scoffed at stories like this thomas said we often mock what we fear sir giles observed sententiously suddenly he grinned jake tells me you caught that old dog fox by the five marys the five marvs were ancient grave mounds that the locals claimed were dug by giants and thomas had never understood why there were six of them it wasnt there thomas said but back of the white nothe back of white nothe up on the cliffs sir giles stared at thomas then laughed you were on holgates land you rascals sir giles who had always complained mightily when thomas had poached from his land now found this predation on a neighbour hugely amusing hes an old woman holgate so are you making head or tail of that book i wish i knew thomas said staring at the name astarac all he knew was that astarac was a fief or county in southern france and the home of the vexille family before they were declared rebel and heretic he had also learned that astarac was close to the cathar heartlands close enough for the contagion to catch the vexilles and when a hundred years before the french king and the true church had burned the heretics out of the land they had also forced the vexilles to flee now it seemed that the legendary sir perceval was a vexille it seemed to thomas that the further he penetrated the mystery the greater the entanglement did my father ever talk to you of astarac sir he asked sir giles astarac whats that where his family came from no no he grew up in cheshire thats what he always said but cheshire had merely been a refuge a place to hide from the inquisition was that where the grail was now hidden thomas turned a page to find a long passage describing how a raiding column had tried to attack the tower of astarac and had been repulsed by the sight of the grail it dazzled them father ralph had written so that of them were cut down another page recorded that it was impossible for a man to tell a lie while he held his hand on the grail or else he will be stricken dead a barren woman would be granted the gift of children by stroking the grail and if a man were to drink from it on good friday he would be vouchsafed a glimpse of she whom he will take to wife in heaven another story related how a knight carrying the grail across a wilderness was pursued by heathens and when it seemed he must be caught god sent a vast eagle that caught him his horse and the precious grail up into the sky leaving the pagan warriors howling in frustrated rage one phrase was copied over and over in the pages of the book transfer calicern istem a me and thomas could feel his fathers misery and frustration reaching through the repeated phrase take this cup from me the words meant and they were the same words christ had spoken in the garden of gethsemane as he pleaded with god the father to spare him the pain of hanging on the tree the phrase was sometimes written in greek a language thomas had studied but never mastered fully he managed to decipher most of the greek text but the hebrew remained a mystery sir john the ancient vicar of st peters agreed that it was a strange kind of hebrew ive forgotten all the hebrew i ever learned he told thomas but i dont remember seeing a letter like that he pointed to the symbol that looked like a human eye very odd thomas very odd its almost hebrew he paused a while then said plaintively if only poor nathan was still here nathan he was before your time thomas nathan collected leeches and sent them to london physicians there prized dorset leeches did you know that but of course nathan was a jew and he left with the others the jews had been expelled from england almost fifty years before an event still green in the priests memory no one has ever discovered where he found his leeches sir john went on and i sometimes wonder if he put a curse on them he frowned at the book this belonged to your father it did poor father ralph sir john said intimating that the book must have been the product of madness he closed the volume and carefully wrapped the soft leather cover about the pages there was no sign of de taillebourg nor any news of thomass friends in normandy he wrote a difficult letter to sir guillaume which told how his daughter had died and begging for any news of will skeat whom sir guillaume had taken to caen to be treated by mordecai the jewish doctor the letter went to southampton and from there to guernsey and thomas was assured it would be sent on to normandy but no reply had come by christmas and thomas assumed the letter was lost thomas also wrote to lord outhwaite assuring his lordship that he was being assiduous in his search and recounting some of the stories from his fathers book lord outhwaite sent a reply that congratulated thomas on what he had discovered then revealed that sir geoffrey carr had left for brittany with half a dozen men rumour lord outhwaite reported claimed that the scarecrows debts were larger than ever which perhaps is why he has gone to brittany it would not just be hope of plunder that had taken the scarecrow to la rochederrien but the law which said a debtor was not required to make repayments while he served the king abroad will you follow the scarecrow lord outhwaite enquired and thomas sent an answer saying he would be in la rochederrien by the time lord outhwaite read these words and then did nothing about leaving dorset it was christmas he told himself and he had always enjoyed christmas sir giles celebrated the twelve days of the feast in high style he ate no meat from advent sunday which was not a particular hardship for he loved eels and fish but on christmas eve he ate nothing but bread readying himself for the first feast of the season twelve empty hives were brought into the hall and decorated with sprigs of ivy and holly a great candle big enough to burn through the whole season was placed on the high table and a vast log set to burn in the hearth and sir giless neighbours were invited to drink wine and ale and eat beef wild boar venison goose and brawn the wassail cup filled with mulled and spiced claret was passed about the hall and sir giles as he did every night of christmas wept for his dead wife and was drunkenly asleep by the time the candles burned out on the fourth night of christmas thomas and robbie joined the hogglers as disguised as ghosts and green men and wild men they pranced about the parish extorting funds for the church they went as far as dorchester encroaching on two other parishes as they did and got into a fight with the hogglers from all saints and they ended the night in the dorchester jail from which they were released by an amused george adyn who brought them a morning pot of ale and one of his wifes famous hogs puddings the twelfth night feast was a boar that robbie had speared and after it was eaten and when the guests were lying half drunk and satiated on the hall rushes it began to snow thomas stood in the doorway and watched the flakes whirling in the light of a flickering torch we must be away soon robbie had come to join him away we have work to do the scot said thomas knew that was true but he did not want to leave i thought you were happy enough here so i am robbie said and sir giles is more generous than i deserve so its mary robbie said he was embarrassed and did not finish pregnant thomas guessed robbie crossed himself it seems so thomas stared at the snow if you give her enough money to make a dowry he said shell thrive ive only got three pounds left robbie said he had been given a purse by his uncle sir william supposedly with enough money to last a year that should be enough thomas said the snow whirled in a gust of wind itll leave me with nothing robbie protested you should have thought of that before you ploughed the field thomas said remembering how he had been in just this predicament with a girl in hookton he turned back to the hall where a harpist and flautist made music to the drunks we should go he said but i dont know where you said you wanted to go to calais thomas shrugged you think de taillebourg will seek us there i think robbie said that once he knows you have that book hell follow you into hell itself thomas knew robbie was right but the book was not proving to be of any great help it never specifically said that father ralph had possessed the grail nor described a place where a searcher might look for it thomas and robbie had been looking they had combed the sea caves in the cliffs near hookton where they had found driftwood limpets and seaweed there had been no golden cup half hidden in the shingle so where to go now where to look if thomas vent to calais then he could join the army but he doubted de taillebourg would seek him out in the heart of englands soldiery maybe thomas thought he should go back to brittany and he knew that it was not the grail or the necessity to face de taillebourg that attracted him to la rochederrien but the thought that jeanette chenier might have returned home he thought of her often thought of her black hair of her fierce spirit and defiance and every time he thought of her he suffered guilt because of eleanor the snow did not last it thawed and a hard rain came from the west to lash the dorset coast a big english ship was wrecked on the chesil shingle and thomas and robbie took one of sir giless wagons down to the beach and with the aid of jake churchill and two of his sons fought off a score of other men to rescue six packs of wool that they carried back to down mapperley and presented to sir giles who thereby made a years income in one day and next morning the french priest came to dorchester the news was brought by george adyn i know as you said we should be watching for foreigners he told thomas and this one be real foreign dressed like a priest he is but who knows looks like a vagabond he does you say the word he winked at thomas and well give the bugger a proper whipping and send him on up to shaftesbury what will they do with him there robbie asked give him another whipping and send him back george said is he a dominican thomas asked how would i know hes talking gibberish he is he dont talk proper not like a christian what colour is his gown black of course ill come and talk to him thomas said he only jabbers away he does your honour this was in greeting to sir giles and thomas then had to wait while the two men discussed the health of various cousins and nephews and other relatives and it was close to midday by the time he and robbie rode into dorchester and thomas thought for the thousandth time what a good town this was and how it would be a pleasure to live here the priest was brought out into the small jail yard it was a fine day two blackbirds hopped along the top wall and an aconite was blooming in the yard corner the priest proved to be a young man very short with a squashed nose protuberant eyes and bristling black hair he wore a gown so shabby torn and stained that it was little wonder the constables had thought the man a vagrant a misconception that made the little priest indignant is this how the english treat gods servants hell is too good for you english i shall tell the bishop and he will tell the archbishop and he will inform the holy father and you will all be declared anathema you will all be excommunicated see what i mean george advn asked yaps away like a dog fox but he dont make sense hes speaking french thomas told him then turned to the priest whats your name i want to see the bishop now here whats your name bring me the local priest ill punch your bloody ears out first thomas said now whats your name he was called father pascal and he had just endured a journey of exquisite discomfort crossing the winter seas from normandy from a place south of caen he had travelled first to guernsey and then on to southampton from where he had walked and he had done it all without any knowledge of english it was a miracle to thomas that father pascal had come this far and it seemed even more of a miracle because father pascal had been sent to hookton from evecque with a message for thomas sir guillaume devecque had sent him or rather father pascal had volunteered to make the journey and it was urgent for he was bringing a plea for help evecque was under siege it is terrible father pascal said by now calmed and placated he was by the fire in the three cocks where he was eating goose and drinking bragget a mixture of warmed mead and dark ale it is the count of coutances who is besieging him the count why is that terrible thomas enquired because the count is his liege lord the priest exclaimed and thomas understood why father pascal said it was terrible sir guillaume held his lands in fief to the count and by making war on his own tenant the count was declaring sir guillaume an outlaw but why thomas asked father pascal shrugged the count says it is because of what happened at the battle do you know what happened at the battle i know thomas said and because he was translating for robbie he had to explain anyway the priest referred to the battle that had been fought the previous summer by the forest at crecy sir guillaume had been in the french army but in the middle of the fight he had seen his enemy guy vexille and had turned his menatarms against vexilles troops the count says that is treason the priest explained and the king has given his blessing thomas said nothing for a while how did you know i was here he finally asked you sent a letter to sir guillaume i didnt think it reached him of course it did last year before this trouble started sir guillaume was in trouble but his manor of evecque father pascal said was built of stone and blessed with a moat and so far the count of coutances had found it impossible to break the wall or cross the moat but the count had scores of men while sir guillaume had a garrison of only nine there are some women too father pascal tore at a goose leg with his teeth but they dont count does he have food plenty and the well is good so he can hold for a time the priest shrugged maybe maybe not he thinks so but what do i know and the count has a machine a he frowned trying to find the word a trebuchet no no a springald a springald was like a massive crossbow that shot a huge dart father pascal stripped the last morsel off the bone it is very slow and it broke once but they mended it it batters at the wall oh and your friend is there he mumbled his mouth full my friend skeat is that the name hes there with the doctor he can talk now and he walks he is much better yes but he cannot recognize people not unless they speak unless they speak thomas asked puzzled if he sees you the priest explained he does not know you then you speak and he knows you he shrugged again strange eh he drained his pot so what will you do monsieur what does sir guillaume want me to do he wants you close by in case he needs to escape but hes written a letter to the king explaining what happened in the battle i sent the letter to paris sir guillaume thinks the king may relent so he waits for an answer but me i think sir guillaume is like this goose plucked and cooked did he say anything about his daughter his daughter father pascal was puzzled oh the bastard daughter he said you would kill whoever killed her i will too and that he wants your help he can have it thomas said and well leave tomorrow he looked at robbie were going back to war who am i fighting for thomas grinned me thomas robbie and the priest left next morning thomas took a change of clothes a full arrow bag his bow sword and mail coat and wrapped in a piece of deerskin his fathers book that seemed like a heavy piece of baggage in truth it was lighter than a sheaf of arrows yet the duty its possession implied weighed on thomass conscience he told himself he was merely riding to help sir guillaume yet he knew he was continuing the quest for his fathers secret two of sir giless tenants rode with them to bring back the mare that father pascal rode and the two stallions which sir giles had purchased from thomas and robbie you dont want to take them on a boat sir giles said horses and boats dont mix he paid us too much robbie remarked as they rode away he doesnt want his soninlaw to get it thomas said besides hes a generous man he gave mary gooden another three pounds as well for her dowry hes a lucky man something in thomass tone caught robbies attention he is you mean shes found a husband a nice fellow a thatcher in tolpuddle theyll be wed next week next week robbie sounded aggrieved that his girl was marrying it did not matter that he was abandoning her it still cut his pride but why would he marry her he asked after a while or doesnt he know shes pregnant he thinks the child is his thomas said keeping a straight face and well it might be i hear jesus robbie swore when that made sense then he turned to look back along the road and he smiled remembering the good times hes a kind man he said of sir giles a lonely one thomas said sir giles had not wanted them to leave but accepted they could not stay robbie sniffed the air theres more snow coming never it was a morning of gentle sunlight crocus and aconite were showing in sheltered spots and the hedgerows were noisy with chaffinches and robins but robbie had indeed smelt snow as the day wore on the skies became low and grey the wind went into the east and hit their faces with a new bite and the snow followed they found shelter in a verderers house in the woods crowding in with the man his wife five daughters and three sons two cows had a byre at one end of the house and four goats were tethered at the other father pascal confided to thomas that this was very like the house in which he had grown up but he wondered if conventions in england were the same as in the limousin conventions thomas asked in our house father pascal said blushing the women pissed with the cows and the men with the goats i would not want to do the wrong thing its the same here thomas assured him father pascal had proved a good companion he had a fine singing voice and once they had shared their food with the verderer and his family the priest sang some french songs afterwards as the snow still fell and the smoke from the fire swirled thick under the thatch he sat and talked with thomas he had been the village priest at evecque and when the count of coutances attacked he had found refuge in the manor but i do not like being cooped up he said and so he had offered to carry sir guillaumes message to england he had escaped from evecque he said by first throwing his clothes across the moat and then swimming after them it was cold he said i have never been so cold i told myself it is better to be cold than to be in hell but i dont know it was terrible what does sir guillaume want us to do thomas asked him he did not say perhaps if the besiegers can be discouraged he shrugged the winter is not a good time for a siege i think inside evecque they are comfortable they are warm they have the harvest stored and the besiegers they are wet and cold if you can make them more uncomfortable who knows perhaps they will abandon the siege and you what will you do i have no work left at evecque the priest said sir guillaume had been declared a traitor and his goods pronounced forfeited so his serfs had been taken off to the count of coutancess estates while his tenants pillaged and raped by the besiegers had mostly fled so perhaps i go to paris i cannot go to the bishop of caen why not because he has sent men to help the count of coutances father pascal shook his head in sad wonderment the bishop was impoverished by the english in the summer he explained so he needs money land and goods and he hopes to get some from evecque greed is a great provoker of war yet youre on sir guillaumes side father pascal shrugged he is a good man but now now i must look to paris for preferment or may be dijon i have a cousin there they struggled east for the next two days riding across the dead heaths of the new forest which lay under a soft whiteness at night the small lights of the forest villages glittered hard in the cold thomas feared if they would reach normandy too late to help sir guillaume but that doubt was not reason enough to abandon the effort and so they struggled on their last few miles to southampton were through a melting slush of mud and snow and thomas wondered how they were to reach normandy which was an enemy province he doubted that any shipping would go there from southampton because any english boat going close to the normandy coast was liable to be snapped up by pirates he knew plenty of boats would be going to brittany but that was a long walk from caen we go through the islands of course father pascal said they spent one night in a tavern and next morning found space on the ursula a cog bound for guernsey and carrying barrels of salt pork kegs of nails barrel staves iron ingots pots packed in sawdust bolts of wool sheaves of arrows and three crates of cattle horns it was also carrying a dozen bowmen who were travelling to the garrison of the castle which guarded the anchorage at st peter port come a had west wind the ursulas captain told them and dozens of ships carrying wine from gascony to england could be blown upchannel and st peter port was one of their last harbours of refuge though the french sailors knew it too and in bad weather their ships would swarm off the island trying to pick up a prize or two does that mean theyll be waiting for us thomas asked the isle of wight was slipping astern and the ship was plunging into a wintergrey sea not waiting for us they wont be not us they know the ursula they do the captain a toothless man with a face horribly scarred from the pox grinned they do know her and they do love her which meant presumably that he had paid his dues to the men of cherbourg and carteret however he had paid no dues to neptune or whatever spirit governed the winter sea for though he claimed some special foreknowledge of winds and waves and asserted that both would be calm the ursula rolled like a bell swung on a beam up and down pitching hard over so that the cargo slid in the hold with a noise like thunder and the evening sky was grey as death and then sleet began to seethe on the torn water the captain clinging to the steering oar with a grin said it was nothing but a little blow that should not worry any good christian but others in his crew either touched the crucifix nailed to the single mast or else bowed their heads to a small shrine on the afterdeck where a crude wooden image was wrapped in bright ribbons the image was supposed to be st ursula the patron of ships and thomas said a prayer to her himself as he crouched in a small space under the foredeck ostensibly sheltering there with the other passengers but the overhead deck seams gaped and a mixture of rainwater and seawater continually slopped through three of the archers were sick and even thomas who had crossed the channel twice before and had been raised among fishermen and spent days aboard their small boats was feeling ill robbie who had never been to sea looked cheerful and interested in every thing that was happening aboard its these round ships he yelled over the noise they roll you know about ships do you thomas asked it seems obvious robbie said thomas tried to sleep he wrapped himself in his damp cloak curled up and lay as still as the pitching boat would let him and astonishingly he did fall asleep he woke a dozen times that night and each time he wondered where he was and when he remembered he wondered whether the night would ever end or whether he would ever be warm again dawn was sickly grey and the cold bit into thomass bones but the crew was altogether more cheerful for the wind had dropped and the sea was merely sullen the long foamstreaked waves rising and falling sluggishly about a wicked group of rocks that appeared to be home for a myriad seabirds it was the only land in sight the captain stumped across the deck to stand beside thomas the casquets he said nodding at the rocks a lot of widows have been made on those old stones he made the sign of the cross spat over the gunwales for luck and then looked up to a widening rift in the clouds were making good time he said thanks be to god and to ursula he looked askance at thomas so what takes you to the islands thomas thought of inventing some excuse family perhaps then thought the truth might elicit something more interesting we want to go on to normandy he said they dont like englishmen much in normandy not since our king paid them a visit last year i was there then youll know why they dont like us thomas knew the captain was right the english had killed thousands in caen then burned farms mills and villages in a great swathe east and north it was a cruel way to wage war but it could persuade the enemy to come out of his strongholds and give battle doubtless that was why the count of coutances was laying evecques lands waste in hope that sir guillaume would be enticed out of his stone walls to defend them except sir guillaume had only nine men and could not hope to face the count in open battle weve business in caen thomas admitted if we can ever reach the place the captain picked at a nostril then flicked something into the sea look for the troy frairs he said the what troy frairs he said again its a boat and thats her name its french she aint big no larger than that little tub he pointed to a small fishing boat her hull tarred black from which two men cast weighted nets into the broken sea about the casquets a man called ugh peter runs the troy frairs he might carry you to caen or maybe to carteret or cherbourg not that i told you that of course not thomas said he supposed the captain meant that ugly peter commanded a boat called les trois freres he stared at the fishing boat and wondered what kind of life it was to drag sustenance from this hard sea it was easier no doubt to smuggle wool into normandy and wine back to the islands all morning they ran southwards until at last they made landfall a small island lay off to the east and a larger guernsey to the west and from both rose pillars of smoke from cooking fires that promised shelter and warm food but though that promise fluttered in the sky the wind backed and the tide turned and it took the rest of the day for the ursula to beat down to the harbour where she anchored under the loom of the castle built on its rocky island thomas robbie and father pascal were rowed ashore and found respite from the cold wind in a tavern with a fire burning in a wide hearth beside which they ate fish stew and black bread washed down with a watery ale they slept on strawfilled sacks that were home to lice it was four days before ugly peter whose real name was pierre savon put into the harbour and another two before he was ready to leave again with a cargo of wool on which no duty would be paid he was happy to take passengers though only at a price which left robbie and thomas feeling robbed father pascal was carried free on the grounds that he was a norman and a priest which meant according to pierre the ugly that god loved him twice over and so was unlikely to sink les trots freres so long as father pascal was aboard god must have loved the priest for he sent a gentle west wind clear skies and calm seas so that les trois freres seemed to fly her way to the river orne they went up to caen on the tide arriving in the morning and once they were ashore father pascal offered thomas and robbie a blessing then hitched up his shabby robe and began walking east to paris thomas and robbie carrying heavy bundles of mail weapons arrows and spare clothing vent south through the city caen looked no better than when thomas had left it the previous year after it had been laid waste by english archers who disregarding their kings orders to discontinue their attack had swarmed over the river and hacked to death hundreds of men and women inside the city robbie stared in awe at the destruction on ile st jean the newest part of caen which had suffered most from the english sack few of the burned houses had been rebuilt and there were ribs skulls and long bones showing in the rivers mud at the falling tides margin the shops were half bare though a few countryfolk were in town selling food from carts and thomas bought dried fish bread and rockhard cheese some looked askance at his bowstave but he assured them he was a scotsman and thus an ally of france they do have proper bows in scotland dont they he asked robbie of course we do then why didnt you use them at durham we just dont have enough robbie said and besides wed rather kill you bastards up close make sure youre dead see he stared openmouthed at a girl carrying a pail of milk im in love if its got tits you fall in love thomas said now come on he led robbie to sir guillaumes town house the place where he had met eleanor and though sir guillaumes crest of three hawks was still carved in stone above the door there was now a new banner flying over the house a flag showing a humpbacked boar with great tusks whose flag is that thomas had crossed the small square to talk with a cooper who was hammering an iron ring down the flanks of a new barrel its the count of coutances the cooper said and the bastards already raised our rents and i dont care if you do serve him he straightened and frowned at the bowstave are you english ecossais thomas said ah the cooper was intrigued and leaned closer to thomas is it true monsieur he asked that you paint your faces blue in battle always thomas said and our arses formidable the cooper said impressed whats he saying robbie asked nothing thomas pointed at the oak which grew at the centre of the small square a few shrivelled leaves still clung to the twigs i was hanged from that tree he told robbie aye and im the pope of avignon robbie heaved up his bundle did you ask him where we could buy horses expensive things horses thomas said and i thought we might save ourselves the bother of buying were footpads now indeed thomas said he led robbie off the island across the bridge where so many archers had died in the frenzied attack and then through the old city that had been less damaged than the ile st jean because no one had tried to defend the narrow streets while the castle which had never fallen to the english had only suffered from cannon balls that had done little except chip the stones about the gate a red and yellow hanner flew from the castle rampart and menatarms wearing the same coloured liven challenged thomas and robbie as they were leaving the old city thomas answered by saying they were scottish soldiers seeking employment from the count of coutances i thought hed be here thomas lied but we hear hes at evecque and getting nowhere the guard commander said he was a bearded man whose helmet had a great split that suggested he had taken it from a corpse hes been pissing at those walls for two months now and got nowhere but if you want to die at evecque boys then good luck to you they walked past the walls of the abbaye aux dames and thomas had a sudden vision of jeanette again she had been his lover but then had met edward woodstock the prince of wales and what chance did thomas have after that it had been here in the abbaye aux dames that jeanette and the prince had lived during the brief siege of caen where was jeanette now thomas wondered back in brittany still seeking her infant son did she ever think of him or did she regret fleeing from the prince of wales in the belief that the picardy battle would be lost perhaps by now she would be married again thomas suspected she had taken a small fortune in jewels when she had fled the english army and a rich widow scarce more than twenty years old made an attractive bride what happens robbie interrupted his thoughts if they find out youre not scottish thomas held up the two fingers of his right hand that drew the bowcord they cut those off is that all those are the first things they cut off they walked on south through a country of small steep hills tight fields thick woods and deep lanes thomas had never been to evecque and though it was not far from caen some of the peasants they asked had never heard of it but when thomas asked which way the soldiers had been going during the winter they pointed on southwards they spent their first night in a roofless hovel a place that had evidently been abandoned when the english came in the summer and swept through normandy they woke at dawn and thomas put two arrows into a tree just to keep in practice he was cutting the steel heads out of the trunk when robbie picked up the bow can you teach me to use it he asked what i can teach you thomas said will take ten minutes but the rest will need a lifetime i began shooting arrows when i was seven and after ten years i was beginning to get good at it it cant be that difficult robbie protested ive killed a stag with a bow that was a hunting bow thomas said he gave robbie one of the arrows and pointed to a willow that had stubbornly kept its leaves hit the trunk robbie laughed i cant miss the willow was scarcely thirty paces away go on then robbie drew the bow glancing once at thomas as he realized just how much strength was needed to bend the great yew stave it was twice as stiff as the shorter hunting bows he had used in scotland jesus he said softly as he hauled the string back to his nose and realized his left arm was trembling slightly with the tension of the weapon but he peered down the arrow to check his aim and was about to loose when thomas held up a hand youre not ready yet i damn well am robbie said though the words came out as grunts for the bow needed immense force to hold in the drawn position youre not ready thomas said because theres four inches of the arrow sticking out in front of the bow you have to pull it back until the arrow head touches your left hand oh sweet jesus robbie said and took a breath nerved himself and pulled until the string was past his nose past his eye and close by his right ear the steel arrow head touched his left hand but now he could no longer aim by looking down the arrows shaft he frowned as he realized the difficulty that implied then compensated by edging the bow to the right his left arm was shaking with the tension and unable to keep the arrow drawn he released then twitched as the hemp string whipped along his inner left forearm the arrows feathers flashed white as they passed a foot from the willows trunk robbie swore in amazement then handed the bow to thomas so the trick of it he said is learning how to aim it the trick thomas said is not aiming at all its something that just happens you look at the target and you let the arrow fly some archers the lazy ones only drew to the eye and that made them accurate but their arrows lacked force the good archers the archers who drove down armies or brought down kings in shining armour pulled the string all the way back i taught a woman to shoot last summer thomas said taking back the bow and she became good really good she hit a hare at seventy paces a woman i let her use a longer string thomas said so the bow didnt need as much strength but she was still good he remembered jeanettes delight when the hare tumbled in the grass squealing the arrow pinned through its haunches jeanette why was he thinking of her so much they walked on through a world edged white with frost the puddles had frozen and the leafless hedgerows were outlined with a sharp white rime that faded as the sun climbed they crossed two streams then climbed through beechwoods towards a plateau which when they reached it proved to be a wild place of thin turf that had never been cut with a plough a few gorse bushes broke the grass but otherwise the road ran across a featureless plain beneath an empty sky thomas had thought that the heathland would be nothing but a narrow belt of high country and that they must soon drop into the wooded valleys again but the road stretched on and he felt ever more like a hare on a chalk upland under the gaze of a buzzard robbie felt the same and the two of them left the road to walk where the gorse provided some intermittent cover thomas kept looking ahead and behind this was horse country a firmturfed upland where riders could go full gallop and where there were no woods or gullies in which two men on foot could hide and the high ground seemed to extend for ever at midday they reached a circle of standing stones each about the height of a man and heavily encrusted with lichen the circle was twenty yards across and one of the stones had fallen and they rested their backs against it while they took a meal of bread and cheese the devils wedding party eh robbie said the stones you mean we have them in scotland robbie twisted round and brushed fragments of snail shell from the fallen stone they re people who were turned into rocks by the devil in dorset thomas said folk say that god turned them into stone robbie wrinkled his face at that idea why would god do that for dancing on the sabbath theyd just go to hell for that robbie said then idly scratched at the turf with his heel we dig the stones up when we have the time look for gold see you ever find any we do in the mounds sometimes pots anyway and beads rubbish really we throw it away as often as not and we find elf stones of course he meant the mysterious stone arrow heads that were supposedly shot from elfin bowstrings he stretched out enjoying the feeble warmth of the sun that was now as high as it would climb in the midwinter sky i miss scotland ive never been gods own country robbie said forcefully and he was still talking about scotlands wonders when thomas fell gently asleep he dozed then was woken because robbie had kicked him the scot was standing on the fallen stone what is it thomas asked company thomas stood beside him and saw four horsemen a mile or more to the north he dropped back to the turf pulled upon his bundle and took out a single sheaf of arrows then hooked the bowstring over the nocked tips of the stave maybe they havent seen us he said optimistically they have robbie commented and thomas climbed onto the stone again to see that the horsemen had left the road they had stopped now and one of them stood in his stirrups to get a better look at the two strangers at the stone circle thomas could see they were wearing mail coats under their cloaks i can take three of them he said patting the bow if you manage the fourth ah be kind to a poor scotsman robbie said drawing his uncles sword leave me two i have to make money remember he might have been facing a fight with four horsemen in normandy but he was still a prisoner of lord outhwaite and so bound to pay his ransom that had been set at a mere two hundred pounds his uncles was ten thousand and in scotland the douglas clan would be worrying how to raise it the horsemen still watched thomas and robbie doubtless wondering who and what they were the riders would not be fearful after all they were mailed and armed and the two strangers were on foot and men on foot were almost certainly peasants and peasants were no threat to horsemen in armour a patrol from evecque robbie wondered aloud probably the count of coutances would have men roaming the country looking for food or perhaps the horsemen were reinforcements riding to the counts aid but whoever they were they would regard any stranger in this countryside as prey for their weapons theyre coming robbie said as the four men spread into a line the riders must have assumed the two strangers would try to escape and so were making the line to snare them the four horsemen eh robbie said i can never remember what the fourth one is death var pestilence and famine thomas said putting the first arrow on the string its famine i always forget robbie said the four riders were a halfmile away swords drawn cantering on the fine solid turf thomas was holding the bow low so they would not be ready for the arrows he could hear the hoofbeats now and he thought of the four horsemen of the apocalypse the dreadful quartet of riders whose appearance would presage the end of time and the last great struggle between heaven and hell war would appear on a horse the colour of blood famine would be on a black stallion pestilence would ravage the world on a white mount while death would ride the pale horse thomas had a sudden memory of his father sitting bolt upright head back intoning the latin et ecce equus pallidus father ralph used to say the words to annoy his housekeeper and lover thomass mother who though she knew no latin understood that the words were about death and hell and she thought rightly as it turned out that her priest lover was inviting hell and death to hookton behold a pale horse thomas said robbie gave him a puzzled look i saw a pale horse thomas quoted and the name of its rider was death and hell followed him is hell another of the riders robbie asked hell is what these bastards are about to get thomas said and he brought up the bow and dragged back the cord and felt a sudden anger and hate in his heart for the four men and then the bow sounded the cords note hard and deep and before the sound had died he was already plucking a second arrow from where he had stuck a dozen pointdown in the turf he hauled the cord back and the four horsemen were still riding straight for them as thomas aimed at the lefthand rider he loosed took a third arrow and now the sound of the hooves on the frosthardened turf was as loud as the scottish drums at durham and the second man from the right was thrashing left and right falling back an arrow jutting from his chest and the rider on the left was lying back on his saddles cantle and the other two at last understanding their danger were swerving to throw off thomass aim gobbets of earth and grass were thrown up from the horses hooves as they slewed away if the two unwounded riders had any sense thomas thought they would ride away as though hell and death were on their heels ride back the way they had come in a desperate bid to escape the arrows but instead with the rage of men who had been challenged by what they believed to be an inferior enemy they curved back towards their prey and thomas let the third arrow fly the first two men were both out of it one fallen from his saddle and the other lolling on his horse that just cropped the winterpale turf and the third arrow flew hard and straight at its victim but his galloping horse tossed up its head and the arrow slid down the side of its skull blood bright on the black hide the horse twisted away from the pain and the rider unready for the turn was flailing for balance but thomas had no time to watch him for the fourth rider was inside the stone circle and closing on him the man had a vast black cloak that billowed behind as he turned the pale grey horse and he shouted his defiance as he stretched out the sword to whip the point like a lance head into thomass chest but thomas had his fourth arrow on the cord and the man suddenly understood that he was a split second too late non he shouted and thomas did not even draw the bow fully back but let it fly off the halfstring and the arrow still had enough force to bury itself in the mans head splitting the bridge of his nose and driving deep into his skull he twitched his sword arm dropped thomas felt the wind as the mans horse thundered past him and then the rider fell back over the stallions rump the third man the one unseated from the black horse had fallen in the stone circles centre and now approached robbie thomas plucked an arrow from the turf no robbie called hes mine thomas relaxed the string chien batard the man said to robbie he was much older than the scotsman and must have taken robbie for a mere boy for he half smiled as he came fast forward to lunge his sword and robbie stepped back parried and the blades rang like bells in the clear air batard the man spat and attacked again robbie stepped back once more yielding ground until he had almost reached the stone ring and his retreat worried thomas who had stretched his string again but then robbie parried so fast and riposted so quickly that the frenchman was going backwards in a sudden and desperate hurry you english bastard robbie said he swung his blade low and the man dropped his own blade to parry and robbie just kicked it aside and lunged so that his uncles blade sank into the mans neck bastard english bastard robbie snarled ripping the blade free in a spray of bright blood bloody english pig he freed the sword and swung it back to bury its edge in what was left of the mans neck thomas watched the man fall blood was bright on the grass he wasnt english thomas said its just a habit when i fight robbie said its the way my uncle trained me he stepped towards his victim is he dead you half cut off his head thomas said what do you think i think ill take his money robbie said and knelt beside the dead man one of the first two men to be struck by thomass arrows was still alive the breath bubbled in his throat and showed pink and frothy at his lips he was the man lolling in his saddle and he moaned as thomas spilled him down to the ground is he going to live robbie had crossed to see what thomas was doing christ no thomas said and took out his knife jesus robbie stepped back as the mans throat was cut did you have to i dont want the count of coutances to know there are only two of us thomas said i want the count of coutances to be as scared as hell of us i want him to think the devils own horsemen are hunting his men they searched the four corpses and after a lumbering chase managed to collect the four horses from the bodies and the saddlebags they took close to eighteen pounds of had french silver coinage two rings three good daggers four swords a fine mail coat that robbie claimed to replace his own and a gold chain that they hacked in half with one of the captured swords then thomas used the two worst swords to picket a pair of the horses beside the road and on the horses backs he tied two of the corpses so that they hung in the saddle bending sideways with vacant eyes and white skin laced with blood the other two corpses stripped of their mail were placed on the road and in each of their dead mouths thomas put sprigs of gorse that gesture meant nothing but to whoever found the bodies it would suggest something strange even satanic itll worry the bastards thomas explained four dead men should give them a twitch robbie said theyll be scared to hell if they think the devils loose thomas said the count of coutances would scoff if he knew there were only two young men come as reinforcements for sir guillaume deyecque but he could not ignore four corpses and hints of weird ritual and he could not ignore death to which end when the corpses were arranged thomas took the big black cloak the money and the weapons the best of the stallions and the pale horse for the pale horse belonged to death and with it thomas could make nightmares a single short burst of thunder sounded as thomas and robbie neared evecque they did not know how close they were but they were riding through country where all the farms and cottages had been destroyed which told thomas that they must be within the manors boundaries robbie on hearing the rumble looked puzzled for the sky immediately above them was clear although there were dark clouds to the south its too cold for thunder he said maybe its different in france they left the road and followed a farm track that twisted through woods and petered out beside a burned building that still smoked gently it made little sense to burn such steadings and thomas doubted that the count of coutances had initially ordered the destruction but sir guillaumes long defiance and the bloodymindedness of most soldiers would ensure that the pillage and burning would happen anyway thomas had done the same in brittany he had listened to the screams and protests of families who had to watch their home being burned and then he had touched the fire to the thatch it was war the scots did it to the english the english to the scots and here the count of coutances was doing it to his own tenant a second clap of thunder sounded and just after its echo had died thomas saw a great veil of smoke in the eastern sky he pointed to it and robbie recognizing the smear of campfires and realizing the need for silence just nodded they left their horses in a thicket of hazel saplings and then climbed a long wooded hill the setting sun was behind them throwing their shadows long on the dead leaves a woodpecker redheaded and wings barred white whirred loud and low above their heads as they crossed the ridge line to see the village and manor of evecque beneath them thomas had never seen sir guillaumes manor before he had imagined it would be like sir giles marriotts hall with one great barnlike room and a few thatched outbuildings but evecque was much more like a small castle at the corner closest to thomas it even had a tower a square and not very tall tower but properly crenellated and flying its banner of three stooping hawks to show that sir guillaume was not yet beaten the manors saving feature though was its moat which was wide and thickly covered with a vivid green scum the manors high walls rose sheer from the water and had few windows and those were nothing but arrow slits the roof was thatched and sloped inwards to a small courtyard the besiegers whose tents and shelters lay in the village to the north of the manor had succeeded in setting fire to the roof at some point but sir guillaumes few defenders must have managed to extinguish the flames for only one small portion of the thatch was missing or blackened none of those defenders was visible now though some of them must have been peering though the arrow slits that showed as small black specks against the grey stone the only visible damage to the manor was some broken stones at one corner of the tower where it looked as though a giant beast had nibbled at the masonry and that was probably the work of the springald that father pascal had mentioned but the oversized crossbow had obviously broken again and irremediably for thomas could see it lying in two gigantic pieces in the field beside the tiny stone village church it had done very little damage before its main beam broke and thomas wondered if the eastern hidden side of the building had been hurt more the manors entrance must be on that far side and thomas suspected the main siege works would also be there only a score of besiegers were in sight most doing nothing more threatening than sitting outside the village houses though a halfdozen men were gathered around what looked like a small table in the churchyard none of the counts men was closer to the manor than a hundred and fifty paces which suggested that the defenders had succeeded in killing some of their enemies with crossbows and the rest had learned to give the garrison a wide berth the village itself was small not much bigger than down mapperley and like the dorset village had a watermill there were a dozen tents to the south of the houses and twice as many little turf shelters and thomas tried to work out how many men could be sheltered in the village tents and turf huts and decided the count must now have about men what do we do robbie asked nothing for now just watch it was a tedious vigil for there was little activity beneath them some women carried pails of water from the watermills race others were cooking on open fires or collecting clothes that had been spread out to dry over some bushes at the edge of the fields the count of coutancess banner showing the black boar on a white field spangled with blue flowers flew on a makeshift staff outside the largest house in the village six other banners hung above the thatched rooftops showing that other lords had come to share the plunder a halfdozen squires or pages exercised some warhorses in the meadow behind the encampment but otherwise evecques attackers were doing little except wait siege work was boring work thomas remembered the idle days outside la rochederrien though those long hours had been broken by the terror and excitement of the occasional assault these men unable to assault evecques walls because of the moat could only wait and hope to starve the garrison into surrender or else tempt it into a sally by burning farms or perhaps they were waiting for a long piece of seasoned wood to repair the broken arm of the abandoned springald then just as thomas was deciding that he had seen enough the group of men who had been gathered about what he had thought was a low table beside the churchyard hedge suddenly ran back towards the church what in gods name is that robbie asked and thomas saw that it had not been a table they were crowding round but a vast pot cradled in a heavy wooden frame its a cannon thomas said unable to hide his awe and just then the gun fired and the great metal pot and its huge wooden cradle both vanished inside a swelling burst of dirty smoke and out of the corner of his eye he saw a piece of stone fly away from the damaged corner of the manor a thousand birds flew up from hedgerows thatch and trees as the guns booming thunder rolled up the hill and washed past him that vast clap of sound was the thunder they had heard earlier in the afternoon the count of coutances had managed to find a gun and was using it to nibble away at the manor the english had used guns at caen last summer though not all the guns in their army nor all the best efforts of the italian gunners had hurt caens castle indeed as the smoke slowly cleared from the encampment thomas saw that this shot had made little impact on the manor the noise seemed more violent than the missile itself yet he supposed that if the counts gunners could fire enough stones then eventually the masonry must give way and the tower collapse into the moat to make a rubble causeway across the water stone by stone fragment by fragment maybe three or four shots a day and thus the besiegers would undermine the tower and make their rough path into evecque a man rolled a small barrel out of the church but another man waved him back and the barrel was taken back inside the church had to be their powder store thomas thought and the man had been sent back because the gunners had shot their last missile for the day and would not reload until morning and that suggested an idea but he pushed it away as impractical and stupid have you seen enough he asked robbie ive never seen a gun before robbie said staring down at the distant pot as if hoping that it would be fired again but thomas knew it was unlikely that the gunners would discharge it again this evening it took a long time to charge a cannon and once the black powder was packed into its belly and the missile put into the neck the gun had to be sealed with damp loam the loam would confine the explosion that propelled the missile and it needed time to dry before the gun was fired so it was unlikely that there would be another shot before morning it sounds more trouble than its worth robbie said sourly when thomas had explained it so you reckon theyll not fire again theyll wait till morning ive seen enough then robbie said and they crawled back through the beeches until they were over the ridge then went down to their picketed horses and rode into the falling night there was a halfmoon cold and high and the night was bitter so bitter they decided they must risk a fire though they did their best to hide it by taking refuge in a deep gully with rock walls where they made a crude roof of boughs covered in hastily cut turfs the fire flickered through the holes in the roof to light the rock walls red but thomas doubted that any of the besiegers would patrol the woods in the dark no one willingly went into deep trees at night for all kinds of beasts and monsters and ghosts stalked the woodlands and that thought reminded thomas of the summer journey he had made with jeanette when they had slept night after night in the woods it had been a happy time and the remembrance of it made him feel sorry for himself and then as ever guilty for eleanors sake and he held his hands to the small fire are there green men in scotland he asked robbie in the woods you mean there are goblins evil little bastards they are robbie made the sign of the cross and in case that was not sufficient leaned over and touched the iron hilt of his uncles sword thomas was thinking of goblins and other creatures things that waited in the night woods did he really want to go back to evecque tonight did you notice he said to robbie that no one in coutancess camp seemed very disturbed that four of their horsemen hadnt returned we didnt see anyone going looking for them did we robbie thought about it then shrugged maybe the horsemen didnt come from the camp they did thomas said with a confidence he did not entirely feel and for a moment he guiltily wondered if the four horsemen had nothing to do with evecque then reminded himself that the riders had initiated the fight they must have come from evecque he said and theyll be worried there by now so so will they have put more sentries on their camp tonight robbie shrugged does it matter im thinking thomas said that i have to tell sir guillaume that were here and i dont know how to do that except by making a big noise you could write a message robbie suggested and put it round an arrow thomas stared at him i dont have parchment he said patiently and i dont have ink and have you ever tried shooting an arrow wrapped up in parchment it would probably fly like a dead bird id have to stand by the moat and it would be easier to throw the arrow from there robbie shrugged so what do we do make a noise announce ourselves thomas paused and im thinking that the cannon will break the tower down eventually if we dont do something the cannon robbie asked then stared at thomas sweet jesus he said after a while as he thought of the difficulties tonight once coutances and his men know were here thomas said theyll double their sentries but ill bet the bastards are half asleep tonight aye and wrapped up warm if theyve any damn sense robbie said he frowned but that gun looked like a rare great pot how the hell do you break it i was thinking of the black powder in the church thomas said set fire to it therere plenty of campfires in the village thomas said and he wondered what would happen if they were captured in the enemy encampment but it was pointless to worry about that if the gun was to be made useless then it was best to strike before the count of coutances knew an enemy had come to harass him and that made this night the ideal opportunity you dont have to come thomas told robbie its not as if your friends are inside the manor hold your breath robbie said scornfully he frowned again whats going to happen afterwards afterwards thomas thought it depends on sir guillaume if he gets no answer from the king then hell want to break out so he has to know were here why in case he needs our help he did send for us didnt he sent for me anyway so we go on making a noise we make ourselves a nuisance we give the count of coutances some nightmares the two of us you and me thomas said and the saying of it made him realize that robbie had become a friend i think you and i can make trouble he added with a smile and they would begin this night in this bitter and cold night beneath a hardedged moon they would conjure the first of their nightmares they went on foot and despite the bright halfmoon it was dark under the trees and thomas began to worry about whatever demons goblins and spectres haunted these norman woods jeanette had told him that in brittany there were nains and gorics that stalked the dark while in dorset it was the green man who stamped and growled in the trees behind lipp hill and the fishermen spoke of the souls of the drowned men who would sometimes drag themselves on shore and moan for the wives they had left behind on all souls eve the devil and the dead danced on maiden castle and on other nights there were lesser ghosts in and about the village and up on the hill and in the church tower and wherever a man looked which was why no one left his house at night without a scrap of iron or a piece of mistletoe or at the very least a piece of cloth that had been touched by a holy wafer thomass father had hated that superstition but when his people had lifted their hands for the sacrament and he saw a scrap of cloth tied about their palms he had not refused them and thomas had his own superstitions he would only ever pick up the bow with his left hand the first arrow to be shot from a newly strung bow had to be tapped three times against the stave once for the father once for the son and a third time for the holy spirit he would not wear white clothes and he put his left boot on before his right for a long time he had worn a dogs paw about his neck then had thrown it away in the conviction it brought ill luck but now after eleanors death he wondered if he should have kept it thinking of eleanor his mind slid back to the darker beauty of jeanette did she remember him then he tried not to think of her because thinking of an old love might bring ill luck and he touched the bole of a tree as he passed to cleanse away the thought thomas was looking for the red glow of dying campfires beyond the trees that would tell him that they were close to evecque but the only light was the silver of the moon tangled in the high branches nains and gorics what were they jeanette had never told him except to say they were spirits that haunted the country they must have something similar here in normandy or perhaps they had witches he touched another tree his mother had firmly believed in witches and his father had instructed thomas to say his paternoster if he ever got lost witches father ralph had believed preyed upon lost children and later much later thomass father had told him that witches began their invocation of the devil by saying the paternoster backwards and thomas of course had tried it though he had never dared finish the whole prayer olam a son arebil des the backward paternoster began and he could say it still even managing the difficult reversals of temptationem and supersubstantialem though he was careful never to finish the whole prayer in case there was a stench of brimstone a crack of flame and the terror of the devil descending on black wings with eyes of fire what are you muttering robbie asked im trying to say supersubstantialem backwards thomas said robbie chuckled youre a strange one thomas delait nats bus repus thomas said is that french robbie said because i have to learn it you will thomas promised him then at last he glimpsed fires between the trees and they both went silent as they climbed the long slope to the crest among the beeches that overlooked evecque no lights showed from the manor a clean and cold moonlight glistened on the greenscummed moat that looked smooth as ice perhaps it was ice and the white moon threw a black shadow into the damaged corner of the tower while a glow of firelight showed on the manors farther side confirming thomass suspicion that there was a siege work opposite the buildings entrance he guessed that the counts men had dug trenches from which they could douse the gateway with crossbow bolts as other men tried to bridge the moat where the drawbridge would be missing thomas remembered the crossbow bolts spitting from the walls of la rochederrien and he shivered it was bitter cold soon thomas thought the dew would turn to frost silvering the world like robbie he was wearing a wool shirt beneath a leather jerkin and a coat of mail over which he had a cloak yet still he was shivering and he wished he was back in the shelter of their gully where the fire burned i cant see anyone robbie said nor could thomas but he went on looking for the sentries maybe the cold was keeping everyone under a roof he searched the shadows near the guttering campfires watched for any movement in the darkness about the church and still saw no one doubtless there were sentinels in the siege works opposite the manor entrance but surely they would be watching for any defender trying to sneak out of the back of the manor except who would swim a moat on a night this cold and the besiegers were surely bored by now and their watchfulness would be low he saw a silveredged cloud sailing closer to the moon when the cloud covers the moon he told robbie we go and god bless us both robbie said fervently making the sign of the cross the cloud seemed to move so slowly then at last it veiled the moon and the glimmering landscape faded into grey and black there was still a wan faint light but thomas doubted the night would get any blacker and so he stood brushed the twigs off his cloak and started towards the village along a track that had been beaten across the eastern slope of the ridge he guessed the path had been made by pigs being taken to get fat on the beechmast in the woods and he remembered how hooktons pigs had roamed the shingle eating fish heads and how his mother had always claimed it tainted the taste of their bacon fishy bacon she had called it and compared it unfavourably with the bacon of her native weald in kent that she had always said had been proper bacon nourished on beechmast and acorn the best thomas stumbled on a tussock of grass it was difficult to follow the track because the night suddenly seemed much darker perhaps because they were on lower ground he was thinking of bacon and all the time they were getting closer to the village and thomas was suddenly scared he had seen no sentries but what about dogs one barking bitch in the night and he and robbie could be dead men he had not brought the bow but suddenly wished he had though what could he do with it shoot a dog at least the path was easily visible now for it was lit by the campfires and the two of them walked confidently as though they belonged in the village you must do this all the time thomas said to robbie softly this when you raid across the border hell we stay in the open country go after cattle and horses they were among the shelters now and stopped talking a sound of deep snoring came from one small turf hut and an unseen dog whined but did not bark a man was sitting in a chair outside a tent presumably guarding whoever slept inside but the guard himself was asleep a small wind stirred the branches in an orchard by the church and the stream made a splashing noise as it plunged over the little weir beside the mill a woman laughed softly in one of the houses where some men began to sing the tune was new to thomas and the deep voices smothered the sound of the churchyard gate which squealed as he pushed it open the church had a small wooden belfry and thomas could hear the wind sighing on the bell is that you georges a man called from the porch non thomas spoke more curtly than he intended and the tone brought the man out from the black shadows of the porchs arch and thomas thinking he had initiated trouble put his hand behind his back to grasp the hilt of his dagger sorry sir the man had mistaken thomas for an officer maybe even a lord ive been expecting a relief sir hes probably still sleeping thomas said the man stretched yawning hugely the bastard never wakes up the sentry was little more than a shadow in the dark but thomas sensed he was a big man and its cold here the man went on god but its cold did guy and his men come back one of their horses threw a shoe thomas said thats what it was and i thought theyd found that ale shop in saintgermain christ and his angels but that girl with the one eye have you seen her not yet thomas said he was still holding his dagger one of the weapons that the archers called a misericord because it was used to put unhorsed and wounded menatarms out of their misery the blade was slender and sufficiently flexible to slide between the joints of armour and seek out the life beneath but he was reluctant to draw it this sentry suspected nothing and his only offence was to want a long conversation is the church open thomas asked the sentry of course why not we have to pray thomas said must be a guilty conscience that makes men pray at night eh the sentry was affable too many oneeyed girls thomas said robbie not speaking french stood to one side and stared at the great black shadow of the gun a sin worth repenting the man chuckled then he drew himself up would you wait here while i wake georges it wont take a moment take as long as you like thomas said grandly we shall be here till dawn you can let georges sleep if you want the two of us will keep watch youre a living saint the man said then he fetched his blanket from the porch before walking away with a cheerful goodnight thomas when the man was gone walked into the porch where he immediately kicked an empty barrel that rolled over with a great clatter he swore and went still but no one called from the village to demand an explanation for the noise robbie crouched beside him the dark was impenetrable in the porch but they groped with their hands to discover a halfdozen empty barrels they stank of rotten eggs and thomas guessed they had once held black powder he whispered to robbie the gist of the conversation he had held with the sentry but what i dont know he went on is whether hes going to wake georges or not i dont think so but i couldnt tell who does he think we are two menatarms probably thomas said he pushed the empty barrels aside then stood and groped for the rope that lifted the latch of the church door he found it then winced as the hinges squealed thomas could still see nothing but the church had the same sour stench as the empty barrels we need some light he whispered his eyes slowly became accustomed to the gloom and he saw the faintest glimmer of light showing from the big eastern window over the altar there was not even a small flame burning above the sanctuary where the wafers were kept presumably because it was too dangerous with the gunpowder being stored in the nave thomas found the powder easily enough by bumping into the stack of barrels that were just inside the door there were at least two score of them each about the size of a water pail and thomas guessed the cannon used one or maybe two barrels for each shot say three or four shots a day so maybe there was two weeks supply of powder here we need some light he said again turning but robbie made no response where are you thomas hissed the question but again there was no answer and then he heard a boot thump hollow against one of the empty barrels in the porch and he saw robbies shadow flicker in the clouded moonlight of the graveyard thomas waited a campfire smouldered not far beyond the thorn hedge that kept cattle out of the villages graves and he saw a shadow crouch beside the dying flames and then there was a sudden flare of brightness like summer lightning and robbie reeled back and then thomas dazzled and alarmed by the flare could see nothing he had gone to the church door and he expected to hear a shout from one of the men in the village but instead he heard only the squeal of the gate and the scotsmans footsteps i used an empty barrel robbie said except it wasnt as empty as i thought or else the powder gets into the wood he was standing in the porch and the barrel was in his hands he had used it to scoop up some embers the powder residue had flared burning his eyebrows and now fire leaped up the barrels inside what do i do with it he asked christ thomas imagined the church exploding give it to me he said and he took the barrel which was hot to the touch and he ran with it into the church his way lit by the flames and he thrust the burning wood deep between two stacks of full barrels now we get out he said to robbie did you look for the poor box robbie said only if were going to smash the church we might as well take the poor box come on thomas snatched robbies arm and dragged him through the porch its a waste to leave it robbie said theres no bloody poor box thomas said the village is full of soldiers you idiot they ran dodging between graves and pounding past the bulbous cannon which lay in its wooden firing cradle they climbed a fence that filled a gap in the thorn hedge then sprinted past the gaunt shape of the broken springald and the turfroofed shelters not caring if they made a noise and two dogs began to bark then a third howled at them and a man jumped up from beside the entrance of one of the big tents qui va lå he called and began to wind his crossbow but thomas and robbie were already past him and out in the open field where they stumbled on the uneven turf the moon came from behind the cloud and thomas could see his breath like a mist halte the man shouted thomas and robbie stopped not because the man had given them the order but because a red light was filling the world they turned and stared and the sentry who had challenged them now forgot them as the night became scarlet thomas was not sure what he had expected a lance of flame to pierce the heavens a great noise like thunder instead the noise was almost soft like a giants inrush of breath and a soft blossoming flame spilled from the church windows as though the gates of hell had just been opened and the fires of death were filling the nave but that great red glow only lasted an instant before the roof of the church lifted off and thomas distinctly saw the black rafters splaying apart like butchered ribs sweet jesus christ he blasphemed god in his heaven robbie said wideeyed now the flames and smoke and air were boiling above the cauldron of the unroofed church and still new barrels exploded one after the other each one pulsing a wave of fire and fumes into the sky neither thomas nor robbie knew it but the powder had needed stirring because the heavier saltpetre found its way to the bottom of the barrels and the lighter charcoal was left at the top and that meant much of the powder was slow to catch the fire but the explosions were serving to mix the remaining powder that pulsed bright and scarlet to spew a red cloud over the village every dog in evecque was barking or howling and men women and children were crawling from their beds to stare at the hellish glow the noise of the explosions rolled across the meadows and echoed from the manor walls and startled hundreds of birds up from their roosts in the woodlands debris splashed in the moat throwing up sharpedged shards of thin ice that mirrored the fire so it seemed the manor was surrounded by a lake of sparkling flame jesus robbie said in awe then the two of them ran on towards the beech trees at the high eastern side of the pastureland thomas began to laugh as he stumbled up the path to the trees ill go to hell for that he said stopping among the beeches and making the sign of the cross for burning a church robbie was grinning his eyes reflecting the brightness of the fires you should see what we did to the black canons at hexham christ half scotland will be in hell for that one they watched the fire for a few moments then turned into the darkness of the woods dawn was not far off there was a lightness in the east where a wan grey pale as death edged the sky we have to go deeper into the forest thomas said we have to hide because the hunt for the saboteurs was about to start and in the first light as the smoke still made a great pall above evecques the count of coutances sent twenty horsemen and a pack of hounds to find the men who had destroyed his store of powder but the day was cold the ground hard with frost and the quarrys small scent faded early next day in his petulance the count ordered his forces to make an attack they had been readying gabions great basketwork tubes woven from willow that were filled with earth and stones and the plan was to fill the moat with the gabions and then swarm over the resultant bridge to assault the gatehouse the gateway lacked its drawbridge which had been taken down early in the siege to leave an open and inviting archway which was blocked by nothing more than a low stone barricade the counts advisers told him there were not enough gabions that the moat was deeper than he thought that the time was not propitious that venus was in the ascendant and mars in the decline and that he should in brief wait until the stars smiled on him and the garrison was hungrier and more desperate but the count had lost face and he ordered the assault anyway and his men did their best they were protected so long as they held the gabions for the earthfilled baskets were proof against any crossbow bolt but once the gabions were thrown into the moat the attackers were exposed to sir guillaumes six crossbowmen who were sheltering behind the low stone wall that had been built across the manors entrance arch where the drawbridge had once been the count had crossbowmen of his own and they were protected by pavises fulllength shields carried by a second man to protect the archer while he laboriously wound the cord of the crossbow but the men throwing the gabions had no protection once their burdens were thrown and eight of them died before the rest realized that the moat really was too deep and that there were not nearly enough gabions two paviseholders and a crossbowman were badly wounded before the count accepted he was wasting his time and called the attackers back then he cursed sir guillaume on the fourteen humpbacked devils of st candace before getting drunk thomas and robbie survived on the day after they had burned the counts powder thomas shot a deer and next day robbie discovered a rotting hare in a gap in a hedge and when he pulled the body out discovered a snare that must have been set by one of sir guillaumes tenants who had either been killed or chased off by the counts men robbie washed the snare in a stream and set it in another hedge and next morning found a hare choking in the tightening noose they dared not sleep in the same place two nights running but there was plenty of shelter in the deserted and burnedout farms they spent most of the next weeks in the country south of evecque where the valleys were deeper the hills steeper and the woods thicker here there were plenty of hiding places and it was in that tangled landscape that they made the counts nightmare worse tales began to be told in the besiegers encampment of a tall man in black on a pale horse and whenever the man on the pale horse appeared someone would die the death would be caused by a long arrow an english arrow yet the man on the horse had no bow only a staff topped by a deers skull and everyone knew what creature rode the pale horse and what a skull on a pole denoted the men who had seen the apparition told their womenfolk in the counts encampment and the womenfolk cried to the counts chaplain and the count said they were dreaming but the corpses were real enough four brothers come from distant lyons to earn money by serving in the siege packed their belongings and went others threatened to follow death stalked evecque the counts chaplain said folk were touched by the moon and he rode into the dangerous south country loudly chanting prayers and scattering holy water and when the chaplain survived unscathed the count told his men they had been fools that there was no death riding a pale horse and next day two men died only this time they were in the east the tales grew in the telling the horseman was now accompanied by giant hounds whose eves glowed and the horseman did not even need to appear to explain any misfortune if a horse tripped if a man broke a bone if a woman spilled food if a crossbow string snapped then it was blamed on the mysterious man who rode the pale horse the confidence of the besiegers plunged there were mutterings of doom and six menatarms went south to seek employment in gascony those who remained grumbled that they did the devils work and nothing the count of coutances did seemed to restore his mens spirits he tried cutting back trees to stop the mysterious archer shooting into the camp but there were too many trees and not enough axes and the arrows still came he sent to the bishop of caen who wrote a blessing on a piece of vellum and sent it back but that had no effect on the blackcloaked rider whose appearance presaged death and so the count who fervently believed he did gods work and feared to fail in case he incurred gods wrath now appealed to god for help he wrote to paris louis bessieres cardinal archbishop of livorno a city he had only seen once when he travelled to rome on his return he had made a detour so he would not be forced to see livorno a second time walked slowly down the quai des orfevres on the ile de la cite in paris two servants went ahead of him using staves to clear the way for the cardinal who appeared not to be paying attention to the lean hollowcheeked priest who spoke to him so urgently the cardinal instead examined the wares on offer in the goldsmiths shops lining the quai that was named for their trade goldsmiths quay he admired a necklace of rubies and even considered buying it but then discovered a flaw in one of the stones so sad he murmured then moved to the next shop exquisite he exclaimed of a salt cellar made in silver and emblazoned with four panels on which pictures of country life were enamelled in blue red yellow and black a man ploughed on one panel and broadcast seed on the next a woman cut the harvest on the third while on the last panel the two sat at table admiring a glowing loaf of bread quite exquisite the cardinal enthused dont you think it beautiful bernard de taillebourg scarcely gave the salt cellar a glance the devil is at work against us your eminence he said angrily the devil is always at work against us bernard the cardinal said reprovingly that is the devils job there would be something desperately amiss in the world if the devil were not at work against us he caressed the salt cellar running his fingers over the delicate curves of the panels then decided the shape of the base was not quite right something crude there he thought a clumsiness in the design and with a smile for the shopkeeper he put it back on the table and strolled on the sun shone there was even some warmth in the winter air and a sparkle on the seine a legless man with wooden blocks on his stumps swung on short crutches across the road and held out a dirty hand towards the cardinal whose servants rushed at the man with their staves no no the cardinal called and felt in his purse for some coins gods blessing on you my son he said cardinal bessieres liked giving alms he liked the melting gratitude on the faces of the poor and he especially liked their look of relief when he called off his servants a heartbeat before they used their staves sometimes the cardinal paused just a fraction too long and he liked that too but today was a warm sunlit day stolen from a grey winter and so he was in a kindly mood once past the sabot dor a tavern for scriveners he turned away from the river into the tangle of alleys that twisted about the labyrinthine buildings of the royal palace parliament such as it was met here and the lawyers scuttled the dark passages like rats yet here and there piercing the gloom gorgeous buildings reared up to the sun the cardinal loved these alleys and had a fancy that shops magically disappeared overnight to be replaced by others had that laundry always been there and why had he never noticed the bakery and surely there had been a lutemakers business beside the public privy a furrier hung bear coats from a rack and the cardinal paused to feel the pelts de taillebourg still yapped at him but he scarcely listened just past the furriers was an archway guarded by men in blue and gold livery they wore polished breastplates plumed helmets and carried pikes with brightly polished blades few folk got past them but the guards hastily stepped back and bowed as the cardinal passed he gave them a benevolent wave suggestive of a blessing then followed a damp passage into a courtyard this was all royal land now and the courtiers offered the cardinal respectful bows for he was more than a cardinal he was also papal legate to the throne of france he was gods ambassador and bessieres looked the part for he was a tall man strongly built and burly enough to overawe most men without his scarlet robes he was goodlooking and knew it and vain which he pretended he did not know and he was ambitious which he hid from the world but not from himself after all a cardinal archbishop had only one more throne to mount before he came to the crystal steps of the greatest throne of all and bernard de taillebourg seemed the unlikely instrument that might give louis bessieres the triple crown for which he yearned and so the cardinal wearily turned his attention to the dominican as the two left the courtyard and climbed the stairs into the saintechapelle tell me bessieres broke into whatever de taillebourg had been saying about your servant did he obey you de taillebourg so rudely interrupted took a few seconds to adjust his thoughts then he nodded he obeyed me in all things he showed humility he did his best to show humility ah so he still has pride it is ingrained in him de taillebourg said but he fought it and he did not desert you no your eminence so he is back here in paris of course de taillebourg said curtly then realized what tone he had used he is at the friary your eminence he added humbly i wonder whether we should show him the undercroft again the cardinal suggested as he walked slowly towards the altar he loved the saintechapelle loved the light that flooded between the high slender pillars this was he thought as close to heaven as man came on earth a place of supple beauty overwhelming brightness and enchanting grace he wished he had thought to order some singing for the sound of eunuchs voices piercing the high fanwork of the chapels stones could take a man very close to ecstasy priests were running to the high altar knowing what it was that the cardinal had come to see i do find he went on that a few moments in the undercroft compel a man to seek gods grace de taillebourg shook his head he has been there already your eminence take him again there was a hardness in the cardinals voice now show him the instruments show him a soul on the rack or under the fire let him know that hell is not confined to satans realm but do it today we may have to send you both away send us away de taillebourg sounded surprised the cardinal did not enlighten him instead he knelt before the high altar and took off his scarlet hat he rarely and only reluctantly removed the hat in public for he was uncomfortably aware that he was going bald but it was necessary now necessary and aweinspiring for one of the priests had opened the reliquary beneath the altar and brought out the purple cushion with its lace fringe and golden tassels which he now presented to the cardinal and on the cushion lay the crown it was so old so fragile so black and so very brittle that the cardinal held his breath as he reached for it the very earth seemed to stop in its motion all sounds went silent even heaven was still as he reached and then touched and then lifted the crown that was so light it seemed to have scarce any weight at all it was the crown of thorns it was the very crown that had been crammed onto christs head where it became imbued with his sweat and blood and the cardinals eyes filled with tears as he raised it to his lips and kissed it gently the twigs woven into the spiky circlet were spindly they were frail as a wrens leg bones yet the thorns were sharp still as sharp as the day when they had been raked over the saviours head to pour blood down his precious face and the cardinal lifted the crown high using two hands and he marvelled at its lightness as he lowered it onto his thinning scalp to let it rest there then hands clasped he stared up at the golden cross on the altar he knew the clergy of saintechapelle disliked his coming here and wearing the crown of thorns they had complained of it to the archbishop of paris and the archbishop had whined to the king but bessieres still came because he had the power to come he had the popes delegated power and france needed the popes support england was besieging calais and flanders was warring in the north and all of gascony was now again swearing allegiance to edward of england and brittany was in revolt against its rightful french duke and seethed with english bowmen france was assailed and only the pope could persuade the powers of christendom to come to its aid and the pope would probably do that for the holy father was himself french clement had been born in the limousin and had been chancellor of france before being elected to the throne of st peter and installed in the great papal palace at avignon and there in avignon clement listened to the romans who tried to persuade him to move the papacy back to their eternal city they whispered and plotted bribed and whispered again and bessieres feared that clement might one day give in to those wheedling voices but if louis bessieres became pope then there would be no more talk of rome rome was a ruin a pestilent sewer surrounded by petty states forever at war with each other and gods vicar on earth could never be safe there but while avignon was a good refuge for the papacy it was not perfect because the city and its county of venaissin both belonged to the kingdom of naples and the pope in louis bessieress view should not be a tenant nor should the pope live in some provincial city rome had once ruled the world so the pope had belonged in rome but in avignon the cardinal the thorns resting so lightly on his brow stared up at the great blue and scarlet of the passion window above the altar he knew which city deserved the papacy only one and louis bessieres was certain that once he was pope he could persuade the king of france to yield the ile de la cite to the holy father and so cardinal bessieres would bring the papacy north and give it a new and glorious refuge the palace would be his home the cathedral of notre dame would be his new st peters and this glorious saintechapelle his private shrine where the crown of thorns would be his own relic perhaps he thought the thorns should be incorporated into the popes triple crown he liked that idea and he imagined praying here on his private island the goldsmiths and the beggars the lawyers and the whores the laundries and the lutemakers would be sent across the bridges to the rest of paris and the ile de la cite would become a holy place and then the vicar of christ would have the power of france always at his side and so the kingdom of god would spread and the infidel would be slain and there would be peace on earth but how to become pope there were a dozen men who wanted to succeed clement yet bessieres alone of those rivals knew of the vexilles and he alone knew that they had once owned the holy grail and might perhaps own it still which was why bessieres had sent de taillebourg to scotland the dominican had returned emptyhanded but he had learned some things so you do not think the grail is in england bessieres now asked him keeping his voice low so that saintechapelles priests could not overhear their conversation it may be hidden there de taillebourg sounded gloomy but it is not in hookton guy vexille searched the place when he raided it we looked again and it is nothing but ruin you still think sir guillaume took it to evecque i think it possible your eminence de taillebourg said then not likely he qualified the answer but possible the siege goes badly i was wrong about coutances i offered him a thousand fewer years in purgatory if he captured evecque by st timothys day but he does not have the vigour to press a siege tell me about this bastard son de taillebourg made a dismissive gesture he is nothing he doubts the grail even exists all he wants is to be a soldier an archer you tell me an archer de taillebourg confirmed i think you are wrong about him coutances writes to say that their work is being impeded by an archer one archer who shoots long arrows of the english type de taillebourg said nothing one archer the cardinal pressed on who probably destroyed coutancess whole stock of black powder it was the only supply in normandy if we want more it will have to be brought from paris the cardinal lifted the crown from his head and placed it on the cushion then slowly reverently he pressed his forefinger against one of the thorns and the watching priests leaned forward they feared he was trying to steal one of the thorns but the cardinal was only drawing blood he winced as the thorn broke his skin then he lifted his finger to his mouth and sucked there was a heavy gold ring on the finger and hidden beneath the ruby which was cunningly hinged was a thorn he had stolen eight months before sometimes in the privacy of his bed chamber he scratched his forehead with the thorn and imagined being gods deputy on earth and guy vexille was the key to that ambition what you will do he ordered de taillebourg when the taste of the blood was gone is show guy vexille the undercroft again to remind him what hell awaits him if he fails us then go with him to evecque youd send vexille to evecque de taillebourg could not hide his surprise he is ruthless and he is cruel the cardinal said as he stood and put on his hat and you tell me he is ours so we shall spend money and we shall give him black powder and enough men to crush evecque and bring sir guillaume to the undercroft he watched as the crown of thorns was taken back to its reliquary and soon he thought in this chapel in this place of light and glory he would have a greater prize he would have a treasure to bring all christendom and its riches to his throne of gold he would have the grail thomas and robbie were both filthy their clothes were caked with dirt their mail coats were snagged with twigs dead leaves and earth and their hair was uncut greasy and matted at night they shivered the cold seeping into the marrow of their souls but by day they had never felt so alive for they played a game of life and death in the small valleys and tangled woods about evecque robbie clad in a swathing black cloak and carrying the skull on its pole rode the white horse to lead coutancess men into ambush where thomas killed sometimes thomas merely wounded but he rarely missed for he was shooting at close range forced to it by the thickness of the woods and the game reminded him of the songs the archers liked to sing and the tales their women told about the armys campfires they were the songs and tales of the common folk ones never sung by the troubadours and they told of an outlaw called robin hood it was either hood or hude thomas was not sure for he had never seen it written down but he knew hood was an english hero who had lived a couple of hundred years before and his enemies had been englands frenchspeaking nobility hood had fought them with an english weapon the war bow and todays nobility doubtless thought the stories were subversive which was why no troubadour sung them in the great halls thomas had sometimes thought he might write them down himself except no one ever wrote in english every book thomas had ever seen was in latin or french but why should the hood songs not be put between covers some nights he told the hood tales to robbie as the two of them shivered in whatever poor shelter they had found but the scotsman thought the stories dull things i prefer the tales of king arthur he said you have those in scotland thomas asked surprised of course we do robbie said arthur was scots dont be so bloody daft thomas said offended he was a scotsman robbie insisted and he killed the bloody english he was english thomas said and hed probably never heard of the bloody scots go to hell robbie snarled ill see you there first thomas spat and thought that if he ever did write the hood tales he would have the legendary bowman go north and spit a few scots on some honest english arrows they were both ashamed of their tempers next morning its because im hungry robbie said im always shorttempered when im hungry and youre always hungry thomas said robbie laughed then heaved the saddle onto his white horse the beast shivered neither horse had eaten well and they were both weak so thomas and robbie were being cautious not wanting to be trapped in open country where the counts better horses could outrun their two tired destriers at least the weather had turned less cold but then great bands of rain swept in from the western ocean and for a week it poured down and no english bow could be drawn in such weather the count of coutances would doubtless be beginning to believe that his chaplains holy water had driven the pale horse from evecque and so spared his men but his enemies were also spared for no more powder had come for the cannon and now the meadows about the moated house were so waterlogged that trenches flooded and the besiegers were wading through mud horses developed hoof rot and men staved in their shelters shivering with fever at every dawn thomas and robbie rode first to the woods south of evecque and there on the side of the manor where the count had no entrenchments and only a small sentry post they stood at the edge of the trees and waved they had received an answering wave on the third morning that they signalled the garrison but after that there was nothing until the week of the rain then on the morning after they had argued about king arthur thomas and robbie waved to the manor and this time they saw a man appear on the roof he raised a crossbow and shot high into the air the quarrel was not aimed at the sentry post and if the men on guard there even saw its flight they did nothing but thomas watched it fall into the pasture where it splashed in a puddle and skidded through the wet grass they did not ride out that day instead they waited until evening until the darkness had fallen and then thomas and robbie crept to the pasture and on hands and knees searched the thick svet grass and old cowdung it seemed to take them hours but at last robbie found the bolt and discovered there was a waxed packet wrapped about the short shaft you see robbie said when they were back in their shelter and shivering beside a feeble fire it can be done he gestured at the message wrapped about the quarrel to make the bolt fly the message had been whipped to the shaft with cotton cord that had shrunk and thomas had to cut it free then he unwrapped the waxed parchment and held it close to the fire so he could read the message which had been written with charcoal its from sir guillaume thomas said and he wants us to go to caen caen and were to find a thomas frowned and held the letter with its crabbed handwriting even closer to the flames were to find a shipmaster called pierre villeroy i wonder if thats ugly peter robbie put in no thomas said peering close at the parchment this mans ship is called the pentecost and if hes not there were to look for jean lapoullier or guy vergon thomas was holding the message so close to the fire that it began to brown and curl as he read the last words aloud tell villeroy i want the pentecost ready by st clements day and he must provision for ten passengers going to dunkirk wait with him and we shall meet you in caen set a fire in the woods tonight to show you have received this that night they did set a fire in the woods it blazed briefly then rain came and the fire died but thomas was sure the garrison would have seen the flames and by dawn wet tired and filthy they were back in caen thomas and robbie searched the citys quays but there was no sign of pierre villeroy or of his ship the pentecost but a tavernkeeper reckoned villerov was not far away he carried a cargo of stone to cabourg the man told thomas and he reckoned he should be back today or tomorrow and the weather wont have held him up he looked askance at the bowstave is that a goddamn bow he meant an english bow hunting bow from argentan thomas said carelessly and the lie satisfied the tavernkeeper for there were some men in every french community who could use the long hunting bow but they were very few and never enough to coalesce into the kind of army that turned hillsides red with noble blood if villeroys back today the man said hell be drinking in my tavern tonight youll point him out to me thomas asked you cant miss pierre the man laughed hes a giant a giant with a bald head a beard you could breed mice in and a poxed skin youll recognize pierre without me thomas reckoned that sir guillaume would be in a hurry when he reached caen and would not want to waste time coaxing horses onto the pentecost therefore he spent the day haggling about prices for the two stallions and that night flush with money he and robbie returned to the tavern there was no sign of a bigbearded giant with a bald head but it was raining they were both chilled and reckoned they might as well wait and so they ordered eel stew bread and mulled wine a blind man played a harp in the taverns corner then began singing about sailors and seals and the strange sea beasts that rose from the ocean floor to howl at the waning moon then the food arrived and just as thomas was about to taste it a stocky man with a broken nose crossed the tavern floor and planted himself belligerently in front of thomas he pointed at the bow thats an english bow the man said flatly its a hunting bow from argentan thomas said he knew it was dangerous to carry such a distinctive weapon and last summer when he and jeanette had walked from brittany to normandy he had disguised the bowstave as a pilgrims staff but he had been more careless on this visit its just a hunting bow he repeated casually then flinched because the eel stew was so hot what does the bastard want robbie asked the man heard him youre english do i sound english thomas asked so how does he sound the man pointed to robbie or has he lost his tongue now hes scottish oh im sure and im the goddamn duke of normandy what you are thomas said mildly is a goddamn nuisance and he heaved the bowl of soup into the mans face and kicked the table into his groin get out he told robbie christ i love a fight robbie said a halfdozen of the scalded mans friends were charging across the floor and thomas hurled a bench at their legs tripping two and robbie swung his sword at another man theyre english the scalded man shouted from the floor theyre goddamns the english were hated in caen hes calling you english thomas told robbie ill piss down his throat robbie snarled kicking the scalded man in the head then he punched another man with the hilt of his sword and was screaming his scottish war cry as he advanced on the survivors thomas had snatched up their baggage and his bowstave and pulled open a door come on he shouted call me english you tosspots robbie challenged his sword was holding the attackers at bay but thomas knew they would summon their courage and charge home and robbie would almost certainly have to kill one to escape and then there would be a hue and cry and they would be lucky not to end dangling at rope ends from the castle battlements so he just dragged robbie backwards through the tavern door run i was enjoying that robbie insisted and tried to head back into the tavern but thomas pulled him hard away and then shouldercharged a man coming into the alley run thomas shouted again and pushed robbie towards the iles centre they dodged into an alley sprinted across a small square and finally went to ground in the shadows of the porch of st jeans church their pursuers searched for a few minutes but the night was cold and the patience of the hunters limited there were six of them thomas said we were winning robbie said truculently and tomorrow thomas said when were supposed to be finding pierre villeroy or one of the others youd rather be in caens jail i havent punched a man since the fight at durham robbie said not properly what about the hoggling fight in dorchester we were too drunk doesnt count he started to laugh anyway you started it i did aye robbie said you chucked the eel stew right in his face all that stew i was only trying to save your life thomas pointed out christ you were talking english in caen they hate the english so they should robbie said so they should but what am i supposed to do here keep my mouth shut hell its my language too god knows why its called english because it is english thomas said and king arthur spoke it sweet jesus robbie said then laughed again hell i hit that one fellow so hard he wont know what day it is when he wakes up they found shelter in one of the many houses that were still abandoned after the savagery of the english assault in the summer the houses owners were either far away or more likely their bones were in the big common grave in the churchyard or mired in the rivers bed next morning they went down to the quays again thomas remembered wading through the strong current as the crossbowmen fired from the moored ships the quarrels had spat up small fountains of water and because he dared not get his bowstring vvet he had not been able to shoot back now he and robbie walked down the quays to discover the pentecost had magically appeared in the night she was as big a ship as any that made it upriver a ship capable of crossing to england with a score of men and horses aboard but she was high and dry now as the falling tide stranded her on the mud thomas and robbie gingerly crossed the narrow gangplank to hear a monstrous snoring coming from a small fetid cabin in the stern thomas fancied the deck itself vibrated every time the man drew breath and he wondered how any creature who made such a sound would react to being woken but just then a waif of a girl pale as a dawn mist and thin as an arrow climbed from the cabin hatch and put some clothes on the deck and a finger to her lips she looked very fragile and as she pulled up her robe to tug on stockings showed legs like twigs thomas doubted she could have been more than thirteen years old hes sleeping she whispered so i hear thomas said sh she touched her finger to her lips again then hauled a thick woollen shirt over her nightgown put her thin feet into huge boots and wrapped herself in a big leather coat she pulled a greasy woollen hat over her fair hair and picked up a bag that appeared to be made of ancient frayed sailcloth im going to buy food she said quietly and theres a fire to be made in the forepeak youll find a flint and steel on the shelf dont wake him with that warning she tiptoed off the ship swathed in her great coat and boots and thomas appalled at the depth and loudness of the snoring decided discretion was the best course he went to the forepeak where he found an iron brazier standing on a stone slab a fire was already laid in the brazier and after opening the hatch above to serve as a chimney he struck sparks from the flint the kindling was damp but after a while the fire caught and he fed it scraps of wood so that by the time the girl came back there was a respectable blaze im yvette she said apparently incurious as to who thomas and robbie were pierres wife she explained then fetched out a huge blackened pan onto which she broke twelve eggs do you want to eat too she asked thomas wed like to you can buy some eggs from me she said nodding at her sailcloth bag and theres some ham and bread in there he likes his ham thomas looked at the eggs whitening on the fire those are all for pierre hes hungry in the morning she explained so why dont you cut the ham he likes it thick the ship suddenly creaked and rolled slightly on the mud hes awake yvette said taking a pewter plate from the shelf there was a groan from the deck then footsteps and thomas backed out of the forepeak and turned to find the biggest man he had ever seen pierre villeroy was a foot taller than thomass bow he had a chest like a hogshead a smoothly bald pate a face terribly scarred by the childhood pox and a beard in which a hare could have become lost he blinked at thomas youve come to work he grunted no i brought you a message only weve got to start soon villeroy said in a voice that seemed to rumble from some deep cavern a message from sir guillaume devecque thomas explained have to use the low tide see villerov said ive three tubs of moss in the hold ive always used moss my father did others use shredded hemp but i dont like it dont like it at all nothing works half as well as fresh moss it holds see and mixes better with the pitch his ferocious face suddenly creased into a gaptoothed smile mon caneton he declared as yvette brought out his plate heaped with food yvette his duckling provided thomas and robbie with two eggs apiece then produced two hammers and a pair of strange iron instruments that looked like blunt chisels were caulking the seams villerov explained so ill heat the pitch and you two can ram moss between the planks he scooped a mess of egg yolk into his mouth with his fingers have to do it while the ships high and dry between tides but weve brought you a message thomas insisted i know you have from sir guillaume which means he wants the pentecost for a voyage and what sir guillaume wants he gets because hes been good to me he has but the pentecost aint no good to him if she sinks is she aint no good down on the seabed with all the drowned mariners is she she has to be caulked my darling and i almost drowned ourselves yesterday didnt we my duckling she was taking on water yvette agreed gurgling away it was villeroy declared loudly all the way from cabourg to here so if sir guillaume wants to go somewhere then you two had better start work he beamed at them above his vast beard which was now streaked with egg yolk he wants to go to dunkirk thomas said planning on making a run for it is he villeroy mused aloud hell be over that moat and on his horses and up and away before the count of coutances knows what year it is why dunkirk yvette wondered hes joining the english of course villeroy said without a trace of any resentment for that presumed betrayal by sir guillaume his lord has turned against him the bishops is pissing down his gullet and they do say the king has a finger in the pie so he might as well change sides now dunkirk hell be joining the siege of calais he scooped more eggs and ham into his mouth so when does sir guillaume want to sail st clements day thomas said whens that none of them knew thomas knew which day of the month was the feast of st clement but he did not know how many days away that was and that ignorance gave him an excuse to avoid what he was certain would be a disgustingly messy cold and wet job ill find out he said and be back to help you ill come with you robbie volunteered you stay here thomas said sternly monsieur villeroy has a job for you a job robbie had not understood the earlier conversation its nothing much thomas reassured him youll enjoy it robbie was suspicious so where are you going to church robbie douglas thomas said im going to church the english had captured caen the previous summer then occupied the city just long enough to rape its women and plunder its wealth they had left caen battered bleeding and shocked but thomas had stayed when the army marched away he had been sick and dr mordecai had treated him in sir guillaumes house and later when thomas had been well enough to walk sir guillaume had taken him to the abbaye aux hommes to meet brother germain the head of the monasterys scriptorium and as wise a man as any thomas had ever met brother germain would certainly know when st clements day was but that was not the only reason thomas was going to the abbey he had realized that if any man could understand the strange script in his fathers notebook it was the old monk and the thought that perhaps this morning he would find an answer to the grails mystery gave thomas a pang of excitement that surprised him he often doubted the grails existence and even more frequently wished the cup would pass from him but now suddenly he felt the thrill of the hunt more he was suddenly overwhelmed with the solemnity of the quest so much so that he stopped walking and stared into the shimmering light reflected from the river and tried to recall his vision of fire and gold in the northern english night how stupid to doubt he thought suddenly of course the grail existed it was just waiting to be found and so bring happiness to a broken world mind out thomas was startled from his reverie by a man pushing a barrow of oyster shells who barged past him a small dog was tied to the barrow and it lunged at thomas snapping ineffectually at his ankles before yelping as the rope dragged it onwards thomas was hardly aware of man or dog instead he was thinking that the grail must hide itself from the unworthv by giving them doubts to find it then all he had to do was believe in it and perhaps to request a little help from brother germain a porter accosted thomas in the abbeys gateway then immediately suffered a coughing fit the man doubled over gasped for breath then straightened slowly and blew his nose onto his fingers ive caught my death he wheezed thats what it is ive caught my death he hawked up a gob of mucus and spat it towards the beggars by the gate the scriptoriums that way he said past the cloister thomas made his way to the sunlit room where a score of monks stood at tall sloping desks a small fire burned in a central hearth ostensibly to keep the ink from freezing but the high room was still cold enough for the monks breath to mist above their parchments they were all copying books and the stone chamber clicked and scratched with the sound of the quills two novice monks were pounding powder for paints at a side table another was scraping a lambskin and a fourth was sharpening goose quills all of them nervous of brother germain who sat on a dais where he worked at his own manuscript germain was old and small fragile and bent with wispy white hair milky myopic eyes and a badtempered expression his face had been just three inches from his work until he heard thomass footsteps then he abruptly looked up and though he could not see well he did at least observe that his unannounced visitor had a sword at his side what business does a soldier have in gods house brother germain snarled come to finish what the english started last summer i have business with you brother thomas said the scratching of the quills had abruptly ceased as the monks tried to overhear the conversation work brother germain snapped at the monks work you are not translated to heaven yet you have duties attend to them quills rattled in ink pots and the scratching and pounding and scraping began again brother germain looked alarmed as thomas stepped tip onto the dais do i know you he snarled we met last summer sir guillaume brought me to see you sir guillaume brother germain startled laid his quill down sir guillaume i doubt well see him again ha mewed up by coutances thats what i hear and a good thing you know what he did coutances sir guillaume you fool he turned against the king in picardy turned against the king he made himself a traitor he was always a fool always risking his neck but now hell be lucky to keep his head whats that thomas had unwrapped the book and now placed it on the desk i was hoping brother he said humbly that you could make some sense of you want me to read it eh never learned yourself and now you think i have nothing better to do than read some nonsense so you can determine its value folk who could not read sometimes came into possession of books and brought them to the monastery to have them valued hoping against hope that some collection of pious advice might turn out to be a rare book of theology astrology or philosophy what did you say your name was brother germain demanded i didnt thomas said but im called thomas the name held no apparent memories for brother germain but nor was he interested any longer for he was immersed in the book mouthing words under his breath turning pages with long white fingers lost in wonder and then he leafed back to the first page and read the latin aloud calix mens inebriwn he breathed the words as if they were sacred then made the sign of the cross and turned to the next page which was in the strange hebrew script and he became even more excited to my son he said aloud evidently translating who is the son of the tirshatha and the grandson of hachaliah he turned his shortsighted eyes on thomas is that you me are you the grandson of hachaliah germain asked and despite his bad eyesight he must have detected the puzzlement on thomass face oh never mind he said impatiently do you know what this is stories thomas said stories of the grail stories stories youre like children you soldiers mindless cruel uneducated and greedy for stories you know what this script is he poked a long finger at the strange letters which were dotted with the eyelike symbols you know what it is its hebrew isnt it its hebrew isnt it brother germain mocked thomas with mimicry of course its hebrew even a fool educated at the university in paris would know that but its their magical script its the lettering the jews use to work their charms their dark magic he peered close at one of the pages there you see the devils name abracadabra he frowned for a few seconds the writer claims abracadabra can be raised to this world by invoking his name above the grail that seems plausible brother germain made the sign of the cross again to ward off evil then peered up at thomas where did you get this he asked the question sharply but did not wait for an answer youre him arent you him the vexille that sir guillaume brought to me brother germain said accusingly and made the sign of the cross again youre english he made that sound even worse who will you take this book to i want to understand it first thomas said confused by the question understand it you brother germain scoffed no no you must leave it with me young man so i can make a copy of it and then the book itself must go to paris to the dominicans there they sent a man to ask about you about me thomas was even more confused now about the vexille family it seems one of your foul brood fought at the kings side this summer and now he has submitted to the church the inquisition have had brother german paused evidently seeking the right word conversations with him with guy thomas asked he knew guy was his cousin knew guy had fought on the french side in picardy and he knew guy had killed his father in search of the grail but he knew little more who else and now they do say guy vexille is reconciled to the church brother germain said as he turned the pages reconciled to the church indeed can a wolf lay down with lambs who wrote this my father so you are hachaliahs grandson brother germain said with reverence then he closed his thin hands over the book thank you for bringing it to me he said can you tell me what the hebrew passages say thomas asked baffled by brother germains last words tell you of course i can tell you but it will mean nothing you know who hachaliah was you are familiar with the tirshatha of course not the answers would be wasted on you but i thank you for bringing me the book he drew a scrap of parchment towards him took up his quill and dipped it in the ink if you take this note to the sacristan he will give you a reward now i have work he signed the note and held it towards thomas thomas reached for the book i cant leave it here he said cant leave it here of course you can such a thing belongs to the church besides i must make a copy brother germain folded his hands over the book and hunched over it you will leave it he hissed thomas had thought of brother germain as a friend or at least not as an enemy and even the old monks harsh words about sir guillaumes treachery had not altered that opinion germain had said that the book must go to paris to the dominicans but thomas now understood that germain was allied with those men of the inquisition who in turn had guy vexille on their side and thomas understood too that those formidable men were seeking the grail with an avidity he had not appreciated until this moment and their path to the grail lay through him and this book those men were his enemies and that meant that brother germain was also his foe and it had been a terrible mistake to bring the book to the abbey he felt a sudden fear as he reached for the book i have to leave he insisted brother germain tried to hold onto the book but his twiglike arms could not compete with thomass bowgiven strength he nevertheless clutched it stubbornly threatening to tear its soft leather cover where will you go brother germain demanded then tried to trick thomas with a false promise if you leave it he said i shall make a copy and send the book to you when it is finished thomas was going north to dunkirk so he named a place in the other direction im going to la rochederrien he lied an english garrison brother germain still tried to pull the book away then yelped as thomas slapped his hands you cant take that to the english i am taking it to la rochederrien thomas said finally retrieving the book he folded the soft leather cover over the pages then half drew his sword because several of the younger monks had slipped from their high stools and looked as though they wanted to stop him but the sight of the blade dissuaded them from any violence they just watched as he walked away the porter was coughing still then leaned against the arch and fought for breath while tears streamed from his eyes at least it aint leprosy he managed to say to thomas i know it aint leprosy my brother had leprosy and he didnt cough not much anyway when is st clements day thomas remembered to ask day after tomorrow and god love me if i live to see it no one followed thomas but that afternoon while he and robbie were standing up to their crotches in flooding cold river water and pounding thick moss into the pente costs planking a patrol of soldiers in red and yellow livery asked pierre villeroy if he had seen an englishman dressed in mail and a black cloak thats him down there villeroy said pointing to thomas then laughed if i see an englishman he went on ill piss down the bastards throat till he drowns bring him to the castle instead the patrols leader said then led his men to question the crew on the next boat villeroy waited till the soldiers were out of earshot for that he said to thomas you owe me two more rows of caulking jesus christ thomas swore now he was a properly skilled carpenter villeroy observed through a mouthful of yvettes apple pie but he was also the son of god wasnt he so he didnt have to do menial jobs like caulking so its no damn good asking for his help just bang the moss in hard boy bang it in hard sir guillaume had held the manor from its attackers for close on three months and did not doubt he could hold it indefinitely so long as the count of coutances did not bring more gunpowder to the village but sir guillaume knew that his time in normandy was ended the count of coutances was his liege lord sir guillaume held land of him as the count held land of the king and if a man was declared a traitor by his liege lord and if the king supported the declaration then a man had no future unless he was to find another lord who owed fealty to a different king sir guillaume had written to the king and he had appealed to friends who had influence at court but no reply had come the siege had continued and so sir guillaume must leave the manor that saddened him for evecque was his home he knew every inch of its pastures knew where to find the shed deer antlers knew where the young hares lay trembling in the long grass and knew where the pike brooded like demons in the deeper streams it was home but a man declared a traitor had no home and so on the eve of st clements when his besiegers were sunk in a damp winter gloom he made his escape he had never doubted his ability to escape the count of coutances was a dull unimaginative middleaged man whose experience of war had always been in the service of greater lords the count was averse to risk and given to a blustery temper whenever the world escaped his understanding which happened frequently the count certainly did not understand why great men in paris were encouraging him to besiege evecque but he saw the chance of enriching himself and so he obeyed them even though he was wary of sir guillaume sir guillaume was in his thirties and had spent half his life fighting usually on his own account and in normandy he was called the lord of the sea and of the land because he fought on both with enthusiasm and effectiveness he had been handsome once hardfaced and goldenhaired but guy vexille count of astarac had taken one eye and had left scars that made sir guillaumes face even harder he was a formidable man a fighter but in the hierarchy of kings princes dukes and counts he was a lesser being and his lands made it tempting to declare him a traitor there were twelve men three women and eight horses inside the manor which meant every horse but one had to carry two riders after nightfall when rain was softly falling across evecques waterlogged fields sir guillaume ordered planks put across the gap where the drawbridge should have been and then the horses blindfolded were led one by one across the perilous bridge the besiegers huddled from the cold and rain saw and heard nothing even though the sentries in the forwardmost works had been placed to guard against just such an attempt to escape the horses blindfolds were taken off the fugitives mounted and then rode northwards they were challenged just once by a sentry who demanded to know who they were who the hell do you think we are sir guillaume retorted and the savagery in his voice persuaded the sentry not to ask any more questions by dawn they were in caen and the count of coutances was still none the wiser it was only when one of the sentries saw the planks spanning the moat that the besiegers realized their enemy was gone and even then the count wasted time by searching the manor he found furniture straw and cooking pots but no treasures an hour later a hundred blackcloaked men arrived at evecque their leader carried no banner and their shields had no badges they looked battlehardened like men who earned their living by renting their lances and swords to whoever paid the most and they curbed their horses beside the makeshift bridge over evecques moat and two of them one a priest crossed into the courtyard whats been taken the priest demanded curtly the count of coutances turned angrily on the man who wore dominican robes who are you what have your men plundered here the priest gaunt and angry asked again nothing the count assured him then wheres the garrison the garrison escaped bernard de taillebourg spat in his rage guy vexille next to him gazed up at the tower which now flew the counts banner when did they escape he asked and where did they go the count bridled at the tone who are you he demanded for vexille wore no badge on his black surcoat your equal vexille said coldly and my lord the king will want to know where they have gone no one knew though a few questions eventually elicited that some of the besiegers had been aware of horsemen going northwards in the cold night and that surely meant that sir guillaume and his men had ridden to caen and if the grail had been hidden in evecque then that would have gone north as well and so de taillebourg ordered his men to remount their tired horses they reached caen in the early afternoon but by then the pentecost was halfway down the river to the sea blown northwards by a fitful svind that barely gave headway against the last of the flooding tide pierre villeroy grumbled at the futility of trying to stem the tide but sir guillaume insisted for he expected his enemies to appear at any moment he had only two menatarms with him now for the rest had not wanted to follow their lord to a new allegiance even sir guillaume had little enthusiasm for that enforced loyalty you think i vant to fight for edward of england he grumbled to thomas but what choice do i have my own lord turned against me so ill swear fealty to your edward and at least ill live that was why he was going to dunkirk so that he could make the small journey to the english siege lines about calais and make his obeisance to king edward the horses had to be abandoned on the quay so all sir guillaume brought aboard the pentecost was his armour some clothes and three leather bags of money that he dumped on the deck before offering thomas an embrace and then thomas had turned to his old friend will skeat who had glanced at him without recognition and then looked away thomas about to speak checked himself skeat was wearing a sallet and his hair white as snow now hung lank beneath its battered metal brim his face was thinner than ever deeplined and with a vague look as though he had just woken and did not know where he was he also looked old he could not have been more than fortyfive yet he looked sixty though at least he was alive when thomas had last seen him he had been dreadfully wounded with a sword cut through the scalp which had laid his brain open and it had been a miracle he had lived long enough to reach normandy and the skilled attentions of mordecai the jewish doctor who was now being helped across the precarious gangplank thomas took another step towards his old friend who again glanced at him without recognition will thomas said puzzled will and at the sound of thomass voice light came into skeats eyes thomas he exclaimed by god it is you he stepped towards thomas stumbling slightly and the two men embraced by god thomas its grand to hear an english voice ive heard nowt but foreign jabber all winter good god boy you look older i am older thomas said but how are you will im alive tom im alive though i sometimes wonder if it wouldnt have been better to die weak as a kitten i am his speech ryas slightly slurred as if he had drunk too much but he was plainly sober i shouldnt call you plain will now should i thomas asked for youre sir william now sir william me skeat laughed youre full of crap boy just like you always were always too clever for your own good eh tom skeat did not remember the battle in picardy did not remember the king knighting him before the first french charge thomas had sometimes wondered whether that act had been pure desperation to raise the archers spirits for the king had surely seen how hugely his little sick army was outnumbered and he could not have believed his men would survive but survive they did and svin though the cost to skeat had been terrible he took off his sallet to scratch his pate and one side of his scalp was revealed as a wrinkled horror of lumpy scar pink and white weak as a kitten skeat said again and i havent pulled a bow in weeks mordecai insisted that skeat had to rest then he greeted thomas as villeroy let go the mooring lines and used a sweep to shove the pentecost into the rivers current mordecai grumbled about the cold about the privations of the siege and about the horrors of being aboard a ship then he smiled his wise old smile you look good thomas for a man who was once hanged you look indecently good hows your urine clear and sweet your friend sir william now mordecai jerked his head towards the forecabin where skeat had been bedded down in a pile of skeepskins his urine is very murky i fear you did me no favours by sending him to me hes alive i dont know why and i sent him to you because youre the best you flatter me mordecai staggered slightly because the ship had rocked in a small river wave that no one else had noticed yet he looked alarmed had he been a christian he would doubtless have warded off imminent danger by the sign of the cross instead he looked worriedly at the ragged sail as though he feared it might collapse and smother him i do detest ships he said plaintively unnatural things poor skeat he seems to be recovering i admit but i cannot boast that i did anything except wash the wound and stop people putting charms of mouldy bread and holy water on his scalp i find religion and medicine mix uneasily skeat lives i think because poor eleanor did the right thing when he was wounded eleanor had put the broken piece of skull on the exposed brain made a poultice of moss and spider web then bandaged the wound i was sorry about eleanor me too thomas said she was pregnant we were going to marry she was a dear thing a dear thing sir guillaume must be angry mordecai rocked his head from side to side when he received your letter that was before the siege of course he frowned trying to remember angry i dont think so he grunted that was all he was fond of eleanor of course but she was a servants child not he paused well its sad but as you say your friend sir william lived the brain is a strange thing thomas he understands i think though he cannot remember his speech is slurred and that might have been expected but strangest of all is that he does not recognize anyone with his eyes i will walk into a room and hell ignore me then i speak and he knows me we have all got into the habit of speaking as we get near him youll get used to it mordecai smiled but it is good to see you so you travel to calais with us thomas asked dear me no calais he shuddered but i couldnt stay in normandy i suspect that the count of coutances cheated of sir guillaume would love to make an example of a jew so from dunkirk i shall travel south again to montpellier first i think my son is studying medicine there and from montpellier i might go to avignon avignon the pope is very hospitable to jews mordecai said reaching out for the gunwale as the pentecost shivered under a small wind gust and we need hospitality mordecai had intimated that sir guillaumes reaction to eleanors death was callous but that was not evident when sir guillaume spoke of his lost daughter with thomas as the pentecost cleared the rivers mouth and the cold waves stretched to the grey horizon sir guillaume his ravaged face hard and grim looked close to tears as he heard how eleanor had died do you know anything more about the men who killed her he asked when thomas had finished his tale thomas could only repeat what lord outhwaite had told him after the battle about the french priest called de taillebourg and his strange servant de taillebourg sir guillaume said flatly another man to kill eh he made the sign of the cross she was illegitimate he spoke of eleanor not to thomas but to the wind instead but she was a sweet girl all of my children are dead now he gazed at the ocean his dirty long yellow hair stirring in the breeze we have so many men to kill you and i he spoke to thomas now and the grail to find others are looking for it thomas said then we must find it before them sir guillaume growled but we go to calais first i make my allegiance to edward and then we fight by god thomas we fight he turned and scowled at his two menatarms as if reflecting on how his fortunes and following had been shrunk by fate then he saw robbie and grinned i like your scotsman he can fight thomas said thats why i like him and he wants to kill de taillebourg too three of us want to kill him then god help the bastard because well serve his tripes to the dogs sir guillaume growled but hell have to be told youre in the calais siege lines eh if hes to come looking for us he has to know where you are to reach calais the pentecost needed to go east and north but once clear of the land she merely wallowed instead of sailing a small southwest wind had taken her clear of the river mouth but then long before she was out of sight of the norman shore the breeze faded and the big ragged sail flapped and slatted and banged on the yard the ship rolled like a barrel in a long dull swell that came from the west where dark clouds heaped like some gloomladen range of hills the winter day faded early the last of its cold light a sullen glint beneath the clouds a few spots of fire showed on the darkening land the tide will take us up the sleeve villeroy said gloomily then float us down again then up and down and up and down till god or st nicholas sends us wind the tide took them up the english channel as villeroy had predicted then drifted them down again thomas robbie and sir guillaumes two menatarms took it in turns to go down into the stonefilled bilge and hand up pails of water of course she leaks villeroy told a worried mordecai all ships leak shed leak like a sieve if i didnt caulk her every few months bang in the moss and pray to st nick it keeps us all from drowning the night was black the few lights ashore flickered in a damp haze the sea broke feebly against the hull and the sail hung uselessly for a time a fishing boat lay close a lantern burning on its deck and thomas listened to the low chant as the men hauled a net then they unshipped oars and rowed eastwards until their tiny glimmering light vanished in the haze a west wind will come villeroy said it always does west from the lost lands the lost lands thomas asked out there villeroy said pointing into the black west if you go as far as a man can sail youll find the lost lands and youll see a mountain taller than the sky where arthur sleeps with his knights villeroy made the sign of the cross and on the clifftops under the mountain you can see the souls of the drowned sailors calling for their womenfolk its cold there always cold cold and fogsmothered my father saw those lands once yvette put in he said he did villeroy commented but he was a rare drinker he said the sea was full of fish yvette went on as if her husband had not spoken and the trees were very small cider he drank villeroy offered whole orchards went down his gullet but he could sail a boat your father drunk or sober he was a seaman thomas was staring into the western darkness imagining a voyage to the land where king arthur and his knights slept under the fog and where the souls of the drowned called for their lost lovers time to bail ship villeroy said to him and thomas event down into the bilge and scooped the water into buckets until his arms were aching with tiredness and then he vvent to the forepeak and slept in the cocoon of sheepskins that villeroy kept there because he said it was colder at sea than on land and a man should drown warm dawn came slow seeping into the east like a grey stain the steering oar creaked in its ropes doing nothing as the ship rocked on the windless swell the norman coast was still in sight a greygreen slash to the south and as the vinter light grew thomas saw three small ships rowing out from the coast the three headed up channel until they were east of the pentecost thomas assumed they were fishermen and he wished that villeroys boat had oars and so could make some progress in this frustrating stillness there was a pair of great sweeps lashed to the deck but yvette said they were only useful in port shes too heavy to row for long she said especially when shes full full we carry cargo yvette said her man was sleeping in the stern cabin his snores seeming to vibrate the whole ship up and down the coast we go yvette said with wool and wine bronze and iron building stone and hides you like it i love it she smiled at him and her young face which was strangely wedgelike took on a beauty as she did so my mother now she event on she was going to have me put into the bishops service cleaning and washing cooking and cleaning till your hands are fair worn away by work but pierre told me i could live free as a bird on his boat and so we do so we do just the two of you the pentecost seemed a large ship for just two even if one of them was a giant no one else will sail with us yvette said its bad luck to have a woman on a boat my father always said that he was a fisherman a good one yvette said but he drowned all the same he was caught on the casquets on a bad night she looked up at thomas earnestly he did see the lost lands you know i believe you he sailed ever so far north and then west and he said the men from the north lands know the fishing grounds of the lost lands well and theres fish as far as you can see he said you could walk on the sea it was so thick with fish and one day he was creeping through the fog and he saw the land and he saw the trees like bushes and he saw the dead souls on shore thev were dark he said like theyd been scorched by hells fires and he took fright and he turned and sailed away it took him two months to get there and a month and a half to come home and all his fish had gone bad because he wouldnt go ashore and smoke them i believe you thomas said again though he was not really sure that he did and i think if i drown yvette said then me and pierre will go to the lost lands together and he wont have to sit on the cliffs and call for me she spoke very matteroffactly then went to ready some breakfast for her man whose snoring had just ceased sir guillaume emerged from the forecabin he blinked at the winter daylight then strolled aft and pissed across the stern rail while he stared at the three boats which had rowed out from the river and were now a mile or so east of the pentecost so you saw brother germain he asked thomas i wish i hadnt hes a scholar sir guillaume said pulling up his trews and tying the waist knot which means he doesnt have balls doesnt need to hes clever mind you clever but he was never on our side thomas i thought he was your friend when i had power and money thomas sir guillaume said i had many friends but brother germain was never one of them hes always been a good son of the church and i should never have introduced you to him why not once he learned you were a vexille he reported our conversation to the bishop and the bishop told the archbishop and the archbishop told the cardinal and the cardinal spoke to whoever gives him his crumbs and suddenly the church got excited about the vexilles and the fact that your family had once owned the grail and it was just about then that guy vexille reappeared so the inquisition took hold of him he paused gazing at the horizon then made the sign of the cross thats who your de taillebourg is id wager my life on it hes a dominican and most inquisitors are hounds of god he turned his one eye on thomas why do they call them the hounds of god its a joke thomas said from the latin domini canis the hound of god doesnt make me laugh sir guillaume said gloomily if one of those bastards gets hold of you its redhot pokers in the eyes and screams in the night and i hear they got hold of guy vexille and i hope they hurt him so guy vexille is a prisoner thomas was surprised brother germain had said his cousin was reconciled with the church thats what i heard i heard he was singing psalms on the inquisitions rack and doubtless he told them that your father had possessed the grail and how he sailed to hookton to find it and how he failed but who else went to hookton me thats who so i think coutances was told to find me arrest me and haul me to paris and meanwhile they sent men to england to find out what they could and to kill eleanor thomas said bleakly which theyll pay for sir guillaume said and now thomas said theyve sent men here what sir guillaume asked startled thomas pointed at the three fishing boats which now were rowing directly towards the pentecost they were too far away for him to see who or what was on board but something about their deliberate approach alarmed him yvette coming aft with bread ham and cheese saw thomas and sir guillaume staring and she joined them then uttered a curse that only a fishermans daughter would ever have learned and ran to the stern cabin and shouted for her man to get on deck yvettes eyes were accustomed to the sea and she knew these were no fishing boats they had too many men aboard for a start and after a while thomas could see those men for himself and his eves which were more used to looking for enemies among the green leaves saw that some of them wore mail and he knew that no man went to sea in mail unless he was intent on killing theyll have crossbows villeroy was on deck now tying the neck cords of a swathing leather cloak and looking from the approaching boats up to the clouds as if he might see a breath of wind coming from the heavens the sea was still heaving in great swells but the water was smooth as beaten brass and there were no winddriven ripples streaking the swells long flanks crossbows villeroy repeated gloomily you want me to surrender sir guillaume asked villeroy his voice was sour suggesting the question was nothing but sarcasm aint for me to tell your lordship what to do villeroy sounded just as sarcastic but your men could fetch some of the bigger stones out of the bilge what will that achieve sir guillaume asked ill drop em on the bastards when they try to board those little boats a stonell go straight through their bottoms and then yon bastards will be trying to swim with mail strapped to their chests villeroy grinned hard to swim when youre wrapped in iron the stones were fetched and thomas readied his arrows and bow robbie had donned his mail coat and had his uncles sword at his side sir guillaumes two menatarms were with him in the waist of the boat the place where any boarding attempt would be made for there the gunwale was closest to the sea thomas went to the higher stern where will skeat joined him and though he did not recognize thomas he did see the bow and held out a hand its me will thomas said i know its you skeat said he lied and was embarrassed let me try the bow boy thomas gave him the great black stave and watched in sadness as skeat failed to draw it even halfway skeat thrust the weapon back to thomas with a look of embarrassment im not what i was he muttered youll be back will skeat spat over the gunwale did the king really knight me he did sometimes i think i can remember the battle tom then it fades like a fog skeat stared at the three approaching boats which had spread into a line their oarsmen were pulling hard and thomas could see crossbowmen standing in the bows and stern of each craft have you ever shot an arrow from a boat skeat asked never youre moving and theyre moving it makes it hard but take it slow lad take it slow a man shouted from the closest boat but the pursuers were still too far away and whatever the man said was lost in the air st nicholas st ursula villeroy prayed send us wind and send us plenty of it hes having a go at us skeat said because a crossbowman in the bows of the central boat had raised his weapon he seemed to cock it high in the air then he shot and the bolt banged with astonishing force low into the pentecosts stern sir guillaume ignoring the threat climbed onto the rail and took hold of the backstay to keep his balance theyre coutancess men he told thomas and thomas saw that some of the men in the nearest boat were wearing the green and black livery that had been the uniform of evecques besiegers more crossbows twanged and two of the bolts thudded into the stern planks and two others whipped past sir guillaume to slap into the impotent sail but most splashed into the sea it might have been calm but the crossbowmen were still having a hard time aiming their weapons from the small boats and the three attacking boats were small each held eight or ten oarsmen and about the same number of archers or menatarms the three craft had plainly been chosen for their speed under oars but they were dwarfed by the pentecost which would make any attempt to board the bigger vessel very perilous though one of the three boats seemed determined to come alongside villeroys ship what theyre going to do sir guillaume said is let those two boats shower us with quarrels while this bastard he gestured at the boat that was pulling hard to close on the pentecost puts her men on board more crossbow bolts thumped into the hull two more quarrels pierced the sail and another hit the mast just above a weathered crucifix that was nailed to the tarred timber the figure of christ white as bone had lost its left arm and thomas wondered if that was a had omen then tried to forget it as he drew the big bow and shot off an arrow he only had thirtyfour shafts left but this was not the time to stint on them and so while the first was still in the air he loosed a second and the crossbowmen had not finished vinding their cords back as the first arrow slashed a rowers arm and the second drove a splinter up from the boats bow then a third arrow hissed above the oarsmens heads to splash into the sea the rowers ducked then one gasped and fell fonvard with an arrow in his back and the next instant a manatarms was struck in the thigh and fell onto two of the oarsmen and there was sudden chaos aboard the boat which clewed sharply away with its oars clattering against each other thomas lowered the big bow taught you well will skeat said fervently ah tom you always were a lethal bastard the boat pulled away thomass arrows had been far more accurate than the crossbow bolts for he had been shooting from a much larger and more stable ship than the narrow and overburdened rowboats only one of the men aboard those smaller ships had been killed but the frequency of thomass first arrows had put the fear of god into the rowers who could not see where the missiles came from but only hear the hiss of feathers and the cries of the wounded now the other two boats overtook the third and the crossbowmen levelled their weapons thomas took an arrow from the bag and worried what would happen when he had no more shafts but just then a swirl of ripples showed that a wind was coming across the water an east wind of all things the most unlikely of all winds in this sea but it came from the east nonetheless and the pentecosts big brown sail filled and slackened then filled again and suddenly she was turning away from her pursuers and the water was gurgling down her flanks coutancess men pulled hard on their oars down sir guillaume shouted and thomas dropped behind the rail as a volley of crossbow bolts punched into the pentecosts hull or flew high to tear the ragged sail villeroy shouted at yvette to man the steering oar then he sheeted down the mainsail before diving into the stern cabin to fetch a huge and evidently ancient crossbow that he cocked with a long iron lever he loaded a rusty bolt into the groove then shot it at the nearest pursuer bastards he roared your mothers were goats they were whoring goats boxed whoring goats bastards he cocked the weapon again loaded another corroded missile and shot it away but the bolt plunged into the sea the pentecost was gathering speed and already out of crossbow range the wind filled and the pentecost drew further away from her pursuers the three rowboats had first gone up channel in the expectation that the flooding tide and a possible western wind would bring the pentecost to them but with the wind coming from the east the oarsmen could not keep up with their quarry and so the three boats fell astern and finally abandoned the chase but just as they gave up so two new pursuers appeared in the mouth of the river orne two ships both of them large and equipped with big square sails like the pentecosts mainsail were coming out to sea the one in front is the saintesprit villerov said even at this distance from the river mouth he could distinguish the two boats and the other is the marie she sails like a pregnant pig but the saintesprit will catch us the saintesprit sir guillaume sounded appalled jean lapoullier who else i thought he was a friend he was your friend villerov said so long as you had land and money but what do you have now sir guillaume brooded on the truth of that question for a while so why are you helping me because im a fool villeroy said cheerfully and because youll pay me damn well sir guillaume grunted at that truism not if we sail in the wrong direction he added after a while the right direction villerov pointed out is away from the saintesprit and downwind so well stand on west they stood on westwards all day they made good speed but still the big saintesprit slowly closed the gap in the morning she had been a blur on the horizon by midday thomas could see the little platform at her masthead where villerov told him crossbowmen would be stationed and by midafternoon he could see the black and white eyes painted on her bows the east wind had increased all through the day until it was blowing strong and cold whipping the wavetops into white streamers sir guillaume suggested going north maybe as far as the english shore but villeroy claimed not to know that coastline and said he was unsure where he could find shelter there if the weather turned bad and this time of year it can turn fast as a womans temper villeroy added and as if to prove him right they ran into violent sleet squalls that hissed on the sea and buffeted the ship and cut visibility down to a few yards sir guillaume again urged a northward course suggesting they turn while the ship was hidden inside the squall but villeroy stubbornly refused and thomas guessed that the huge man feared being accosted by english ships that loved nothing better than capturing french vessels another squall crashed past them the rain bouncing up a hands breadth from the deck and the sleet making a slushy white coating on the eastern flank of every halyard and sheet villeroy feared that his sail would split but dared not shorten the canvas because whenever the squalls passed leaving the sea white and frantic the saintesprit was always in sight and always a little closer shes a quick one villeroy said grudgingly and lapoullier knows how to sail her yet the short winter day was passing and night would offer a chance for the pentecost to escape the pursuers knew that and they must have been praying that their ship would be given a little extra speed as dusk fell she was closing the gap inch by inch yet still the pentecost kept her lead they were out of sight of land now two ships on a seething and darkening ocean and then when the night was almost complete the first flame arrow streaked out from the saintesprits bow it was shot from a crossbow the flames seared the night arcing up and then plunging to fall in the pentecosts wake send him an arrow back sir guillaume growled too far thomas said a good crossbow would always outrange a yew stave though in the time it took to reload the crossbow the english archer would have run within range and loosed half a dozen arrows but thomas could not do that in this gathering darkness nor did he dare waste arrows he could only wait and watch as a second fire bolt slashed up against the clouds it too fell behind they dont fly as well will skeat said whats that will thomas had not heard clearly they wrap the shaft in cloth and it slows them down you ever shot a fire arrow tom never takes fifty paces off the range skeat said watching a third arrow plunge into the sea and plays hell with accuracy that one was closer sir guillaume said villerov had put a barrel on the deck and he was filling it with seawater yvette meanwhile had nimbly climbed the rigging to perch herself on the crosstrees where the one yard hung from the masthead and now she hauled up canvas pails of water which she used to soak the sail can we use fire arrows sir guillaume asked that thing must have the range he nodded at villeroys monstrous crossbow thomas translated the question for will skeat whose french was still rudimentary fire arrows skeats face wrinkled as he thought you have to have pitch tom he said dubiously and you must soak it into the wool and then bind the woollen cloth onto the arrow real hard but fray the edges a little to get the fire burning nicely fire has to be deep in the cloth not just on the edge because that wont last and when its burning hard and deep you send the arrow off before it eats through the shaft no thomas translated for sir guillaume we cant sir guillaume cursed then turned away as the first fire arrow thumped into the pentecost but the bolt struck low on the stern so low that the next heave of a wave extinguished the flames with an audible hiss we must be able to do something sir guillaume raged we can be patient villeroy said he was standing at the stern oar i can use your bow sir guillaume asked the big sailor and when villeroy nodded sir guillaume cocked the huge crossbow and sent a quarrel back towards the saintesprit he grunted as he pulled on the lever to cock the weapon again astonished at the strength needed a crossbow drawn by a lever was usually much weaker than the bows armed with a wormscrew and ratchet but villeroys bow was massive sir guillaumes bolts must have struck the pursuing ship but it was too dark to tell if any damage had been done thomas doubted it for the saintesprits bows were high and her gunwales stout sir guillaume was merely driving metal into planks but the saintesprits fiery missiles were beginning to threaten the pentecost three or four enemy crossbows were firing now and thomas and robbie were busy dousing the burning bolts with water then a flaming quarrel hit the sail and creeping fire began to glow on the canvas but yvette succeeded in extinguishing it just as villeroy pushed the steering oar hard over thomas heard the oars long shank creak under the strain and felt the ship lurch as she turned southwards the saintesprit was never quite as quick off the wind villeroy said and she wallows in a cross sea and were quicker thomas asked well find out villeroy said why didnt we try to find out earlier sir guillaume snarled the question because we didnt have sea room villeroy answered placidly as a flaming bolt seared oser the stern deck like a meteor but were well clear of the cape now he meant they were safely to the west of the norman peninsula and south of them now were the rockstudded sea reaches between normandy and brittany the turn meant that the range suddenly shortened as the saintesprit held on westwards and thomas shot a clutch of arrows at the dim figures of armoured men in the pursuing ships waist yvette had come down to the deck and was hauling on ropes and when she was satisfied with the new set of the sail she clambered back up to her eyrie just as two more fire bolts thumped into the canvas and thomas saw the flames leap up the sail as yvette dragged up buckets thomas sent another arrow high into the night so that it plunged down onto the enemy deck and sir guillaume was shooting the heavier crossbow bolts as fast as he could but neither man was rewarded with a cry of pain then the range opened again and thomas unstrung his bow the saintesprit was turning to follow the pentecost south and for a few heartbeats she seemed to disappear in the dark but then another fire arrow climbed from her deck and in its sudden light thomas saw she had made the turn and was again in the pentecosts wake villerovs sail was still burning giving the saintesprit a mark she could not fail to follow and the pursuing bowmen sent three arrows together their flames flickering hungrily in the night and yvette heaved desperately on the buckets but the sail was ablaze now and the ship was slowing as the canvas lost its force and then blessedly there was a seething hiss and a squall came lashing in from the east the sleet pelted down with an extraordinary violence rattling on the charred sail and drumming on the deck and thomas thought it would last forever but it stopped as suddenly as it had begun and all on board the pentecost stared astern waiting for the next fire bolt to climb from the saintesprits deck but when the flame finally seared into the sky it was a long way off much too far away for its light to illuminate the pentecost and villeroy grunted they reckoned wed turn back west in that squall he said with amusement but they were being too clever for their own good the saintesprit had tried to head off the pentecost thinking villerov would put his ship straight downwind again but the pursuers had made the wrong guess and they were now a long way to the north and west of their quarry more fire arrows burned in the dark but now they were being shot in all directions in hope that the small light of one would glint a dull reflection from the pentecosts hull but villerovs ship was drawing ever farther away pulled by the remnants of her scorched sail if it had not been for the squall thomas thought they would surely have been overhauled and captured and he wondered whether the hand of god was somehow sheltering him because he possessed the book of the grail then guilt assailed him the guilt of doubting the grails existence of wasting lord outhwaites money instead of spending it on the pursuit of the grail then the greater guilt and pity of eleanor and father hobbes wasteful deaths and so he dropped to his knees on the deck and stared up at the onearmed crucifix forgive me lord he prayed forgive me sails cost money villeroy said you shall have a new sail pierre sir guillaume promised and lets pray that whats left of this one will get us somewhere villeroy said sourly off to the north a last fire arrow etched red across the black and then there was no more light just the endless dark of a broken sea in which the pentecost survived under her tattered sail dawn found them in a mist and with a fitful breeze that fluttered a sail so weakened that villeroy and yvette doubled it on itself so that the wind would have more than charred holes to blow upon and when they reset it the pentecost limped south and west and everyone on board thanked god for the mist because it hid them from the pirates that haunted the gulf between normandy and brittany villeroy was not sure where they were though he was certain enough that the norman coast was to the east and that all the land in that direction was in fealty to the count of coutances and so they held on south and west with yvette perched in the bows to keep a lookout for the frequent reefs they breed rocks these waters villeroy grumbled then go into deeper water sir guillaume suggested the big man spat overboard deeper water breeds english pirates out of the isles they pushed on south the wind dying and the sea calming it was still cold but there was no more sleet and when a feeble sun began to burn off the shredding mists thomas sat beside mordecai in the bow i have a question for you he said my father told me never to get on board a ship mordecai responded his long face was pale and his beard which he usually brushed so carefully was tangled he was shivering despite a makeshift cloak of sheepskins did you know he went on that flemish sailors claim that you can calm a storm by throwing a jew overboard do they really so im told mordecai said and if i was on board a flemish ship i might welcome drowning as an alternative to this existence what is that thomas had unwrapped the book that his father had bequeathed him my question he said ignoring mordecais question is who is hachaliah hachaliah mordecai repeated the name then shook his head do you think the flemings carry jews aboard their ships as a precaution it would seem a sensible if cruel thing to do why die when a jew can die thomas opened the book to the first page of hebrew script where brother germain had deciphered the name hachaliah there he said giving the book to the doctor hachaliah mordecai peered at the page grandson of hachaliah he translated aloud and son of the tirshatha of course its a confusion about jonah and the great fish hachaliah is thomas asked staring at the page of strange script no dear boy mordecai said the superstition about jews and storms is a confusion about jonah a mere ignorant confusion he looked back at the page are you the son of the tirshatha im the bastard son of a priest thomas said and did your father write this yes for you thomas nodded i think so then you are the son of the tirshatha and the grandson of hachaliah mordecai said then smiled ah of course nehemiah my memory is almost as bad as poor skeats eh fancy forgetting that hachaliah was the father of nehemiah thomas was still none the wiser nehemiah and he was the tirshatha of course he was extraordinary isnt it how we jews prosper in foreign states and then they tire of us and we get blamed for every little accident then time passes and we are restored to our offices the tirshatha thomas was the governor of judaea under the persians nehemiah was the tirshatha not the king of course just governor for a time under the rule of artaxerxes mordecais erudition was impressive but hardly enlightening why would father ralph identify himself with nehemiah who must have lived hundreds of years before christ before the grail the only answer that thomas could conjure up was the usual one of his fathers madness mordecai was turning the parchment pages and winced when one cracked how people do yearn he said for miracles he prodded a page with a finger stained by all the medicines he had pounded and stirred a golden cup in the lords hand that made all the earth drunk now what on earth does that mean hes talking about the grail thomas said i had understood that thomas mordecai chided him gently but those words were not written about the grail it refers to babylon part of the lamentations of jeremiah he turned another page people like mystery they want nothing explained because when things are explained then there is no hope left i have seen folk dying and known there is nothing to be done and i am asked to go because the priest will soon arrive with his dish covered by a cloth and everyone prays for a miracle it never happens and the person dies and i get blamed not god or the priest but i he let the book fall on his lap where the pages stirred in the small wind these are just stories of the grail and some odd scriptures that might refer to it a book really of meditations he frowned did your father truly believe the grail existed thomas was about to give a vigorous affirmative but paused remembering for much of the time his father had been a wry amused and clever man but there had been other times when he had been a wild shrieking creature struggling with god and desperate to make sense of the sacred mysteries i think thomas said carefully that he did believe in the grail of course he did mordecai said suddenly how stupid of me of course your father believed in the grail because he believed that he possessed it he did thomas asked he was utterly confused now nehemiah was more than the tirshatha of judaea the doctor said he was cupbearer to artaxerxes he says so at the beginning of his writings i was the kings cupbearer there he pointed to a line of hebrew script i was the kings cupbearer your fathers words thomas taken from nehemiahs story thomas stared at the writing and knew that mordecai was right that was his fathers testimony he had been cupbearer to the greatest king of all to god himself to christ and the phrase confirmed thomass dreams father ralph had been the cupbearer he had possessed the grail it did exist thomas shivered i think mordecai spoke gently that your father believed he possessed the grail but it seems unlikely unlikely thomas protested i am merely a jew mordecai said blandly so what can i know of the saviour of mankind and there are those who say i should not even speak of such things but so far as i understand jesus was not rich am i right he was poor thomas said so i am right he was not a rich man and at the end of his life he attends a seder a seder the passover feast thomas and at the seder he eats bread and drinks wine and the grail tell me if i am wrong was either the bread dish or the wine goblet yes yes yes mordecai echoed and glanced off to his left where a small fishing boat rode the broken swell there had been no sign of the saintesprit all morning and none of the smaller boats they passed showed any interest in the pentecesr yet if jesus was poor mordecai said what kind of seder dish would he use one made of gold one ringed with jewels or a piece of common pottery whatever he used thomas said god could transform ah yes of course i was forgetting mordecai said he sounded disappointed but then he smiled and gave thomas the book when we reach wherever we are going he said i can write down translations of the hebrew for you and i hope it helps thomas sir guillaume bellowed from the stern we need fresh arms to bail water the caulking had not been finished and the pentecost was taking water at an alarming rate and so thomas vent down into the bilge and handed up the pails to robbie who jettisoned the water over the side sir guillaume had been pressing villerov to go north and east again in an attempt to run past caen and make dunkirk but villerov was unhappy with his small sail and even more unhappy with the leaking hull i have to put in somewhere soon he growled and you have to buy me a sail they dared not call into normandy it was well known throughout the province that sir guillaume had been declared a traitor and if the pentecost was searched and it was probable on this smuggling coast that she would be then sir guillaume would be discovered that left brittany and sir guillaume was eager to make saintmalo or saintbrieuc but thomas protested from the bilge that he and will skeat would be considered enemies by the breton authorities who in those towns held allegiance to duke charles who was struggling against the englishbacked rebels who reckoned duke jean was brittanys true ruler so where would you go sir guillaume demanded england well never make england villerov said unhappily looking at his sail the islands thomas suggested thinking of guernsey or jersey the islands sir guillaume liked that idea this time it was villerov who objected cant do it he said bluntly and explained that the pentecost was a guernsey boat and he had been one of the men who helped capture her i take her into the isles he said and theyll take her back and me with her for gods sake sir guillaume snarled then where do we go can you make treguier will skeat asked and everyone was so astonished he had spoken that for a few heartbeats no one responded treguier villeroy asked after a while then nodded like as not he said why treguier sir guillaume demanded it was in english hands last i heard skeat said still is villerov put in and weve got friends there skeat went on and enemies thomas thought treguier was not just the closest breton port in english hands but also the harbour closest to la rochederrien where sir geoffrey carr the scarecrow had gone and thomas had told brother germain that he was headed for the same small town and that would surely mean de taillebourg would hear of it and follow and perhaps jeanette was there too and suddenly though thomas had been saying for weeks that he would not go back he desperately wanted to reach la rochederrien for it was there in brittany he possessed friends old lovers and enemies he wanted to kill part three brittany spring the kings cupbearer jeanette chenier comtesse darmorique had lost her husband her parents her fortune her house her son and her royal lover and all before she was twenty years old her husband had been lost to an english arrow and had died in agony weeping like a child her parents had died of the bloody flux and their bedclothes had been burned before they were buried near the altar of st renans church they had left jeanette their only remaining child a small fortune in gold a wineshipping business and the great merchants house on the river in la rochederrien jeanette had spent much of the fortune on equipping ships and men to fight the hated english who had killed her husband but the english won and thus the fortune vanished jeanette had begged help from charles of blois duke of brittany and her dead husbands kinsman and that was how she had lost her son the threeyearold charles named for the duke had been snatched from her she was called a whore because she was a merchants daughter and thus unworthy to be an aristocrat and charles of blois to show jeanette how much he despised her had raped her her son now the count of armorica was being raised by one of charles of bloiss loyal supporters to ensure that the boys extensive lands stayed sworn to the house of blois so jeanette who had lost her fortune in the attempt to make duke charles the undisputed ruler of brittany learned a new hatred and found a new lover thomas of hookton she fled north with him to the english army in normandy and there she had caught the eye of edward of woodstock prince of wales and so jeanette had abandoned thomas but then fearing that the english would be crushed by the french in picardy and that the victorious french would punish her for her choice of lover she had fled again she had been wrong about the battle the english had won but she could not go hack kings and the sons of kings did not reward fickleness and so jeanette chenier dowager countess of armorica had gone back to la rochederrien to find she had lost her house when she had left la rochederrien she had been deeply in debt and monsieur belas a lawyer had taken the house to pay those debts jeanette on her return possessed money enough to pay all she owed for the prince of wales had been generous with jewels but belas would not move from the house the law was on his side some of the english who occupied la rochederrien showed sympathy for jeanette but they did not interfere with the decision of the court and it would not have mattered overmuch if they had for everyone knew the english could not stay in the small town for long duke charles was gathering a new army in rennes and la rochederrien was the most isolated and remote of all the english strongholds in brittany and when duke charles snapped up the town he would reward monsieur belas his agent and scorn jeanette chenier whom he called a whore because she was not nobly born so jeanette unable to claim back her house found another much smaller close to la rochederriens southern gate and she confessed her sins to the priest at st renans church who said she had been wicked beyond mans measure and perhaps beyond gods measure as well the priest promised her absolution if she would sin with him and he hoisted up his robes and reached for her then cried aloud as jeanette kicked him she continued to take mass at st renans for it was her childhood church and her parents were buried beneath the painting of christ emerging from the tomb with a golden light about his head and the priest dared not refuse her the sacrament and dared not meet her eyes jeanette had lost her servants when she fled north with thomas but she hired a fourteenyearold girl to be her kitchen maid and the girls idiot brother to draw water and collect firewood the princes jewels jeanette reckoned would last her a year and something would turn up by then she was young she was truly beautiful she was filled with anger her child was still a hostage and she was inspired by hatred some in the town feared she was mad because she was much thinner than when she had left la rochederrien but her hair was still ravenblack her skin as smooth as the rare silk that only the wealthiest could afford and her eyes were big and bright men came and begged her favours but were told they could not speak to her again unless they brought her the shrivelled heart of belas the lawyer and the shrivelled prick of charles of blois bring them both to me in reliquaries she told them but bring me my son alive her anger repelled men and some of them spread the tale that she was moontouched perhaps a witch the priest of st renans confided to the other clergy in the town that jeanette had tried to tempt him and he spoke darkly of bringing in the inquisition but the english would not permit it for the king of england refused to let the torturers of god work their dark arts in his possessions theres enough grumbling dick totesham commander of the english garrison in la rochederrien said without bringing in damned friars to stir up trouble totesham and his garrison knew that charles of blois was raising an army that would attack la rochederrien before marching on to besiege the other english strongholds in brittany and so they worked hard to make the towns walls higher and to build new ramparts outside the old local farm labourers were whipped to the work they were forced to push barrowloads of clay and rock they drove timbers into the soil to make palisades and they dug ditches they hated the english for forcing them to work without pay but the english did not care for they had to defend themselves and totesham pleaded with westminster to send him more men and on the feast of st felix in the middle of january a troop of welsh archers landed at treguier which was the small harbour an hour and a halfs walk upriver from la rochederrien but the garrisons only other reinforcements were a few knights and menatarms who were down on their luck and came to the small town in hope of plunder and prisoners some of those knights came from as far away as flanders lured by false rumours of the riches to be had in brittany and another six menatarms arrived from northern england led by a malevolent rawfaced man who carried a whip and a heavy load of grudges and they were la rochederriens last reinforcements before the pentecost came to the river la rochederriens garrison was small but duke charless army was large and grew even larger spies in english pay told of genoese crossbowmen arriving at rennes in companies a hundred strong and of menatarms riding from france to swear fealty to charles of blois his army swelled and the king of england apparently careless of his garrisons in brittany sent them no help which meant that la rochederrien smallest of all the english fortress towns in brittany and the one closest to the enemy was doomed thomas felt strangely unsettled as the pentecost slipped between the low rocky outcrops that marked the mouth of the river jaudv was it a failure he wondered to be coming back to this small town or had god sent him because it was here that the enemies of the grail would be seeking him that was how thomas thought of the mysterious de taillebourg and his servant or perhaps he told himself he was merely nervous of seeing jeanette again their history was too tangled there was too much hate mixed with the love yet he did want to see her and he was worried she would not want to see him he tried and failed to conjure a picture of her face as the incoming tide carried the pentecost into the rivers mouth where guillemots spread their ragged black wings to dry above rocks fretted with white foam a seal raised its glistening head stared indignantly at thomas and then went back to the depths the riverbanks came closer bringing the smell of land there were boulders and pale grass and small windbent trees while in the shallows there were sinuous fish traps made from woven willow stakes a small girl scarce more than six years old used a stone to knock limpets from the rocks its a poor supper that will skeat remarked it is will it is ah tom skeat smiled recognizing the voice you never had limpets for supper i did thomas protested and for breakfast too a man who speaks latin and french eating limpets skeat grinned you can write aint that so tom good as a priest will i reckon we should send a letter to his lordship skeat said meaning the earl of northampton and ask for my men to be shipped here only he wont do that without money will he he owes you money thomas said skeat frowned at thomas he does your men have been serving him these last months he has to pay for that skeat shook his head the earl was never slow to pay for good soldiers hell be keeping their purses full ill be bound and if i want them here ill have to persuade him to let them go and ill have to pay their passages too skeats men were contracted to fight for the earl of northampton who after campaigning in brittany had joined the king in normandy and now served him near calais ill have to pay passage for men and horses thomas skeat went on and unless things have changed since i got slapped about the head that wont be cheap wont be cheap and why would the earl want them to leave calais theyll have a bellyful of fighting come springtime the question was a good one thomas thought for there surely would be some vicious fighting near calais when the winter ended so far as thomas knew the town had not fallen but the english had surrounded it and the french king was said to be raising a great army that would attack the besiegers in springtime therell be plenty of fighting here come spring thomas said nodding at the riverbank which was very close now the fields beyond the banks were fallow but at least the barns and farmhouses still stood for these lands fed la rochederriens garrison and so they had been spared the pillage rape and fire that had crackled across the rest of the dukedom therell be fighting here skeat agreed but more in calais maybe you and i should go there tom thomas said nothing he feared skeat could no longer command a band of menatarms and archers his old friend was too prone to forgetfulness or to sudden bouts of vagueness and melancholy and those attacks were made worse by the times when skeat seemed like his old self except he never was quite like the old will skeat who had been so swift in war savage in decision and clever in battle now he repeated himself became confused and was too frequently puzzled as he was now by a guardboat flying englands red cross on its white field that pulled downstream towards the pentecost skeat frowned at the small craft is he an enemy flying our flag will he is a mailclad man stood up in the rowboats bows and hailed the pentecost who are you sir william skeat thomas shouted back using the name that would be most welcome in brittany there was a pause maybe of incredulity sir william skeat the man called back will skeat you mean the king knighted him thomas told the man i keep forgetting that myself skeat said the portside oarsmen backed water so that the guard boat turned in the tide alongside the pentecost what are you carrying the man asked empty thomas shouted the man stared up at the ragged scorched doubled sail you had trouble off normandy time those bastards were killed once and for all the man grumbled then gestured upriver to where treguiers houses smeared the sky with their woodsmoke tie up outboard of the edward he ordered them theres a harbour fee youll have to pay six shillings six shillings villeroy exploded when he was told six bloody shillings do they think we pull money off the seabed in nets thus thomas and will skeat came back to treguier where the cathedral had lost its tower after bretons who supported charles of blois had fired crossbows at the english from its summit in retaliation the english had pulled the tower down and shipped the stone to london the little harbour town was scantily populated now for it had no walls and charles of bloiss men sometimes raided the warehouses behind the quay small ships could go all the way upriver to la rochederrien but the pentecost drew too much water and so she tied herself alongside the english cog and then a dozen men in redcrossed jupons came aboard to take the harbour fee and look for contraband or else a healthy bribe to persuade them to ignore whatever they might discover but they found neither goods nor bribe their commander a fat man with a weeping ulcer on his forehead confirmed that richard totesham still commanded at la rochederrien he be there the fat man said and sir thomas dagworth commands in brest dagworth skeat sounded pleased hes a good one he is sos dick totesham he added to thomas then looked puzzled as sir guillaume emerged from the forecabin its sir guillaume thomas said in a low voice course it is skeat said sir guillaume dropped the saddlebags on the deck and the chink of coins drew an expectant gaze from the fat man sir guillaume met his gaze and half drew his sword reckon i be going the fat man said reckon you do skeat said with a chuckle robbie heaved his baggage onto the deck then stared across the waist of the eduard to where four girls were gutting herrings and chucking the offal into the air where gulls snatched it in mid flight the girls strung the gutted fish on long poles that would be placed in the smokers at the quays end are they all as pretty as that robbie asked prettier thomas said wondering how the scot could see the girls faces under their bonnets im going to like brittany robbie said there were debts to be paid before they could leave sir guillaume paid off villeroy and added enough cash to buy a new sail you might do well he advised the big man to avoid caen for a while well go on down to gascony villeroy said theres always trade in gascony maybe well even poke on down to portugal perhaps mordecai spoke shyly you would let me come you sir guillaume turned on the doctor you hate goddamn ships i have to go south mordecai said wearily to montpellier first of all the further south a man is the friendlier the people i would rather suffer a month of sea and cold than meet duke charless men passage to gascony sir guillaume offered villeroy a gold coin for a friend of mine villeroy glanced at yvette who shrugged and that persuaded the big man to agree youre welcome doctor he said so they said farewell to mordecai and then thomas and robbie will skeat and sir guillaume and his two menatarms went ashore a boat was going upstream to la rochederrien but not till later in the day and so the two menatarms were left with the baggage and thomas led the others along the narrow track that followed the rivers western bank they wore mail and carried weapons for the local peasantry were not friendly to the english but the only men they passed were a dozen drab labourers pitchforking dung from two carts the men paused to watch the soldiers pass but said nothing and by this time tomorrow thomas commented charles of blois will know weve arrived hell be quaking in his boots skeat said with a grin it began to rain as they reached the bridge which led into la rochederrien thomas stopped under the arch of the protective barbican on the bank opposite the town and pointed upstream to the ramshackle quay where he and skeats other archers had sneaked into la rochederrien on the night it first fell to the english remember that place will he asked course i remember skeat said though he looked vague and thomas did not say more they crossed the stone bridge and hurried down the street to the house by the tavern that had always been richard toteshams headquarters and totesham himself was just sliding out of his saddle as they arrived he turned and scowled at the newcomers then recognized will skeat and stared at his old friend as though he had seen a ghost skeat looked blankly back and his lack of recognition troubled totesham will the garrison commander asked will is it you will a look of astonished delight animated skeats face dick totesham of all the folk to meet totesham was puzzled that skeat should be surprised to meet him in a garrison he commanded but then he saw the emptiness in his old friends eyes and frowned are you well will i had a bash on the head skeat said but a doctor cobbled me together again things get blurred here and there just blurred the two clasped hands they were both men who had been born penniless and become soldiers then earned the trust of their masters and gained the profits of prisoners ransomed and property plundered until they were wealthy enough to raise their own bands of men which they hired to the king or to a noble and so became richer still as they ravaged more enemy lands when the troubadours sang of battle they named the king as the fighting hero and extolled the exploits of dukes earls barons and knights but it was men like totesham and skeat who did most of englands fighting totesham clapped skeat goodnaturedly on the shoulder tell me youve brought your men will god knows where they are skeat said i havent laid eyes on them in months theyre outside calais thomas put in dear god totesham made the sign of the cross he was a squat man greyhaired and broadfaced who held la rochederriens garrison together by sheer force of character but he knew he had too few men far too few men ive a hundred and thirtytwo men under orders he told skeat and half of those are sick then theres fifty or sixty mercenaries who might or might not stay till charles of blois arrives of course the townsfolk will fight for us or most of them will they will thomas interrupted astonished at the claim when the english had captured the town the previous year the towns people had fought bitterly to defend their walls and when they had lost they had been subjected to rape and plunder vet now they supported the garrison trades good totesham explained theyve never been so rich ships to gascony to portugal to flanders and to england making money they are they dont want us to leave so yes some will fight for us and itll help but its not like having trained men the other english troops in brittany were a long way to the west so when charles of blois came with his army totesham would have to hold the small town for two or three weeks before he could expect any relief and even with the inhabitants help he doubted he could do it he had sent a petition to the king at calais begging that more men be sent to la rochederrien we are far from help his clerk had written to toteshams dictation and our enemies gather close about totesham seeing will skeat had assumed that skeats men had arrived in answer to his petition and he could not hide his disappointment youll write to the king yourself totesham asked will tom here can write for me ask for your men to be sent totesham urged i need three or four hundred more archers but your fifty or sixty would help tommy dagworth cant send you any skeat asked hes as hard pressed as i am too much land to hold too few men and the king wont hear of us surrendering a single acre to charles of blois so why doesnt he send reinforcements sir guillaume asked because he aint got men to spare totesham said which is no reason for us not to ask totesham took them inside his house where a fire blazed in a big hearth and his servants brought jugs of mulled wine and plates of bread and cold pork a baby lay in a wooden cradle by the fire and totesham blushed when he admitted it was his newly married he told skeat then ordered a maid to take the baby away before it began crying he flinched when skeat took off his hat to reveal his scarred thickridged scalp then he insisted on hearing wills story and when it was told he thanked sir guillaume for the help the frenchman had given his friend thomas and robbie got a cooler welcome the latter because he was scottish and the former because totesham remembered thomas from the previous year you were a bloody nuisance totesham said bluntly you and the countess of armorica is she here thomas asked she came back aye totesham sounded guarded we can go back to her house will thomas said to skeat no you cant totesham said firmly she lost the house it was sold to pay her debts and shes been screaming about it ever since but it was sold fair and square and the lawyer who bought it has paid us a quittance to be left in peace and i dont want him disturbed so the two of you can find yourself space at the two foxes then come and have supper this invitation was to will skeat and to sir guillaume and pointedly not to thomas or robbie thomas did not mind he and robbie found a room to share in the tavern called the two foxes and afterwards as robbie had his first taste of breton ale thomas went to st renans church which vas one of the smallest in la rochederrien but also one of the wealthiest because jeanettes father had endowed it he had built a bell tower and paid to have fine pictures painted on its walls though by the time thomas reached st renans it was too dark to see the saviour walking on galilees water or the souls tumbling down to their fiery hell the only light in the church came from some candles burning on the altar where a silver reliquary held st renans tongue but thomas knew there was another treasure beneath the altar something almost as rare as a saints silent tongue and he wanted to consult it it was a book a gift from jeanettes father and thomas had been astonished to find it there not just because the book had survived the fall of the town though in truth not many soldiers would seek books for plunder but because there was any book in a small church in a breton town books were rare and that was st renans treasure a bible most of the new testament was missing evidently because some soldiers had taken those pages to use in the latrines but all of the old testament remained thomas threaded his way through the blackdressed old ladies who knelt and prayed in the nave and he found the book beneath the altar and blew off the dust and cobwebs then put it beside the candles one of the women hissed that he was being impious but thomas ignored her he turned the stiff pages sometimes stopping to admire a painted capital there was a bible in st peters church in dorchester and his father had possessed one and thomas must have seen a dozen in oxford but he had seen few others and as he searched the pages he marvelled at the time it must take to copy such a vast book more women protested his annexation of the altar and so to placate them he went a few steps away and sat crosslegged with the heavy book on his lap he was now too far from the candles and found it hard to read the script which was mostly ill done the capitals were pretty suggesting they had been done by a skilled hand but most of the writing was cramped and his task was made no easier by his ignorance of where to look in the huge book he began at the end of the old testament but did not find what he wanted and so he leafed back the huge pages crackling as he turned them he knew what he sought was not in the psalms so he turned those pages fast then slowed again seeking words out of the illwritten script and then suddenly the names jumped from the page neemias athersatha filius achelai nehemiah the governor son of hachaliah he read the whole passage but did not find what he sought and so he leafed still further back page by stiff page knowing he was close and there at last it was ego enim bram pincerna regis he stared at the phrase then read it aloud ego enim bram pincerna regis for i was the kings cupbearer mordecai had thought father ralphs book was a plea to god to make the grail true but thomas did not agree his father did not want to be the cupbearer no the notebook was a way of confessing and of hiding the truth his father had left a trail for him to follow go from hachaliah to the tirshatha and realize that the governor was also the cupbearer ego enim eram pincerna regis was thomas thought did that mean his father had lost the grail it was more likely that he knew thomas would only read the book after his death but thomas was certain of one thing the words confirmed that the grail did exist and his father had been its reluctant keeper i was the kings cupbearer let this cup pass from me the cup makes me drunk the cup existed and thomas felt a shiver go though his body he stared at the candles on the altar and his eyes blurred with tears eleanor had been right the grail existed and it was waiting to be found and to put the world right and to bring god to man and man to god and peace on earth it existed it was the grail my father a woman said gave that book to the church i know he did thomas said then he closed the bible and he turned to look at jeanette and he was almost frightened to see her in case she was less beautiful than he remembered or perhaps he feared the sight of her would engender hatred because she had abandoned him but instead he felt tears in his eyes when he saw her face merle he said softly using her nickname it meant blackbird thomas her voice was toneless then she flicked her head towards an old woman dressed and veiled in black madame verlon jeanette said who is nervous of life told me that an english soldier was stealing the bible so you came to fight the soldier thomas asked a candle guttered to his right its flame flickering as fast as a small birds heart jeanette shrugged the priest here is a coward and would not challenge an english archer so who else would come madame verlon can rest safe thomas said as he put the bible back under the altar she also said jeanettes voice had a quaver in it that the man stealing the bible had a big black bow which was why she implied she had come herself instead of sending for help she had guessed it was thomas at least you did not have to come far thomas said gesturing to the side door which led into the yard of jeanettes fathers house he was pretending not to know that she had lost the house her head jerked back i do not live there she said curtly not now a dozen women were listening and they stepped nervously back as thomas came towards them then perhaps madame he said to jeanette you will let me escort you home she nodded abruptly her eyes seemed very bright and big in the candlelight she was thinner thomas thought or perhaps that was the darkness in the church shadowing her cheeks she had a bonnet tied under her chin and a great black cloak that swept on the flagstones as she followed him to the western door you remember belas she asked him i remember the name thomas said wasnt he a lawyer he is a lawyer jeanette said and a thing of bile a creature of slime a cheat what was that english word you taught me a tosspot he is a tosspot when i came home he had bought the house claiming it was sold to pay my debts but he had bought the debts he promised to look after my business waited till i was gone then took my house and now i am back he wont let me pay what i owed he says it is paid i said i would buy the house from him for more than he paid but he just laughs at me thomas held the door for her rain was spitting in the street you dont want the house he told her not if charles of blois comes back you should be gone by then youre still telling me what to do thomas she asked and then as if to soften the harshness of her words she took his arm or perhaps she put her hand through his elbow because the street was steep and slippery i will stay here i think if you hadnt escaped from him thomas said charles was going to marry you to one of his menatarms if he finds you here hell do that or worse he already has my child he has already raped me what more can he do no she clutched thomass arm fiercely i shall stay in my little house by the south gate and when he rides into the town i will sink a crossbow quarrel in his belly im surprised you havent put a quarrel into belass belly you think i would hang for a lawyers death jeanette asked and gave a short hard laugh no i shall save my death for the life of charles of blois and all brittany and france will know he was killed by a woman unless he returns your child he wont she said fiercely he answered no appeals she meant thomas was sure that the prince of wales maybe the king as well had written to charles of blois but the appeals had achieved nothing and why should they england was charless most bitter enemy its all about land thomas she said wearily land and money she meant that her son who at three years old was the count of armorica was the rightful heir to great swathes of western brittany that were presently under english occupation if the child were to give fealty to duke jean who was edward of englands candidate to rule brittany then the claim of charles of blois to sovereignty of the duchy would be seriously weakened and so charles had taken the child and would keep him till he was of an age to swear fealty where is charles thomas asked it was one of the ironies of jeanettes life that her son had been named after his greatuncle in an attempt to win his favour he is in the tower of roncelets jeanette said which is south of rennes he is being raised by the lord of roncelets she turned on thomas its almost a year since ive seen him the tower of roncelets thomas said its a castle ive not seen it a tower i suppose yes a castle youre sure hes there im sure of nothing jeanette said wearily but i received a letter which said charles was there and i have no reason to doubt it who wrote the letter i dont know it was not signed she walked in silence for a few paces her hand warm on his arm it was belas she said finally i dont know that for sure but it must be he was goading me tormenting me it is not enough that he has my house and charles of blois has my child belas wants me to suffer or else he wants me to go to roncelets knowing that i would be given back to charles of blois im sure it was belas he hates me why why do you think she asked scornfully i have something he wants something all men want but i wont give it to him they walked on through dark streets singing sounded from some taverns and somewhere a woman screamed at her man a dog barked and was silenced the rain pattered on thatch dripped from the eaves and made the muddy street slippery a red glow slowly appeared ahead growing as they came closer until thomas saw the flames of two braziers varming the guards on the south gate and he remembered how he and jake and sam had opened that gate to let in the english army i promised you once he said to jeanette that i would fetch charles back you and i thomas jeanette said made too many promises she still sounded weary i should start keeping some of mine thomas said but to reach roncelets i need horses i can afford horses jeanette said stopping by a dark doorway i live here she went on then looked into his face he was tall but she was very nearly the same height the count of roncelets is famous as a warrior you mustnt die to keep a promise you should never have made it was made though thomas said she nodded that is true there was a long pause thomas could hear a sentrys footsteps on the wall i he began no she said hastily i didnt another time i must get used to your being here im tired of men thomas since picardy she paused and thomas thought she would say no more but then she shrugged since picardy i have lived like a nun he kissed her forehead i love you he said meaning it but surprised all the same that he had spoken the thought aloud for a heartbeat she did not speak the reflected light from the two braziers glinted red in her eyes what happened to that girl she asked that little pale thing ho was so protective of you i failed to protect her thomas said and she died men are such bastards she said then turned and pulled the rope that lifted the latch of the door she paused for a moment but im glad youre here she said without looking back and then the door was shut the bolt slid home and she was gone sir geoffrey carr had begun to think his foray to brittany was a mistake for a long time there had been no sign of thomas of hookton and once the archer arrived he had made little effort to discover any treasure it was mysterious and all the time sir geoffreys debts were growing but then at last the scarecrow discovered what plans thomas of hookton was hatching that new knowledge took sir geoffrey to maitre belass house rain poured on la rochederrien it was one of the wettest winters in memory the ditch beyond the strengthened town wall was flooded so it looked like a moat and many of the river jaudys water meadows resembled lakes the streets of the town were sticky with mud mens boots were thick with it and women went to market wearing awkward wooden pattens that slipped treacherously on the steeper streets and still thick mud was smeared on the hems of their dresses and cloaks the only good things about such rain was the protection it offered against fire and for the english the knowledge that it would make any siege of the town difficult siege engines whether catapults trebuchets or guns needed a solid base not a quagmire and men could not assault through a marsh richard totesham was said to be praying for more rain and giving thanks every morning that dawned grey heavy and damp a wet winter sir geoffrey belas greeted the scarecrow then gave his visitor a covert inspection a raw and ugly face he thought and while sir geoffreys clothes were of a fine quality they had also been made for a fatter man which suggested that either the englishman had recently lost weight or more likely the clothes had been taken from a man he had killed in battle a coiled whip hung at his belt which seemed a strange accoutrement but the lawyer never presumed to understand soldiers a very wet winter belas went on waving the scarecrow into a chair its a pissing vet winter sir geoffrey snarled to cover his nervousness nothing but rain cold and chilblains he was nervous because he was not certain that this thin and watchful lawyer was as sympathetic to charles of blois as tavern rumour suggested and he had been forced to leave beggar and dickon in the courtyard below and he felt vulnerable without their protective company especially as the lawyer had a great hulking attendant who was dressed in a leather jerkin and had a long sword at his side pierre protects me belas said he had seen sir geoffrey glancing at the big man he protects me from the enemies all honest lawyers make please sir geoffrey sit yourself he gestured again at a chair a small fire burned in the hearth the smoke vanishing up a newly made chimney the lawyer had a face as hungry as a stoat and pale as a grasssnakes belly he was wearing a black gown and a black cloak edged with black fur and a black hat with flaps that covered his ears though he now pushed one flap up so he could hear the scarecrows voice parleyvous francais he asked no breroneg a ourit the lawyer enquired and when he saw the dumb incomprehension on the scarecrows face shrugged you dont speak breton i just told you didnt i i dont talk french french and breton are not the same language sir geoffrey theyre not bloody english sir geoffrey said belligerently indeed they are not alas i do not speak english well but i learn fast it is after all the language of our new masters masters the scarecrow asked or enemies belas shrugged i am a man of how do you say of affairs a man of affairs it is not possible i think to be such and not to make enemies he shrugged again as if he spoke of trivialities then he leaned back in his chair but you come on business sir geoffrey you have property to convey perhaps a contract to make jeanette chenier countess of armorica sir geoffrey said bluntly belas was surprised but did not show it he was alert though he knew well enough that jeanette wanted revenge and he was ever watchful for her machinations but now he pretended indifference i know of the lady he admitted she knows you and she dont like you monsieur belas sir geoffrey said making his pronunciation of the name sound like a sneer she dont like you one small bit shed like to have your collops in a skillet and kindle a fierce fire under them belas turned to the papers on his desk as though his visitor was being tedious i told you sir geoffrey that a lawyer inevitably makes enemies it is nothing to worry about the law protects me piss on the law belas sir geoffrey spoke flatly his eyes curiously pale watched the lawyer who pretended to be busy sharpening a quill suppose the lady got her son back the scarecrow went on suppose the lady takes her son to edward of england and has the boy swear fealty to duke jean the law wont stop them chopping off your collops then will it one two snip snip and stoke the fire lawyer such an eventuality belas said in apparent boredom could have no possible repercussions for me so your english aint bad eh sir geoffrey sneered i dont pretend to know the law monsieur but i know folk if the countess gets her son then shell go to calais and see the king so belas asked still pretending carelessness three months sir geoffrey held up three fingers four maybe before your charles of blois can get here and she might be in calais in four weeks time and back here with the kings piece of parchment inside eight weeks and by then shell be valuable her son has what the king wants and hell give her what she wants and what she wants is your collops shell bite them off with her little white teeth and then shell skin you alive monsieur and the law wont help you not against the king it wont belas had been pretending to read a parchment which he now released so that it rolled up with a snap he stared at the scarecrow then shrugged i doubt sir geoffrey that what you describe is likely to happen the countesss son is not here but suppose monsieur just suppose that a party of men is readying themselves to go to roncelets and fetch the little tosspot belas paused he had heard a rumour that just such a raid was being planned but he had doubted the rumours truth for such tales had been told a score of times and come to nothing yet something in sir geoffreys tone suggested that this time there might be some meat on the bone a party of men belas responded flatly a party of men the scarecrow confirmed that plans to ride to roncelets and watch until the little darling is taken out for his morning piddle and then theyll snatch him bring him back here and put your collops in the frying pan belas unrolled the parchment and pretended to read it again it is hardly surprising sir geoffrey he said carelessly that madame chenier conspires for the return of her son it is to be expected but why should you bother me with it what harm can it do me he dipped the newly sharpened quill in his ink pot and how do you know about this planned raid because i ask the right questions dont i the scarecrow answered in truth the scarecrow had heard rumours that thomas planned a raid on rostrenen but other men in the town had sworn that rostrenen had been picked over so often that a sparrow would die of starvation there now so what the scarecrow had wondered was thomas really doing sir geoffrey was certain that thomas was riding to find the treasure the same treasure that had taken him to durham but why would it be at rostrenen what was there sir geoffrey had accosted one of richard toteshams deputies in a tavern and bought the man ale and asked about rostrenen and the man had laughed and shaken his head you dont want to ride on that nonsense he told sir geoffrey nonsense they aint going to rostrenen theyre going to roncelets well we dont know that for certain the man had continued but the countess of armorica is up to her pretty neck in the whole business so that means it must be roncelets and you want my advice sir geoffrey stay out of it they dont call roncelets the wasps nest for nothing sir geoffrey more confused than ever asked more questions and slowly he came to understand that the thesaurus thomas sought was not thick golden coins nor leather bags filled with jewels but instead was land the breton estates of the count of armorica and if jeanettes little son swore allegiance to duke jean then the english cause in brittany was advanced it was a treasure in its way a political treasure not so satisfying as gold but it was still valuable quite what the land had to do with durham the scarecrow did not know perhaps thomas had gone there to find some deeds or a grant made by a previous duke some lawyers nonsense and it did not matter what mattered was that thomas was riding to seize a boy who could bring political muscle to the king of england and sir geoffrey had then wondered how he could benefit from the child and for a time he had toyed with the wild idea of kidnapping the boy and taking him to calais himself but then he had realized there was a far safer profit to be made by simply betraying thomas which was why he was here and belas he suspected was interested but the lawyer was also pretending that the raid on roncelets was none of his business and so the scarecrow decided it was time to force the lawyers hand he stood and pulled down his rainsoaked jerkin you aint interested monsieur he asked so be it you know your business better than i do but i know how many are going to roncelets and i know who leads them and i can tell you when theyre going the quill was no longer moving and drips of ink were falling from its tip to blot the parchment but belas did not notice as the scarecrows harsh voice ground on of course they aint told mr totesham what theyre doing on account that officially hed disapprove which he might or he might not i wouldnt know so he thinks theyre going to burn some farms near rostrenen which maybe they will and maybe they wont but whatever they sav and whatever master totesham might believe i know theyre going to roncelets how do you know belas asked quietly i know sir geoffrey said harshly belas put down the pen sit he ordered the scarecrow and tell me what you want two things sir geoffrey said as he sat again i came to this damned town to make money but were having thin pickings monsieur thin pickings very thin for english troops had been pillaging brittany for months and there were no farms within a days ride that had not been burned and robbed while to ride further afield was to risk strong enemy patrols beyond the walls of its fortresses brittany was a wilderness of ambush danger and ruin and the scarecrow had quickly discovered that it would be a hard landscape in which to make a fortune so money is the first thing you want belas said acidly and the second refuge sir geoffrey said refuge when charles of blois takes the town the scarecrow said then i want to be in your courtyard i cannot think why belas said drily but of course you will be welcome and as for money he licked his lips let us first see how good your information is and if it is good the scarecrow asked belas considered for a moment seventy ecus he suggested eighty perhaps seventy ecus the scarecrow paused to convert it into pounds then spat just ten pounds no i want a hundred pounds and i want them in englishstruck coin they settled on sixty english pounds to be paid when belas had proof that sir geoffrey was telling him the truth and that truth was that thomas of hookton was leading men to roncelets and they were leaving on the eve of valentines feast which was just over two weeks away why so long belas wanted to know he wants more men hes only got half a dozen now and hes trying to persuade others to go with him hes telling them theres gold to be had at roncelets if you want money belas asked acidly why dont you ride with him because im seeing you instead sir geoffrey answered belas leaned back in his chair and steepled his pale long fingers and that is all you want he asked the englishman some money and refuge the scarecrow stood bending his head under the rooms low beams you pay me once he said and youll pay me again perhaps belas said evasively i give you what you want sir geoffrey said and youll pay me he went to the door then stopped because belas had called him back did you say thomas of hookton belas asked and there was an undeniable interest in his voice thomas of hookton the scarecrow confirmed thank you belas said and he looked down at a scroll he had just unrolled and it seemed he found thomass name written there for his finger checked and he smiled thank you he said again and to sir geoffreys astonishment the lawyer took a small purse from a chest beside his desk and pushed it towards the scarecrow for that news sir geoffrey i do thank you sir geoffrey back down in the courtyard found he had been given ten pounds of english gold ten pounds for just mentioning thomass name he suspected there was much more to learn about thomass plans but at least he had gold in his pocket now so the visit to the lawyer had been profitable and there was the promise of more lawyers gold to come but it was still bloody raining thomas persuaded richard totesham that instead of writing another plea to the king they should appeal to the earl of northampton who was now among the leaders of the army besieging calais the letter reminded his lordship of his great victory in capturing la rochederrien and stressed that achievement might all be for naught if the garrison was not reinforced richard totesham dictated most of the words and will skeat put a cross beside his name at the foot of the letter which claimed truthfully enough that charles of blois was assembling a new and mighty army in rennes master totesham thomas wrote who sends your lordship humble greetings reckons that charless army already numbers a thousand menatarms two times that number in crossbowmen and other men besides while in our garrison we have scarce a hundred healthy men while your kinsman sir thomas dagworth who is a weeks march away can raise no more than six or seven hundred men sir thomas dagworth the english commander in brittany was married to the earl of northamptons sister and totesham was hoping that family pride alone would persuade the earl to avoid a defeat in brittany and if northampton were to send skeats archers just the archers and not the menatarms it would double the number of bowmen on la rochederriens walls and give totesham a chance to resist a siege send the archers the letter pleaded with their bows their arrows but without their horses and totesham would send them back to calais when charles of blois was repulsed he wont believe that totesham grumbled hell know ill want to keep them so make sure he knows its a solemn promise tell him i swear on our lady and on st george that the archers will go back the description of charles of bloiss army was real enough spies in english pay sent the news which in truth charles was eager for his enemies to learn for the more la rochederriens garrison was outnumbered the lower its hopes would be charles already had close to four thousand men more were coming every week and his engineers had hired nine great siege engines to hurl boulders at the walls of the english towns and fortresses in his duchy la rochederrien would be attacked first and few men gave it a hope of lasting longer than a month it is not true i trust totesham said sourly to thomas when the letter was written that you have designs on roncelets on roncelets thomas pretended not to have heard of the place not roncelets sir but rostrenen totesham gazed at thomas with dislike theres nothing at rostrenen the garrison commander said icily i hear theres food there sir thomas said whereas totesham continued as if thomas had not spoken the countess of armoricas son is said to be held at roncelets is he sir thomas asked disingenuously and if its a swiving you want totesham ignored thomass lies then i can recommend the brothel behind st brieucs chantry were riding to rostrenen thomas insisted and none of my men will ride with you totesham said meaning none that took his wages though that still left the mercenaries sir guillaume had agreed to ride with thomas though he was uncomfortable about the prospects for success he had bought horses for himself and his two men but he reckoned they were of poor quality if it comes to a chase out of roncelets he said well be trounced so take a lot of men to put up a decent fight thomass first instinct had been to ride with just a handful of others but a few men on bad horses would be easy bait more men made the expedition safer and why are you going anyway sir guillaume demanded just to get into the widows skirts because i made a promise to her thomas said and it was true though sir guillaumes reason had the more truth and because thomas went on i need to let our enemies know that im here you mean de taillebourg sir guillaume asked he knows already you think so brother germain will have told him sir guillaume said confidently in which case i reckon your dominican is already in rennes hell come for you in good time if i raid roncelets thomas said theyll hear of me then i can be sure theyll come by candlemas he knew he could rely on robbie on sir guillaume and his two menatarms and he had found seven other men who had been lured by the rumours of roncelets wealth or by the prospect of jeanettes good opinion robbie wanted to leave straightaway but will skeat like sir guillaume advised thomas to take a larger party this aint like northern england skeat said you cant run for the border you get caught tom and youll need a dozen good men to lock shields and break heads reckon i ought to come with you no thomas said hastily skeat had his lucid moments but too often was vague and forgetful though now he tried to help thomas by recommending other men to go on the raid most turned the invitation down the tower of roncelets was too far off they claimed or the lord of roncelets was too powerful and the odds against the raiders too great some were frightened of offending iotesham who fearing to lose any of his garrison had decreed that no raids should go farther than a days ride from the town his caution meant there was little plunder to be had and it was only the poorest mercenaries who desperate for anything they could turn into cash offered to ride with thomas twelve men is enough robbie insisted sweet christ but ive been on enough raids into england my brother and i once took a herd of cattle from lord percy with just three other men and percy had half the county searching for us go in fast and come out quicker twelve men is enough thomas was almost convinced by robbies fervent words but he worried that the odds were still too uneven and the horses too badly conditioned to allow them to go swiftly in and come out quicker i want more men he told robbie if you go on dithering robbie told him the enemy will hear about you theyll be waiting for us they wont know where to wait thomas said or what to think he had spread a score of rumours about the raids purpose and hoped that the enemy would be thoroughly confused but well go soon he promised robbie sweet god but whos left to ask robbie demanded lets ride now but that same day a ship came to treguier and three more flemish menatarms rode into the garrison thomas found them that night in a tavern by the rivers edge the three complained how they had been in the english lines at calais but there was too little fighting there and thus few prospects of wealthy prisoners they wanted to try their luck in brittany and so they had come to la rochederrien thomas spoke to their leader a gaunt man with a twisted mouth and with two fingers missing from his right hand who listened grunted an acknowledgement and said he would think about it next morning all three flemings came to the two foxes tavern and said they were willing to ride we came here to fight their leader who was called lodewijk said so we go so lets leave robbie urged thomas thomas would have liked to recruit still more men but he knew he had waited long enough well go he told robbie then he went to find will skeat and made the older man promise to keep an eye on jeanette she liked and trusted skeat and thomas was confident enough to leave his fathers notebook in her keeping we shall be back he told her in six or seven days god be with you jeanette said she clung to thomas for an instant god be with you she said again and bring me my son and next dawn in a mist that pearled their long mail coats the fifteen horsemen rode lodewijk he insisted it was sir lodewijk though his two companions sniggered whenever he did refused to speak french claiming that the language made his tongue sour it is a people of filth lodewijk maintained the french filth the word is good ja filth the word is good thomas agreed jan and pieter sir lodewijks companions spoke only in guttural flemish spiced with a handful of english curses they must have learned near calais whats happening in calais thomas asked sir lodewijk as they rode south nothing the town is what you say sir lodewijk made a circling motion with his hand surrounded ja the town is goddamn surrounded by the english ja and by he paused uncertain of the word he wanted then pointed to a stretch of waterlogged ground that lay east of the road by that marshes ja by bloody marshes and the goddamn bloody french they are on again he was lost for words so jabbed his mailed finger at the lowering sky higher ground thomas guessed ja bloody high ground not so bloody high i think but higher and they he put a hand over his eyes as if shading them stare ja they stare at each other so nothing is happens but they and we gets bloody wet pissing wet ja they got wet later that morning when the rains swept in from the ocean great curtains of grey lashed the deserted farmlands and upland heaths where the trees were permanently bent towards the east when thomas had first come to brittany this had been a productive land of farms orchards mills and grazing but now it was blasted naked the fruit trees untended were thick with bullfinches the fields were choked with weeds and the pastures tangled with couch grass here and there a few folk still tried to scratch a living but they were constantly being forced to la rochederrien to work on the ramparts and their harvests and livestock were forever being stolen by english patrols if any such bretons were aware of the fifteen horsemen they took care to hide themselves and so it seemed as though thomas and his companions rode through a deserted country they rode with one spare horse they should have had more because only the three flemings were mounted on good stallions sea voyages usually had a bad effect on horses but sir lodewijk made it plain their journey had been unusually quick bloody winds is he whirled his hand and made a whooshing noise to suggest the strength of the winds which had brought the destriers through in such fine fettle quick bloody quick the flemings were not only well mounted but well equipped jan and pieter had fine mail hauberks while sir lodewijk had his chest both thighs and one arm protected by good plate that was strapped over a leatherbacked mail haubergeon the three wore black surcoats with a broad white stripe running down front and back and all had undecorated shields though sir lodewijks horses trapper displayed a badge showing a knife dripping blood he tried to explain the device but his english could not cope and thomas was left with the vague impression that it was the mark of a trading guild in bruges the butchers he suggested to robbie is that what he said butchers bloody butchers dont make war except on pigs robbie said he was in a fine mood raiding was in his blood and he had heard stories in la rochederriens taverns of the plunder that could be stolen if a man was willing to break richard toteshams rule and ride further than a days journey from the town the trouble in the north of england he told thomas is that if its worth stealing then its behind big bloody walls we scratch up some cattle now and then and a year ago i stole a fine horse off my lord percy but theres not any gold and silver to be had nothing that youd call real plunder the mass vessels are all wood or pewter or clay and the poor boxes are poorer than the poor and ride too far south and the bastards will be waiting for you on the way home i hate bloody english archers im a bloody english archer youre different robbie said and he meant it for he was puzzled by thomas most archers were country born the sons of yeomen or smiths or bailiffs while a few were the sons of labourers but none in robbies experience was well born which thomas plainly was for he spoke french and latin he was confident in the company of lords and other archers deferred to him robbie might look like a wild scottish fighter but he was the son of a gentleman and nephew to the knight of liddesdale and thus he regarded archers as inferior beings who in a properly arranged universe could be ridden down and slaughtered like game but he liked thomas youre just bloody different he said mind you when my ransoms paid and im safe home ill come back and kill you thomas laughed but it was forced laughter he was nervous he put the nervousness down to being in the unfamiliar position of leading a raid this was his idea and it had been his promises that brought most of these men on the long ride he had claimed that roncelets being so far from any english stronghold lay in unplundered country snatch the child he had promised them and they could then pillage as much as they wished or at least until the enemy woke up and organized a pursuit and that promise had persuaded men to follow him and the responsibility of it weighed on thomas he also resented worrying his ambition after all was to be the leader of a war band like will skeat had been before his injury and what hope did he have of being a good leader if he fretted over a little raid like this yet fret he did and he worried most of all that he might not have anticipated everything that could go wrong and the men who had joined him gave him small consolation for except for his friends and the newly arrived flemings they were the poorest and least well equipped of all the adventurers who had come to la rochederrien in search of wealth one of them a quarrelsome manatarms from western brittany became drunk on the first day and thomas discovered he had two water skins filled with a fierce apple spirit he broke both skins whereupon the enraged breton drew his sword and attacked thomas but he was too drunk to see properly and a knee to his groin and a thump over the head put him down hard thomas took the mans horse and left him groaning in the mud which meant he was down to fourteen men that will have helped sir guillaume said cheerfully thomas said nothing he deserved to be mocked he thought no i mean it you knock a man down one day and you might do it again you know why some men are bad leaders why they want to be liked thats bad thomas asked men want to admire their leaders they want to fear them and above all they want them to be successful what does being liked have to do with any of that if the leader is a good man he will be liked and if hes not he wont and if he is a good man and a bad leader then he is better off dead you see i am full of wisdom sir guillaume laughed he might be down on his luck his manor lost and fortune gone but he was riding to a fight and that cheered him the good thing about this rain he said is that the enemy wont expect you to be riding in it its stayathome weather theyll know weve left la rochederrien thomas said he was certain that charles of blois had as many spies in the town as the english had in rennes he wont know yet sir guillaume said were travelling faster than any message can go anyway while they know weve left la rochederrien they dont know where were going they rode south in hope that the enemy would think they were planning to scavenge the farms near guingamp then late in the first day they turned eastwards and climbed into a high empty country the hazels were in blossom and rooks were calling from the bare elm tops signs that the year was turning away from winter they camped in a deserted farm sheltered by low scorched stone walls and before the last glimmer of dusk faded they had a good augury when robbie rooting about in the ruins of the barn discovered a leather bag half buried beside the broken wall the exorbitant rain had washed the earth away above the bag which held a small silver plate and three handfuls of coins whoever had buried the money must have thought the coins too heavy to carry or else had feared being robbed during their exile from the house we how do you say sir lodewijk made a chopping motion with his hand as if he cut up a pie share ja we share no thomas said that had not been the agreement he would have preferred to have shared for that was how will skeat had treated spoils but the men who rode with him wanted to keep whatever they found sir lodewijk bridled it is how we do it ja we share we dont share sir guillaume said harshly its been agreed he spoke in french and sir lodewijk reacted as though he had been struck but he understood well enough and just turned and walked away tell your scottish friend to watch his back sir guillaume said to thomas lodewijks not so bad thomas said you just dont like him because hes flemish i hate the flemish sir guillaume agreed theyre dull stupid porkwits like the english the small argument with the flemings did not fester next morning sir lodewijk and his companions were cheerful and because their horses were much fresher and fitter than any others they volunteered with much broken english and elaborate hand signals to ride ahead as scouts and all day their black and white surcoats appeared and reappeared far ahead and each time they waved the main party on signalling that there was no danger the deeper they went into enemy territory the greater the risk but the flemings watchfulness meant that they made good progress they were weaving a path either side of the main highway that ran east and west along brittanys spine a road flanked by deep woods which hid the raiders from the few people who travelled on the road they saw only two drovers with their skinny cattle and a priest leading a band of pilgrims who walked barefoot waved tattered branches and sang a dirge no pickings there next day they went south again they were now entering a country where the farms had escaped english raiders and so the people were unafraid of horsemen and the pastures were filled with ewes and their newborn lambs many of which had been torn to bloody scraps because the men of brittany were too busy hunting each other and so the foxes thrived and the lambs died shepherds dogs barked at the greymailed men and now thomas no longer had the flemings ride ahead but instead he and sir guillaume led the horsemen and if challenged they answered in french claiming to be supporters of charles of blois wheres roncelets they constantly asked and at first found no one who knew but as the morning wore on they discovered a man who had at least heard of the place then another who said his father had once been there and he thought it was beyond the ridge the forest and the river and then a third who gave them precise directions the tower he said was no more than a halfdays journey away at the far end of a long wooded ridge that ran between two rivers he showed them where to ford the nearer river told them to follow the ridge crest southwards and then bowed his head in thanks for the coin thomas gave him they crossed the river climbed the ridge and rode south thomas knew they must be close to roncelets when they stopped for the third night but he did not press on for he reckoned it would be better to come to the tower in the dawn and so they camped under beech trees shivering because they dared not light a fire and thomas slept badly because he was listening to the strange things crackle and rustle deep in the woods and he feared those noises might be made by patrols sent out by the lord of roncelets yet no patrols found them thomas doubted there were any patrols except in his imagination yet still he could not sleep and so very early while the others snored he blundered through the trees to where the ridges flank fell steeply away and he stared into the night in hope of seeing a glimmer of light cast from the battlements of the tower of roncelets he saw nothing but he heard sheep bleating piteously further down the slope and he guessed that a fox had got among the lambs and was slaughtering them the shepherds not doing his job someone spoke in french and thomas turned thinking it was one of sir guillaumes menatarms but saw in the small moonlight that it was sir lodewijk i thought you wouldnt use french thomas said there are times when i do sir lodewijk said and he strolled to stand beside thomas and then smiling he rammed a makeshift club into thomass belly and when thomas gasped and bent over the fleming slammed the broken branch over his head and then kicked him in the chest the attack was sudden unexpected and overwhelming thomas was fighting for breath half doubled over staggering and he tried to straighten and claw at sir lodewijks eyes but the club hit him a resounding blow on the side of the head and thomas was down the flemings three horses had been tied to trees a small way from the others no one had thought that strange and no one had remarked that the beasts had been left saddled and no one woke as the horses were untethered and led away sir guillaume alone stirred when sir lodewijk collected his pieces of plate armour is it dawn he asked not yet sir lodewijk answered in soft french then carried his armour and weapons out to the woods edge where jan and pieter were lashing thomass wrists and ankles they slung him belly down on a horses back tied him to the beasts girth strap and then took him eastwards sir guillaume woke properly twenty minutes later the birds were filling the trees with song and the sun was a hint of light in the misted east thomas had vanished his mail coat his arrow bag his sword his helmet his cloak his saddle and his big black bow were all still there but thomas and the three flemings were gone thomas was taken to the tower of roncelets a foursquare unadorned fortress that reared from an outcrop of rock high above a river bend a bridge made of the same grey stone as the tower carried the high road to nantes across the river and no merchant could move his goods across the bridge without paying dues to the lord of roncelets whose banner of two black chevrons on a yellow field flew from the towers high ramparts his men wore the black and yellow stripes as a livery and were inevitably called guepes wasps this far east in brittany the folk spoke french rather than breton and their tower was nicknamed the guepier the wasps nest though on this late winters morning most of the soldiers in the village wore plain black liveries rather than the waspish stripes of the lord of roncelets the newcomers were quartered in the little cottages that lay between the guepier and the bridge and it was in one of those cottages that sir lodewijk and his two companions rejoined their comrades hes up in the castle sir lodewijk jerked his head towards the tower and god help him no trouble a man asked no trouble at all sir lodewijk said he had drawn a knife and was cutting off the white stripes that had been sewn onto his surcoat he made it easy for us a stupid bloody englishman eh so why do they want him god knows and who cares all that matters is that theyve got him and the devil will have him soon sir lodewijk yawned hugely and theres a dozen more of them out in the woods so were riding out to find them fifty horsemen rode westwards from the village the sound of their hooves and their curb chains and creaking leather armour was loud but quickly faded when they rode into the ridges thick woods a pair of kingfishers startling blue whipped up the river and vanished in shadows long weeds waved in the current where a flash of silver showed that the salmon were returning a girl carried a pail of milk down the village street and wept because in the night she had been raped by one of the blackliveried soldiers and she knew it was futile to complain for no one would protect her or even make a protest on her behalf the village priest saw her understood why she was weeping and reversed his course so he would not have to face her the black and yellow flag on the guepiers ramparts flapped in a small gust of wind then hung limp two young men with hooded falcons perched on their arms rode out of the tower and turned south the great door grated shut behind them and the sound of the heavy locking bar dropping into its brackets could be heard throughout the village thomas heard it too the sound shuddered through the rock on which the guepier was built and reverberated up the winding stair to the long bare room where he had been taken two windows lit the chamber but the wall was so thick and the embrasures so deep that thomas who was chained between the windows could not see through either of them an empty hearth stood on the opposite wall the stones of its chimney hood stained black the floors wide wooden boards were scarred and worn by too many nailstudded boots and thomas guessed this had been a barrack room it probably still was but now it was needed as his prison and so the menatarms had been ordered out and thomas carried in and manacled to the iron ring set into the wall between the two windows the manacles encircled his wrists and held them behind his back and were connected to the iron ring in the wall by three feet of chain he had tested the ring seeing if he could shift it or perhaps snap a link of the chain but all he did was hurt his wrists a woman laughed somewhere in the tower feet sounded on the circular stairs beyond the door but no one came into the room and the footsteps faded thomas wondered why the iron ring should have been cemented into the wall it seemed an odd thing to have so high up the tower where no horse would ever need to be tied maybe it had been placed there when the castle had been built he had watched once as men hauled stones to the top of a church tower and they had used a pulley attached to a ring like this one it was better to think of the ring and of stones and of masons making the tower than to reflect on his idiocy in being so easily captured or to wonder what was about to happen to him though of course he did wonder about that and nowhere in his imagination was the answer comforting he tugged on the ring again hoping that it had been there a long time and that the mortar that bedded it would have been weakened but all he did was break the skin of his wrists on the manacles sharp edges the woman laughed again and a childs voice sounded a bird flew in one of the windows fluttered for a few heartbeats and then vanished again evidently rejecting the room as a nesting site thomas closed his eyes and softly recited the prayer of the grail the same prayer that christ had uttered in gethsemane pater si vis transfer calicem isturn a me father if youre willing take this cup from me thomas repeated the prayer over and over suspecting it was a waste of breath god had not spared his own son the agony of golgotha so why would he spare thomas yet what hope did he have without prayer he wanted to weep for his own naivete in thinking he could ride here and somehow snatch the child from this stronghold that stank of woodsmoke horse dung and rancid fat it had all been so stupid and he knew he had not done it for the grail but to impress jeanette he was a fool such a damned fool and like a fool he had walked into his enemys trap and he knew he would not be ransomed what value did he have so why was he even alive because they wanted something from him and just then the door to the room opened and thomas opened his eyes a man in a monks black robe carried two trestles into the room he had untonsured hair suggesting he was a lay servant to a monastery who are you thomas asked the man who was short and had a slight limp gave no answer but just placed the two trestles in the centre of the floor and a moment later brought in five planks that he laid across the trestles to make a table a second untonsured man similarly robed in black entered the room and stared at thomas who are you thomas asked again but the second man was as silent as the first he was a big man with bony ridges over his eyes and sunken cheeks and he inspected thomas as if he were appraising a bullock at slaughter time are you going to make the fire the first man asked in a minute the second man said and he pulled a shortbladed knife from a sheath at his belt and walked towards thomas stay still he growled and you dont get hurt who are you no one you know and no one youll ever know the man said then he seized the neck of thomass woollen jerkin and with one savage cut slit it down the front the blade touched but did not break thomass skin thomas pulled back but the man simply followed him slashing and tugging at the torn cloth until thomass chest was naked then he slit down the sleeves and pulled the jerkin away so that thomas was naked from the waist up then the man pointed at thomass right foot lift it he ordered thomas hesitated and the man sighed i can make you do it he said and that will hurt or you can do it yourself and it wont hurt he pulled off both of thomass boots then cut the waist of his breeches no thomas protested dont waste your breath the man said and he sawed and tugged and ripped with the blade until he had cut through the breeches and could pull them away to leave thomas shivering and naked then the man scooped up the boots and torn clothes and carried them out of the room the other man was carrying things into the room and placing them on the table there was a book and a pot presumably of ink because the man placed two goose feathers beside the book and a small ivoryhandled knife to trim the quills then he put a crucifix on the table two large candles like those that would grace the altar of a church three pokers a pair of pincers and a curious instrument that thomas could not see properly last of all he put two chairs behind the table and a wooden bucket within thomass reach you know what thats for dont you he asked knocking the bucket with his foot who are you please dont want you to make a mess on the floor do we the bigger man came back into the room carrying some kindling and a basket of logs at least youll be warm he said to thomas with evident amusement he had a small clay pot filled with glowing embers that he used to light the kindling then he piled on the smaller logs and held his hands to the growing flames nice and warm he said and thats a blessing in winter never known a winter like it rain we should be building an ark a long way off a bell tolled twice the fire began to crackle and some of the smoke seeped out into the room perhaps because the chimney was cold what he really likes the big man who had laid the fire said is a brazier who thomas asked he always likes a brazier he does but not on a wooden floor i told him who thomas demanded dont want to burn the place down not a brazier i told him not on a wooden floor so we had to use the hearth the big man watched the fire for a while that seems to he burning proper dont it he heaped a halfdozen larger logs on the fire and then backed away he gave thomas a casual look shook his head as if the prisoner was beyond help and then both men left the room the firewood was dry and so the flames blazed high fast and fierce more smoke billowed into the room and gusted out of the windows thomas in a sudden spurt of rage dragged at the manacles heaving with all his archers strength to pull the iron ring from the wall but all he achieved was to cut the iron gyves further into his bleeding wrists he stared up at the ceiling which was simply planks over beams presumably the floor of the chamber above he had heard no footsteps up there but then there came the sound of feet just beyond the door and he stepped back to the wall a woman and a small child came in thomas crouched to hide his nakedness and the woman laughed at his modesty the child laughed too and it took thomas a few seconds to realize that the boy was jeanettes son charles who was gazing at him with interest curiosity but no recognition the woman was tall fairhaired very pretty and very pregnant she wore a pale blue dress that was belted above her swollen belle and was trimmed with white lace and little loops of pearls her hat was a blue spire with a brief veil that she pushed away from her eves to see thomas better thomas drew up his knees to hide himself but the woman brazenly crossed the room to stare down at him such a pity she said a pity thomas asked she did not elaborate are you really english she demanded and looked peeved when thomas did not answer theyre making a rack downstairs englishman windlasses and ropes to stretch you have you ever seen a man after hes been racked he flops its amusing but not i think for the man himself thomas still ignored her looking instead at the small boy who had a round face black hair and the fierce dark eyes of jeanette his mother you remember me charles thomas asked but the boy just stared at him blankly your mother sends you greetings thomas said and saw the surprise on the boys face mama charles who was almost four asked the woman snatched at charless hand and dragged him away as though thomas carried a contagion who are you she asked angrily your mother loves you charles thomas told the wideeyed boy who are you the woman insisted and then turned as the door was pushed open a dominican priest came in he was gaunt thin and tall with short grey hair and a fierce face he frowned when he saw the woman and child you should not be here my lady he said harshly you forget priest who rules here the pregnant woman retorted your husband the priest said firmly and he will not want you here so you will leave the priest held the door open and the woman whom thomas assumed to be the lady of roncelets hesitated for a heartbeat and stalked out charles looked back once then was dragged out of the room just before another dominican entered this one a younger man small and bald with a towel folded over one arm and a bowl of water in his hands he was followed by the two robed servants who walked with folded hands and downcast eyes to stand beside the fire the first priest the gaunt one closed the door then he and his fellow priest walked to the table who are you thomas asked the gaunt priest though he suspected he knew the answer he was trying to remember that misted morning in durham when he had seen de taillebourg fight robbies brother he thought it was the same man the priest who had murdered eleanor or else ordered her death but he could not be certain the two priests ignored him the smaller man put the water and towel on the table then both men knelt in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost the older priest said making the sign of the cross amen he stood opened his eyes and looked down at thomas who was still crouching on the pitted floorboards you are thomas of hookton he said formally bastard son of father ralph priest of that place who are you answer me please the dominican said thomas stared up into the mans eyes and recognized the terrible strength in the priest and knew that he dared not give in to that strength he had to resist from the very first and so he said nothing the priest sighed at this display of petty obstinacy you are thomas of hookton he declared lodewijk says so in which case greetings thomas my name is bernard de taillebourg and i am a friar of the dominican order and by the grace of god and at the pleasure of the holy father an inquisitor of the faith my brother in christ here de taillebourg gestured at the younger priest who had settled at the table where he opened the book and picked up one of the quills is father cailloux who is also an inquisitor of the faith you are a bastard thomas said staring at de taillebourg youre a murdering bastard he might have spared his breath for de taillebourg showed no reaction you will stand please the priest demanded a motherless murdering bastard thomas said making no move de taillebourg made a small gesture and the two servants ran forward and took thomas by his arms and dragged him upright and when he threatened to collapse the bigger one slapped him hard in the face stinging the bruise left by the blow sir lodewijk had given him before dawn de taillebourg waited till the men were back beside the fire i am charged by cardinal bessieres he said tonelessly to discover the whereabouts of a relic and we are informed that you can assist us in this matter which is deemed to be of such importance that we are empowered by the church and by almighty god to ensure that you tell us the truth do you understand what that means thomas you killed my woman thomas said and one day priest youre going to roast in hell and the devils will dance on your shrivelled arse de taillebourg again showed no reaction he was not using his chair but standing tall and arrowthin behind the table on which he rested the tips of his long pale fingers we know he said that your father might have possessed the grail and we know that he gave you a book in which he wrote his account of that most precious thing i tell you that we know of these matters so that you do not waste our time or your pain by denying them yet we shall need to know more and that is why we are here you understand me thomas the devil will piss in your mouth priest and shit in your nostrils de taillebourg looked faintly pained as if thomass crudity was tiresome the church grants us the authority to question you thomas he continued in a mild voice but in her infinite mercy she also commands that we do not shed blood we may use pain indeed it is our duty to employ pain but it must be pain without bloodshed this means we may employ fire his long pale fingers touched one of the pokers on the table and we may crush you and we may stretch you and god will forgive us for it will be done in his name and in his most holy service amen brother cailloux said and like the two servants made the sign of the cross de taillebourg pushed all three of the pokers to the edge of the table and the smaller servant ran across the room took the irons and plunged them into the fire we do not employ pain lightly de taillebourg said or wantonly but with prayerful regret and with pity and with a tearful concern for your immortal soul youre a murderer thomas said and your soul will sear in hell now de taillebourg continued apparently oblivious to thomass insults let us start with the book you told brother germain in caen that your father wrote it is that true and so it began a gentle questioning at first to which thomas gave no answers for he was consumed by a hatred for de taillebourg a hatred fed by the memory of eleanors pale and bloodlaced body vet the questioning was insistent and unceasing and the threat of an awful pain was in the three pokers that heated in the fire and so thomas persuaded himself that de taillebourg knew some things and there could be very little harm in telling him others besides the dominican was so very reasonable and so very patient he endured thomass anger he ignored the abuse he expressed again and again an unwillingness to employ torture and said he only wanted the truth however inadequate and so after an hour thomas began to answer the questions why suffer he asked himself when he did not possess what the dominican wanted he did not know where the grail was he was not even certain that the grail existed and so hesitantly at first and then more willingly he talked there was a book yes and much of it was in strange languages and scripts and thomas claimed to have no idea what those mysterious passages meant as for the rest he admitted a knowledge of latin and agreed he had read those parts of the book but he dismissed them as vague repetitive and unhelpful they were just stories he said what kind of stories a man received his sight after looking at the grail and then when he was disappointed in its appearance he lost his sight again god be praised for that father cailloux interjected then dipped the quill in ink and wrote down the miracle what else de taillebourg asked stories of soldiers winning battles because of the grail stories of healings thomas said do you believe them the stories thomas pretended to think then nodded if god has given us the grail father he said then it will surely work miracles did your father possess the grail i dont know so de taillebourg asked him about father ralph and thomas told how his father had walked the stony beach at hookton wailing for his sins and sometimes preaching to the wild things of the sea and the sky are you saying he was mad de taillebourg asked he was mad with god thomas said mad with god de taillebourg repeated as though the words intrigued him are you suggesting he was a saint i think many saints must have been like him thomas replied cautiously but he was also a great mocker of superstitions what do you mean he was very fond of st guinefort thomas said and called on him whenever some minor problem occurred is it mockery to do that de taillebourg asked st guinefort was a dog thomas said i know what st guinefort was de taillebourg said testily but are you saying god could not use a dog to effect his sacred purposes i am saying that my father did not believe a dog could be a saint and so he mocked did he mock the grail never thomas answered truthfully not once and in his book de taillebourg suddenly reverted to the earlier subject did he say how the grail came to be in his possession for the last few moments thomas had been aware that there was someone standing on the other side of the door de taillebourg had closed it but the latch had been silently lifted and the door pushed gently ajar someone was there listening and thomas assumed it was the lady of roncelets he never claimed that the grail was in his possession he countered but he did say that it was once owned by his family once owned de taillebourg said flatly by the vexilles yes thomas replied and he was sure the door moved a fraction father caillouxs pen scratched on the parchment everything thomas said was being written down and he remembered a wandering franciscan preacher at a fair in dorchester shouting at the people that every sin they ever committed was being recorded in a great book in heaven and when they died and went to the judgement before god the book would be opened and their sins read out and george adyn had made the crowd laugh by calling out that there was not enough ink in christendom to record what his brother was doing with dorcas churchill in puddletown the sins the franciscan had angrily retorted were recorded in letters of fire the same fire that would roast adulterers in the depths of hell and who is hachaliah de taillebourg asked thomas was surprised by the question and hesitated then he tried to look puzzled who hachaliah de taillebourg repeated patiently i dont know thomas said i think you do de taillebourg declared softly thomas stared at the priests strong bony face it reminded him of his fathers face for it had the same grim determination a hardjawed inwardness which hinted that this man would not care what others thought of his behaviour because he justified himself only to god brother germain mentioned the name thomas said cautiously but what it means i dont know i dont believe you de taillebourg insisted father thomas said firmly i do not know what it means i asked brother germain and he refused to tell me he said it was beyond someone of my wits to understand de taillebourg stared at thomas in silence the fire roared hollow in the chimney and the big servant shifted the pokers as one of the logs collapsed the prisoner says he doesnt know de taillebourg dictated to father cailloux without taking his gaze from thomas the servants put more logs on the fire and de taillebourg let thomas stare at the pokers and worry about them for a moment before he resumed his questioning so the dominican asked where is the book now in la rochederrien thomas said promptly where in la rochederrien with my baggage thomas said which i left with an old friend will skeat that was not true he had left the book in jeanettes keeping but he did not want to expose her to danger will skeat even with a damaged memory could look after himself better than the blackbird sir william skeat thomas added does sir william know what the book is de taillebourg asked he cant even read no he doesnt know there were other questions then scores of them de taillebourg wanted to know the story of thomass life why he had abandoned oxford why he had become an archer when he had last made confession what had he been doing in durham what did the king of england know of the grail what did the bishop of durham know the questions went on and on until thomas was faint from hunger and from standing yet de taillebourg seemed indefatigable as evening came on and the light from the two windows paled and darkened he still persisted the two servants had long looked rebellious while father cailloux kept frowning and glancing at the windows as if to suggest that the time for a meal was long past but de taillebourg did not know hunger he just pressed and pressed with whom had thomas travelled to london what had he done in dorset had he searched for the grail in hookton brother cailloux filled page after page with thomass answers and as the evening wore on he had to light the candles so he could see to write the flames of the fire cast shadows from the table legs and thomas was swaying with fatigue when at last de taillebourg nodded i shall think and pray about all your answers tonight thomas he said and in the morning we shall continue water thomas croaked i need water you shall be given food and drink de taillebourg said one of the servants removed the pokers from the fire father cailloux closed the book and gave thomas a glance which seemed to have some sympathy a blanket was fetched and with it came a meal of smoked fish beans bread and water and one of thomass hands was unmanacled so he could eat it two guards both in plain black surcoats watched him eat and when he was done they snapped the manacles back about his wrist and he sensed a pin being pushed through the clasp to secure it that gave him hope and when he was left alone he tried to reach the pin with his fingers but both the gyves were deep bracelets and he could not reach the clasp he was trapped he lay back against the wall huddled in the blanket and watching the dying fire no heat crossed the room and thomas shivered uncontrollably he contorted his fingers as he tried to reach the clasp of the manacles but it was impossible and he suddenly moaned involuntarily as he anticipated the pain he had been spared torture this dav but did that mean he had escaped it altogether he deserved to he thought for he had mostly told the truth he had told de taillebourg that he did not know where the grail was that he was not even certain it existed that he had rarely heard his father speak of it and that he would rather be an archer in the king of englands army than a seeker of the grail again he felt a terrible shame that he had been captured so easily he should have been on his way back to la rochederrien by now riding home to the taverns and the laughter and the ale and the easy company of soldiers there were tears in his eyes and he was ashamed of that too laughter sounded from deep in the castle and he thought he could hear the sound of a harp playing then the door opened he could only see that a man had come into the room the visitor was wearing a swathing black cloak that made him appear a sinister shadow as he crossed to the table where he stopped and stared down at thomas the fires dying timbers were behind the man edging his tall cloaked figure with red but illuminating thomas i am told the man said that he did not burn you today thomas said nothing just huddled under the blanket he likes burning people the visitor said he does like it i have watched him he shudders as the flesh bubbles he went to the fire picked up one of the pokers and thrust it into the smouldering embers before piling new logs over the dying flames the dry wood burned quickly and in the flaring light thomas could see the man for the first time he had a narrow sallow face a long nose a strong jaw and black hair swept back from a high forehead it was a good face intelligent and hard then it was shadowed as the man turned away from the fire i am your cousin he said a stab of hatred coursed through thomas youre guy vexille i am the count of astarac vexille said he walked slowly towards thomas were you at the battle by the forest of crecy yes an archer yes and at the battles end guy vexille said you shouted three words in latin calix meus inebrians thomas said guy vexille perched on the edge of the table and gazed at thomas for a long time his face was in shadow so thomas could see no expression only the faint glimmer of his eyes caix meus inebrians vexille said at last it is the secret motto of our family not the one we show on our crest you know what that is no pie repose to guy vexille said in pious trust thomas translated youre strangely well educated for an archer vexille said he stood and paced up and down as he spoke we display pie repone to but our real motto ismeus inebrians we are the secret guardians of the grail our family has held it for generations we were entrusted with it by god and your father stole it you killed him thomas said and i am proud of that guy vexille said then suddenly stopped and turned to thomas were you the archer on the hill that day yes you shoot well thomas that was the first day i ever killed a man thomas said and it was a mistake a mistake i killed the wrong one guy vexille smiled then went back to the fire and pulled out the poker to see its tip was a dull red he pushed it back into the heat i killed your father he said and i killed your woman in durham and i killed the priest who was evidently your friend you were de taillebourgs servant thomas asked astonished he had hated guy vexille because of his fathers death now he had two more deaths to add to that hatred i was indeed his servant vexille confirmed it was the penance put on me by de taillebourg the punishment of humility but now i am a soldier again and charged with recovering the grail thomas hugged his knees under the blanket if the grail has so much power he asked then why is our family so powerless guy vexille thought about the question for a moment then shrugged because we squabbled he said because we were sinners because we were not worthy but we shall change that thomas we shall recover our strength and our virtue guy vexille stooped to the fire and took the poker from the flames and swept it like a sword so that it made a hissing sound and its redhot tip seared an arc of light in the dim room have you thought thomas he asked of helping me helping you vexille paced close to thomas he still swung the poker in great scything cuts so that the light trailed like a falling star to leave wispy lines of smoke in the dark room your father he went on was the elder brother did you know that if you were legitimate you would be count of astarac he dropped the pokers tip so that it was close to thomass face so close that thomas could feel the scorching heat join me guy vexille said intensely tell me what you know help me retrieve the book and go with me on the quest for the grail he crouched so that his face was at the same height as thomass bring glory to our family thomas he said softly such glory that you and i could rule all christendom and with the power of the grail lead a crusade against the infidel that will leave them writhing in agony you and i thomas we are the lords anointed the grail guardians and if we join hands then for generations men will talk of us as the greatest warrior saints that the church ever knew his voice was deep even almost musical will you help me thomas no thomas said the poker came close to thomass right eye so close that it loomed like a great sullen sun but thomas did not twitch away he did not think his cousin would plunge the poker into his eye but he did think guy vexille wanted him to flinch and so he stayed still your friends got away today vexille said fifty of us rode to catch them and somehow they avoided us they went deep into the trees good but all they can do is retreat to la rochederrien and theyll be trapped there come the spring thomas we shall close that trap thomas said nothing the poker cooled and went dark and thomas at last dared to blink like all the vexilles guy said taking the poker away and standing you are as brave as you are foolish do you know where the grail is no guy vexille stared at him judging that answer then shrugged do you think the grail exists thomas thomas paused then gave the answer he had denied to de taillebourg through all the long day yes youre right vexille said youre right it does exist we had it and your father stole it and you are the key to finding it i know nothing of it thomas protested but de taillebourg wont believe that vexille said dropping the poker onto the table de taillebourg wants the grail as a starving man wants bread he dreams of it he moans in his sleep and he weeps for it vexille paused then smiled when the pain becomes too much to bear thomas and it will and when you are wishing that you were dead and you will then tell de taillebourg that you repent and that you will become my liege man the pain will stop then and you will live it had been vexille thomas realized who had been listening outside the door and tomorrow he would listen again thomas closed his eyes pater he prayed si ris transfer eaicon istem a me he opened his eyes again why did you kill eleanor he asked why not that is a ridiculous answer thomas snarled vexilles head snapped back as if he had been struck because she knew we existed he said thats why existed she knew we were in england she knew what we wanted guy vexille said she knew we had spoken to brother collimore if the king of england had learned that we were searching for the grail in his kingdom then he would have stopped us he would have imprisoned us he would have done to us what we are doing to you you think eleanor could have betrayed you to the king thomas asked incredulous i think it was better that no one knew why we were there guy vexille said but do you know what thomas that old monk could tell us nothing except that you existed all that effort that long journey the killings the scottish weather just to learn about you he didnt know where the grail was couldnt imagine where your father might have hidden it but he did know about you and we have been seeking you ever since father de taillebourg wants to question you thomas he wants to make you cry with pain until you tell him what i suspect you cannot tell him but i dont want your pain i want your friendship and i want you dead thomas said vexille shook his head sadly then stooped so that he was near to thomas cousin he said quietly one day you will kneel to me one day you will place your hands between my hands and you will pledge your allegiance and we shall exchange the kiss of lord and man and thus you will become my liege man and we shall ride together beneath the cross to glory we shall be as brothers i promise it he kissed his fingers then laid the tips on thomass cheek and the touch of them was almost like a caress i promise it brother vexille whispered now goodnight god damn you guy vexille thomas snarled cali meus inebrians guy vexille said and went thomas lay shivering in the dawn every footstep in the castle made him cringe beyond the deep windows cockerels crowed and birds sang and he had an impression for what reason he did not know that there were thick woods outside the tower of roncelets and he wondered if he would ever see green leaves again a sullen servant brought him a breakfast of bread hard cheese and water and while he ate the manacles were unpinned and a waspliveried guard watched him but the gyves were again fixed onto his wrists as soon as he had finished the bucket was carried away to be emptied and another put in its place bernard de taillebourg arrived shortly after and while his servants revived the fire and father cailloux settled himself at the makeshift table the tall dominican greeted thomas politely did you sleep well was your breakfast adequate its colder today isnt it ive never known a winter as wet the river flooded in rennes for the first time in years all those cellars under water thomas cold and frightened did not respond and de taillebourg did not take offence instead he waited as father cailloux dipped a quill in the ink then ordered the taller servant to take thomass blanket away now he said when his prisoner was naked to business let us talk about your fathers notebook who else is aware of the books existence no one thomas said except brother germain and you know about him de taillebourg frowned but thomas someone must have given it to you and that person is surely aware of it who gave it to you a lawyer in dorchester thomas lied glibly a name please give me a name john rowley thomas said making the name up spell it please de taillebourg said and after thomas had obeyed the inquisitor paced up and down in apparent frustration this rowley must have known what the book was surely it was wrapped in a cloak of my fathers and in a bundle of other old clothes he didnt look he might have done john rowley thomas said spinning his invention is old and fat he wont go searching for the grail besides he thought my father was mad so why would he be interested in a book of his all rowleys interested in is ale mead and mutton pies the three pokers were heating in the fire again it had started to rain and gusts of cold wind sometimes blew drops through the open windows thomas remembered his cousins warning in the night that de taillebourg liked to inflict pain yet the dominicans voice was mild and reasonable and thomas sensed he had survived the worst he had endured a day of de taillebourgs questioning and his answers seemed to have satisfied the stern dominican who was now reduced to filling in the gaps of thomass story he wanted to know about the lance of st george and thomas told how the weapon had hung in hooktons church and how it had been stolen and how he had taken it back at the battle outside the forest of crecv did thomas believe it was the real lance de taillebourg asked and thomas shook his head i dont know he said but my father believed it was and your cousin stole the lance from hooktons church yes presumably de taillebourg mused so that no one would realize he sailed to england to search for the grail the lance was a disguise he thought about that and thomas not feeling the need to comment said nothing did the lance have a blade de taillebourg asked a long one yet surely if this was the lance that killed the dragon de taillebourg observed the blade would have melted in the beasts blood would it thomas asked of course it would de taillebourg insisted staring at thomas as though he were mad dragons blood is molten molten and fiery he shrugged as if to acknowledge that the lance was irrelevant to his quest father caillouxs pen scratched as he tried to keep up with the interrogation and the two servants stood by the fire scarcely bothering to hide their boredom as de taillebourg looked for a new subject to explore he chose will skeat for some reason and asked about his wound and about his memory lapses was thomas really sure skeat could not read he cant read thomas said he sounded now as though he were reassuring de taillebourg and that was a measure of his confidence he had begun the previous day with insults and hate but now he was eagerly helping the dominican towards the end of the interrogation he had survived skeat cant read de taillebourg said as he paced up and down i suppose thats not surprising so he wont be looking at the notebook you left in his keeping ill be lucky if he doesnt use its pages to wipe his arse thats the only use will skeat has for paper or parchment de taillebourg gave a dutiful smile then stared up at the ceiling he was silent for a long time but at last shot thomas a puzzled look who is hachaliah the question took thomas by surprise and he must have shown it i dont know he managed to say after a pause de taillebourg watched thomas the room was suddenly tense the servants were fully awake and father cailloux was no longer writing but gazing at thomas de taillebourg smiled im going to give you one last chance thomas he said in his deep voice who is hachaliah thomas knew he must brazen it out get past this he thought and the interrogation would be done id never heard of him he said doing his best to sound guileless before brother germain mentioned his name whv de taillebourg seized on hachaliah as the weak point of thomass defences was a mystery but it was a shrewd seizure for if the dominican could prove that thomas knew who hachaliah was then he could prove that thomas had translated at least one of the hebrew passages in the book he could prove that thomas had lied through the whole interrogation and he would open whole new areas of revelation so de taillebourg pressed hard and when thomas continued with his denials the priest beckoned to the servants father cailloux flinched i told you thomas said nervously i really dont know who hachaliah is but my duty to god de taillebourg said taking the first of the redhot pokers from the tall servant is to make sure you are not telling lies he looked at thomas with what appeared to be sympathy i dont want to hurt you thomas i just want the truth so tell me who is hachaliah thomas swallowed i dont know he said then repeated it in a louder voice i dont know i think you do de taillebourg said and so the pain began in the name of the father de taillebourg prayed as he placed the iron against the bare flesh of thomass leg and of the son and of the holy ghost the two servants held thomas down and the pain was worse than he could have believed and he tried to twist away from it but he could not move and his nostrils were filled with the stench of burning flesh and still he would not answer the question for he thought that by revealing his lies he would open himself to more punishment somewhere in his shrieking head he believed that if he persisted in the lie then de taillebourg must believe him and he would cease to use the fire but in a competition of patience between torturer and prisoner the prisoner has no chance a second poker was heated and its tip traced down thomass ribs who is hachaliah de taillebourg asked ive told you the redhot iron was put to his chest and drawn down to his belly to leave a line of burning puckered raw flesh and the wound was instantly cauterized so it left no blood and thomass scream echoed from the high ceiling the third poker was waiting and the first was being reheated so that the pain did not need to stop and then thomas was turned onto his burned belly and the strange device which he had not been able to recognize when it was first put on the table was placed over a knuckle of his left hand and he knew it was an iron vice screwdriven and de taillebourg tightened the screw and the pain made thomas jerk and scream again he lost consciousness but father cailloux brought him back to his senses with the towel and cold water who is hachaliah de taillebourg asked such a stupid question thomas thought as if the answer was important i dont know he moaned the words and prayed that de taillebourg would believe him but the pain came again and the best moments other than pure oblivion were when thomas drifted in and out of consciousness and it seemed that the pain was a dream a bad dream but still only a dream and the worst moments were when he realized it was not a dream and that his world was reduced to agony pure agony and then de taillebourg would apply more pain either tightening a screw to shatter a finger or else placing the hot iron on his flesh tell me thomas the dominican said gently just tell me and the pain will end it will end if you just tell me please thomas you think i enjoy this in the name of god i hate it so tell me please tell me so thomas did hachaliah was the father of the tirshatha and the tirshatha was the father of nehemiah and nehemiah de taillebourg asked was what was the cup bearer to the king thomas sobbed why do men lie to god de taillebourg asked he had put the fingervice back on the table and the three pokers were all in the fire why he asked again the truth is always discovered god ensures that so thomas after all you did know more than you claimed and we shall have to discover your other lies but let us talk first though about hachaliah do you think this citation from the book of esdras is your fathers av of proclaiming his possession of the grail yes thomas said yes yes yes he was hunched against the wall his broken hands manacled behind him his body a mass of pain but perhaps the hurt would end if he confessed all but brother germain tells me that the hachaliah entry in your fathers book de taillehourg said was written in hebrew do you know hebrew thomas no so who translated the passage for you brother germain and brother germain told you who hachaliah was de taillebourg asked no thomas whimpered there was no point in lying for the dominican would doubtless check with the old monk but the answer opened a new question that in turn would reveal other areas where thomas had lied thomas knew that but it was too late to resist now so who did tell you de taillehourg asked a doctor thomas said softly a doctor de taillehourg repeated that doesnt help me thomas you want me to use the fire again what doctor a doctor of theology a physician and if you asked this mysterious doctor to explain the significance of the passage was he not curious why you wished to know so thomas confessed it was mordecai and admitted that mordecai had looked at the notebook and de taillehourg thumped the table in the first display of temper he had shown in all the long hours of questioning you showed the book to a jew he hissed the question his voice incredulous to a jew in the name of god and of all the precious saints what were you thinking to a jew to a man of the race that killed our dear saviour if the jews find the grail you fool they will raise the antichrist you will suffer for that betrayal you must suffer he crossed the room snatched a poker from the fire and brought it back to where thomas huddled against the wall to a jew de taillehourg shouted and he scored the pokers glowing tip down thomass leg you foul thing he snarled over thomass screams you are a traitor to god a traitor to christ a traitor to the church you are no better than judas iscariot the pain went on the hours went on it seemed to thomas that there was nothing left but pain he had lied when there had been no pain and so now all his previous answers were being checked against the measure of agony he could endure without losing consciousness so where is the grail de taillehourg demanded i dont know thomas said and then louder i dont know he watched the redhot iron come to his skin and by now he was shrieking before it even touched the screaming did no good because the torture went on and on and thomas talked telling all he knew and he was even tempted to do as guy vexille had suggested and beg de taillebourg to let him swear allegiance to his cousin but then somewhere in the red horror of his torment he thought of eleanor and kept silent on the fourth day when he was quivering when even a twitch of de taillebourgs hand was enough to make him whimper and beg for mercy the lord of roncelets came into the room he was a tall man with short bristling black hair and a broken nose and two missing front teeth he was wearing his own waspish livery the two black chevrons on yellow and he sneered at thomass scarred and broken body you didnt bring the rack upstairs father he sounded disappointed it wasnt necessary de taillebourg said the lord of roncelets prodded thomas with a mailed foot you say the bastards an english archer he is then cut off his bow fingers roncelets said savagely i cannot shed blood de taillebourg said by god i can roncelets pulled a knife from his belt he is my charge de taillebourg snapped he is in gods hands and you will not touch him you will not shed his blood this is my castle priest roncelets growled and your soul is in my hands de taillebourg retorted hes an archer an english archer he came here to snatch the chenier boy thats my business his fingers have been shattered by the vice de taillebourg said so hes an archer no longer roncelets was placated by that news he prodded thomas again hes a piece of piss priest thats what he is a piece of feeble piss he spat on thomas not because he hated thomas in particular but because he detested all archers who had dethroned the knight from his rightful place as king of the battlefield what will you do with him he asked pray for his soul de taillebourg said curtly and when the lord of roncelets was gone he did exactly that it was evident he had finished his questioning for he produced a small vial of holy oil and he gave thomas the final rites of the church touching the oil to his brow and to his burned breast and then he said the prayers for the dying sand me domine de taillebourg intoned his fingers gentle on thomass brow quoniam conturbata sunt ossa mea heal me lord for my bones are twisted with pain and when that was said and done thomas was carried down the castle stairs into a dungeon sunk into a pit in the rock crag on which the guepier was built the floor was the bare black stone as damp as it was cold his manacles were removed as he was locked in the cell and he thought he must go mad for his body was all pain and his fingers were shattered and he was no longer an archer for how could he draw a bow with broken hands then the fever came and he wept as he shivered and sweated and at night when he was half sleeping he gibbered in his nightmares and he wept again when he woke for he had not endured the torture but had told de taillebourg everything he was a failure lost in the dark dying then one day he did not know how many days it was since he had been taken down to the guepiers cellars de taillebourgs two servants came and fetched him they put a rough woollen shirt on him pulled dirty woollen breeches over his soiled legs and then they carried him up to the castle yard and threw him into the back of an empty dung cart the towers gate creaked open and accompanied by a score of menatarms in the lord of ronceletss livery and dazzled by the pale sun light thomas left the guepier he was hardly aware of what was happening he just lay on the dirty boards hunched in pain the stink of the carts usual cargo sour in his nostrils wanting to die the fever had not gone and he was shaking with weakness where are you taking me he asked but no one answered maybe no one even heard him for his voice was so feeble it rained the cart rumbled northwards and the villagers crossed themselves and thomas drifted in and out of a stupor he thought he was dying and he supposed they were taking him to the graveyard and he tried to call out to the carts driver that he still lived but instead it was brother germain vho answered him in a querulous voice saying he should have left the book with him in caen its your own fault the old monk said and thomas decided he was dreaming he was next aware of a trumpet calling the cart had stopped and he heard the flapping of cloth and looked up and saw that one of the horsemen was waving a white banner thomas wondered if it was his winding sheet they wrapped a baby when it came into the world and they wrapped a corpse when it went out and he sobbed because he did not want to be buried and then he heard english voices and he knew he was dreaming as strong hands lifted him from the remnants of dung he wanted to scream but he was too weak and then all sense left him and he was unconscious when he woke it was dark and he was in another cart a clean one this time and there were blankets over him and a straw mattress beneath him the cart had a leather cover on wooden halfhoops to keep out the rain and sunlight will you bury me now thomas asked youre talking nonsense a man said and thomas recognized robbies voice robbie aye its me robbie you poor bastard robbie said and stroked thomass forehead you poor poor bastard where am i youre going home thomas robbie said youre going home to la rochederrien he had been ransomed a week after his disappearance and two days after the rest of the raiding party had returned to la rochederrien a messenger had come to the garrison under a flag of truce he brought a letter from bernard de taillebourg that was addressed to sir william skeat surrender father ralphs book the letter said and thomas of hookton will be delivered back to his friends will skeat had the message translated and read to him but he knew nothing of any book so he asked sir guillaume if he had any idea what the priest wanted and sir guillaume spoke to robbie who in turn talked to jeanette and next day an answer went back to roncelets then there was a fortnights delay because brother germain had to be fetched from normandy to rennes de taillebourg insisted on that precaution because brother germain had seen the book and he could confirm that what was exchanged for thomas was indeed father ralphs notebook and so it was robbie said thomas stared up at the ceiling he vaguely felt it had been wrong to exchange him for the book even if he was grateful to be alive to be home and among his friends it was the right book robbie went on with indecent relish but we added some stuff to it he grinned at thomas we copied it all out first of course and then we added some rubbish to mislead them to confuse them see and that shrivelled old monk never noticed he just pawed at the book like a starving dog given a bone thomas shuddered he felt as if he had been stripped of pride strength and even manhood he had been utterly humiliated reduced to a shivering whining twitching thing tears ran down his face though he made no sound his hands hurt his body hurt everything hurt he did not even know where he was only that he had been brought back to la rochederrien and carried up a steep flight of stairs to this small chamber under a roofs steep rafters where the walls were roughly plastered and a crucifix hung at the head of the bed a window screened with opaque horn let in a dirty brown light robbie went on telling him about the false entries they had added to father ralphs book it had been his idea he said and jeanette had copied out the book first but after that robbie had let his imagination run wild i put some of it in scots he boasted how the grail is really in scotland have the bastards searching the heather eh he laughed but could see that thomas was not listening he went on talking anyway and then another person came into the room and wiped the tears from thomass face it was jeanette vagabondpartfm thomas she asked thomas he wanted to tell her that he had seen and spoken to her son but he could not find the words guy vexille had said thomas would want to die while he was being tortured and that had been true but thomas was surprised to find it was still true take a mans pride he thought and you leave him with nothing the worst memory was not the pain nor the humiliation of begging for the pain to stop but the gratitude he had felt towards de taillebourg when the pain did stop that was the most shameful thing of all thomas jeanette asked again she knelt by the bed and stroked his face its all right she said softly youre safe now this is my house no one will hurt you here i might a new voice said and thomas shook with fear then turned to see that it was mordecai who had spoken mordecai the old doctor was supposed somewhere in the arm south i might have to reset your finger and toe bones the doctor said and that will be painful he put his bag on the floor hello thomas i do hate boats we waited for the new sail and then when theyd finished sewing it up they decided there wasnt enough caulking between the planks and when that was corrected they decided the rigging needed work and so the wretched boat is still sitting there sailors all they ever do is talk about going to sea still i shouldnt complain it gave me the time to concoct some new material for your fathers notebook and i rather enjoyed doing that now i hear you need me my dear thomas what have they done to you hurt me thomas said and they were the first words he had spoken since he had come to jeanettes house then we must mend you mordecai said very calmly he peeled the blanket back from thomass scarred body and though jeanette flinched mordecai just smiled ive seen worse come from the dominicans he said much worse so thomas was again tended by mordecai and time was measured by the clouds passing beyond the opaque window and the sun climbing ever higher in the sky and the noise of birds plucking straw from the thatch to make their nests there were two days of awful pain when mordecai brought a bonesetter to rebreak and splint thomass fingers and toes but that pain went after a week and the burns on his body healed and the fever passed day after day mordecai peered at his urine and declared it was clearing you have the strength of an ox young thomas i have the stupidity of one thomas said just brashness mordecai said just youth and brashness when they thomas began and flinched from remembering what de taillebourg had done when they talked to me he said instead i told them you had seen the notebook they cant have liked that mordecai said he had taken a spool of cord from a pocket of his gown and now looped one end of the line around a spur of wood that protruded from an untrimmed rafter they cant have liked the thought of a jew being curious about the grail they doubtless thought i wanted to use it as a pisspot thomas despite the impiety smiled im sorry mordecai for telling them about me what choice did you have men always talk under torture thomas that is why torture is so useful it is why torture will be used so long as the sun goes on circling the earth and you think i am in more danger now than i was im jewish thomas jewish now what do i do with this he was speaking of the cord which now hung from the rafter and which he evidently wished to attach to the floor but there was no obvious anchor point what is it thomas asked a remedy mordecai said staring helplessly at the cord then at the floor i was ever unpractical with matters like this a hammer and nail you think a staple thomas suggested jeanettes idiot servant boy was sent out with careful instructions and managed to find the staple that mordecai asked thomas to hammer into the floorboard but thomas held up his crooked right hand with its fingers bent like claws and said he could not do it so mordecai clumsily banged the staple in himself and then tightened the cord and tied it off so that it stretched taut from floor to ceiling hat you must do he said admiring his handiwork is pluck it like a bowcord i cant thomas said in panic holding up his crooked hands again what are you mordecai asked what am i ignore the specious answers i know youre an englishman and i assume youre a christian but what are you i was an archer thomas said bitterly and you still are mordecai said harshly and if you are not an archer then you are nothing so pluck that cord and keep on plucking it until your fingers can close on it practise practise what else do you have to do with your time so thomas practised and after a week he could tighten two fingers opposite the thumb and make the cord reverberate like a harp string and after another week he could bend the fingers of both hands about the cord and he plucked it so vigorously that it finally broke under the strain his strength was coming back and the burns had healed to leave puckered welts where the poker had scored his skin but the wounds in his memory did not heal he would not talk of what had been done to him for he did not want to remember it instead he practised plucking the cord until it snapped and then he learned to grip a quarterstaff and fought mock battles in the house yard with robbie and as the days had lengthened out of winter he went for walks beyond the town there was a windmill on a slight hill that lay not far from the towns eastern gate and at first he could hardly manage the climb because his toes had been broken in the vice and his feet felt like unyielding lumps but by the time april had filled the meadows with cowslips he was walking confidently will skeat often went with him and though the older man never said much his company was easy if he did talk it was to grumble about the weather or complain because the food was strange or more likely because he had heard nothing from the earl of northampton you think we should write to his lordship again tom maybe the first letter didnt reach him i never did like things written down skeat said it aint natural can you write to him i can try thomas said but though he could pluck a bowcord and hold a quarterstaff or even a sword he could not manage the quill he tried but his letters were scratchy and uncontrolled and in the end one of toteshams clerks wrote the letter though totesham himself did not think the message would do any good charles of blois will be here before we get any reinforcements he said totesham was awkward with thomas who had disobeyed him by riding to roncelets but thomass punishment had been far more than totesham would have wanted and so he felt sorry for the archer you want to carry the letter to the earl he asked thomas thomas knew he was being offered an escape but he shook his head ill stay he said and the letter was entrusted to a shipmaster who was sailing the next day the letter was a futile gesture and totesham knew it for his garrison was almost certainly doomed each day brought news of the reinforcements reaching charles of blois and the enemys raiding parties were now coming within sight of la rochederriens walls and harassing the forage parties that searched the countryside for any cattle goats and sheep that could be driven back to the town to be slaughtered and salted down sir guillaume enjoyed such foraging raids since losing evecque he had become fatalistic and so savage that already the enemy had learned to be wary of the blue jupon with its three yellow hawks yet one evening coming home from a long day that had yielded only two goats he was grinning when he came to see thomas my enemy has joined charles he said the count of coutances god damn his rotten soul i killed one of his men this morning and i only wish it had been the count himself whys he here thomas asked hes not a breton philip of france is sending men to help his nephew sir guillaume said so why wont the king of england send men to oppose him he thinks calais is more important yes calais sir guillaume said in disgust is the arsehole of france he picked a shred of meat from between his teeth and your friends were out riding today he went on my friends the wasps roncelets thomas said we fought half a dozen of the bastards in some benighted village sir guillaume said and i put a lance clean through a black and yellow belly he was coughing afterwards coughing its the wet weather thomas sir guillaume explained it gives men a cough so i left him alone killed another of the bastards then event back and cured his cough i cut his head off robbie rode with sir guillaume and like him amassed coins taken from dead enemy patrols though robbie also rode in hope of meeting guy vexille he knew that name now because thomas had told him that it was guy vexille who had killed his brother just before the battle outside durham and robbie had gone to st renans church put his hand on the altars cross and sworn revenge i shall kill guy vexille and de taillebourg he vowed theyre mine thomas insisted not if i get to them first robbie promised robbie had found himself a browneyed breton girl called oana who hated to leave his side and she came with him whenever he walked with thomas one day as they set out for the windmill she appeared with thomass big black bow i cant use that thomas said frightened of it then what bloody use are you robbie asked and he patiently encouraged thomas to draw the bow and praised him as his strength returned the three of them would take the bow to the windmill and thomas would drive arrows into the wooden tower the shots were feeble at first for he could scarcely pull the cord halfway and the more power he exerted the more treacherous his fingers seemed to be and the more wayward his aim but by the time the swallows and swifts had magically reappeared above the towns roofs he could pull the cord all the way back to his ear and put an arrow through one of oanas wooden bracelets at a hundred paces youre cured mordecai told him when thomas told him that news thanks to you thomas said though he knew it was not only mordecai any more than it was the friendship of will skeat or of sir guillaume or of robbie douglas that had helped him recover bernard de taillebourg had wounded thomas but those bloodless wounds of god had not just been to his body but to his soul and it was on a dark spring night when the lightning was flickering in the east that jeanette had climbed to her attic she had not left thomas until the towns cockerels greeted the new dawn and if mordecai understood why thomas was smiling the next day he said nothing but he noted that from that moment on thomass recovery was swift thereafter thomas and jeanette talked every night he told her of charles and of the look on the boys face when thomas had mentioned his mother jeanette wanted to know everything about that look and she worried that it meant nothing and that her son had forgotten her but eventually she believed thomas when he said the boy had almost wept when he heard news of her you told him i loved him she asked yes thomas said and jeanette lay silent tears in her eyes and thomas tried to reassure her but she shook her head as if there was nothing thomas could say that would console her im sorry he said you tried jeanette said they wondered how the enemy had known thomas was coming and jeanette said that she was sure that belas the lawyer had had a hand in it i know he writes to charles of blois she said and that horrid man what did you call him epolurantail the scarecrow him jeanette confirmed lzpoourantail he talks to belas the scarecrow talks to belas thomas asked surprised he lives there now he and his men live in the storehouses she paused why does he even stay in the town others of the mercenaries had slipped away to find employment where there was some hope of victory rather than stay and endure the defeat that charles of blois threatened he cant go home thomas said because he has too many debts hes protected from his creditors so long as hes here but why la rochederrien because im here thomas said he thinks i can lead him to treasure the grail he doesnt know that thomas said but he was wrong because the next day while he was alone at the windmill and shooting arrows at a wand he had planted a hundred and fifty paces away the scarecrow and his six menatarms came riding out of the towns eastern gate they turned off the pontrieux road filed through a gap in the hedge and spurred up the shallow slope towards the mill they were all in mail and all with swords except for beggar who dwarfing his horse carried a morningstar sir geoffrey reined in close to thomas who ignored him to shoot an arrow that just brushed the wand the scarecrow let the coils of his whip ripple to the ground look at me he ordered thomas thomas still ignored him he took an arrow from his belt and put it on the string then jerked his head aside as he saw the whip snake towards him the metal tip touched his hair but did no damage i said look at me sir geoffrey snarled you want an arrow in your face thomas asked him sir geoffrey leaned forward on his saddles pommel his raw red face twisted with a spasm of anger you are an archer he pointed his whip handle at thomas and i am a knight if i chop you down theres not a judge alive who would condemn me and if i put an arrow through your eye thomas said the devil will thank me for sending him company beggar growled and spurred his horse forward but the scarecrow waved the big man back i know what you want he said to thomas thomas hauled the string back instinctively corrected for the small wind rippling the meadows grass and released the arrow made the wand quiver you have no idea what i want he told sir geoffrey i thought it was gold the scarecrow said and then i thought it was land but i never understood why gold or land would take you to durham he paused as thomas shot another arrow that hissed a hands breadth past the distant wand but now i know he finished now at last i know what do you know thomas asked derisively i know you went to durham to talk with the churchmen because youre seeking the greatest treasure of the church youre looking for the grail thomas let the bowcord slacken then looked up at sir geoffrey were all looking for the grail thomas said still derisive where is it sir geoffrey growled thomas laughed he was surprised the scarecrow knew about the grail but he supposed that gossip in the garrison had probably let everyone in la rochederrien know the best questioners of the church asked me that he said holding up one crooked hand and i didnt tell them you think ill tell you i think the scarecrow said that a man searching for the grail doesnt lock himself into a garrison that only has a month or two to live then maybe im not looking for the grail thomas said and shot another arrow at the wand but this shaft was warped and the arrow wobbled in flight and went wide above him the great sails of the mill furled about their spars and tethered by ropes creaked as a wind gust tried to turn them sir geoffrey coiled the whip you failed the last time you rode out what happens if you ride again what happens if you ride after the grail and you must be going soon before charles of blois gets here so when you ride youre going to need help thomas incredulous realized that the scarecrow had come to offer him help or perhaps sir geoffrey was asking for help he was in la rochederrien for only one reason treasure and he was no nearer to it now than he had been when he first accosted thomas outside durham you darent fail again the scarecrow went on so next time take some real fighters with you you think id take you thomas asked astonished im an englishman the scarecrow said indignantly and if the grail exists i want it in england not in some scab of a foreign place the sound of a sword scraping from its scabbard made the scarecrow and his men turn in their saddles jeanette and robbie had come to the meadow with oana at robbies side jeanette had her crossbow cocked and robbie as though he did not have a care in the world was now slashing the tops from thistles with his uncles sword sir geoffrey turned back to thomas what you dont need is a damned scotchrnan he said angrily nor a damned french bitch if you look for the grail archer look for it with loyal englishmen its what the king would want isnt it again thomas did not answer sir geoffrey hung the whip on a hook attached to his belt then jerked his reins the seven men cantered down the hill going close to robbie as if tempting him to attack them but robbie ignored them what did that bastard want thomas shot at the wand brushing it with the arrows feathers i think he said that he wanted to help me find the grail help you robbie exclaimed help you find the grail like hell he wants to steal it that bastard would steal the milk from the virgin marys tits robbie jeanette said shocked then aimed her crossbow at the wand watch her thomas said to robbie shell close her eyes when she shoots she always does damn you jeanette said then unable to help it closed her eyes as she pulled the trigger the bolt slapped out of the groove and miraculously clipped the top six inches from the wand jeanette looked at thomas triumphantly i can shoot better than you with my eyes closed she said robbie had been on the towns walls and had seen the scarecrow accost thomas and so he had come to help but now with sir geoffrey gone they sat in the sun with their backs against the mills wooden skirt jeanette was staring at the towns wall which still showed the scars where the englishmade breach had been repaired with a lightercoloured stone are you really nobly born she asked thomas bastard born thomas said but to a nobleman he was the count of astarac thomas said then laughed because it was strange to think that father ralph mad father ralph who had preached to the gulls on hooktons beach had been a count so whats the badge of astarac jeanette asked a yale thomas told her holding a cup and he showed her the faded silver patch on his black bowstave that was engraved with the strange creature that had horns cloven hooves claws tusks and a lions tail ill have a banner made for you jeanette said a banner why a man should display his badge jeanette said and you should leave la rochederrien thomas retorted he kept trying to persuade her to leave the town but she insisted she would stay she doubted now she would ever get her son back and so she was determined to kill charles of blois with one of her crossbows bolts which were made of dense yew heartwood tipped with iron heads and fledged not with feathers but with stiff pieces of leather inserted into slits cut crosswise into the yew and then bound up with cord and glue that was why she practised so assiduously for the chance to cut down the man who had raped her and taken her child easter came before the enemy arrived the weather was warm now the hedgerows were full of nestlings and the meadows echoed with the shriek of partridges and on the day after easter when folk ate up the remnants of the feast that had broken their lenten fast the dreaded news at last arrived from rennes that charles of blois had marched more than four thousand men left rennes under the white ermine banner of the duke of brittany two thousand of them were crossbowmen most wearing the green and red livery of genoa and bearing the citys badge of the holy grail on their right arms they were mercenaries hired and prized for their skill a thousand infantrymen marched with them the men who would dig the trenches and assault the broken walls of the english fortresses and then there were over a thousand knights or menatarms most of them french who formed the hard armoured heart of duke charless army they marched towards la rochederrien but the real aim of the campaign was not to capture the town which was of negligible value but rather to draw sir thomas dagworth and his small army into a pitched battle in which the knights and menatarms mounted on their big armoured horses would be released to smash their way through the english ranks a convoy of heavy carts carried nine siege machines which needed the attentions of over a hundred engineers who understood how to assemble and work the giant devices that could hurl boulders the size of beer barrels further than a how could drive an arrow a florentine gunner had offered six of his strange machines to charles but the duke had turned them down guns were rare expensive and he believed temperamental while the old mechanical devices worked well enough if they were properly greased with tallow and charles saw no reason to abandon them over four thousand men left rennes but far more arrived in the fields outside la rochederrien country folk who hated the english joined the army to gain revenge for all the cattle harvests property and virginity their families had lost to the foreigners some were armed with nothing more than mattocks or axes but when the time came to assault the town such angry men would be useful the army came to la rochederrien and charles of blois heard the last of the towns gates slam shut he sent a messenger to demand the garrisons surrender knowing the request was futile and while his tents were pitched he ordered other horsemen to patrol westwards on the roads leading to finisterre the worlds end they were there to warn him when sir thomas dagworths army marched to relieve the town if indeed it did march his spies had told charles that dagworth could not even raise a thousand men and how many of those will be archers he asked at most your grace five hundred the man who answered was a priest one of the many who served in charless retinue the duke was known as a pious man and liked to employ priests as advisers secretaries and in this case as a spymaster at most five hundred the priest repeated but in truth your grace far fewer fewer how so fever in finisterre the priest answered then smiled thinly god is good to us amen to that and how many archers are in the town garrison sixty healthy men your grace the priest had belass latest report just sixty charles grimaced he had been defeated by english archers before even when he had so outnumbered them that defeat had seemed impossible and as a result he was properly wary of the long arrows but he was also an intelligent man and he had given the problem of the english war bow a deal of thought it was possible to defeat the weapon he thought and on this campaign he would show how it could be done cleverness that most despised of soldierly qualities would triumph and charles of blois styled by the french as the duke and ruler of brittany was undeniably a clever man he could read and write in six languages spoke latin better than most priests and was a master of rhetoric he even looked clever with his thin pale face and intense blue eyes fair beard and moustache he had been fighting his rivals for the dukedom almost all his adult life but now at last he had gained the ascendancy the king of england besieging calais was not reinforcing his garrisons in brittany while the king of france who was charless uncle had been generous with men which meant that duke charles at last outnumbered his enemies by summers end he thought he would be master of all his ancestral domains but then he cautioned himself against overconfidence even five hundred archers he observed even five hundred and sixty archers can be dangerous he had a precise voice pedantic and dry and the priests in his entourage often thought he sounded very like a priest himself the genoese will swamp them with bolts your grace a priest assured the duke pray god they do charles said piously though god he thought would need some help from human cleverness next morning under a late spring sun charles rode around la rochederrien though he kept far enough away so that no english arrow could reach him the defenders had hung banners from the town walls some of the flags displayed the english cross of st george others the white ermine badge of the montfort duke that was so similar to charless own device many of the flags were inscribed with insults aimed at charles one showed the dukes white ermine with an english arrow through its bleeding belly and another was evidently a picture of charles himself being trampled under a great black horse but most of the flags were pious exhortations inviting gods help or displaying the cross to show the attackers where heavens sympathies were supposed to lie most besieged towns would also have flaunted the banners of their noble defenders but la rochederrien had few nobles or at least few who displayed their badges and none to match the ranks of the aristocrats in charless army the three hawks of evecque were displayed on the wall but everyone knew sir guillaume had been dispossessed and had no more than three or four followers one flag showed a red heart on a pale field and a priest in charless entourage thought it was the badge of the douglas family in scotland but that was a nonsense for no scotsman would be fighting for the english next to the red heart was a brighter banner showing a blue and white sea of wavy lines is that charles began to ask then paused frowning the badge of armorica your grace the lord of roncelets answered today as duke charles circled the town he was accompanied by his great lords so that the defenders would see their banners and be awed most were lords of brittany the viscount rohan and the viscount morgat rode close behind the duke then came the lords of chåteaubriant and of roncelets laval guingamp rouge dinan redon and malestroit all of them mounted on highstepping destriers while from normandy the count of coutances and the lords of valognes and carteret had brought their retainers to do battle for the nephew of their king i thought armorica was dead one of the norman lords remarked he has a son roncelets answered and a widow the count of guingamp said and shes the traitorous bitch flying the banner a pretty traitorous bitch though the viscount rohan said and the lords laughed for they all knew how to treat unruly but pretty widows charles grimaced at their unseemly laughter when we take the town he ordered coldly the dowager countess of armorica will not be hurt she will be brought to me he had raped jeanette once and he would rape her again and when that pleasure was done he would marry her off to one of his menatarms who would teach her to mind her manners and to curb her tongue now he reined in his horse to watch as more banners were hung from the ramparts all of them insults to him and his house its a busy garrison he said drily busy townspeople the viscount rohan snarled busy goddamn traitors townsfolk charles seemed puzzled why would the townsfolk support the english trade roncelets answered curtly trade theyre becoming rich roncelets growled and they like it they like it enough to fight against their lord charles asked in disbelief a disloyal rabble roncelets said dismissively a rabble charles said that we shall have to impoverish he spurred on only checking his horse when he saw another noblemans banner this one showing a yale flourishing a chalice so far he had not seen a single banner that promised a great ransom if its lord was captured but this badge was a mystery whose is that he asked no one knew but then a slim young man on a tall black horse answered from the rear of the dukes entourage the badge of astarac your grace and it belongs to an imposter the man who had answered had come from france with a hundred grim horsemen liveried in plain black and he was accompanied by a dominican with a frightening face charles of blois was glad to have the blackliveried men in his army for they were all hard and experienced soldiers but he did feel somewhat nervous of them they were somehow too hard too experienced an imposter he repeated and spurred on then we do not need to worry ourselves about him there were three gates on the towns landward side and a fourth opening onto the bridge facing the river charles planned to besiege each of those gates so that the garrison would be trapped like foxes with their earths stopped the army he decreed when the lords returned to the ducal tent which had been raised close to the windmill that stood on the slight hill to the east of the town will be divided into four parts and one part will face each gate the lords listened and a priest copied down the pronouncement so that history would have a true record of the dukes martial genius each of the four divisions of charless army would outnumber any relief force that sir thomas dagworth could gather but to make himself even more secure charles ordered that the four encampments were to surround themselves with earthworks so that the english would be forced to attack across ditches banks palisades and thorn hedges the obstacles would conceal charless men from the archers and give his genoese crossbowmen cover while they rewound their weapons the ground between the four encampments was to be cleared of hedges and other obstacles to leave a bare wilderness of grass and marsh the english archer charles told his lords is not a man who will fight face to face he kills from a distance and he hides behind hedges thus frustrating our horses we shall turn that tactic against him the tent was big white and airy and the smell inside was of trampled grass and mens sweat from beyond the canvas walls came the sound of dull thudding as the engineers used wooden mallets to assemble the biggest of the great siege engines our men charles further decreed will stay within their own defences we shall thus make four fortresses that will stand at the four gates of the town and if the english send a relief force then those men will have to attack our fortresses archers cannot kill men they cannot see he paused to make sure those simple words were understood archers he said again cannot kill men they cannot see remember that our crossbows will be behind banks of earth we will be screened by hedges and hidden by palisades and the enemy will be out in the open where they can be cut down there were growls of agreement for the duke made sense archers could not kill invisible men even the fierce dominican who had come with the soldiers in black looked impressed the midday bells rang from the town one the loudest was cracked and gave a harsh note la rochederrien the duke continued does not matter whether it falls or not is of little consequence what matters is that we draw our enemys army out to attack us dagworth will probably come to protect la rochederrien when he arrives we shall crush him and once he is broken then only the english garrisons will be left and we shall take them one by one until at summers end all brittany is ours he spoke slowly and simply knowing it was best to spell out the campaign for these men who though they were tough as rams were not renowned as thinkers and when brittany is ours he went on there will be gifts of land of manors and of strongholds a much louder growl of approbation sounded and the listening men grinned for there would be more than land manors and castles as the rewards of victory there would be gold silver and women lots of women the growl turned into laughter as the men realized they were all thinking the same thing but it is here charless voice called his audience to order that we make our victory possible and we do it by denying the english archer his targets an archer cannot kill men he cannot see he paused again looking at his audience and he saw them nodding as the simple truth of that assertion at last penetrated their skulls we shall all be in our own fortress one of four fortresses and when the english army comes to relieve the siege they will attack one of those fortresses that english army will be small fewer than a thousand men suppose then that it begins by attacking the fort i shall make here what will the rest of you do he waited for an answer and after a while the lord of roncelets as uncertain as a schoolboy giving a response to his master frowned and made a suggestion come to help your grace the other lords nodded and smiled agreement no charles said angrily no no no he waited making sure they had understood the simple word if you leave your fortress he explained then you offer the english archer a target it is what he wants he will want to tempt us from behind our walls to cut us down with his arrows so what do we do we stav behind our walls we stay behind our walls did they understand that it was the key to victory keep the men hidden and the english must lose sir thomas dagworths army would be forced to assault earth walls and thorn hedges and the crossbowmen would spit them on quarrels and when the english were so thinned that only a couple of hundred remained on their feet the duke would release his menatarms to slaughter the remnant you do not leave your fortresses he insisted and any man who does will forfeit my generosity that threat sobered the dukes listeners if even one of your men leaves the sanctuary of the walls charles continued we shall make sure that you will not share in the distribution of land at the end of the campaign is that plain gentlemen is that plain it was plain it was simple charles of blois would make four fortresses to oppose the four gates of the town and the english when they came would be forced to assault those newly made walls and even the smallest of the dukes four forts would have more defenders than the english had attackers and those defenders would be sheltered and their weapons would be lethal and the english would die and so brittany would pass to the house of blois cleverness it would win wars and make reputations and once charles had shown how to defeat the english here he would defeat them through all france because charles dreamed of a crown heavier than brittanvs ducal coronet he dreamed of france but it must begin here in the flooded fields about la rochederrien where the english archer would be taught his place in hell the nine siege engines were all trebuchets the largest of them capable of throwing a stone weighing twice the weight of a grown man for almost three hundred paces all nine had been made at regensburg in bavaria and the senior engineers who accompanied the gaunt machines were all bavarians who understood the intricacies of the weapons the two biggest had throwing beams over fifty feet long and even the two smallest which were placed on the far bank of the jaudy to threaten the bridge and its barbican had beams thirtysix feet long the biggest two which were named hellgiver and widowmaker were placed at the foot of the hill on which the windmill stood in essence each was a simple machine merely a long beam mounted on an axle like a giants balance or a childs seesaw only one end of the seesaw was three times longer than the other the shorter end was weighted with a huge wooden box that was filled with lead weights while the longer end which actually threw the missile was attached to a great windlass which drew it down to the ground and so raised the ten tons of lead counterweights the stone missile was placed in a leather sling some fifteen feet long which was attached to the longer arm when the beam was released so that the counterweight slammed down the longer end whipped up into the sky and the sling whipped even faster and the boulder was released from the slings leather cradle to curve through the sky and crash down onto its target that much was simple what was hard was to keep the mechanism greased with tallow to construct a winch strong enough to haul the long beam down to the ground to make a container strong enough to thump down again and again and not spill the ten tons of lead weights and trickiest of all to fashion a device strong enough to hold the long beam down against the weight of the lead vet capable of releasing the beam safely these were the matters on which the bavarians were experts and for which they were paid so generously there were many who said that the bavarians expertise was redundant guns were much smaller and hurled their missiles with greater force but duke charles had applied his intelligence to the comparison and decided on the older technology guns were slow and prone to explosions that killed their expensive gunners they were also painfully slow because the gap between the missile and the guns barrel had to be sealed to contain the powders force and so it was necessary to pack the cannon ball about with wet loam and that needed time to dry before the powder could be ignited and even the most skilful gunners from italy could not fire a weapon more than three or four times a day and when a gun fired it spat a ball weighing only a few pounds while it was true that the small ball flew with a velocity so great that it could not even be seen nevertheless the older trebuchets could throw a missile of twenty or thirty times the weight three or four times in every hour la rochederrien the duke decided would be hammered the oldfashioned way and so the little town was surrounded by the nine trebuchets as well as hellgiver and widowmaker there was stonehurler crusher gravedigger stonewhip spiteful destroyer and hand of god each trebuchet was constructed on a platform made of wooden beams and protected by a palisade that was tall and stout enough to stop any arrow some of the peasants who had joined the army were trained to stand close to the palisades and be ready to throw water over any fire arrows that the english might use to burn the fences down and so expose the trebuchets engineers other peasants dug the ditches and threw up the earthen banks that formed the dukes four fortresses where possible they used existing ditches or incorporated the thick blackthorn hedges into the defences they made barriers of sharpened stakes and dug pits to break horses legs the four parts of the dukes army ringed themselves with such defences and day after day as the walls grew and the trebuchets took shape from the pieces transported on the wagons the duke had his men practise forming their lines of battle the genoese crossbomen manned the halffinished walls while behind them the knights and menatarms paraded on foot some men grumbled that such practices were a waste of time but others saw how the duke intended to fight and they approved the english archers would be baffled by the walls ditches and palisades and the crossbows would pick them off one by one and finally the enemy would be forced to attack across the earth walls and the flooded ditches to be slaughtered by the waiting menatarms after a week of backbreaking work the trebuchets were assembled and their counterpoise boxes had been filled with great pigs of lead now the engineers had to demonstrate an even subtler skill the art of dropping their great stones one after the other onto the exact same spot of the wall so that the ramparts would be battered away and a path opened into the town then once the relieving army was defeated the dukes men could assault la rochederrien and put its treasonous inhabitants to the sword the bavarian engineers selected their first stones carefully then trimmed the length of the slings to affect the range of their machines it was a fine spring morning kestrels soared buttercups dotted the fields trout were rising to the mayflies the wild garlic was blossoming white and pigeons flew through the new leaves of the green woods it was the loveliest time of the year and duke charles whose spies told him that sir thomas dagworths english army had yet to leave western brittany anticipated triumph the bavarians he told one of his attendant priests may begin the trebuchet named hellgiver shot first a lever was pulled that extracted a thick metal pin from a staple attached to the long arm of hellgivers beam ten tons of lead dropped with a crash that could be heard in treguier the long arm whipped up and the sling whirled at the arms end with the sound of a sudden gale and a boulder arched into the sky it seemed to hang for a moment a great stone lump in the kestrelhaunted sky and then like a thunderbolt it fell the killing had begun the first stone thrown by hellgiver crashed through the roof of a dyers house close to st brieucs church and took off the heads of an english manatarms and the dyers wife a joke went through the garrison that the two bodies were so crushed together by the boulder that they would go on coupling throughout eternity the stone which killed them a rock about the size of a barrel had missed the eastern ramparts by no more than twenty feet and the bavarian engineers made adjustments to the sling and the next stone thumped just short of the wall spewing up filth and sewage from the ditch the third boulder hit the wall plumb and then a monstrous thump announced that widosvmaker had just shot its first missile and one after the other stonehurler crusher gravedigger stonewhip spiteful destroyer and hand of god added their contributions richard totesham did his best to blunt the assault of the trebuchets it was evident that charles was attempting to make four breaches one on each side of the town and so totesham ordered vast bags to be sewn and stuffed with straw and the bags were placed to cushion the walls which were further protected by baulks of timber those precautions served to slow the process of making the breaches but the bavarians were sending some of their missiles deep into the town and nothing could be done to shield the houses from those plunging boulders some townsfolk argued that totesham should construct a trebuchet of his own and try to break the enemys machines but he doubted there was time and instead a giant crossbow was fashioned from ships spars that had been brought upstream from treguier before the siege began treguier was now deserted for lacking walls its inhabitants had either come to la rochederrien for shelter fled to sea in their ships or gone over to charless camp toteshams springald was thirty feet in width and shot a bolt eight feet long propelled by a cord made from braided leather it was cocked by means of a ships windlass it took four davs to make the weapon and the very first time they tried to use it the spararm broke it was a had omen and there was an even worse one next morning when a horse drawing a cart of night soil broke free from its harness and kicked a child in the head the child died later that day a stone from one of the smaller trebuchets across the river plunged into richard toteshams house and brought down half the upper floor and very nearly killed his baby over a score of mercenaries tried to desert the garrison that night and some must have got clean away others joined charless army and one who had been carrying a message for sir thomas dagworth concealed in a boot was caught and beheaded next morning his severed head with the letter fixed between his teeth was hurled into the town by the trebuchet called the hand of god and the spirits of the garrison plummeted even further i am not sure mordecai told thomas whether omens can be trusted of course they can i should like to hear your reasons but show me your urine first you said i was cured thomas protested eternal vigilance dear thomas is the price of health piss for me thomas obeyed mordecai held the liquid up to the sun then dipped a finger in it and dabbed it onto his tongue splendid he said clear pure and not too saline that is a good omen is it not thats a symptom thomas said not an omen ah mordecai smiled at the correction they were in the small back yard behind jeanettes kitchen where the doctor watched the housemartins bringing mud to their new nests beneath the eaves enlighten me thomas he said with another smile on the matter of omens when our lord was crucified thomas said there was darkness in daytime and a curtain in the temple was torn in two you are saying that omens are secreted at the very heart of your faith and yours too surely thomas asked mordecai flinched as a boulder crunched down somewhere in the town the sound reverberated then there was another splintering crash as a weakened roof or floor gave way dogs howled and a woman screamed theyre doing it deliberately mordecai said of course thomas said not only was the enemy sending boulders to fall on the tight small houses of the town but they sometimes used the trebuchets to lob the rotting corpses of cattle or pigs or goats to splatter their filth and stench through the streets mordecai waited till the woman had stopped screaming i dont think i believe in omens he said we suffer some bad luck in the town and everyone assumes we are doomed but how do we know there is not some ill fortune afflicting the enemy thomas said nothing birds squabbled in the thatch oblivious that a cat was stalking just below the roof ridge what do you want thomas mordecai asked want what do you want thomas grimaced and held out his right hand with its crooked fingers for these to be straight and i want to be young again mordecai said impatiently your fingers are mended they are misshapen but mended now tell me what you want what i want thomas said is to kill the men who killed eleanor to bring jeanettes son back then to be an archer just that an archer he wanted the grail too but he did not like to talk of that with mordecai mordecai tugged at his beard to kill the men who killed eleanor he mused aloud i think youll do that jeanettes son maybe you will do that too though i dont understand why you wish to please her you dont want to marry jeanette do you marry her thomas laughed no good good thomas was offended now i have always enjoyed talking with alchemists mordecai said and i have often seen them mix sulphur and quicksilver there is a theory that all metals are composed of those two substances did you know the proportions vary of course but my point dear thomas is that if you put quicksilver and sulphur into a vessel then heat it the result is very often calamitous he mimed an explosion with his hands that i think is you and jeanette besides i cannot see her married to an archer to a king yes to a duke maybe to a count or an earl certainly but to an archer he shook his head there is nothing wrong with being an archer thomas its a useful skill in this wicked world he sat silent for a few heartbeats my son is training to be a doctor thomas smiled i sense a reproof a reproof your son will be a healer and im a killer mordecai shook his head benjamin is training to be a physician but he would rather be a soldier he wants to be a killer then why thomas stopped because the answer was obvious jews cannot carry weapons mordecai said that is why no i meant no reproof i think as soldiers go thomas that you are a good man he paused and frowned because another stone from one of the bigger trebuchets had slammed into a building not far away and as the echoing crash subsided he waited for the screams none came your friend will is a good man too mordecai went on but i fear hes no longer an archer thomas nodded will skeat was cured but not restored it would have been better i sometimes think thomas began if he had died mordecai finished the thought wish death on no man thomas it comes soon enough without a wish sir william will go home to england no doubt and your earl will look after him the fate of all old soldiers thomas thought to go home and die on the charity of the family they served then ill go to the siege of calais when all this is over thomas said and see if wills archers need a new leader mordecai smiled you wont look for the grail i dont know where it is thomas said and your fathers book mordecai asked it didnt help thomas had been poring over the copy jeanette had made he thought his father must have used some kind of code though try as he might he could not pierce the codes workings or else in its ramblings the book was merely a symptom of father ralphs troubled mind yet thomas was sure of one thing his father had believed he possessed the grail i will look for the grail thomas said but i sometimes think the only way to seek it is not to search for it he looked up startled as there was a sudden scrabbling sound on the roof the cat had made a rush and almost lost its footing as birds scattered upwards another omen mordecai suggested looking up at the escaping birds surely a good one besides thomas said what do you know of the grail i am a jew what do i know of anything mordecai asked innocently what would happen thomas if you found the grail he did not wait for an answer do you think he went on instead that the world will become a better place is it just lacking the grail is that all there was still no answer its a thing like abracadabra is that it mordecai said sadly the devil thomas was shocked abracadabra isnt the devil mordecai answered equally shocked its simply a charm some foolish jews believe if you write it in the form of a triangle and hang it about your neck then youll not suffer from the ague what nonsense the only cure for an ague is a warm poultice of cow dung but folk will put their trust in charms and i fear in omens too yet i do not think god works through the one or reveals himself through the other your god thomas said is a very long way away i rather fear he is mine is close thomas said and he does show himself then youre fortunate mordecai said jeanettes distaff and spindle were on the bench beside him and he put the distaff under his left arm and tried to spin some thread from the wool bundled about its head but he could make nothing of it you are fortunate he said again and i hope that when charless troops break in that your god stays close as for the rest of us i suppose were doomed if they break in thomas said then either take refuge in a church or try and escape by the river i cant swim then the church is your best hope i doubt that mordecai said putting down the distaff what totesham should do he said sadly is surrender let us all leave he wont do that mordecai shrugged so we must die yet the very next day he was given a chance to escape when totesham said that anyone who did not want to suffer the privations of the siege could leave the town by the southern gate but no sooner was it thrown open than a force of charless menatarms all in mail and with their faces hidden by their helmets grey visors blocked the road no more than a hundred folk had decided to go all of them women and children but charless menatarms were there to say they would not be allowed to abandon la rochederrien it was not in the besiegers interest to have fewer mouths for the garrison to feed and so the grey men barred the road and toteshams soldiers shut the town gate and the women and children were stranded all day that evening the trebuchets ceased their work for the first time since the stone had killed the dyers wife and her loser and in the strange silence a messenger came from charless encampment a trumpeter and a white flag announced that he wanted a truce and totesham ordered an english trumpeter to respond to the breton and for a white banner to be waved above the southern gate the breton messenger waited until a man of rank came to the walls then he gestured at the women and children these folk he said cannot be allowed to pass through our lines they will starve here this is the pity your master has for his people toteshams envoy responded he was an english priest who spoke breton and french he has such pity for them the messenger answered that he would free them of englands chains tell your master that he has until this evenings angelus to surrender the town and if he does he will be permitted to march out with all his weapons banners horses families servants and possessions it was a generous offer but the priest did not even consider it i will tell him the priest said but only if you tell your master that we have food for a year and weapons enough to kill all of you twice over the messenger bowed the priest returned the compliment and the parley was over the trebuchets began their work again and at nightfall totesham ordered the town gates opened and the fugitives were allowed back inside to the jeers of those who had not fled thomas like every man in la rochederrien served time on the ramparts it was tedious work for charles of blois took great care to ensure that none of his forces strayed within bowshot of the english archers but there was some diversion to be had in watching the great trebuchets they were cranked down so slowly that it seemed the vast beams were hardly moving but gradually almost imperceptibly the big wooden box with its lead weights would rise from behind the protective palisade and the long arm would sink out of sight then when the long arm was winched as low as it could go nothing would happen for a long time presumably because the engineers were loading the sling and then just when it seemed nothing ever would happen the counterweight would drop the palisade would quiver startled birds flash up from the grass and the long arm would slash up judder the sling would whip about and a stone arc into the air the sound would come then the monstrous crash of the falling counterweight followed a heartbeat later by the thump of the stone onto the broken ramparts more strawfilled bags would be thrown onto the growing breach but the missiles still did their damage and so totesham ordered his men to begin making new walls behind the growing breaches some men including thomas and robbie wanted to make a sally put together sixty men they argued and let them stream out of the town at first light they could easily overrun one or two of the trebuchets soak the machines in oil and pitch and throw burning brands into the tangle of ropes and timber but totesham refused his garrison was too small he argued and he did not want to lose even a halfdozen men before he needed to fight charless men in the breaches he lost men anyway by the third week of the siege charles of blois had finished his own defensive works and the four portions of his army were all protected behind earth walls hedges palisades and ditches he had scoured the land between his encampments of any obstacles so that when a relieving army came its archers would have nowhere to hide now with his own encampments fortified and the trebuchets biting ever bigger holes in la rochederriens walls he sent his crossbowmen forward to harass the ramparts they came in pairs one man with the crossbow and his partner holding a pavise a shield so tall wide and stoutly made that it could protect both men the pavises were painted some with holy imprecations but most with insults in french english and in some cases because the crossbowmen were genoese italian their quarrels battered the wall whistled about the defenders heads and smacked into the thatch of the houses beyond the walls sometimes the genoese would shoot fire arrows and totesham had six squads of men who did nothing except chase down fires in thatch and when they were not extinguishing flames they hauled water out of the river jaudy and soaked the thatch roofs that were nearest the ramparts and thus most in danger from the crossbowmen the english archers shot back but the crossbowmen were mostly hidden behind their pavises and when they did shoot they exposed themselves for only a heartbeat some died all the same but they were also bringing down archers on the towns walls jeanette often joined thomas on the southern rampart and loosed her bolts from a crenellation by the gate a crossbow could be fired from a kneeling position so she did not expose much of her body to danger while thomas had to stand to loose an arrow you shouldnt be here he told her every time and she would mimic his words then stoop to rewind her bow do you remember she asked him the first siege when you were shooting at me lets hope im more accurate now she said then propped the bow on the wall aimed and pulled the trigger the bolt smacked into a pavise that was already stuck with feathered english arrows beyond the crossbowmen was the earth wall of the closest encampment above which showed the ungainly beams of two trebuchets and beyond them the gaudy flags of some of charless lords jeanette recognized the banners of rohan laval malestroit and roncelets and the first sight of that wasplike banner had filled her with anger and then she had cried for the thought of her son in ronceletss distant tower i wish theyd assault now she said and i could put a bolt in roncelets as well as blois they wont attack until theyve defeated dagworth thomas said you think hes coming i think thats why theyre here thomas said nodding towards the enemy then he stood drew the bow and launched an arrow at a crossbowman who had just stepped out from behind his shield the man ducked back a heartbeat before thomass arrow hissed past him thomas crouched again charles knows he can pluck us whenever he wants he said but what he really wants is to crush dagworth for when sir thomas dagworth was crushed there would be no english field army left in brittany and the fortresses would inevitably fall one by one and charles would have his duchy then a month after charles had arrived when the hedges about his four fortresses were white with hawthorn blossom and the petals were blowing from the apple trees and the banks of the river were thick with iris and the poppies were a brilliant red in the growing rye there was a drift of smoke in the southwestern sky the watchers on la rochederriens walls saw scouts riding from the enemy encampment and they knew that the smoke must come from campfires which meant that an army was coming some feared it might be reinforcements for the enemy but they were reassured by others who claimed truly that only friends would be approaching from the southwest what richard totesham and the others who knew the truth did not reveal was that any relieving force would be small much smaller than charless army and that it was coming towards a trap that charles had made for charless ploy had worked and sir thomas dagworth had taken the bait charles of blois summoned his lords and commanders to the big tent beside the mill it was saturday and the enemy force was now a short march away and inevitably there were hotheads in his ranks who wanted to strap on their plate armour hoist up their lances and clatter off on horseback to be killed by the english archers fools abounded charles thought then dashed their hopes by making it clear that no one except the scouts was to leave any of the four encampments no one he pounded the table almost upsetting the ink pot belonging to the clerk who copied down his words no one will leave do you all understand that he looked from face to face and thought again what fools his lords were we stay behind our entrenchments he told them and they will come to us they will come to us and they will be killed some of the lords looked disgruntled for there was little glory in fighting behind earth walls and damp ditches when a man could be galloping on a destrier but charles of blois was firm and even the richest of his lords feared his threat that any man who disobeyed him would not share in the distribution of land and wealth that would follow the conquest of brittany charles picked up a piece of parchment our scouts have ridden close to sir thomas dagworths column he said in his precise voice and we now have an accurate estimate of their numbers knowing that every man in the tent wanted to hear the enemys strength he paused because he wanted to invest this announcement with drama but he could not help smiling as he revealed the figures our enemies he said threaten us with three hundred menatarms and four hundred archers there was a pause as the numbers were understood then came an explosion of laughter even charles usually so pallid unbending and stern joined in it was risible it was actually impertinent brave perhaps but utterly foolhardy charles of blois had four thousand men and hundreds of peasant volunteers who though not actually encamped inside his earthworks could be relied on to help massacre an enemy he had two thousand of the finest crossbowmen in europe he had a thousand armoured knights many of them champions of great tournaments and sir thomas dagworth was coming with seven hundred men the town might contribute another hundred or two hundred but even at their most hopeful the english could not muster more than a thousand men and charles had four times that number they will come gentlemen he told his excited lords and they will die here there were two roads on which they might approach one came from the west and it was the most direct route but it led to the far side of the river jaudy and charles did not think dagworth would use that road the other curled about the besieged town to approach from the southeast and that road led straight towards the largest of charless four encampments the eastern encampment where he was in personal command and where the largest trebuchets pounded la rochederriens walls let me tell you gentlemen charles stilled the amusement of his commanders what i believe sir thomas will do what i would do if i were so unfortunate as to be in his shoes i believe he will send a small but noisy force of men to approach us on the lannion road that was the road that came from the west the direct route and he will send them during the night to tempt us into believing that he will attack our encampment across the river he will expect us to reinforce that encampment and then in the dawn his real attack will come from the east he hopes that most of our army will be stranded across the river and that he can come in the dawn and destroy the three encampments on this bank that gentlemen is what he will probably attempt and it will fail it will fail because we have one clear hard rule and it will not be broken no one leaves an encampment no one stay behind your walls we fight on foot we make our battle lines and we let them come to us our crossbowmen will cut down their archers then we gentlemen shall destroy their menatarms but no one leaves the encampments no one we do not make ourselves targets for their bows do you understand the lord of chåteaubriant wanted to know what he was supposed to do if he was in his southern encampment and there was a fight going on in another of the forts do i just stand and watch he asked incredulous you stand and watch duke charles said in a steely voice you do not leave your encampment you understand archers cannot kill what they cannot see stav hidden the lord of roncelets pointed out that the skies were clear and the moon nearly full dagworth is no fool he went on and hell know weve made these fortresses and cleared the land to deny them cover so why wont he attack at night at night charles asked that way our crossbowmen cant see their targets but the english will have enough moonlight to see their way across our entrenchments it was a good point that charles acknowledged by nodding brusquely fires he said fires a man asked build fires now big fires when they come light the fires turn night into day his men laughed liking the idea fighting on foot was not how lords and knights made their reputations but they all understood that charles had been thinking how to defeat the dreaded english archers and his ideas made sense even if they offered little chance for glory but then charles offered them a consolation they will break gentlemen he said and when they do i shall have my trumpeter give seven blasts seven and when you hear the trumpet you may leave your encampments and pursue them there were growls of approval for the seven trumpet blasts would release the armoured men on their huge horses to slaughter the remnants of dagworths force remember charles pounded the table once more to get his mens attention remember you do not leave your encampment until the trumpet sounds stay behind the trenches stay behind the walls let the enemy come to you and we shall win he nodded to show he was finished and now gentlemen our priests will hear confessions let us cleanse our souls so that god can reward us with victory fifteen miles away in the roofless refectory of a plundered and abandoned monastery a much smaller group of men gathered their commander was a greyhaired man from suffolk stocky and gruff who knew he faced a formidable challenge if he was to relieve la rochederrien sir thomas dagworth listened to a breton knight tell what his scouts had discovered that charles of bloiss men were still in the four encampments placed opposite the towns four gates the largest encampment where charless great banner of a white ermine flew was to the east it is built around the windmill the knight reported i remember that mill sir thomas said he ran his fingers through his short grey beard a habit when he was thinking thats where we must attack he said so softly that he could have been talking to himself its where theyre strongest a man warned him so we shall distract them sir thomas stirred himself from his reverie john he turned to a man in a tattered mail coat take all the camp servants take the cooks clerks grooms anyone who isnt a fighter then take all the carts and all the draught horses and make an approach on the lannion road you know it i can find it leave before midnight lots of noise john you can take my trumpeter and a couple of drummers make em think the whole armys coming from the west i want them sending men to the western encampment well before dawn and the rest of us the breton knight asked well march at midnight sir thomas said and go east till we reach the guingamp road that road approached la rochederrien from the southeast since sir thomass small force had marched from the west he hoped that the guingamp road was the very last one charles would expect him to use itll be a silent march he ordered and we go on foot all of us archers in front menatarms behind and well attack their eastern fort in the darkness by attacking in the dark sir thomas hoped he could cheat the crossbowmen of their targets and better still catch the enemy asleep so his plans were made he would make a feint in the west and attack from the east and that was exactly what charles of blois expected him to do night fell the english marched charless men armed themselves and the town waited thomas could hear the armourers in charless camp he could hear their hammers closing the rivets of the plate armour and hear the scrape of stones on blades the campfires in the four fortresses did not die down as they usually did but were fed to keep them bright and high so that their light glinted off the iron straps that fastened the frames of the big trebuchets outlined against the fires glow from the ramparts thomas could see men moving about in the nearest enemy encampment every few minutes a fire would glow even brighter as the armourers used bellows to fan the flames a child cried in a nearby house a dog whined most of toteshams small garrison was on the ramparts and a good many of the townspeople were there too no one was quite sure why they had gone to the walls for the relief army had to be a long way off still yet few people wanted to go to bed they expected something to happen and so they waited for it the day of judgement thomas thought would feel like this as men and women waited for the heavens to break and the angels to descend and for the graves to open so that the virtuous dead could rise into the sky his father he remembered had always wanted to be buried facing the west but on the eastern edge of the graveyard so that when he rose from the dead he would be looking at his parishioners as they came from the earth they will need my guidance father ralph had said and thomas had made sure it had been done as he wished hooktons parishioners buried so that if they sat up they would look eastwards towards the glory of christs second coming would find their priest in front of them offering them reassurance thomas could have done with some reassurance this night he was with sir guillaume and his two menatarms and they watched the enemys preparations from a bastion on the towns southeast corner close to where the tower of st barnabes church offered a vantage point the remnants of toteshams giant springald had been used to make a rickety bridge from the bastion to a window in the church tower and once through the window there was a ladder that climbed past a gaping hole torn by one of the widowmakers stones to the tower parapet thomas must have made the journey a halfdozen times before midnight because from the parapet it was just possible to see over the palisade into the largest of charless camps it was while he was on the tower that robbie came to the rampart beneath i want you to look at this robbie called up to him and flourished a newly painted shield you like it thomas peered down and in the moonlight saw something red what is it he asked a blood smear you blind english bastard robbie said its the red heart of douglas ah from up here it looks like something died on the shield but robbie was proud of his shield he admired it in the moonlight there was a fellow painting a new devil on the wall in st gorans church he said and i paid him to do this i hope you didnt pay him too much thomas said youre just envious robbie propped the shield against the parapet before edging over the makeshift bridge to the tower he vanished through the window then reappeared at thomass side what are they doing he asked gazing eastwards jesus thomas blasphemed because something was at last happening he was staring past the great black shapes of hellgiver and widowmaker into the eastern encampment where men hundreds of men were forming a battle line thomas had assumed that any fight would not start until dawn vet now it looked as though charles of blois was readying to fight in the nights black heart sweet jesus sir guillaume summoned to the towers top echoed thomass surprise the bastards are expecting a fight robbie said for charless men were lining shoulder to shoulder they had their backs to the town and the moon glinted off the espaliers that covered the knights shoulders and touched the blades of spears and axes white dagworth must be coming sir guillaume said at night robbie asked why not sir guillaume retorted then shouted down to one of his menatarms to go and tell totesham what was happening wake him up he snarled when the man wanted to know what he should do if the garrison commander was asleep of course hes not asleep he added to thomas totesham might be a bloody englishman but hes a good soldier totesham was not asleep but nor had he been aware that the enemy was formed for battle and after he had negotiated the precarious bridge to st barnabes tower he gazed at charless troops with his customary sour expression reckon well have to lend a hand he said i thought you didnt approve of sorties beyond the wall sir guillaume who had chafed under that restriction observed this is the battle that saves us totesham said if we lose this fight then the town falls so we must do what we can to win it he sounded bleak then he shrugged and turned back to the towers ladder god help us he said softly as he climbed down into the shadows he knew sir thomas dagworths relieving army would be small and he feared it would be much smaller than he dared imagine but when it attacked the enemy encampment the garrison had to be ready to help he did not want to alert the enemy to the likelihood of a sortie from the battered gates and so he did not sound the church bells to gather his troops but rather sent men through all the streets to summon the archers and menatarms to the market square outside st brieucs church thomas went back to jeanettes house and pulled on his mail haubergeon which robbie had brought back from the roncelets raid then he strapped his sword belt in place fumbling with the buckle because his fingers were still clumsy at such finicky things he hung the arrow bag on his left shoulder slid the black bow out of its linen cover put a spare bowcord in his sallet then pulled the sallet onto his head he was ready and so he saw was jeanette she had her own haubergeon and helmet and thomas gaped at her you cant join the sortie he said join the sortie she sounded surprised when you all leave the town thomas who will guard the walls oh he felt foolish she smiled stepped to him and gave him a kiss now go she said and god go with you thomas went to the marketplace the garrison was gathering there but they were desperately few in number a tavernkeeper rolled a barrel of ale into the square tapped it and let men help themselves a smith was sharpening swords and axes in the light of a cresseted torch that burned outside the porch of st brieucs and his stone rang on long steel blades the sound strangely mournful in the night it was warm bats flickered about the church and dipped into the tangled mooncast shadows of a house ruined by a trebuchets direct hit women were bringing food to the soldiers and thomas remembered how just the year before these same women had screamed as the english scrambled into the town it had been a night of rape robbery and murder vet now the townsfolk did not want their occupiers to leave and the market square was becoming ever more crowded as men from the town brought makeshift weapons to help the foray most were armed with the axes they used to chop their firewood though a few had swords or spears and some townsmen even possessed leather or mail armour they far outnumbered the garrison and would at least make the sally seem formidable christ jesus a sour voice spoke behind thomas what in christs name is that thomas turned and saw the lanky figure of sir geoffrey carr staring at robbies shield which was propped against the steps of a stone cross in the markets centre robbie also turned to look at the scarecrow who was leading his six men looks like a squashed turd the scarecrow said his voice was slurred and it was evident he had spent the evening in one of the towns many taverns its mine robbie said sir geoffrey kicked the shield is that the bloody heart of douglas boy its my badge robbie said exaggerating his scottish accent if thats what you mean men all about had stopped to listen i knew you were a scot the scarecrow said sounding even more drunk but i didnt know you were a damned douglas and what the hell is a douglas doing here the scarecrow raised his voice to appeal to the assembled men whose side is bloody scotland on eh whose side and the goddamn douglases have been fighting us since they were spawned from the devils own arsehole the scarecrow staggered then pulled the whip from his belt and let its coils ripple down sweet jesus he shouted but his goddamn family has impoverished good englishmen theyre goddamn thieves spies robbie dragged his sword free and the whip lashed up but sir guillaume shoved robbie out of the way before the clawed tip could slash his face then sir guillaumes sword was drawn and he and thomas were standing beside robbie on the steps of the cross robbie douglas sir guillaume shouted is my friend and mine thomas said enough a furious richard totesham pushed through the crowd enough the scarecrow appealed to totesham hes a damned scot good god man totesham snarled weve got frenchmen welshmen flemings irishmen and bretons in this garrison what the hell difference does it make hes a douglas the scarecrow insisted drunkenly hes an enemy hes my friend thomas bellowed inviting to fight anyone who wished to side with sir geoffrey enough toteshams anger was big enough to fill the whole marketplace we have fight enough on our hands without behaving like children do you vouch for him he demanded of thomas i vouch for him it was will skeat who answered he pushed through the crowd and put an arm about robbies shoulders i vouch for him dick then douglas or not totesham said hes no enemy of mine he turned and walked away sweet jesus the scarecrow was still angry he had been impoverished by the house of douglas and he was still poor the risk he had taken in pursuing thomas had not paid off because he had found no treasure and now all his enemies seemed united in thomas and robbie he staggered again then spat at robbie i burn men who wear the heart of douglas he said i burn them he does too thomas said softly burns them robbie asked at durham thomas said his gaze on sir geoffreys eyes he burned three prisoners you did what robbie demanded the scarecrow drunk as he was was suddenly aware of the intensity of robbies anger and aware too that he had not gained the sympathy of the men in the marketplace who preferred will skeats opinion to his he coiled the whip spat at robbie and stalked uncertainly away now it was robbie who wanted a fight hey you he shouted leave it be thomas said not tonight robbie he burned three men robbie demanded not tonight thomas repeated and he pushed robbie hard back so that the scotsman sat on the steps of the cross robbie was staring at the retreating scarecrow hes a dead man he said grimly i tell you thomas that bastard is a dead man were all dead men sir guillaume said quietly for the enemy was ready for them and in overwhelming numbers and sir thomas dagworth was nearing their trap john hammond a deputy to sir thomas dagworth led the feint that came from the west along the lannion road he had sixty men as many women a dozen carts and thirty horses and he used them to make as much noise as possible once they were within sight of the westernmost of duke charless encampments fires outlined the earthworks and firelight showed in the tiny slits between the timbers of the palisade there seemed to be a lot of fires in the encampment and even more blazed up once hammonds small force began to bang pots and pans clatter staves against trees and blow their trumpets the drummers beat frantically but no panic showed on the earthen ramparts a few enemy soldiers appeared there stared for a while down the moonlit road where hammonds men and women were shadows under the trees then turned and went away hammond ordered his people to make even more noise and his six archers the only real soldiers in his decoy force went closer to the camp and shot their arrows over the palisades but still there was no urgent response hammond expected to see men streaming over the river that sir thomass spies had said was bridged with boats but no one appeared to be moving between the enemy encampments the feint it seemed had failed if we stay here a man said theyll goddamn crucify us they goddamn will hammond agreed fervently well go back down the road a bit he said just a bit back into deeper shadow the night had begun badly with the failure of the feint assault but sir thomass men the real attackers had made better progress than they expected and arrived off the eastern flank of duke charless encampment not long after the decoy group began its noisy diversion three miles to the west sir thomass men crouched at the edge of a wood and stared across the felled land to the shape of the nearest earthworks the road pale in the moonlight ran empty to a big wooden gate where it was swallowed up by the makeshift fort sir thomas had divided his men into two parties that would attack either side of the wooden gate there was to he nothing subtle in the assault just a rush through the dark then a swarming attack over the earth wall and kill whoever was discovered on its farther side god give you joy sir thomas said to his men as he walked down their line then he drew his sword and waved his party on they would approach as silently as they could and sir thomas still hoped he would achieve surprise but the firelight on the other side of the defences looked unnaturally bright and he had a sinking feeling that the enemy was ready for him yet none showed on the embanked wall and no crossbow quarrels hissed in the dark and so he dared to let his hopes rise and then he was at the ditch and splashing through its muddy bottom there were archers to left and right of him all scrambling up the bank to the palisade still no crossbows shot no trumpet sounded and no enemy showed the archers were at the fence now and it proved more flimsy than it looked for the logs were not buried deeply enough and they could be kicked over without much effort the defences were not formidable and were not even defended for no enemy challenged as sir thomass menatarms splashed through the ditch their swords bright in the moonlight the archers finished demolishing the palisade and sir thomas stepped over the fallen timbers and ran down the bank into charless camp except he was not inside the camp but rather on a wide open space that led to another bank and another ditch and another palisade the place was a labyrinth but still no bolts flew in the dark and his archers were running ahead again though some cursed as they tripped in holes dug to trap horses hooves the fires were bright beyond the next palisade where were the sentries sir thomas hefted his shield with its device of a wheatsheaf and looked to his left to see that his second party was across the first bank and streaming over the grass towards the second his own archers pulled at the new palisade and like the first it tumbled easily no one was speaking no one was shouting orders no one was calling on st george for help they were just doing their job but surely the enemy must hear the falling timbers but the second palisade was down and sir thomas jostled with the archers through the new gap and there was a meadow in front and a hedge beyond it and beyond that hedge were the enemy tents and the high windmill with its furled sails and the monstrous shapes of the two biggest trebuchets all of them lit by the bright fires so close now and sir thomas felt a fierce surge of joy for he had achieved surprise and the enemy was surely his and just at that moment the crossbows sounded the bolts flickered in from his right flank from an earth bank that ran between the second earthwork and the hedge archers were falling cursing sir thomas turned towards the crossbowmen who were hidden and then more bolts came from the thick hedge in front and he knew he had surprised no one that the enemy had been waiting for him and his men were screaming now but at least the first archers were shooting back the long english arrows flashed in the moonlight but sir thomas could see no targets and he realized the archers were shooting blindly to me he shouted dagworth dagworth shields maybe a dozen menatarms heard and obeyed him making a cluster who overlapped their shields and then ran clumsily towards the hedge break through that sir thomas thought and at least some of the crossbowmen would be visible archers were shooting to their front and their side confused by the enemys bolts sir thomas snatched a glance across the road and saw his other men were being similarly assailed we have to get through the hedge he shouted through the hedge archers through the hedge a crossbow bolt slammed into his shield half spinning him round another hissed over head an archer was twisting on the grass his belly pierced by a quarrel other men were shouting now some called on st george others cursed the devil some screamed for their wives or mothers the enemy had massed his crossbows and was pouring the bolts out of the darkness an archer reeled back a quarrel in his shoulder another screamed pitiably hit in the groin a manatarms fell to his knees crying jesus and now sir thomas could hear the enemy shouting orders and insults the hedge he roared get through the hedge he thought and maybe his archers would have clear targets at last get through the hedge he bellowed and some of his archers found a gap closed up with nothing but hurdles and they kicked the wicker barriers down and streamed through the night seemed alive with bolts fierce with them and a man shouted at sir thomas to look behind he turned and saw the enemy had sent scores of crossbowmen to cut off his retreat and that new force was pushing sir thomass men on into the heart of the encampment it had been a trap he thought a goddamned trap charles had wanted him to come into the encampment he had obliged and now charless men were curling about him so fight he told himself fight through the hedge sir thomas thundered get through the damned hedge he dodged between the bodies of his men pounded through the gap and looked for an enemy to kill but instead he saw that charless menatarms were formed in a battle line all armoured visors down and shields up a few archers were shooting at them now the long arrows smacking into shields bellies chests and legs but there were too few archers and the crossbowmen still hidden by hedges or walls or pavises were killing the english bowmen rally on the mill sir thomas shouted for that was the most prominent landmark he wanted to collect his men form them into ranks and start to fight properly but the crossbows were closing on him hundreds of them and his frightened men were scattering into the tents and shelters sir thomas swore out of sheer frustration the survivors of the other assault party were with him now but all of his men were entangled in the tents tripping on ropes and still the crossbow bolts slammed through the dark ripping the canvas as they hurtled into sir thomass dying force form here form here he yelled choosing an open space between three tents and maybe twenty or thirty men ran to him but the crossbowmen saw them and poured their bolts down the dark alleys between the tents and then the enemy menatarms came shields up and the english archers were scattering again trying to find a vantage point to catch their breath find some protection and look for targets the great banners of the french and breton lords were being brought forward and sir thomas knowing he had blundered into this trap and been comprehensively beaten just felt a surge of anger kill the bastards he bawled and he led his men at the nearest enemy the swords rang in the dark and at least now that it was hand to hand the crossbowmen could not shoot at the english menatarms the genoese were hunting the hated english archers instead but some of the bowmen had found a wagon park and sheltered by the vehicles were at last fighting back but sir thomas had no shelter and no advantage he had a small force and the enemy a great one and his men were being forced backwards by sheer pressure of numbers shields crashed on shields swords hammered on helmets spears came under the shields to tear through mens boots a breton flailed an axe beating down two englishmen and letting in a rush of men wearing the white ermine badge who shrieked their triumph and cut down still more men a manatarms screamed as axes hacked through the mail covering his thighs then another axe battered in his helmet and he was silent sir thomas staggered backwards parrying a sword blow and saw some of his men running into the dark spaces between the tents to find refuge their visors were down and they could hardly see where they were going or the enemy who came to kill them he slashed his sword at a man in a pigsnout helmet backswung the blade into a shield striped yellow and black took a step back to make space for another blow and then his feet were tangled by a tents guy ropes and he fell backwards onto the canvas the knight in the pigsnout helmet stood over him his plate mail shining in the moon and his sword at sir thomass throat i yield sir thomas said hurriedly then repeated his surrender in french and you are the knight asked sir thomas dagworth sir thomas said bitterly and he held up his sword to his enemy who took the weapon and then pushed up his snouted visor i am the viscount morgat the knight said and i accept your surrender he bowed to sir thomas handed back his sword and held out a hand to help the englishman to his feet the fight was still going on but it was sporadic now as the french and bretons hunted down the survivors killed the wounded who were not worth ransoming and hammered their own wagons with crossbow bolts to kill the english bowmen who still sheltered there the viscount morgat escorted sir thomas to the windmill where he presented him to charles of blois a great fire burned a few yards away and in its light charles stood beneath the furled sails with his jupon smeared with blood for he had helped to break sir thomass band of menatarms he sheathed his sword still bloody and took off his plumed helmet and stared at the prisoner who had twice defeated him in battle i commiserate with you charles said coldly and i congratulate your grace sir thomas said the victory belongs to god charles said not to me yet all the same he felt a sudden exhilaration because he had done it he had defeated the english field army in brittany and now as certain as blessed dawn follows darkest night the duchy would fall to him the victory is gods alone he said piously and he remembered it was now very early on sunday morning and he turned to a priest to tell the man to have a te deum sung in thanks for this great victory and the priest nodded eyes wide even though the duke had not yet spoken and then he gasped and charles saw there was an unnaturally long arrow in the mans belly then another whitefledged shaft hammered into the windmills flank and a raucous almost bestial growl sounded from the dark for though sir thomas was captured and his army was utterly defeated the battle it seemed was not quite finished richard totesham watched the fight between sir thomass men and charless forces from the top of the eastern gate tower he could not see a great deal from that vantage point for the palisades atop the earthworks the two great trebuchets and the windmill obscured much of the battle but it was abundantly clear that no one was coming from the other three french encampments to help charles in his largest fortress you d think theyd be helping each other he said to will skeat who was standing next to him its you dick will skeat exclaimed aye its me will totesham said patiently he saw that skeat was dressed in mail and had a sword at his side and he put a hand on his old friends shoulder now youre not going to be fighting tonight will are you if theres going to be a scrap skeat said then id like to help leave it to the young ones will totesham urged leave it to the young ones you stay and guard the town for me will you do that skeat nodded and totesham turned back to stare into the enemys camp it was impossible to tell which side was winning for the only troops he could see belonged to the enemy and they had their backs to him though once in a while a flying arrow would flash a reflection of the firelight as proof that sir thomass men still fought but totesham reckoned it was a bad sign that no troops were coming from the other fortresses to help charles of blois it suggested the duke did not need help which in turn suggested that sir thomas dagworth did and so totesham leaned over the inner parapet open the gate he shouted it was still dark dawn was two hours or more away yet the moon was bright and the fires in the enemy camp threw a garish light totesham hurried down the stairs from the ramparts while men pulled away the stonefilled barrels that had formed a barricade inside the gateway then lifted the great locking bar that had not been disturbed in a month the gates creaked open and the waiting men cheered totesham wished they had kept silent for he did not want to alert the enemy that the garrison was making a sortie but it was too late now and so he found his own troop of menatarms and led them to join the stream of soldiers and townsmen who poured through the gate thomas went to the attack alongside robbie and sir guillaume and his two men will skeat despite his promise to totesham had wanted to come with them but thomas had pushed him onto the ramparts and told him to watch the fight from there you aint fit enough will thomas had insisted if you say so tom skeat had agreed meekly then climbed the steps thomas once he was through the gate looked back and saw skeat on the gate tower he raised a hand but skeat did not see him or if he did could not recognize him it felt strange to be outside the longlocked gates the air was fresher lacking the stench of the towns sewage the attackers followed the road which ran straight for three hundred paces before vanishing beneath the palisade which protected the timber platforms on which hellgiver and widowmaker were mounted that palisade was higher than a tall man and some of the archers were carrying ladders to get across the obstacle but thomas reckoned the palisades had been made in a hurry and would probably topple to a good heave he ran still clumsy on his twisted toes he expected the crossbows to start at any moment but no bolts came from charless earthworks the enemy thomas supposed were occupied with dagworths men then the first of toteshams archers reached the palisade and the ladders went up but just as thomas had reckoned a whole length of the heavy fence collapsed with a crash when men put their weight on the ladders the banks and palisades had not been built to keep men out but to shelter the crossbowmen but those crossbowmen still did not know that a sortie had come from the town and so the bank was undefended four or five hundred men crossed the callen palisade most were not trained soldiers but townsmen who had been enraged by the enemys missiles crashing into their houses their women and children had been maimed and killed by the trehuchets and the men of la rochederrien wanted revenge just as they wanted to keep the prosperity brought by the english occupation and so they cheered as they swarmed into the enemy camp archers totesham roared in a huge voice archers to me archers sixty or seventy archers ran to obey him making a line just to the south of the platforms where the two biggest trebuchets were set the rest of the sortie were charging at the enemy who were no longer formed in their battle line but had scattered into small groups who were so intent on completing their victory over sir thomas dagworth that they had not been watching behind them now they turned alarmed as a feral roar announced the garrisons arrival kill the bastards a townsman shouted in breton kill an english voice roared no prisoners another man bellowed and though totesham fearful for lost ransoms called out that prisoners must be taken no one heard him in the savage roar that the attackers made charless menatarms instinctively formed a line but totesham ready for it had gathered his archers and now he ordered them to shoot the bows began their devils music and the arrows hissed through the dark to bury themselves in mail and flesh and bone the bowmen were few but they shot at close range they could not miss and charless men cowered behind thei shields as the missiles whipped home but the arrow easily pierced shields and the menatarms broke and scattered to find shelter among the tents hunt the down hunt them down totesham released his archer to the kill less than a hundred of sir thomas dagworths me were still fighting and most of those were the archer who had gone to ground in the wagon park some of the others were prisoners many were dead while most were trying to escape across the earthworks and palisades but those men hearing the great roar behind them turned back charless men were scattered many were still hunting down the remnants of the first attack and those who had tried to resist toteshams sortie were either dead or fleeing into shadows toteshams men now struck the heart of the encampment with the savagery of a tempest the townsmen were filled with rage there was no subtlety in their assault just a lust for vengeance as they swarmed past the two great trebuchets the first huts they encountered were the shelters of the bavarian engineers who wanting no part of the handtohand slaughter that was finishing off the survivors of sir thomas dagworths assault had stayed by their billets and now died there the townsmen had no idea who their victims were only that they were the enemy and so they were chopped down with axes mattocks and hammers the chief engineer tried to protect his elevenyearold son but they died together under a frenzy of blows and meanwhile the english and fleming menatarms were streaming past thomas had shot his bow with the other archers but now he sought robbie whom he had last seen by the two big trebuchets widowmaker had been winched down ready to launch its first missile in the dawn and thomas stumbled over a stout metal spike that protruded a yard from the beam and acted as an anchor for the sling he cursed because the metal had hurt his shins then he climbed onto the trebuchets frame and shot an arrow above the heads of the men slaughtering the bavarians he had been aiming at the enemy still clustered at the foot of the windmill and he saw a man fall there before the gaudy shields came up he shot again and realized that his wounded hands were doing what they had always done and were doing it well and so he plucked a third arrow from the bag and drove it into a firelit shield painted with a white ermine then the english menatarms and their allies were climbing the hill and obscuring his aim so he jumped down from the trebuchet and resumed his search for robbie the enemy was defending the mill stoutly and most of toteshams men had veered away into the tents where they had more hope of finding plunder the townsmen their bavarian tormentors killed were following with bloody axes a man in plate armour stepped from behind a tent and cut at a man with a sword folding him at the belly and thomas did not think but put an arrow on the cord drew and loosed the arrow went through the slit in the enemys visor as cleanly as if thomas had been shooting on the butts at home and moonglossed blood glistening like a jewel oozed from the visor slits as the man fell backwards onto the canvas thomas ran on stepping over bodies edging past halffallen tents this was no place for a bow everything was too cramped and so he slung the yew stave on his shoulder and drew his sword he ducked into a tent stepped over a fallen bench heard a scream and twisted sword raised to see a woman on the ground half hidden by bedding shaking her head at him he left her there went out into the firelit night and saw an enemy aiming a crossbow at the english menatarms who attacked the mill he took two steps and stabbed the man in the small of the back so that his victim arched his wounded spine and twisted and shook thomas dragging the sword free was so appalled by the noise the dying man made that he hacked the blade down again and again chopping at the fallen twitching man to make him silent hes dead christ man hes dead robbie shouted at him then snatched at thomass sleeve and pulled him towards the mill and thomas took the bow from his shoulder and shot two men wearing the white ermine badge on their jupons they had been trying to escape running down the back side of the hill a dog streaked across the shoulder of the slope something red and dripping in its jaws there were two great bonfires on the hill flanking the mill and a manatarms fell backwards into one driven there by the strike of an english arrow sparks exploded upwards as he fell then he began to scream as his flesh roasted inside his armour he tried to scramble out of the flames but a townsman thrust him back with the butt of a spear and laughed at the mans desperate squeals the clash of swords shields and axes was huge filling the night but in the strange chaos there was a peaceful area at the back of the windmill robbie had seen a man duck through a small doorway there and he pulled thomas that way hes either hiding or running away robbie shouted he must have money thomas was not sure what robbie was talking about but he followed anyway he just had time to sling his bow again and draw the sword a second time before robbie smashed the door down with his mailclad shoulder and plunged into the darkness come here you english bastard he shouted you want to be killed thomas roared at him youre fighting for the goddamn english robbie swore at that reminder then thomas saw a shadow to his right only a shadow and he swung his sword that way it clanged against another sword and robbie was screaming in the dusty dark and the man was shouting at them in french and thomas pulled back but robbie just slammed his sword down once twice and the blade chopped through bone and flesh and there was a crash as an armoured man fell onto the upper millstone what the hell was he saying to me robbie wanted to know he was trying to surrender a voice spoke from across the mill and thomas and robbie both spun towards the sound their swords banging against the wooden tangle of joists beams cogwheels and axles and then the unseen man called out again whoa boys whoa im english there was a thump as an arrow struck the outside wall the furled sails tugged against their tethers and made the wooden machinery squeal and shudder more arrows thumped into the boards im a prisoner the man said youre not now thomas said i suppose not the man climbed over the millstones and pushed open the door and thomas saw he was middleaged with grey hair whats happening the man asked were gralloching the devils robbie said pray god you are the man turned and offered his hand to robbie im sir thomas dagworth and i thank you both he drew his sword and ducked out into the moonlit night and robbie stared at thomas did you hear that he said thank you thomas said aye but he said he was sir thomas dagworth then maybe he was so what the hell was he doing in here robbie asked before taking hold of the man he had killed and with much effort and the clank of armour against stone and timber dragged him to the door where the fires offered light the man had discarded his helmet and robbies sword had split his skull but under the gore there was the glint of gold and robbie dragged a chain from beneath the mans breastplate he must have been an important fellow robbie said admiring the gold chain then he grinned at thomas well split it later eh split it were friends arent we robbie asked then pushed the gold under his haubergeon before shoving the corpse back into the mill valuable armour that he said well come back when its over and hope no bastard has stolen it there was tangled bloody horror in the encampment now survivors of sir thomas dagworths attack still fought notably the archers in the wagon park but as the towns garrison swept through the tents they released prisoners or brought other survivors out of the dark places where they had been hiding charless crossbowmen who could have stemmed the garrisons attack were mostly fighting against the english archers in the wagon park the genoese were using their huge pavises as shelters but the new attackers came from behind and the crossbowmen had nowhere to hide as the long arrows hissed through the night the war bows sang their devils melody ten arrows flying to every quarrel shot and the crossbowmen could not endure the slaughter they fled the victorious archers reinforced now by the men who had been among the wagons turned back to the shelters and tents where a deadly game of hide and seek was being played in the dark avenues between the canvas walls but then a welsh archer discovered that the enemy could be flushed out if the tents were set on fire soon there were smoke and flames spewing all across the encampment and enemy soldiers were running from the fires onto the arrows and blades of the incendiarists charles of blois had retreated from the windmill reckoning his position on the hill made him conspicuous and he had tried to rally some knights in front of his own sumptuous tent but an overwhelming rush of townsmen had swept those knights underfoot and charles watched appalled as butchers coopers wheelwrights and thatchers massacred their betters with axes cleavers and reaping hooks he had hastily retreated into his tent but now one of his retainers unceremoniously pulled him towards the back entrance this way your grace charles shook off the mans hand where can we go he asked plaintively well go to the southern camp sir and bring men back to help charles nodded reflecting that he should have ordered that himself and regretting his insistence that none of his men leave their encampments well over half his army was in the other three camps all of them close by and all of them eager to fight and more than capable of sweeping this disorganized horde aside yet they were obeying his orders and standing tight while his encampment was put to the sword wheres my trumpeter he demanded sir im here your grace im here the trumpeter had miraculously survived the fight and stayed close to his lord sound the seven blasts charles ordered not here a priest snapped and when charles looked offended made a hasty explanation it will attract the enemy your grace after two blasts theyll be onto us like hounds charles acknowledged the wisdom of the advice with a curt nod a dozen knights were with him now and they made a formidable force in this night of fractured battle one of them peered from the tent and saw flames searing the sky and knew the dukes tents would be fired soon we must go your grace he insisted we must find our horses they left the tent hurrying across the patch of beaten grass where the dukes sentinels usually stood and then an arrow flickered from the dark to glance off a breastplate shouts were suddenly loud and a rush of men came from the right and so charles retreated to his left which took him back up the slope towards the firelit windmill and then a shout announced that he had been seen and the first arrows slashed up the hill trumpeter charles shouted seven blasts seven blasts charles and his men barred from reaching their horses now had their backs against the mills apron which was stuck with scores of whitefeathered arrows another arrow spitted a man in the midriff drilling through his mail piercing his belly and the mail on his back to pin him to the mills boards then an english voice roared at the archers to stop shooting its their duke the man roared its their duke we want him alive stop shooting bows down the news that charles of blois was cornered at the mill prompted a growl from the attackers the arrows stopped flying and charless battered bleeding menatarms who were defending the hill stared down the slope to see just beyond the light of the mills two fires a mass of dark creatures prowling like wolves god help us a priest said in a scared voice trumpeter charles of blois snapped sir the trumpeter acknowledged he had found his instruments mouthpiece mysteriously plugged by earth he must have fallen though he did not remember doing so he shook the last of the soil out of the silver mouthpiece then put the trumpet to his mouth and the first blast sounded sweet and loud in the night the duke drew his sword he only had to defend the mill long enough for his reinforcements to come from the other camps and sweep this impertinent rabble into hell the second trumpet note rang out thomas heard the trumpet turned and saw the flash of silver by the mill then he saw the reflection of flamelight rippling off the instruments bell as the trumpeter raised it to the moon for the third time thomas had heard no order to stop shooting arrows and so he hauled his bows cord back twitched his left hand up a fraction and released the arrow whipped over the heads of the english menatarms and struck the trumpeter just as he took breath for the third blast and the air hissed and bubbled out of his pierced lung as he spilled sideways onto the turf the dark prowling things at the hills base saw the man fall and suddenly charged no help came to charles from the three remaining fortresses they had heard two trumpet blasts but only two and they reckoned charles must be winning besides they had his strict and constantly repeated orders to stay where they were on pain of losing out when the conquered lands were distributed among the victors so they did stay watching the smoke boil out of the flames and wondering what happened in the large eastern encampment chaos was happening this fight thomas reckoned was like the attack on caen unplanned disordered and utterly brutal the english and their allies had been keyed up nervous expecting defeat while charless men had been expecting victory indeed they had gained the early victory but now the english nervousness was being turned into a maddened bloody vicious assault and the french and bretons were being harried into terror a ragged clash sounded as the english menatarms slammed into charless men defending the windmill thomas wanted to join that fight but robbie suddenly pulled at his mail sleeve look robbie was pointing back into the burning tents robbie had seen three horsemen in plain black surcoats and with them on foot a dominican thomas saw the white and black robes and followed robbie through the tents trampling over a collapsed spread of blue and white canvas past a fallen standard running between two fires and then across an open space that whirled with smoke and burning scraps of flying cloth a woman with a dress half torn away screamed and ran across their path and a man scattered fire with his boots as he pursued her into a turfroofed hut for a moment they lost sight of the priest then robbie saw the black and white robes again the dominican was trying to mount an unsaddled horse that the men in black surcoats held for him thomas drew his bow let the arrow fly and saw it bury itself up to its feathers in the horses breast the beast reared up yellow hooves flailing and the dominican fell backwards the men in black surcoats galloped away from the bows threat and the priest abandoned turned and saw his pursuers and thomas recognized de taillebourg gods torturer thomas screamed a challenge and drew the bow again but de taillebourg ran towards some remaining tents a genoese crossbowman suddenly appeared saw them raised his weapon and thomas let the cord go the arrow slashed the mans throat spilling blood down his red and green tunic the woman screamed inside the shelter then was abruptly silenced as thomas followed robbie to where the inquisitor had disappeared among the tents the door flap of one was still swinging and robbie sword drawn thrust the canvas aside and ducked into what proved to be a chapel de taillebourg was standing at the altar with its white easter frontal a crucifix stood on the altar between two flickering candles the camp outside was an uproar of screams and pain and arrows of horses whimpering and men shouting but it was oddly calm in the makeshift chapel you bastard thomas said drawing his sword and advancing on the dominican you goddamn stinking turdfaced piece of priestly shit bernard de taillebourg had one hand on the altar he raised the other to make the sign of the cross dominus tohiscum he said in his deep voice an arrow scraped over the tents roof with a highpitched scratching sound and another whipped through a side wall and span down behind the altar is vexille with you thomas demanded gods blessings on you thomas de taillebourg said he was fiercefaced stern eyes hard and he made the sign of the cross towards thomas then stepped back as thomas raised the sword is vexille with you thomas demanded again can you see him the dominican asked peering about the chapel then smiled no thomas hes not here hes gone into the dark he rode to fetch help and you cannot kill me give me a reason robbie said because you killed my brother you bastard de taillebourg looked at the scotsman he did not recognize robbie but he saw the anger and offered him the same blessing he had given thomas you cannot kill me he said after he had made the sign of the cross because i am a priest my son i am gods anointed and your soul will be damned through all time if you so much as touch me thomass response was to lunge his sword at de taillebourgs belly forcing the priest hard back against the altar a man screamed outside the sound faltering and fading ending in a sob a child wept inconsolably her breath coming in great gasps and a dog barked frantically the light of the burning tents was lurid on the chapels canvas walls you are a bastard thomas said and i dont mind killing you for what you did to me what i did de taillebourgs anger flared like the fires outside i did nothing he spoke in french now your cousin begged me to spare you the worst and so i did one day he said you would be on his side one day you would join the side of the grail one day you would be on gods side and so i spared you thomas i left you your eyes i did not burn your eves ill enjoy killing you thomas said though in truth he was nervous of attacking a priest heaven would be watching and the recording angels pen would be writing letters of fire in a great book and god loves you my son de taillebourg said gently god loves you and god chastises whom he loves whats he saying robbie interrupted hes saying that if we kill him thomas said our souls are damned till another priest undamns them robbie said there aint a sin done on earth that some priest wont absolve if the price is right so stop talking to the bastard and just kill him he advanced on de taillebourg sword raised but thomas held him back wheres my fathers book thomas asked the priest your cousin has it de taillebourg replied i promise you your cousin has it then where is my cousin i told you he rode away to fetch help de taillebourg said and now you must go too thomas you must leave me here to pray thomas almost obeyed but then he remembered his pathetic gratitude to this man when he had ceased the torture and the memory of that gratitude was so shaming so painful that he suddenly shuddered and almost without thinking swung the sword at the priest no de taillebourg shouted his left arm cut to the bone where he had tried to defend himself from thomass sword yes thomas said and the rage was consuming him filling him and he cut again and robbie was beside him stabbing with his sword and thomas swung a third time but so lavishly that his blade got tangled with the tent roof de taillebourg was swaying now you cant kill me he shouted im a priest he screamed that last word and was still screaming as robbie chopped sir william douglass sword into his neck thomas disentangled his own blade de taillebourg the front of his robes soaked with blood was staring at him with astonishment then the priest tried to speak and could not and the blood was spreading through the weave of his robes with an extraordinary swiftness he fell to his knees still trying to speak and thomass sword blow took him on the other side of his neck and more blood spurted out to slash drops across the white altar frontal de taillebourg looked up this time with puzzlement on his face then robbies last blow killed the dominican tearing his windpipe out of his neck robbie had to leap back to avoid the spray of blood the priest twitched and in his death throes his left hand pulled the blooddrenched frontal off the altar spilling candles and cross he made a rattling noise twitched and was still that did feel good robbie said in the sudden dark as the candles went out i hate priests ive always wanted to kill one i had a friend who was a priest thomas said making the sign of the cross but he was murdered either by my cousin or by this bastard he stirred de taillebourgs body with his foot then stooped and wiped his sword blade clean on the hem of the priests robes robbie went to the tent door my father reckons that hell is full of priests he said then theres one more on his wav down there now thomas said he picked up his bow and he and robbie went back into the dark where the screams and arrows laced the night so many tents and huts were now aflame that it might as well have been daylight and in the lurid glare thomas saw a crossbowman kneeling between two picketed and terrified horses the crossbow was aimed up the hill to where so many english were fighting thomas put an arrow on his cord drew and at the very last second just as he was about to put the arrow through the crossbowmans spine he recognized the blue and white wavy pattern on the jupon and he jerked his aim aside so that his arrow hit the crossbow instead and knocked it out of jeanettes hands youll get killed he shouted at her angrily thats charles she pointed up the hill equally angry with him the only crossbows are with the enemy he said to her you want to be shot by an archer he picked up her bow by its crank and tossed it into the shadows and what are you goddamn doing here i came to kill him she said pointing again at charles of blois who with his retainers was warding off a desperate assault he had eight surviving knights with him and they were all fighting savagely even though they were hugely outnumbered and every one of them was wounded thomas led jeanette up the slope just in time to see a tall english manatarms hack at charles who caught the blow on his shield and slid his own sword under its rim to stab the englishman in the thigh another man attacked and was slashed down by an axe a third pulled one of charless retainers away from the mill and hacked at his helmet there seemed to be a score of englishmen trying to reach charles smashing their shields into his retainers weapons thrusting swords and chopping with big war axes give him room an authoritative voice shouted give him room back away back away let him yield the attackers reluctantly moved back charles had his visor up and there was blood on his pale face and more blood on his sword a priest was on his knees beside him yield a man shouted at the duke who seemed to understand because he impulsively shook his head in refusal but then thomas put an arrow on his cord drew and pointed it at charless face charles saw the threat and hesitated yield another man shouted only to a man of rank charles called in french who has rank here thomas called in english then again in french one of charless remaining menatarms slowly collapsed first to his knees then onto his belly with a crash of plate armour a knight stepped out of the english ranks he was a breton one of toteshams deputies and he announced his name to prove to charles that he was a man of noble birth and then he held out his hand and charles of blois nephew to the king of france and claimant of the duchy of brittany stepped awkwardly forward and held out his sword a huge cheer went up then the men on the hill divided to let the duke and his captor walk away charles expected to be given his sword back and looked surprised when the breton did not make the offer then the defeated duke walked stiffly down the hill ignoring the triumphant english but suddenly checked for a blackhaired figure had stepped into his path it was jeanette remember me she asked charles looked her up and down and flinched as though he had been struck when he recognized the badge on her jupon then he flinched again when he saw the anger in her eyes he said nothing jeanette smiled rapist she said then spat through his open visor the duke jerked his head away but too late and jeanette spat into his face again he shivered with anger she was daring him to strike her but he restrained himself and jeanette unable to do the same spat a third time leer she said scornfully and walked away to an ironic cheer whats ver robbie asked worm thomas said then smiled at jeanette well done my lady i was going to kick his goddamn balls she said but i remembered he was wearing armour thomas laughed then stepped aside as richard totesham ordered a halfdozen menatarms to escort charles back into la rochederrien short of capturing the king of france he was as valuable a captive as any to be had in the war thomas watched him walk away charles of blois would now be joining the king of scotland as englands prisoner and both men would have to raise a fortune if they wished to be ransomed it isnt finished totesham shouted he had seen the crowd of jeering men following the captured duke and hurried to pull them away it isnt done finish the job horses sir thomas dagworth called take their horses the fight in charless encampment was won but not ended the assault from the town had hit like a storm and driven clean through the centre of duke charless carefully prepared battle line and what was left of his force was now split into small groups scores were already dead and others were fleeing into the darkness archers a shout vent up archers to me dozens of archers ran to the back of the encampment where the escaping french and bretons were trying to reach the other fortresses and the bows cut the fugitives down mercilessly clean them out totesham shouted clean them out a rough kind of organization had emerged in the shambles as the garrison and the townsmen augmented by the survivors of sir thomas dagworths force hunted through the burning encampment to drive any survivors back to where the archers waited it was slow work not because the enemy was making any real resistance but because men were constantly stopping to pillage tents and shelters women and children were pulled out into the moonlight and their men were killed prisoners worth a huge ransom were slaughtered in the confusion and darkness the viscount rohan was chopped down as were the lords of laval and of chåteaubriant of dinah and of redon a grey light glimmered in the east the first hint of dawn whimpering sounded in the burned camp finish them off richard totesham had at last found sir thomas dagworth the two men were on the encampments ramparts from where they stared at the southern enemy fortress cant leave them sitting there sir thomas said then held out a hand thanks dick for doing my job totesham responded embarrassed so lets scour the bastards out of the other camps eh a trumpet called the english to assemble charles of blois had told his men that an archer could not shoot a man he could not see and that was true but the men of the southern encampment who formed the second largest portion of charless army were crowding onto their outer rampart in an effort to see what was happening in the eastern encampment about the windmill they had lit fires to give their own crossbowmen illumination but those fires now served to outline them as they stood on the earth bank which had no palisade and the english archers given such a target could not miss those archers were in the cleared ground between the encampments shadowed by the loom of the long earthworks and their arrows flickered out of the night to strike the watching french and bretons crossbowmen tried to shoot back but they made the easiest targets for few of them possessed mail and then with a roar the english menatarms were charging over the defences and the killing began again townsmen eager for plunder followed the charge and the archers seeing the earthwork stripped of defenders ran to catch up thomas paused on the earth rampart to shoot a dozen arrows into the panicked enemy who had made this encampment where the english siege camp had stood the previous year he had lost sight of sir guillaume and though he had told jeanette to go back to the town she was still with him but now armed with a sword she had taken from a dead breton you shouldnt be here he snarled at her wasps she called back and pointed to a dozen menatarms wearing the black and yellow surcoats of the lord of roncelets the enemy here made small resistance they had been unaware of the disaster that had overcome charles and they had been surprised by the sudden assault from the darkness the surviving crossbowmen now retreated panicking into the tents and the english again snatched brands from the great fires and hurled them onto the canvas roofs to flare bright and garish in the predawn darkness the english and welsh archers had slung their bows and were grimly working their way through the tent lines with axes swords and clubs it was another slaughter fuelled by the prospect of plunder and some of the french and bretons rather than face the screaming mass of maddened men took to their horses and fled east towards the thin grey light that now leaked a touch of red along the horizon thomas and robbie headed for the men wearing ronceletss waspish stripes those men had attempted to make a stand beside a trebuchet that had the name stonewhip painted on its big frame but they had been outflanked by archers and now they were trying to escape and in the chaos they did not know which way to go two of them ran at thomas and he skewered one with his sword while robbie stunned the other with a massive blow to his helmet then a rush of archers swept the men in black and yellow aside and thomas scabbarded his wet sword and unslung his bow before running into a big unburned tent that stood beside a pole flying the black and yellow banner and there between a bed and an open chest was the lord of roncelets himself he and a squire were scooping coins from the chest into small bags and they turned as thomas and robbie entered and the lord of roncelets snatched up a sword from the bed just as thomas dragged back the bowcord the squire lunged at robbie but thomas loosed the arrow and the squire jerked back as if tugged by a massive rope and the blood from the wound in his forehead pattered red on the tent roof the squire jerked a few times and then was still and the lord of roncelets was still three paces from thomas when the second arrow was placed on the string come on my lord thomas said give me a reason to send you to the devil the lord of roncelets looked like a fighter he had short bristly hair a broken nose and missing teeth but there was no belligerence in him now he could hear the screams of defeat all about him he could smell the burning flesh of the men trapped among the tents and he could see the arrow on thomass bow that was aimed at his face and he simply held out his sword in instant surrender you have rank he asked robbie he had not recognized thomas and anyway presumed that any man carrying a bow had to be a commoner robbie did not understand the question which had been asked in french and so thomas answered for him hes a scottish lord thomas said exaggerating robbies status then i yield to him roncelets said angrily and threw his sword at robbies feet god robbie said not understanding the exchange but he scared quick thomas gently released the bowcords tension and held up the crooked fingers of his right hand its a good job you surrendered he told roncelets remember you wanted to cut these off he could not help smiling as first recognition then abject fear showed on ronceletss face jeanette thomas shouted his small victory gained jeanette jeanette came through the tent flap and with her of all people was will skeat what the hell are you doing here thomas demanded angrily you wouldnt keep an old friend from a scrap would you tom skeat asked with a grin and thomas thought he could see his friends true character in that grin youre an old fool thomas grumbled then he picked up the lord of ronceletss sword and gave it to jeanette hes our prisoner he said yours as well ours jeanette was puzzled hes the lord of roncelets thomas said and he could not help another smile and ive no doubt we can squeeze a ransom from him and i dont mean that cash he pointed at the open chest thats ours anyway jeanette stared at roncelets and it slowly dawned on her that if the lord of roncelets was her prisoner then her son was as good as returned to her she laughed suddenly then gave thomas a kiss so you do keep your promises thomas and you keep good guard of him thomas said because his ransom is going to make us all rich robbie you me and will were all going to be wealthy he grinned at skeat youll stav with her will look after him ill stay will agreed who is she the lord of roncelets asked thomas the countess of armorica jeanette answered for him and laughed again when she saw the shock on his face take him back to the town now thomas told them and he ducked outside the tent where he found two townsmen searching for plunder among the nearest tents you two he snapped at them youre going to help guard a prisoner take him back to the town and youll be well rewarded guard him well thomas pulled the two men into the tent he reckoned the lord of roncelets could not escape if jeanette skeat and the two men were watching him just guard him he told them and take him to your old house this last was to jeanette my old house she was puzzled you wanted to kill someone tonight thomas said and you cant kill charles of blois so why dont you go and murder belas he laughed at the look on her face then he and robbie slammed down the chest lid and covered it with blankets from the bed in hope of hiding it for a few moments and then they went back to the fight all through the flamelit battle thomas had caught glimpses of men in plain black surcoats and he knew that guy vexille must be nearby but he had not seen him now there were shouts and the clash of blades from the encampments southern edge and thomas and robbie ran to see what the commotion was they saw that a group of horsemen in black surcoats were fighting off a score of english menatarms vexille thomas shouted vexille its him robbie asked its his men anyway thomas said he guessed his cousin had been in the eastern encampment with de taillebourg and that he had come here in hope of bringing a relief force to charless aid but he had been too late and now his men were fighting a rearguard battle to protect other men who were fleeing where is he robbie demanded thomas could not see his cousin he shouted again vexille vexille and there he was the harlequin count of astarac armoured in plate visor lifted mounted on a black destrier and carrying a plain black shield he saw thomas and raised his sword in an ironic salute thomas unslung his bow but guy vexille saw the threat turned away and his horsemen closed protectively about him vexille thomas yelled and he ran towards his cousin robbie called a warning and thomas ducked as a horseman swung a blade at him then he pushed against the horse smelling leather and sweat and another horseman banged into him almost throwing him off his feet vexille he bellowed he could see guy vexille again only now his cousin was turning back spurring towards him and thomas drew the bowcord but vexille held up his right hand to show he had scabbarded his sword and the gesture made thomas lower the black bow guy vexille his visor raised and his handsome face lit by the fires smiled i have the book thomas thomas said nothing but just raised the bow again guy vexille shook his head in reproof no need for that thomas join me in hell you bastard thomas said this was the man who had killed his father had killed eleanor had killed father hobbe and thomas drew the arrow fully back and vexille took a small knife that had been concealed in his shield hand and calmly leaned fonvard and cut the bowcord the broken string made the bcm jump violently in thomass hand and the arrow spewed away harmlessly the cord had been cut so swiftly that thomas had been given no time to react one day youll join me thomas vexille said then he saw that the english archers had at last noticed his men and were beginning to take their toll and so he turned his horse shouted at his men to retreat and spurred away jesus thomas swore in frustration calix meus inebrians guy vexille shouted then he was lost among the horsemen galloping south a flight of english arrows followed them but none struck vexille bastard robbie swore at the retreating figure a womans scream sounded from the burning tents what did he say to you robbie asked he wanted me to join him thomas said bitterly he threw away the slashed cord and took the spare from under his sallet his clumsy fingers fumbled as he restrung the bow but he managed to do it on the second try and he said hes got the book aye well much good that will bloody do him robbie commented the fight had died and he knelt by a blackdressed corpse and began searching for coins sir thomas dagworth was shouting for men to assemble at the encampments western edge to assault the next fortress where some of the defenders realizing that the battle was lost were already running away church bells were ringing in la rochederrien celebrating that charles of blois had entered the town as a prisoner thomas stared after his cousin he was ashamed because one small part of him one small and treacherous part had been tempted to take the offer join his cousin be back in a family look for the grail and harness its power the shame was sour like the shame of the gratitude he had felt towards de taillebourg when the torture ceased bastard he yelled uselessly bastard bastard it was sir guillaumes voice that cut across thomass sir guillaume with his two menatarms was prodding a prisoner in the back with a sword the captive wore plate armour and the sword scraped on it with every prod bastard sir guillaume bawled again then saw thomas its coutances coutances he pulled off his prisoners helmet look at him the count of coutances was a melancholylooking man bald as an egg who was doing his best to appear dignified sir guillaume poked him again i tell you thomas he spoke in french that this bastards wife and daughters will have to whore themselves to raise this ransom theyll be swiving every man in normandy to buy this gutless bastard back he jabbed the count of coutances again im going to squeeze you witless sir guillaume roared and then exultant marched his prisoner onwards the woman screamed again there had been many women screaming that night but something about this sound cut through thomass awareness and he turned alarmed the scream sounded a third time and thomas began to run robbie he shouted to me thomas ran across the remnants of a burning tent his boots throwing up sparks and embers he swerved round a smoking brazier almost tripped on a wounded man who was vomiting into an upturned helmet ran down an alley between armourers huts where anvils bellows hammers tongs and barrels full of rivets and mail rings were spilt on the grass a man in a farriers apron with blood streaming from a head wound staggered into his path and thomas shoved him aside to run towards the black and yellow standard that still flew outside the lord of ronceletss burning tent jeanette he called jeanette but jeanette was a prisoner she was being held by a huge man who had pressed her spine against the windlass of the trebuchet called stonewhip that stood just beyond the lord of ronceletss tent the man heard thomas shouting and looked round grinning it was beggar all beard and rotted teeth and he shoved jeanette hard as she struggled to escape him hold her beggar sir geoffrey carr shouted hold the bitch the pretty aint going anywhere beggar said going nowhere darling and he tried to haul up her coat of mail but it was too heavy and awkward and jeanette was struggling too frantically the lord of roncelets still without his sword was sitting on stonewhips frame he had a red mark on his face suggesting he had been struck and sir geoffrey carr with five other menatarms was standing over him the scarecrow stared defiantly at thomas hes my prisoner he insisted he belongs to us thomas said we took him listen boy the scarecrow said his voice still slurred by drink i am a knight and you are a turd you understand me he staggered slightly as he stepped towards thomas i am a knight he said again louder and you are nothing his red face made lurid by the flames was twisted in derision you are nothing he shouted again then whipped round to make sure that his men were guarding the lord of roncelets such a wealthy captive would solve all sir geoffreys problems and he was determined to hold onto him and take the ransom for himself she cant take a captive he said pointing his sword at jeanette because shes got tits and you cant take him because youre a turd but im a knight a knight he spat the word at thomas who goaded by the insults drew his bow the new string was slightly too long and he could feel the lack of power in the black stave because of it but he reckoned there was enough strength for his purpose beggar the scarecrow shouted if he looses that bow kill the bitch kill the pretty beggar said he was drooling spittle which ran down his big beard as he stroked the mail rings above jeanettes breasts she still fought but he had her bent painfully back across the windlass and she could hardly move thomas kept the bow drawn the trebuchets long beam he saw had been winched down to the ground though the engineers must have been interrupted before they could load a stone because the great leather sling was empty a heap of stones stood off to the right and a sudden movement there made thomas see there was a wounded man leaning against the boulders the man was trying to stand but could not there was blood on his face will thomas asked tom will skeat tried to push himself upright again its you tom what happened thomas asked not what i was torn skeat said the two townsmen who had been helping to guard the lord of roncelets were dead at skeats feet and skeat himself seemed to be dying he was whitefaced feeble and every breath was a struggle there were tears on his face i tried to fight he said pitiably i did try but im not what i was who attacked you thomas asked but skeat seemed unable to answer will was just trying to protect me jeanette shouted then she screamed as beggar thrust her back so hard that at last she was forced onto the top of the windlass and beggar could push her mail skirts up he gabbled excitedly just as sir geoffrey roared in anger its the douglas bastard thomas loosed the cord with a new bowcord he liked to shoot a couple of arrows to discover how the new hemp would behave but he had no time for such niceties now he just loosed the arrow and it sliced through the tangles of beggars beard to cut his throat the broad arrow head slitting his gullet as cleanly as a butchers knife and jeanette screamed as the blood spurted across her jupon and face the scarecrow bellowed in rage and ran at thomas who rammed the horntipped howstave into the red face then let the weapon fall as he drew his sword robbie ran past him and thrust his uncles sword at the scarecrows belly but even drunk sir geoffrey was quick and he managed to parry the blow and strike back two of his menatarms were running to help the others were guarding the lord of roncelets and thomas saw the two men coming he went to his left hoping to put the big frame of stonewhip between himself and the men wearing sir geoffreys badge of the black axe but sir geoffrey almost cut him off and thomas gave a desperate backswing with his newly drawn sword that slammed against the scarecrows blade with a force that numbed thomass arm the blow rocked the scarecrow back then he recovered and leaped forward and thomas was desperately defending himself as the scarecrow rained blows down on him thomas was no swordsman and he was being beaten down to his knees and robbie could not help him because he was fending off sir geoffreys two followers and then there was an almighty crash a bang that sounded as though the gates of hell had just opened and the ground shook as the scarecrow screamed in utter agony his howl trailing blood seared into the sky jeanette had pulled the lever that released the long beam ten tons of counterweight had thumped to the ground and the thick metal pin that held the sling had jerked up between sir geoffreys legs and torn a bloody hole from his crotch to his belly he should have been hurled halfway to the town by the trebuchets beam but instead the pin had been trapped in his entrails and he was caught on the beams end where he writhed in agony his blood pouring down to the ground his men seeing their master dying stepped back why fight for a man who could offer no reward robbie gaped up as the scarecrow twisted and jerked and somehow the dying man managed to tear himself free of the great iron stake and he fell trailing intestines and spraying blood he hit the ground with a thump bounced bloodily yet still he lived his eyes were twitching and his mouth was drawn back in a snarl goddamn douglas he managed to gasp before robbie stepped to him lifted his uncles sword and rammed it down once straight between the scarecrows eyes the lord of roncelets had watched it all happen with disbelief now jeanette was holding a sword to his face daring him to run away and he dumbly shook his head to show that he had no intention of risking his life among the drunken screaming savage men who had come out of the night to destroy the greatest army the duchy of brittany had ever raised thomas crossed to sir william skeat but his old friend was dead he had been wounded in the neck and he had bled to death on the stone pile he looked strangely peaceful a first shaft of the new days sun cut across the worlds edge to light the bright blood at the top of stonewhips beam as thomas closed his mentors eyes who killed will skeat thomas demanded of sir geoffreys men and dickon the young one pointed at the wreckage of mail flesh entrails and bone that had been the scarecrow thomas inspected the dents in his sword he must learn to use one he thought or else he would die by the sword then he looked up at sir geoffreys men go and help the attack on the next fort he told them they stared at him go he snapped and startled they ran westwards thomas pointed his sword at the lord of roncelets take him back to town he told robbie and guard him well what about you robbie asked im going to bury will thomas said he was a friend he thought he must shed some tears for will skeat but there were none not now anyway he sheathed the sword then smiled at robbie you can go home robbie i can robbie seemed puzzled de taillebourgs dead roncelets will pay your ransom to lord outhwaite you can go to eskdale go home go back to killing englishmen robbie shook his head guy vexille lives hes mine to kill and mine robbie said you forget he killed my brother im staying till hes dead if you can ever find him jeanette said softly the sun was lighting the smoke of the burning encampments and casting long shadows across the ground where the last of charless army abandoned their earthworks and fled towards rennes they had come in their great splendour and now they scuttled away in abject defeat thomas went to the engineers tents and found a pickaxe a mattock and a shovel he dug a grave beside stonewhip and tipped skeat into the damp soil and tried to say a prayer but he could not think of one and then he remembered the coin for the ferryman and so he went to the lord of ronceletss tent and pulled the charred canvas away from the chest and took a piece of gold and went back to the grave he jumped down beside his friend and put the coin under skeats tongue the ferryman would find it and know from the gold that sir william skeat was a special man god bless you will thomas said then he scrambled out of the grave and he filled it in though he kept pausing in hope that wills eyes would open but of course they did not and thomas at last wept as he shovelled earth onto his friends pale face the sun was up by the time he finished and women and children were coming from the town to look for plunder a kestrel flew high and thomas sat on the chest of coins and waited for robbie to return from the town he would go south he thought go to astarac go and find his fathers notebook and solve its mystery the bells of la rochederrien were ringing for the victory a huge victory and thomas sat among the dead and knew he would have no peace until he had found his fathers burden calix mens inebrians transfer calicem istem a me ego enim bram pincerna regis whether he wanted the job or not he was the kings cupbearer and he would go south historical notes the novel begins with the battle of nevilles cross the name of the battle is derived from the stone cross that lord neville erected to mark the victory though it is possible there was another cross already on the site which lord nevilles memorial replaced the battle fought by a large scottish army against a small scratch force hastily assembled by the archbishop of york and the northern lords was a disaster for the scots their king david ii was captured as described in vagabond trapped under a bridge he managed to knock out some of his captors teeth but then was subdued he spent a long time at bamburgh castle recovering from his facial wound then was taken to london and put into the tower with most of the other scottish aristocracy captured that day including sir william douglas the knight of liddesdale the two scottish earls who had previously sworn fealty to edward were decapitated then quartered and the parts of their body displayed around the realm as a warning against treachery later that year charles of blois nephew to the king of france and wouldbe duke of brittany joined david ii in the tower of london it was a remarkable double by the english who will in another decade add the king of france himself to the haul the scots invaded england at the request of the french to whom they were allied and it is probable that david ii truly believed englands army was all in northern france but england had foreseen just this kind of trouble and certain northern lords were charged with staying at home and being ready to raise forces if the scots ever marched the backbone of those forces was of course the archer and this is the great age of english and to a lesser extent welsh archery the weapon used was the longbow a name that was coined much later which was a yew bow at least six feet in length with a draw weight of over a hundred pounds more than double the weight of modern competition bows it is a mystery why england alone could field armies of lethal archers who did indeed become kings of the european battlefield but the likeliest answer is that mastery of the longbow was an english enthusiasm practised as a sport in hundreds of villages eventually laws were passed making archery practice obligatory presumably because the enthusiasm was fading it was certainly an extraordinarily difficult weapon to use requiring immense strength and the french though they tried to introduce the weapon into their ranks never mastered the longbow the scots were accustomed to these archers and had learned never to attack them on horseback but in truth there was no answer to the longbow until firearms were deployed on the battlefield prisoners were important a great man like sir william douglas would only be released on payment of a vast ransom though sir william was given early parole to help negotiate the ransom of the king of scotland and when he failed he dutifully returned to his imprisonment in the tower of london the ransoms for men like charles of blois and king david ii were massive and might take years to negotiate and raise in davids case the ransom was a sum that has to be multiplied at least a hundred times to get even a rough approximation of its modern value the scots were allowed to pay it in ten instalments and twenty noblemen had to be surrendered as hostages for the payment before david was released in by which time ironically his sympathies had become entirely proenglish sir thomas dagworth was officially the captor of charles of blois and he sold him to edward iii for the much smaller sum of but doubtless it was better to have that money in hand than wait while a larger ransom was collected in france and brittany king davids captor had been an englishman called john coupland who also sold his prisoner to edward in couplands case for a knighthood and land charless defeat at la rochederrien is one of the great unsung english triumphs of the period charles had faced archers before and had worked out rightly as it happened that the way to defeat them was to make them attack wellprotected positions what the archer could not see he could not kill the tactic worked against sir thomas dagworths assault but then came richard toteshams frenetic sortie from the town and because charles had insisted that the four parts of his army stay behind their protective earthworks he was overwhelmed and the other parts of his army were then defeated in turn his defeat and capture were an immense shock to his allies the french who were failing to relieve the siege of calais i must record my debt to jonathan sumption whose book trial by battle the first volume of his superb history of the hundred years war was of particular use to me the errors in the novel are entirely mine of course though in the interests of lightening my post bag may i gently point out that durham cathedral only possessed two towers in and that i placed the hachaliah reference in the book of esdras instead of in nehemiah because i was using the vulgate and not the king james bible
