sophie littlefield unforsaken the second book in the banished series for bryan lamb and eric lamb acknowledgments some books come easier than others this one was a joy two people made it better than i could have imagined barbara poelle my agent who knew exactly what was missing in the first draftand my editor stephanie elliott who took time out of a very exciting year to bring the book to life elevens like the new ten jess said cracking herself up and spitting coke on gojos coffee table it had a glass top that showed every markfingerprints smudges of guacamole and the crumbs from the chips which were made of blue corn but tasted like every other chip id ever had still it was a first and out of habit i said the words in my head blue corn chips when i got homewhich had better be soonid write it in my journal it would be number but that was for later right now i had to focus that makes no sense charlotte said licking salt off her fingers she was sitting on the floor between gojos legs he leaned back on the couch with a beer dangling loose in one hand the fingers of the other playing with charlottes wavy red hair it was gojos fifth beer since wed gotten here id counted no you know really jess said managing to stop giggling only to start up again i was pretty sure she didnt usually drink as much as she had tonight not like charlotte who drank more than jess and me put together and you couldnt tell eleven oclock isnt as late now that were going to be juniors its like the new ten oclock you know like black is the new no wait olive i said olive green its the new black you know neutral i read it in vogue i wasnt making it up i really had read it in vogue the day before when prairie and i went for groceries we went twice a week pushing chub in the shopping cart and buying all kinds of expensive gourmet stuff id never seen when i lived in gypsum missouri now we lived in downtown milwaukee which wasnt exactly la or new york but our building had a concierge and our grocery store sold things like squid ink pasta and herbed ch√®vre and italian grapefruit soda numbers and we always bought a magazine at the store and then i read the articles to prairie while she cooked she said i ought to do the cooking since she worked all day and she was right but i saw how much she enjoyed it making things for the two of us i tried to do my part by cleaning up keeping the apartment neat and doing the laundry and she never complained none of us did not even chub whose chores consisted mostly of helping set the table and picking up his toys at the end of the day we kept things light we never argued two months after we burned the lab down i think we were still kind of surprised wed made it out aliveand i was still getting used to living with my aunt especially since until a few months ago i hadnt even known i had any living relatives besides gram if it was weird how prairie and i came to be in each others lives it was also really easy living together i was comfortable with her and i never had to think about what to say around her not like i did with jess and charlotte it should have been a natural fit since the three of us had so much in common we were all sixteen all starting our junior year at grosbeck academy in the fall all interested in the same thingsclothes boys music makeup but i had a secret they were the first real friends id ever had that was a secret i meant to keep which was why i was sitting here in an apartment across the tennis courts from ours an apartment that belonged to a twentyeightyearold bank branch manager named gordon johnson who drove a red bmw and had told us to call him gojo and offered us cokes a week ago sunday when charlotte started talking to him at the pool late in the afternoon that day hed invited us up to his place and given us sodas from the fridge and wed played blackjack todayanother lazy sunday afternoon that stretched into evening all three of us calling home to say we were at each others places lies that werent questioned by charlottes or jesss momgojo had put frozen pizzas in the oven scooped guacamole from a jar and poured our cokes into tall glasses then topped them off with whiskey it wasnt very good whiskey in fact it was dirt cheap i knew that because my grandmother used to serve it to her customers and if there was one thing you could say about gram it was that shed been as cheap as they come id poured my drink out in the sink and filled my glass with straightup coke that was at six oclock when wed first arrived id kept doing it all night whenever gojo topped our drinks off but now it was nearly eleven half an hour past when id said id be home and i had a decision to make should i leave and earn the derision of jess and charlotte the first and only friends id ever made or should i stay and give my aunt something to worry herself sick over a missed curfew didnt mean the same thing to me as it did to other kids if i didnt come home when id said i would prairie would immediately think that they had found us and that we were as good as dead sorry guys i said standing up and faking a yawn id love to stay but ive got a driving lesson first thing tomorrow jess gave me a forlorn little pout but charlotte fixed me with a chilly glare so sorry to hear it she said coolly as gojo ignored me and rubbed her neck his fingers dipping into the back of her tank top see you at the pool see you i echoed and by the time the door closed behind me i could hear jess giggling about something else as though shed already forgotten id been there hows charlotte and jess prairie asked after id given her my breathless apology for being late making up a story about how wed been watching a movie and lost track of time fine i said turning away from her and pouring myself a glass of water i was a terrible liar and i knew it i hadnt always been lying to gram had been not only easy but necessary but with prairie it was different after all wed been through i felt bad lying to her at home in the apartment where i spent nearly all my time i let myself forget that she was now holly garrett and i was amber garrett prairie kept telling me that i needed to stop using our old names that we were never going back and i kept telling her i needed just a little more time i knew from the way the line between her eyebrows deepened when i called her prairie that she thought it was a mistake not to force the issue but i also knew that prairie had a hard time saying no to me i tried not to take advantageexcept when it came to this one thing id give up our old lives our old names soon just not quite yet why dont you see if jess and charlotte want to go to the mall with us tuesday prairie continued keeping her voice light i can get off a little early we can try that new sushi place my treat umm sure ill ask them i tried to ignore the lump in my throat prairie was trying so hardshe knew how much it meant to me to fit in here when wed first moved to milwaukee there had been only a few weeks left in the school year so she had made arrangements for me to attend a private high school in the fall and id gotten an early start on the summer reading list prairie had been on the lookout for friends for me even then she was so excited when school finally let out and i met jess and charlotte at the pool in a couple of months i would be attending the exclusive grosbeck academy with jess and charlotte and four hundred girls just like them pretty spoiled girls who were used to getting everything they wanted prairie made sure i had everything i needed to fit in my closet was full of clothes from department stores and expensive boutiques i had sandals in every color to show off my pedicure i had my own bathroom and enough cosmetics and hair products to fill all the cabinets we had cable and highspeed internet and great speakers no one could tell that three months ago id been a freak an outcast an orphan in thriftstore rags a girl nobody wanted least of all my drugdealing grandmother who was now buried in an unmarked grave courtesy of the citizens of gypsum so its a date then prairie said giving me a quick squeeze she looked so pleased that i didnt say what id been trying to find words for that maybe we could make it just the two of us just for a little longer i wantedneededto be accepted by jess and charlotte yet there was a part of me that wasnt ready not by a long shot when tuesday evening rolled around i let prairie down i waited until she got home to tell her i told myself it was because she never took her phone into the lab where they conducted the experimentsshe was part of a team doing some kind of research with high magnetic fields and they couldnt take anything electronic into the lab with thembut the truth was that i could have left a message on her work phone or her cell phone i knew she checked both the minute she got out of the labafter she checked the other phone the one hidden in a pocket in the bottom of her purse i didnt call any of those numbers though at five when prairie came home all excited about our evening out i was waiting for her sitting on one of the barstools in the kitchen her smile slipped a little when she saw what i was wearing i knew the blue halter top showed too much and the white shorts were too shortand the platform sandals were way over the top but charlotte had called after lunch and once shed talked me into her plan she coached me about what to wearyoull look so hot amberand if i showed up in something else it would be proof that i didnt fit in i crossed my arms over my chest im going out with charlotte and jess i mumbled not meeting prairies eyes oh are they were not going for sushi i shook my head and reached for my purse in my sandals i was taller than prairie change of plans were going to catch a movie and then maybe go out for a late dinner just me and them there was a pause and i edged toward the door feeling my face go hot okay just call me if youre going to be late prairie said in a small voice and hearing her try to stay cheerful was worse than her getting angry and yelling at me maybe that was why i snapped at her i always call remember im going to have to grow up eventually prairie or do you plan on keeping me in thisthis cage for the rest of my life then i ran for the door and let it slam behind me trying to drown out the shocked silence but i couldnt put the image of prairie out of my mind she stood there in her neat tailored clothes with her hand to her throat looking pretty and elegant and more worried than id ever seen her i might have said no to charlotte except that gojo was bringing his summer interns and they were nineteen and twenty business students at the university which made it seem almost okay well at least a lot more okay than when it was just us and a twentyeightyearold guy we met at charlottes town house on the other side of the development shed snuck a bottle of vodka into her room she mixed it with raspberry crystal light in big plastic glasses while we did each others makeup i drank some instead of just pretending like i usually did it seemed to me that charlotte was watching me more carefully than usual like she was coming to a conclusion about me that would determine whether i would still be a part of the in crowd when summer ended jess had told me that charlotte was a big deal at grosbeck i didnt doubt it and i also thought i knew why charlotte had chosen jess as her best friend jess was rich and pretty but she was neither smart nor opinionated she did as she was told and she seemed more than happy to let charlotte make all the decisions like now charlotte told her to try the green eyeliner under her lower lashes and jess just sat there like one of those makeup barbie heads id always wanted when i was a little girl letting charlotte draw it on when charlotte turned to me i snapped shut the compact i was holding before she could start in on me and announced that i was ready i could see that charlotte had something on the tip of her tongue but with my short platinum hair and the clothes i was wearing too much eye makeup would make me look like a slut which was not how i wanted to look in front of a bunch of strangers in fact i almost went home after we said goodbye to charlottes folks i thought we were going to try to sneak out but charlotte took us straight past her mom and stepdad who were watching tv in the family room charlottes mom jumped up spilling her wine and told us to have fun at the movie she gave charlotte a noisy peck on the cheek and then squinted at me and jess swaying slightly on her spike heels dont you girls look sweet she said breathing wine in my face and giving me a view of her ample cleavage which her tight pink top didnt cover very well at least i knew where charlotte got her sense of style by the time wed walked to gojos apartment my sandals were hurting my feet outside his door charlotte gave us a quick onceover tugging at jesss top then fluffing the front of my hair so it swooped over one eye which made it hard to see i pushed it back behind my ear whatever charlotte sighed as gojo opened the door wearing a sunburn and a loud print shirt his interns justin and calvin didnt seem all that impressive to me justin was thin with a red line of acne along his hairline and calvin had on a work shirt buttoned too high and jeans that looked like hed ironed them they didnt match my image of the kind of guys charlotte and jess would hang out with but maybe it was enough that they were older and eager to party with us theyd already been drinking it was clear i decided to stick to water for the rest of the night since i was already feeling the vodka until i met charlotte id had alcohol only once back when i lived with gram i tasted one of her beers when i was ten and trying to figure out why she liked it so much by ninethirty we still hadnt had dinnergojo had promised to get takeout but had somehow never gotten around to itand the party had splintered into couples gojo turned the lights down low before he and charlotte went out on the balcony leaving the door open so we could hear them murmuring and laughing justin pulled jess down on his lap on the couch and she pretended to resist but it was pretty clear where they were headed especially since she was probably the drunkest person there shed been pounding rumandcokes since wed arrived calvin seemed just about as thrilled to be stuck with me as i was to be with him id been making small talk asking him about school what he was studyinghe wanted to go back to his hometown and open a mobile computerrepair franchiseand hed been pushing his beer bottle in circles on the table not looking at me im uh only sixteen i blurted after an awkward lull in the conversation that made his eyes go wide and i knew my suspicion was correct gojo had told them we were older im only here because johnson made it sound like it would come up in my performance review if i didnt show up calvin admitted hes always making us go to happy hour you dont want to i asked surprised i mean ive got a girlfriend calvin said blushing a pretty serious one after that i didnt feel so bad about leaving it helped to know that there was someone else who felt out of place who didnt want to be there calvin said hed walk me home and i said he didnt have to and he said hed feel better about it that you never knew after dark and i had to suppress a smile wondering what hed think if he knew exactly how much trouble id actually gotten into in the last year im going to head home i said loudly gathering up my things no response from the patio which had been quiet for a while but jess staggered to her feet almost tripping over justin no dont go amber she said her words slurring it wont beit wont be i saw it coming saw her teetering in slow motion trying to get her balance before she took a faltering step in her clunky flipflops twisted her ankle and went down she crashed onto the coffee table and from the sounds of things breaking i was sure that the glass top had shattered but when i raced across the room i saw that the noise had been made by the glasses and bottles that had accumulated there over the course of the night most had fallen to the carpeted floor spilling their contents but jess had broken a couple of glasses and as i helped her up from the mess i saw blood dripping down her arm amber she said her lips bunched in a confused pout i think i cut myself that was when i noticed a twoinch piece of glass embedded in her wrist and the blood wasnt just flowing from the woundit was pumping out in rhythmic spurts holy shit justin said backing away from the mess on the floor that looks bad calvin said why dont you take her into the bathroom amber and we can clean up out here give me a sec ill be right there jess leaned against me staring at her arm in detached amazement the bottom of her shirt was already soaked in blood i heard calvin and gojo arguing on the patio but i closed the bathroom door behind us in the light it looked even worse i helped jess sit down on the edge of the tub but she slid onto the tiled floor leaning into the corner where the tub met the wall her eyelids drifting down i knew she was drunk but was she already weak from losing so much blood it looked like at least a cup had leaked from her wrist and i suspected that if i pulled the shard out the blood would flow even faster i felt my knees buckle and my vision clouded the murmur of the ancient voices swirled and crescendoed in my mind blocking out everything else my fingers twitched and my heartbeat slowed to a steady echoing rhythm calvin pushed open the bathroom door jesusyou okay amber youre not going to like faint or something are you no i i managed to choke out my throat dry my hands shaking from the effort of trying not to touch jess i couldnt do it not here i couldnt let them know couldnt let them see id worked so hard to fit in since wed come to milwaukee i was starting school in two short months and i just wanted to be a normal girl in a normal high school with normal friends and normal habits and the thing i longed to do was not normal at all i heard calvin draw his breath in sharply she needs an ambulance fast stay with her and he was gone i lowered myself to the floor next to jess holding on to the towel bar for support but the desire to touch her grew so intense i had to jam my hands under my knees to stop myself amber jess said her voice soft and dreamy you have such pretty eyes theyre like her voice faded as she looked down at her wrist her mouth made a sad little o and she slumped against the wall i think im going to sleep now she said the blood flow hadnt slowed the puddle under her was growing at an alarming rate outside i could hear calvin yelling and gojo toosomething about his carpetand i knew if i didnt do something quickly jess was going to die and just like that i threw away all my plans my dreams my wishes i wasnt going to be normal i wasnt going to fit in i wasnt going to have friends like other girls or sleepovers or homecoming dances or cheerleading tryouts i looked like a different girl from the one i used to be with my expensive wardrobe and makeup and haircut but on the inside i was exactly the same a freak if i waited too long i would make things infinitely worse i had made that mistake once before and sworn i would never make it again i couldnt let her die i put my hands on jesss wrist and carefully removed the glass shard trying to ignore the blood that spurted out she made a soft mewling sound but i barely heard her as my fingers slipped on the slick warm blood and the words swirled faster and my eyes drifted shut and the energy coiled and gathered and reversed its flow out through my arms through my fingertips and into jess as i whispered the ancient chant and i felt her respond to my touch the ragged torn skin skimming over the blood flow slowing the veins and tendons knitting back together i continued to whisper until i felt her heartbeat strong and steady under my touch and then i opened my eyes just as the bathroom door burst open johnsons called a jesus amber what i followed his gaze and saw what he was seeing my legs shorts hands and forearms were covered in jesss blood next to me she yawned and ran a bloody hand through her hair leaving red smears on her cheek and forehead i thought i was going to lose it there for a minute she said conversationally i just cant hold my liquoroh it was as though she was noticing the blood for the first time i reached for a hand towel i um actually dont think its that bad i mumbled as i began to mop up the blood and jess lifted her arm to stare at her wrist i kept mopping rinsing the towel in the sink and wringing it out over and over as jess and calvin searched for the wound and found only a thin pink line and i tried to destroy the evidence of what id done we were in trouble as it turned out but not the kind id worried about charlotte was out the door after one quick look in the bathroom she seemed happy to leave us to deal with the problem so i guessed that was my answer to whether she was a true friend i was trying to sober jess up and gojo was swearing and cleaning up the living room and kitchen calvin and justin helping him without a word when the emts arrived i was sure they didnt believe gojos storythat hed heard the sound of breaking glass on the pool deck when hed been out for an evening walk and that hed only brought us back to his place to offer first aid but the emts were so puzzled over the woundor rather the lack of a woundon jesss wrist that they didnt spend much time interrogating gojo as they examined jess looking for the source of the blood that covered our clothes and created a trail on the carpet i felt a faint swell of pride i had taken care of jess when no one else could i had made her well but i had also risked the new life that prairie and i had so carefully constructed and broken my secret promise to myself never to use the gift again prairie and jesss parents arrived within moments of each other as the emts were preparing jess for the trip to the hospital jesss parents werent as concerned about their daughters condition as they were about her reputation or rather their reputation her father was a developer who hoped to run for office and her mother was thin and overdressed and looked like she could freeze you with her stare what were you doing in a place like this they demanded as though the expensive apartment complex was a seedy motel does your niece make a habit of getting drunk in strange mens apartments they asked prairie conveniently ignoring the facts that i was sober and jess couldnt track the emts finger as he moved it from side to side in front of her face perhaps the girls should take a break from each other they huffed as we were leaving prairie and i didnt say much on the walk home i started to apologize a few times but i didnt know where to begin it wasnt that id been drinking or that id been in a strangers apartment or even that id lied to her it was that id been willing to gamble all of our safety for a chance to fit in as i went to my room murmuring a good night to prairie and chub i wished i could take it all back but more than anything i wished i had never found out i was a healer chub woke me up the next morning after he climbed out of his new bigboy bed and padded down the hall to my room dragging his stuffed red dog he liked to snuggle with me before we started the day clifford can go to school today he said his voice unusually serious i propped myself up on my elbow and blinked the sleep out of my eyes clifford cant go to school i said gently he needs to stay here and take a nap at home but theres lots to do at school right lots of fun stuff i want clifford to come today he whispered a sad pout taking over his sweet mouth and then he stared in front of him his eyes going wide and shiny and my heart skipped because i had seen him do this before and i knew what it meant bad farm he whispered what i leaned closer grabbed his hands and held them trying to make him look at me im going to the bad farm he repeated a mixture of resignation and fear in his voice is the bad farm at school i asked thinking of playskool plastic horses toy barns skirmishes with playmates timeouts in the corner chub had learned lots of new words lately but it was still hard to understand him sometimes was someone mean to you did you get in trouble did you have a timeout trouble he repeated sadly ill talk to prairie i said she can talk to the teacher okay prairies going to make sure you dont get in trouble i pulled him into my arms and held him close i didnt have any idea what the bad farm was but i did know two things first chub didnt like it and second if he said he was going there then unless someone stepped in and did something it was going to happen because chub was a seer i had him dressed and sitting down with a waffle and juice by the time prairie finished getting ready for work it was our routine one i took pleasure in i had been chubs only caregiver when we lived with gramshe wouldnt so much as change a dirty diaper or give him a crackerand even though he loved prairie it was still me he wanted when he was upset or tired or hurt it didnt matter that he wasnt really my little brotherespecially since now we had documents saying that he was charlie garrett was his new name but we still called him chub i handed prairie her cup of coffee when she came into the kitchen dressed in a silk blouse and a black skirt pearl earrings and plain highheeled black pumps besides her earrings the only jewelry she wore was her antique rubyandsilver pendant i had one just like it it had belonged to my mother the necklaces had been handed down from prairies and my mothers greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgrandmother the one who had come over from ireland in the eighteen hundreds the one who had brought with her the gift of healing im sorry i blurted before prairie could say anything what i did was stupid and i didnt think and i know i endangered us all and its okay amber prairie said she never called me hailey anymore she said the only way we could make sure we didnt make mistakes in public was to use our new names all the time but the name still stung and i forgot what i was saying and stared into my own steaming coffee cup maybe we can try again she went on hesitantly you know the sushi place i can try to come home early tonight i felt tears well up in my eyes she was always like thisso patient with me so understanding sometimes i thought it made things worse arent you mad she gave me a smile tinged with sadness she was still as beautiful as the first time id seen her but now she looked tired most of the time i knew she wasnt sleeping very well how could i be mad you helped that girl maybe saved her life thats what the gift is for you cant turn your back on itneither of us can that might have been true but it seemed like i was the only one who had been forced to heal lately prairie had healed chub when hed been hit by a stray bullet the night gram was killed but that was before i understood what i could do since then it had been me always me whod healed whod laid on hands and said the ancient words if prairie had made her peace with the gift why wasnt she the one who was called to use it it didnt seem fair i was the one who was in high school the one who was under constant scrutiny the one who had to find a way to fit in prairie was in her element in the lab doing the work she loved and i doubted that any of the geeks she worked with would notice if she had to step out of the office now and then to help the occasional accident victim or whatever now wasnt the time to worry about it though i topped off prairies coffee for the road and she and chub left for the day id been so caught up in my apology that id forgotten to mention chubs problem at school and i hoped the teacher would bring it up herself if not id tell prairie tonight when she and chub got home still after i kissed chub goodbye and gave prairie a hug i felt guilty and restless and frustrated all at once but it was wednesday the best day of the weekbecause on wednesdays i got to talk to kaz this was another thing i kept from prairie and though i felt guilty about it i didnt feel guilty enough to stop i guess kaz felt the same way because his mom didnt know about our calls either kaz was my boyfriend sort of his mom anna and prairie had been friends for years since he was a baby anna and kaz had helped us a few months earlier taking us in when we were on the run and standing by us as things got more and more dangerous somewhere along the way kaz and i had become more than friends when prairie and chub and i left chicago prairie and anna told me and kaz that they were sorry that we wouldnt be able to stay in touch but we had to leave everything behind including everyone we had ever known no one from our old lives could know where we were kaz and i had obeyed part of the rule id never told him where wed moved and he hadnt asked for all he knew we were living in california or in canada or even at the north pole but before i left wed figured out a way to talk so no one would know i couldnt call him at home we had learned to plan for the worst at all timeswhich meant we had to assume that his house was being watched that the phone lines were tapped we couldnt even use cell phones because they could be tracked we could have used our emergency phones the prepaid cell phones each of usme prairie anna and kazcarried with us the ones that were to be used only if the unthinkable happened but prairie checked the phones once a week and replaced them once a month if i used mine shed know so that was out but kaz had a summer job at the public library branch near their house and on wednesday afternoons his task was to prepare the new childrens books to go into circulation that meant he had to enter them into the system and cover them with special protective bindings it usually took a couple of hours and he worked in the office that belonged to one of the reference librarians because she didnt come in on wednesdays and every wednesday i called him on that phone it was a windowless office and there was no way anyone could be monitoring incoming calls for the entire library i used my own cell phone and made sure that when the bill came i was the one who paid it that was easy enough to get past prairie once i convinced her that i was old enough to learn about personal finances gram had never used a bank but kept her money locked in an old desk drawer in her bedroom i had never even had a bank account and prairie was happy for me to take on the responsibility no one bothered kaz on wednesday afternoons with the office door closed no one even remembered he was there we talked for only half an hour at a timecaution had become a habit for both of usand we never ever talked about the future because we both knew that it would be a pointless conversation after prairie left for work i took a long hot shower and blowdried my hair i tried to read a book for a while but i couldnt focus on the story i dusted and vacuumed and at noon i fixed myself a sandwich then all i had to do was watch the minutes crawl by until onethirty finally it was time i took my phone and a glass of iced tea out onto the balcony where i had a great view of the pool by the time i dialed the number i couldnt keep a smile off my face but when kaz answered it was clear something was very wrong i heard a clatter and a sharp intake of breath and when he spoke i knew something terrible had happened hailey hang upthey know i was so shocked i couldnt answer for a second my heart hammering i gripped the phone tightly what kaz what happened there was an exterminator here all weekno one thought to checktheyve gotten to the phoneshailey i had to sneak in here and if they find me an exterminator i interrupted trying to make sense of what he was saying but how would they think about it haileythink about what they do if they believe ive talked to you they will find a way to go through every single outgoing and incoming call for every line in this whole building im going to hang up now and his voice cracked and we cant talk anymore i knew he was right if theyd found kaz theyd use him any way they could to get to me and prairie but i couldnt accept it couldnt accept the thought of never hearing his voice again now that id lost jess and charlotte kaz was all i had leftthe only person in the world who cared about me besides prairie and chuband the idea that this was the last time wed speak this was goodbye but how will i how will we i mean they cant just ive got to go hailey dont you understandwe have to theres no other choice there was a crash and then an unfamiliar voice a man speaking in clipped tones without emotion we found him room start trace the phone smashed into the cradle as kaz hung up he hadnt been quick enoughbecause id kept him on the phone everything was wrong and it was my fault for several long moments i didnt move i disconnected and stared at my phonejust a few ounces of plastic and metal and yet i had used it to destroy every bit of security of safety that prairie and i had worked so hard to create and to bring danger straight to kaz if only id hung up when he told me to if only id hung up but even that might not have been enough we had hoped that they would never find us we had wanted to keep anna and kaz completely out of it when prairie and chub and i had driven north from chicago a month ago we had hoped that they would be forgotten that the people searching for us would never find the humble bungalow in the middle of chicago where wed once taken shelter but somehow theyd found kaz and they were smart enough to know that anna and kaz would never admit to being in contact with us so theyd followed kaz instead followed him to his job pretending to be exterminators biding their time guessing that eventually he would lead them to us and they had been right stupid i muttered and then i snapped out of my trance i raced into the apartment phone clutched in my hand and grabbed my purse then i left not even bothering to lock up as i ran down the hallway i dialed prairie when i got to the elevator her phone was ringing i was alone in the elevator and i paced the tiny space the twofloor descent felt like it took an eternity as i waited for prairie to pick up the phone rang four times before going to her voice mail i heard the familiar greeting id reached many times before this is holly garrett im currently away from my desk stupid stupid i dug my nails into the soft flesh of my palm furious with myself but beating myself up wasnt going to fix things id gotten us into this mess and now i had to find a way to get us out taxis werent hard to come by at our apartment building the complex was built on a strip of land that once formed the barrier between downtown milwaukee and the grand old mansions of the east side and despite what jesss parents thought many young rich professionals and families called it home and cabbies often cruised by looking for fares today was no exception a man in expensive sunglasses and the kind of golf shirt that nobody plays golf in took the first cab i spotted barely pausing in the conversation he was having on his earpiece to open the door i got the next one id become pretty good at it stepping into the street a couple of paces and raising my hand high looking like i meant business id found that you had to look like you expected them to stop or they drove right by if you had told me six months earlier that i would ever hail a cab i would have thought you were crazy in the entire time i lived in gypsum the only cabs i saw were on tv i reeled off the address of chubs preschool which prairie had made me memorize the minute she signed chub up the ride took only ten minutes but it seemed endless i had to resist urging the cabbie to go faster when we pulled up in front of the school i threw some bills onto the front seat and bolted out of the cab id come only once before with prairie back when chub had been the newest kid there and this time i took a wrong turn before finding the desk separating the reception area from the classrooms and play spaces i could hear children shouting happily but i couldnt see any of them a young woman with a long braid down her back came through a frosted glass door pulling it shut behind her she held a stack of construction paper in one hand and when she noticed me waiting she gave me a tired smile can i help you yes im um im here to pick up my little brother charlie garrett charlie is something wrong no no i just my aunt wanted me to pick him up for her holly holly garrett now the young woman frowned holly hasnt called in thats right she hasnt had a chance to shes tied up at work she said i should just come get him i can show you my id if you want one of the benefits of paying for a fake id was that even though i didnt have a drivers license yet i had a state id card and a social security card that were guaranteed to be one hundred percent indistinguishable from real ones please give me a second the woman said but i saw the change on her face the way her eyes turned opaque and suspicious she went to a computer at the reception desk and typed for a moment with a small frown on her face when she looked up at me the suspicion had deepened im sorry but your aunt is the only person authorized to pick charlie up but im his sister i protested even though i wasnt not really please you have to let me take him maybe you can call her at work i hadnt been able to get her to pick up though and i knew that calling her would be pointless the woman shook her head and her hand hovered above the keyboard as though she was trying to make a decision if you come in with your aunt and she signs a release form but theres no time for that i said i have toits an emergencylook i met the other teacher when chubi mean when charlie first came here the blond one maybe you can go get her im sorry the woman repeated but now she didnt sound sorry at all charlie is fine and he will stay here until your aunt returns to pick him up there are no exceptions to the release policy i stared at her for a moment trying to think of some way to prove to her that i was safe that i wasnt crazy but anything i said would just make me sound insane finally i turned and left arguing further wouldnt help i would simply have to find prairie first it was a fourblock walk from the preschool to the building where prairie worked and while i jogged down the sidewalk dodging pedestrians i checked my watch and tried to figure out how fast they could get here i figured half an hour to trace the call once they found my number registered to holly garrett theyd have to search employment records and even then there was no way they would be able to find out where chub went to preschool was there on the other hand they could just torture the information out of kaz i knew there was nothing they wouldnt try if they needed to i ran faster when i got to prairies building i burst through the doors and the receptionist glanced up from her magazine startled i was already digging through my purse i found my id card and slapped it on the counter im amber garrett i said trying to catch my breath im here to see holly garrett she works in the high magnetic field laboratory on the second floor its really really important the receptionist a spindly woman with thin gray hair and a blouse that hung on her frail frame peered over reading glasses at me you can go on up there if you want she said they got their own security i ran past her muttering a quick thanks i hit the up button at the elevator bank then saw a door marked exit and took the stairs instead two at a time the stairwell echoed with my pounding feet the door to the second floor stuck before i forced it open onto a carpeted hall there was a pair of glass doors with a small square plaque identifying what was inside as the g laurence high magnetic field laboratory but the doors were locked i pounded on them bruising my knuckles after a few moments the door swung openjust as i noticed a doorbell set in the wall whats going on demanded a tall whitehaired man in a cheap sports shirt with sweat stains under the arms what do you want im here to see prto see holly garrett is she here he blinked at me looking more confused than annoyed are you her niece yes but you look like the pictures she has pictures of you and your little brother all over her cube we work together im don borelli i was surprised that prairie would take such a risk she was always so careful so cautious but then i remembered that it wasnt supposed to be a risk anymore we didnt have secrets other than the big one that we used to be completely different people i forced a smile yep thats me can you help me find her iits about charlie hes sick and i need her to come with me to the preschool because they wont release him to me i added a little earnest concern to my smile see i tried to telegraph im only worried not crazy help me find my aunt oh im sorry to hear that im sure we can help you find her the man said holding the door wide for me so hard when the little ones are sick isnt it i nodded my agreement borelli didnt strike me as father material but then again what did i know id only recently learned that my dad was a crazed killer borelli led me through a maze of cubicles stopping in front of one which i knew instantly was prairies it wasnt just the pictures of me and chubseveral were pinned to the cubicle walls just as borelli had saidit was the tailored black jacket hung neatly on a wooden hanger the orderly stacks of papers the expensive pen resting on the blotter well shes not at her desk borelli said unnecessarily and winked at me i wanted to throttle him but i resisted maybe shes in the lab i suggested trying to keep the panic out of my voice can we try there i suppose so seeing as its a bit of an emergency but when we got to the long rectangular room and peered through the large windows at the enormous machines there was no sign of prairie i felt the panic gaining strength and rising in my chest two men walked by laughing at some shared joke borelli stopped them hey have you guys seen holly her niece is looking for her they glanced at me with mild interest yeah you just missed her one of them said she went out to lunch with a couple of friends who i demanded two guysyou know around her age what were they wearing what did they look like i asked uh shirts plain shirtsone of them had a jacket black maybe or blue short hair they had short hair did they look like cops borelli was staring at me eyebrows raised but i couldnt think of a better way to describe the men whod tried to kidnap us the last time the ones whod broken into grams house and started shooting the men glanced at each other then back at me yeah i guess so the second one said they could have been cops why is holly in trouble with the law the way he said it i knew he thought he was joking but prairie was in way more trouble than he could imagine they had her they had her and it was all my fault after several weeks had passed wed convinced ourselves theyd given up but we should have known better men like that never gave up and when they couldnt get to us theyd gone after kaz instead and nowbecause of my slowness because of my stupiditytheyd found us after all thank you i whispered my throat dry with terror i walked away from the group of confused men who thought they had been working with a nice lady named holly garrett when i got to the lobby i ran id run hard on the way to prairies building but i ran twice as hard now back the way id come toward the preschool when i was only halfway there i heard the sirens when i got within a block my lungs screamed from the effort and i had to stop holding on to a tree trunk for support i couldnt risk getting any closer anyway not after what i had done three police cars had been parked hastily in front of the building a cop stood next to one leaning on the open door and talking into his pager another cop stood in the door of the preschool holding the arm of an agitated womanthe young woman id talked to she was trying to break away from him crying and pointing down the street in my direction i slipped behind the tree heart thudding she was telling them about me the crazy girl who had come in half an hour earlier she was telling them that i had taken chub if only she knew if i could get chub back id walk right up to the cops with my hands up they could throw me in jail and id go gladly if only i could save chub if there was anything in the world i could trade for chubs and prairies safety i would give it but i had nothing and now i had to save myself before i could help them i slipped back down the street trying to blend into the early lunchtime crowd groups of people out enjoying the sunshine when a bus pulled to the curb in front of me i got on and picked an empty seat near the back i slumped down in my seat and tried to be invisible and as the bus pulled away from the curb i closed my eyes and pretended that if i couldnt see anyone else then they couldnt see me either it was a game from when i was a little girl a time that seemed so far away it might as well have happened to somebody else the bus made its slow exhaustemitting way downtown toward the heart of the city where prairie and i often went to shop or try new restaurants i eventually opened my eyes half expecting to find a gun pointed at my face but there were only a dozen or so boredlooking passengers staring at the ads that ringed the bus or at the floor or at folded newspapers no one was looking at me i was trying to calm down and figure out what to do next when my phone rang not my cell phone but the other one the one that had never rung before i scrambled to fold back the hidden pocket at the bottom of my purse my shaking fingers making it difficult i dropped the phone on the floor and it skittered forward under the seats and a heavyset woman with a lined face picked it up and handed it to me with a look of distaste i was too anxious to thank her i grabbed it and hit the answer key hello hailey its me kaz where are you are you safe on my honor relief washed over me on my honor was our safety phrase something kazs dad used to say to him long ago before he left to fight in a war and never came back when anna and prairie had given us the phones we had all settled on the phrase as a way to communicate that we were safe and alone that there was no one with a knife at our throat or a gun at our temple oh my god kaz i wanted to let the story rush outthey have chub and prairie and im on a bus and the cops are after mebut i knew i had to be careful i moved to the back of the bus where there were no other passengers who might overhear and then i forced myself to take a deep breath before i told him everything how id seen prairies jacket on the hanger as if she was going to be back any moment how the cop cars had pulled up in front of the preschool and how i had heard the childrens laughter but i hadnt been able to see chub where are you now im on a bus a city bus i took the first one that came i dont think anyone saw me its we just passed the us bank building hailey kazs voice was gentle i dont even know what city youre in remember that was righti had never told im in milwaukee i said and with that one revelation i knew that everything had changed we were a team again me and kaz with an impossible challenge ahead of us but i had learned to focus on the first step and then the one after that and then the one after that we had a chance if we just put one foot in front of the other in my heart i knew that it was a fantasy that our odds were nearly impossible but for the moment i chose to pretend after we settled on a plan i hung up and looked out at the streets of downtown milwaukee at all the people going about their business nice ordinary folks whod never had to discover a terrible secret that changed their lives forever i managed to keep the denial going for a while when the city bus came within a few blocks of the amtrak station i got off and bought a ticket and a sandwich and a magazine i didnt read and waited in the station with all the other passengers until it was time to depart a year earlier i wouldnt have known how to buy a ticket where to wait what to eat every decision would have frightened me i had never left missouri and i could count on one hand the number of times id left gypsum i had never shopped in a department store had a real haircut eaten in a nice restaurant gone to a concert or kissed a boy now id done all those things and more prairie had been there for me every step of the way she knew when i was afraid and she always made time for me whether it was to take me on my first visit to a real doctor to teach me how to ride public transportation or to help me balance my checkbook shed created our new lives with great care making my safety her foremost concern and shed been right to worry even as i chafed under her rules even as i broke them even as i resented her for loving me enough to keep me safe shed given me everything and id thrown it away as the chicago skyline came into view outside the train window i picked out the sears tower the hancock building all the landmarks id come to love in the brief time that prairie and i had lived with anna and kaz and wondered if i was a city girl now but deep down i knew that despite my new confidence my new look i still didnt know who or what i was i got off the train hoping kaz would be waiting for meand knowing that he wouldnt we had learned to be a lot more careful than that i kept my sunglasses on an expensive pair that had been a recent splurge on a shopping trip with prairie and walked purposefully in the direction of the shops lining the edges of the train station i pretended to windowshop pausing in front of a little store jammed with racks of costume jewelry i lost track of how long id been standing there a minute two five i watched the reflection in the polished glass a thousand people with a thousand different destinations hailey i had been waiting for his voice but i still jumped my thoughts fell away and i blinked and spun around and there he was right in front of me and for a moment i forgot everything else kaz i managed to whisper and then i was lost in his arms git up rattler sikes muttered his lips inches away from derek pollitts freckled ear it had been no problem letting himself in through a poorly secured groundlevel window at dereks place which was really just the basement of his mothers crumbling ranch house on the west end of town not far from the old packnsave theyd shut down when they built the walmart supercenter over in casey kids took potshots at the sides of the packnsave building now and spun donuts in the parking lot on days when slate skies left a slick layer of ice on the pavement rattler himself had let out some of his extra energy there a few times on days when all that power inside him felt like it wanted to itch its way out and leave him twitching and empty days when he felt like it controlled him rather than the other way around he didnt like that feeling no not one bit days like that he split wood for hours working in the freezing cold with no shirt on feeling the splinters bounce off his torso smug in the knowledge that theyd leave no mark on him or he shot a couple dozen rounds at the n in the abandoned stores sign from across the parking lot feeling the restlessness ease its way back down with every shot that met its mark which was all of them today though he hadnt come over to this side of town meaning to shoot anything hed shot enough yesterday hed seen them coming waited stealthy and still in the corner of the parlor and sure enough in they came sneakin too dumb to know what they were up against rattler nailed one of them in the heart and the other between the eyes and werent they a sight tumbling to the floor like the cowards they were the thrill of the blood hunt was still in his fingers making them sure and strong and now he was about to sign himself up a lieutenant if that was what it was called anyway rattler had never been in the service didnt know anyone whod served and made the mental connection only because it sounded like a secondincharge a righthand man which was what he wanted he didnt want a partner he didnt need an equal what rattler wanted was someone who would do what he said without much fuss someone who understood a basic concept and was clear on a result and would do what it took to get from one to the other without wanting to run the show and someone who was banished it might as well be another banished not because rattler needed anyone elses visions especially given that there wasnt another man in the county who could predict which way the wind would blow to save his life and hadnt been in an easy couple of generations not since most everyone had gone and married outside and diluted the line no he wanted a banished man because it felt right to him in the same way it felt right that hed put on his grandpas silver watch that didnt keep time and nodded as he left the house at the old family portrait of his greatgrandparents that hung in his hallbecause this was about getting back to the past to the way it was meant to be to the way it was ordained before the families left the soil of that village in ireland so many years ago derek pollitt wasnt the worst of them and he wasnt the best he had a taste for weed and a pintaday rum habit but that made him about ten times as reliable as the ones whod gone down the prescriptiondrug road those ones twitched those ones were about as skittish as a burnt cat they forgot whether they were coming or going and rattler didnt need any of that ironic really since he was doing this for them for all the lameass dilutedblood breed of the families those whod tossed away their heritage the first time theyd caught sight of a tightfitting skirt chasing tail all over the county and fathering any number of spawn with the gift so weak in their blood theyd be hardpressed to know it was there it didnt make any sense since the banished were drawn to each otherlike bees to honey the way a girl from the families could set a mans heart to poundingbut a lot of men just went for the path of least resistance the easy score then they got locked in put a ring on a womans finger and compounded their error by having more kids to taint the population with halfbreeds hell quarterbreeds eighthbreeds who knew in fact as far as rattler was aware there were only a few pure lines leftamong them the sikes and the tarbells and it was prairie tarbell he aimed to bring back hed already fathered the girl hailey with prairies sister and no one could say it was his fault that clover had hanged herself from a rafter before her baby took her first steps hell hed treated clover tarbell goodbetter than he had to anyway rattlers mouth tightened in a stoic line as he thought about the other ones the ones whod resisted the ones hed had to raise a hand to not in anger he wasnt an angry man an idealist that was what he wasa visionary hell they all ought to be thanking him he was finelooking that was a fact hed fathered half a dozen finelooking kids around town that he knew of not counting the tarbell girl and every one of them had the strength of his blood in their veins and since he only picked women with the strongest blood ties to their banished ancestors he was singlehandedly turning around the ruination of the bloodline that gypsums onceproud citizens had allowed to happen clovers girl was pureblood he had done that and when he brought prairie back shed give him children too hell she wasnt much more than thirty she had a decade of bearing left easyenough time to produce a damn brood it didnt even bother rattler that theyd all be girls he wasnt the kind of man who had to have a son who wanted to teach a boy to toss a ball or skin a deer rattler wasnt father material and he didnt care he was on this earth for one reason the way he saw it and that was to build the banished line back up the way it was meant to be and he was meant to do it with prairie it made him near upon insane that she couldnt see it couldnt understand how it was meant to be between thembut hed make her see this time hed make her see but first he had to get her back and he couldnt do it alone the failure in chicagohis dead eye which his daughter had stabbed before she and prairie escaped throbbed in fury at the thoughtthat failure filled him with shame and determination but it also served him notice that prairie and the girl had more backbone than hed expected more power the thought excited him even as it angered him i said git up rattler said a bit louder giving dereks shoulder a good shove derek coughed his breath foul with whiskey and cigarette smoke and rot wha what what dooh rattler derek put a hand to his face squeezing the bridge of his nose with grimy fingers he squinted and moaned faintly then dragged himself up to a sitting position and raked his hands through his hair body odor wafting from his undershirt as the bedclothes fell away what you want anyhow rattler fingered the card in his pocket the card hed fished out of the wallet of one of the men whod died in the ambush on his house it had a nameprentissand a phone number written in blue ink got a job rattler saw dereks jeans lying in a heap next to battered work boots on the floor he picked them up and tossed them to derek letting the heavy metal buckle strike him in his soft gut what kinda job the kind where you might could make some serious cash how much derek asked automatically as he kicked the sheets away so he could pull on his jeans five hunnert rattler said without thinking it was what was left of the money hed had in his pocket for most of a month the money mr chicago had given him for information too bad he hadnt held out for more now mr chicago was burnt up dead and a lot of that cash had gone to the doctorhed said he was a doctor anywaywho had swabbed and cleaned and stitched rattlers stabbed eye in a filthy south side apartment damn irony prairie could have fixed him faster and for free only this way with his eye dead to the outside world it seemed to have developed an inner life of its own and rattler wasnt sure but what it might be better like this he caught derek staring while he pulled on a waddedup work shirt that hurtin you still no figure you can still drive an all with just the one eye got here didnt i rattler put a little extra menace in his voice and that shut derek up while he waited for derek to piss and brush his teeth and gather up his guns rattler swiped a slingshot off a bookshelf climbed the basement stairs and let himself out the front door of mrs pollitts house ignoring her baleful glare as she lurked in a doorway in her flowery housedress he picked rocks out of the gravel and winged them at a row of mailboxes across the drive when a red bird swooped out from the branches of a tall oak he remembered how his mama used to call them mr robin red breast even as his stone found its mark and the bird fell dead out of the sky without a sound and hit the ground in a burst of crimson feathers how did you get away kaz and i sat on a highbacked wooden bench that gave us a little privacy in the middle of all the earlyevening commuters and he put his arm around me and pulled me close it felt so good to be with him again his chin resting on my forehead my face pressed against his neck as i inhaled his scent of soap and cotton he let me go reluctantly there wasnt a whole lot they could do i mean we were in crystals office there were people passing by they uh had a gun on me at first but honestly they seemed a lot more interested in the phone than in keeping me there yeah i said bitterly who knew exterminators were so good with technology no one in the library thought that was a little strange kaz shrugged even i didnt think anything about it i mean they were working up in the ceiling panels and down along the floorboards they had the little sprayers and all they even had people out of their offices for a few hours at a time so they could treat them when they were really getting into the phones setting up the trace or whatever yeah i guess he shook his head i just cant believe theyd do all that i mean thats a hell of a lot of planning expense but its the general remember we were both silent thinking about that we knew very little about the general only that he was the mysterious exmilitary figure prairie had worked for in chicago well to be accurate prairie had worked for a man named bryce safian and bryce had worked for the general a fact prairie had accidentally learned from overheard conversations and files she was never meant to see prairie and bryce had already been keeping one secret prairie was a healer a member of an ancient clan called the banished not all the banished could heal but they all had abilities that the rest of the world didnt the men had visions of future events most banished could recognize each other through an intuitive sense and a very few of the womenincluding the women of the tarbell family like my mother and prairie and my grandmother and her mother and her mother all the way back to the irish village where it all startedwere healers bryce had thought prairie was the only healer still living in the united states then he found out about me he decided to kidnap me and use me for research but he didnt tell prairie it wasnt the only thing he lied about hed led prairie to believe she was helping to research ways of using her healing gift to reach larger populations of the injured and the ill when really he was studying her trying to figure out how to create healers out of ordinary people but the general didnt care about healing people he had discovered that if a healer laid hands on a person right after the moment of death the person lived on in an undead state for a while his emotions and reasoning powers his soul gone these people were able to follow directions though and the general meant to create and sell these zombies to foreign armies to be used in battle as suicide bombers and mine clearers to perform tasks that living soldiers could not be made to do he also planned to use banished men for their visions selling their services to the military strategists attacking your enemies would be a hell of a lot easier if you had someone who could see their next move foreign militaries it turned out would pay astonishing amounts of money for the generals zombies without healers to create the zombies he had nothing so he came after me but when prairie found out she located me first she didnt know about chubshe hadnt even known i existedbut she helped us escape and then we made our way to chicago where kaz and his mom helped us burn down the lab with bryce and all the zombies in it so that no one would ever be able to create zombies again after that when we went to bryces apartment to destroy his files we discovered he had found another healer three more actuallypolish sisters descended from the banished two of the sisters had died in the fire and we sent the third back to poland where she would be safe a thought struck me oh no i gasped i forgot to call zytka zytka walczak the surviving sister was the fifth person who carried an emergency phone we hadnt seen her since wed said our goodbyes at ohare two days after we burned down the lab try her now kaz urged i did several times but the phone rang and rang dont worry kaz said shes safe they wont be able to find her in poland i wasnt so sure but we already had plenty to worry about chub saw something i confessed trying to keep my voice from breaking he was talking about a bad farm this morning i thought he was just you know talking about getting in trouble at school if id just listened you couldnt know yes but if id just done what prairie asked me to i mean i lied to her kaz i swore to her i wasnt in touch with you kaz sighed i lied too to my mom to prairie hailey even before you left i knew there was no way i was going to let you go i never intended to keep my promise that should have made it better that i wasnt alone instead i just felt more miserable it was my fault wed been found my fault chub and prairie were gone listen hailey i was seeing things too only i didnt put it together kaz pounded the bench with a fist i just didnt figure it out you saw them coming i asked kaz shook his head clearly frustrated no i mean ive been having those same visions you and the wires guess we know what that was all about now last week when wed talked hed told me that hed kept seeing me running my hair flying my legs moving so fast they were a blur neither of us had thought it meant danger we joked that i ought to take up jogging and the other thing hed said it was like a spedup movie of a roller coaster on a track made of wire a dizzying blaze of sparking energy flying by a trip through a psychedelic grid that left him with a searing headache id teased him saying that he was spending too much time watching youtube concert videos but now i suspected hed been seeing the trace itself the moment the generals men pinpointed my location and everything fell apart so they let you leave kaz shrugged they didnt stop me i just walked out of the office i knew they were focused on one thing and that was tracing the call i was afraid they might have someone posted at the entrance but i just walked out into the street and kept going i rode the el for a few hours out to blue island around the loop a couple of times by the time i came here i was pretty sure no one had tried to come after me his expression changed and he touched my cheek softly youre really okay yes i whispered not trusting my voice i closed my eyes and savored the feeling of safety for a moment then i forced myself to pull away we need to get going we cant stay here i gestured at the lobby with its soaring ceilings the people hurrying to catch their trains it wasnt a bad place to hide but before long the evening commute would dwindle and there would be no crowds to camouflage us kaz nodded yeah we need to keep moving i called mom earlier i told her that we would be gone for a while that we had to find prairie and chub oh kaz i said dismayed imagining annas reaction shed lost her husband in the first gulf war when kaz was little and had never remarried kaz was all she had she didnt take it well he said hoarsely looking away for a moment what if if theres any chance the cops could get chub and prairie back but kaz cut me off think about it hailey if youre not one of us if youre just another person whos never had a vision and never healed anything and never heard of the banished if youre just doing your job and trying to catch bad guys and keep order would you believe it any of it i thought about how id resisted when prairie first told me what we were how id refused to believe even after shed proved it after shed healed a bullet wound in chubs leg right before my eyes the mind refuses to believe what it knows is impossible before i could answer kaz he took my hand again the sensationhis touch his warmth the electric rightness of itrocketed through me hailey together we have a chance of finding chub and prairie once we have them well come straight back here and figure out what to do next but for now its down to us what do you mean me and you we have to go get them were the strongest we have my visions you can keep us well mom will be safe here she doesnt know anything and the general must know that by now since theyve probably been watching the house and tapping our phone for weeks i looked in kazs pale gray eyes saw his determination and energy and i felt the current that ran between us felt how it danced at the edge of my heart in the banished blood that ran through my veins and i knew that when i was with him my gift was stronger i was stronger at that moment it felt strangely as though we were not alone as though in addition to me and kaz there was some presence something larger than life and older than history and deeper than time that reached to us across myth and impossibility and pushed us forward that blessed and comforted and promised everything would be all right okay it was what kaz had been waiting for my permission my agreement but he hesitated a moment longer theyre all going to be all right i heard the fear in his voice and i knew he was saying that for himself as much as me leaving his mother behind was undoubtedly the hardest thing hed ever done but kaz and i both knew that until we defeated the general once and for all none of us would be safe my shiny new life the beautiful apartment and the new school and new friends none of it had been real we had all been waiting knowing that this moment would come someday id seen the toll the last weeks had taken on prairie the worry on her face the dark circles under her eyes maybe that was what parenting meantconstant fear of what might happen next i didnt know gram had never acted like a parent to me neither prairie nor i had ever really had a mother and wed never had fathers either only kaz had grown up with someone who loved him more than life itself and maybe that was what gave him the strength to leave now because he was protecting anna he was almost a man or maybe he was a man in the same way that some days i felt like i was an adult and others i missed being a child but when i looked at kaz i saw it clearly he would be strong for the ones who couldnt for his mother and chub and prairie and i would be strong with him i put my hand in his im ready i whispered we slipped out into the descending evening the city easing into its night self around us and i knew that whatever lay ahead of us kaz and i would give everything we had to make things right again prairie sat up straight in the upholstered chair and kept her expression impassive they were watching hershe was sure of itand they had been ever since theyd deposited her still unconscious from whatever theyd given her on the hotel bed there was a beautiful sunset over lake michigan out her window the room was on a high floor in what was clearly one of chicagos finest hotels but prairie ignored the view she would wait for them to make their next move and she would not give them the satisfaction of seeing how afraid she was whatever theyd given her must have taken many hours to wear off because when she woke curled up on the bed the sun had already dipped low in the sky shed tried the phone and found it disconnected the door was locked from the outside she thought about pounding on the walls but all that would accomplish was to bring them running and that could easily make things worse thoughts of chub and hailey made her almost desperate enough to take the chance though if the men had managed to find her despite the new identities despite how careful she had been then all was lost the general would have sent teams to the apartment the preschool everywhere at once giving them no time to warn each other but hailey was something special she was smart and gifted and brave and she had the blood running strong in her she was the most powerful healer prairie had ever known the hope and the future of the banished was it possible that hailey could have escaped when the sun finally slipped under the horizon leaving an orange glow on the water the door opened and one of the men from the lab walked into the room he was still wearing the black jacket hed had on earlier but hed taken off his earpiece he looked around and nodded in approval prairie had smoothed the bedcovers neatly the room looked undisturbed she stood and faced him silently we didnt have time for proper introductions he said extending a hand he was about her age handsome in a bland way im david graybull well be working together prairie ignored his hand working together was he serious you dragged me out of my office at gunpoint id say thats all the introduction i need graybulls expression tightened and he let his hand drop you dont need to make this harder on yourself he said but as he ushered her out of the room he didnt try to make further conversation the hall was quiet and thickly carpeted graybull pulled a key ring from his pocket and worked at the locks of the next room down prairie looked up and down the hall and saw that it was oddly short with only four doors and a single elevator prairie guessed they were on the penthouse floor one that had been customized at what was no doubt a very high price after you graybull said with an exaggerated sweep of his arm inside the drapes were drawn and the roomtwice the size of an ordinary hotel roomwas dim as prairies eyes adjusted she saw several beds lined up along the wall and on the opposite wall two people working at computers their faces illuminated by the monitors glow one of them was her other kidnapper and one was a woman with a mass of curls around her face ah ms tarbell welcome im phil cutler the man rose from his computer shes not feeling very friendly graybull said really cutler considered her for a moment well i suppose i might be a little irritable myself maybe it will help to know that the boy is doing well we just received a report from the lab he had two chicken nuggets and some applesauce for dinner didnt think much of the tater tots apparently i want to see chub prairie said quickly trying to keep the desperation from her voice all in good time cutler said your niece on the other hand managed to have other plans this afternoon most distressing prairie bit down on her lip to keep from reacting so it was truethey didnt have hailey good girl she thought staring at a crack in the curtains where the evening light filtered through im sure youre hungry cutler continued well find you some dinner in a moment well do everything we can to keep you comfortable here tonight and tomorrow well get you acquainted with our setup what setup prairie demanded cutler raised his eyebrow oh i think you can guess prairie i understand you are a very resourceful woman still our partnership will require your cooperation and focus please take a look at our current subjects he gestured at the beds lining the other side of the room and prairie took a closer look in the dimness she hadnt noticed the banks of medical equipment at first exam lighting and surgical spotlights focused here and there two of the three beds were occupied the motionless figures covered with sheets up to the chin and connected to iv lines feeding tubes monitorsall kinds of lifesustaining measures her heart plummeted as she realized what she was looking at a crop of the dying waiting to be saved by a healer given life without life the floor grew unsteady under her feet prairie knew this scene entirely too well when she was sixteen her high school boyfriend had been killed in a car accidentbut she hadnt been strong enough to let him stay dead instead she had healed vincent healed him after deaththe one thing that must never be done she had turned him into the living dead and he lingered on in the shadows his body preserved by science in a setting not unlike this one no one knew who he was and no one cared his body was the subject of endless research by scientists who could not understand how he lived on long after his flesh had withered shed visited him over and over the pain fresh every time she stared into his unseeing eyes and touched the cold flesh of the arms that had once held her for more than a decade shed snuck into the nursing home where he existed between life and death his tissues pumped full of experimental chemicals she pretended to be someone else a volunteer a church lady anyone but the girl whod believed that she and vincent would be together forever these two came in over the weekend cutler continued oblivious to her pain americas finest gave their all for their country blah blah blah they havent yet been transitioned thats where you come in prairie couldnt keep a soft cry from escaping her lips transitioned such a bland word for the most horrific act she could imagine no she whispered no i canti wont and when youre done well send them on down to the lab which youll be happy to know weve set up in your old hometown great for the local economy and so forth youve youve got people in gypsum prairies mind reeled at the thought so many banished concentrated in such a small place they would be sitting ducks waiting to be picked off by the general turned into lab rats made to commit unthinkable acts oh hell yes got a real nice operation in the works it would be better to fly these fellas straight there but i guess you know how things work in the sticks cant get a decent bagel much less a direct flight so we bring in our volunteers by private car these two will be heading down there next week once youre done with them ill never help you oh dont be hasty cutler exclaimed his voice taking on a hard edge theres someone here youll want to talk to sharon will you help her only then did prairie realize that there was one more person in the room in a far corner a wilted figure leaned in a chair her face obscured by a bandage that circled her scalp her arm in a sling her other wrist was manacled to the arm of the chair the woman working at the computers got up and went to kneel next to the motionless woman opening the manacles with a small key when the woman didnt stir sharon took her good arm and guided her up not without care the woman stumbled to her feet and seemed to rouse herself from a stupor then limped toward them with a look of bleak resignation on her bruised face prairie searched her features then took a step back in shock zytka she gasped how cutler chuckled ah i was hoping youd be surprised i suppose youve been disappointed that shes been out of touch you see there was a slight problem with her flight to poland irregularities with her documents you might say we were able to step in before the authorities got involved nasty business deportation although i suppose they cant be careful enough these days can they as the pieces fell into place prairies throat went dry she remembered the silent tears that had streamed down zytkas cheeks as shed walked through security at ohare planning to disappear among her countrymen to build a new life and try to put the nightmare of her old one behind her i realize that you probably thought youd never see zytka again cutler continued but after that unfortunate accident at the lab we found ourselves understaffed luckily we were able to persuade her to stay and help us rebuild do not do what he says zytka mumbled with effort lifting a shaking hand to point at the beds lining the wall her voice was raw and prairie saw ugly purple bruises at her throat whats wrong with her prairie demanded what did you do to her oh i didnt do anything to her personally cutler said and my colleagues only issued a er correction when she broke one of the very few rules we have here what did she do cutler laughed a chilling soulless sound that echoed around the sterile room she decided to leave without telling anyone she made it out the doorquite impressive reallybut she was er dissuaded before she made it to the elevator and as you can see that was not a very comfortable experience zytka took two tottering steps one leg twisting as though it would buckle under her weight and one of her arms hanging at a strange angle she worked her jaw and spit at cutler it fell short and cutler looked at the saliva on the floor at his feet with distaste see to this please he turned his back on the pathetic scene as sharon gathered paper towels and a spray bottle of disinfectant while graybull led zytka gently but firmly back to her seat zytka pushed weakly at the mans hands but she was no match for him its too bad of course cutler said conversationally to prairie as he took her arm and guided her toward the closest bed if she wasnt one of your own you could fix her up far more quickly than we could fix her up heal her so he knew that healers were of no use to each other a fact that had perplexed bryce it had been one of the things he was most looking forward to studying when hed found out that prairie had a niece back then convinced that bryce loved her and was working to combat disease prairie had told him almost everythinghow the healing gift ran in banished families how healers only bore girls how the oncenoble seers had diluted their gift by marrying outside the banished and become hateful and mean addicted and lazy and stupid how glad she was to have left trashtown and her childhood tormentors behind up close prairie saw that the patient in the bed had nearly half a dozen tubes protruding from his body including equipment for airway maintenance and cardioversion he was receiving advanced life support if the machines were disconnected he would die within moments i wont touch him she vowed clenching her hands tightly behind her i wont touch any of them oh dont worry we dont expect you to start work tonight cutler said chuckling youve had a long day you need your rest i just couldnt wait to show you how much weve accomplished in such a short time impressive no prairie shuddered this is unconscionable cutler tsked and pulled the sheet back from the body on the bed with a flourish the young mans torso was swathed in bandages prairie reached involuntarily to touch the smooth undamaged patch of exposed skin above the bandages he was not yet even a man he was a boy barely older than kaz shot down on foreign soil far from home she guessed that hed lost a great deal of blood that his brain had been deprived of oxygen long enough to leave his body unable to sustain life on its own you want to touch him dont you cutler said unable to restrain the excitement in his voice to heal him prairie jerked her hand away and took a step back no i told you i wont do it oh but i think you will cutler said in a few days when you are settled in and ready to begin work i will turn the machines off this young mans heart will stop beating and oxygen will cease to reach his brain his systems will shut down and then you will lay your hands on him and say those words youll do it because you cannot help yourself deep inside heal him and we will leave your friends alone refuse and we will be forced to go find kazimierz and anna sawicki are you willing to gamble with their lives no prairie whispered leave them alone cutler shrugged as you wish and welcome to the team three or four blocks from the train station kazs cell phone made the ting that signaled a text message he dug it out of his pocket and glanced at the screen then he frowned and showed it to me we have prairie tarbell and the boy theyre oh god kaz you think i should call them you have to i said without hesitation only we need to get rid of these wait i dug a pen out of my purse and wrote the number on my hand then i turned kazs phone off and threw it in a trash can if these guys were good enough to track down chub and prairie that fast kazs cell phone wouldnt give them any trouble that they hadnt tracked him down yet was proof that they were only using him to get to me we caught the el and rode it north only after wed cleared the city did we get out at the howard stop a few blocks away was a tiny park a triangle of mowed grass with concrete paths and a few scrubby shrubs already most of the benches had been claimed by homeless people some beside carts loaded high with possessions some lying on their sides asleep faces obscured by caps and jackets slung like blankets over their still forms we found a bench that was unoccupied near the far edge and i dug the emergency phone from my purse and handed it to kaz they cant trace this one i said and then i turned my palm up so he could read the number id copied as he dialed i leaned in close so that i could hear both sides of the conversation the phone barely rang before it was picked up prentiss a deep clipped voice said this is kazimierz sawicki there was no hesitation or tremor in kazs voice he sounded sure of himself even dangerous id like to speak to the general i heard a dry chuckle the general only safian ever called me that young man it has been a long time since i wore the uniform of this country or any other my name is simply prentiss now alistair prentiss wheres prairie and chub the man laughed again a sound that held no trace of warmth so you want to get right to business eh no time to chat to get to know one another all i need to know about you is that you have kidnapped two innocent people and i want them back i put my hand on kazs hardmuscled shoulder he played lacrosse for st stephens high school in the city and his training regimen had carved and strengthened his body despite my fear despite the danger and uncertainty i felt my fingers tighten against his skin and my heart sped up to match the beat i sensed deep in his veins prentiss laughed shortly i think theres a little more you need to understand kaz okay if i call you kaz isnt it since thats what your mother calls you i felt his muscles tense under my fingers but when kaz spoke again his voice was cold and calm thats none of your business tell me kaz youre doing very well in your ap bio class arent you prentiss continued as though kaz hadnt spoken i believe mr tanenbaum was quite pleased with your lab report last week i hope im not breaking any confidences when i tell you that you received a ninetytwo on it enough to bring you up to a bplus if im not mistaken how the hell do you know that kaz demanded tap into the secret service computers general i was learning something about kaz he didnt experience fear the way i did he seemed to skip it and go directly to whatever emotion followed to the thing i would feel in his circumstances only after i was finished feeling utterly terrified in this case it was anger and i understood that understood how violated it must make you feel to have someone finding out the most hidden details about your life but in my experience anger had not served me well it never paid to get angry at gram shed just laugh her hardvoiced drunk laugh or yell obscenities at me and it never changed things but kaz was a warrior like his father anna once told me that her husband tanek had passed along a legacy of bravery and convictionother banished traits that had died out when the bloodline had been thinned beyond recognition i already told you my name is alistair prentiss no titlemy years in the official service of our great country are regrettably over now i must operate with shall we say sensitivity to the demands of national security so what they threw you out of the army and now youve got some sort of grudge or is it all about money selling to the highest bidder kaz knew as well as i did that if safian had managed to use healers to create and sell battle zombies prentiss stood to make a great deal of money unimaginable amounts i shall pretend you did not say that prentiss snarled but i caution you do not underestimate my convictions or my commitment do not make that mistake again yeah whatever you say prentiss kaz muttered youre the great patriot that what youre telling me patriotism takes many forms young man i hired safian because he was a pragmatist you might call him a pointatopointb thinker and he was hungry i used his hunger for money and affirmationyes i stroked his ego and encouraged him it was easy hes dead guess he wasnt the best choice after all he was weak prentiss shot back weak enough to fall for his subject after we had set it up so perfectly if you knew what lengths we went to to maintain the illusion that your friend prairie was working on thosethose ridiculous holistic health practices he spoke as though it pained him as though the words themselves were foul that wont happen again i learned you see from my mistakes putting one man in charge of the operation was too risky now there are several handselected my young friend and if it helps you make your peace with what you are about to do allow me to reassure you that these leaders shall we call them are most humane they are not interested in hurting prairie or hailey they will be grateful for the ladies service in fact and accord them the dignity and respect of a fellow team member haileys never going to be a member of your socalled team kaz said his voice low and dangerous ah yes we have your young romance to consider dont we how clumsy of me to forget the illusions of puppy love the way it makes tender hearts burst with noble thoughts and hormones unfortunately which are a bit counterproductive puppy love to hear prentiss mock my feelings for kaz his voice dripping with sarcasm as he used words neither of us had yet spoken aloud drove a spike of hot fury into my mind but that just cemented my determination if i hadnt already been committed to fighting him i would be now but kaz refused to be sucked in you wont find hailey ever really consider this kaz if young chub knew where she was we would already know oh dont worry we wouldnt use anything so primitive as torture we have other means lets just say that all our research into the machinations of the human mind has led to some very interesting discoveries it would be accurate to say that none of the little boys secrets are safe with us so what happens when we find you kaz prentiss went on in his oily voice if you know haileys whereaboutsand for the sake of argument lets say that you find out somehowhow long do you think it will take us to get the information out of you kazs gaze locked on mine but he didnt blink you wont find me if you are foolish enough to take that gamble and young man i am betting on you being as smart as your teachers think you are and realizing that the only course that makes sense is to cooperate with us but if you wish to gamble with the little boys safety then let me assure you that you will also be jeopardizing your mother tell me kaz would you like to know what she is doing now kaz was silent lips parted his grip on the phone so tight his knuckles showed white she is staring out the kitchen window no doubt wondering where you are she is twisting that pretty brown hair around the fingers of her left hand that is her habit yes when she is worried and how worried she must be about you he knew exactly how to torment kazand he was enjoying it ill leave you with that thought young kazimierz prentiss said softly enough that i had to lean in close to hear when you decide to call me backand you will my friend of that you can be sureyou may reach me at this number at any hour of the day and now i must bid you good night i heard the click that signaled the end of the conversation but kaz stayed frozen with the phone to his ear theyre watching your mom i whispered im so sorry yes but they didnt follow us here he said slowly and they dont know where were going where were we going i thought of the money in my purse a few twentieshow far would that take us and then i thought of prairie and was hit with a wave of guiltnot because shed given me the money i knew she wouldnt care about that but because she was a prisoner now unable to do anything but worry i could picture her thinking chewing her lower lip a habit we shared i had put her in an impossible position she was supposed to be taking care of me she felt responsible but it was different for me i was a kid i wasnt responsible for anyone and neither was kaz that made it possible for us to risk everything to rescue her and chub kaz handed my phone back but before i put it in my purse i had a thought prairie had programmed all the emergency numbers i wrote a quick text message to her knowing that prentiss would have had her searched that her purse and the emergency phone had probably been taken from her first thing i love you i wrote dont worry about us then i hit send not caring who saw my message prentisss men could intercept it they could throw prairies phone away they could lie to her but they could never extinguish the feelings that had taken root in my cold lonely heart i love you i had said those words to only one other person chub when he came to live with us he became my problem as gram couldnt be bothered to feed or change or bathe him it took only a couple of days for me to know that he and i were linked forever to learn the curve of his chubby cheeks and the way his little hands felt holding mine i didnt look at kaz as i slipped the phone back into my pocket hed probably said it a hundred times to his mother perhaps even his father whom hed known only a few short years and i imagined him saying it to me could feel the words on my lips could easily say it to him but we had been strangers not long ago and besides we had a job to do what now i asked what do you think i focused on his question it was a welcome reprieve from my thoughts you could offer to trade me we could set up a meeting place and no too dangerous by the time we set up the exchange itd be too late theyve got all the advantages hailey technology weapons everything they wouldnt give up anything and then theyd have you too they dont have everything i said softly they dont have you they dont have seers we just need to think about what were up against prentiss said hes got more people in charge now hailey not just one like before when bryce ran everything i bet theres a lot more people than that at the new lab more security for one and more staff if theyre trying to rebuild the research in the shortest possible time i still think prentiss must be exmilitary i said it was the way he talked as though he was used to being in command if he hires people like him they wouldnt care where they work theyd just move to the new facility wherever prentiss told them to go yeah kaz agreed grimly prentiss probably has contacts everywhere contractors who work for governments all over the world not just ours old buddies still on the inside who are happy to take his calls listen to his ideas maybe have an inside track to approving projects or getting funding and the seers i said if they could train people like you who could see what the enemy was doing their movements their strategies the visions dont work like that im a strong seer a pureblood and even i cant predict when they come or what theyll reveal but bryce was trying to develop ways around that training seers to control their visions what if prentiss found a way to control someone as powerful as kaz it was terrifying to imagine kazs gift being manipulated by someone like prentiss i prayed that they hadnt figured out yet that chub was a seer if they knew what chub could do they would never let him go so kaz said us against the exmilitary machine theyve got money weapons connections weve got uh he shrugged well weve got each other no problemought to be a piece of cake he was trying to joke but his voice was hollow the park had emptied as the sky had grown dark it was just us and the few homeless people who were making their home here for the night i shivered partly from the chill of nightfall and partly from the fear in his voice i touched kazs face just a hesitant brush of my fingers against his cheek i wanted to comfort him and i moved without thinking but kaz reacted by covering my hand with his and pressing it to his face he took a shuddering breath and said my name hardly more than a whisper hailey i cant do this without you he couldnt do it without me kaz was strong and brave and i was shocked by his admission he circled his arms around me and i leaned against him and held on and i could feel his heart beating through his shirt and his warm breath on my neck as he bent toward me and his eyelashes brushed my forehead and then he kissed me and it was like the first time the day wed left chicago when wed stolen a private moment in the shadow of his mothers garage it was like the first time but it was also different that time had been about the newness of our relationship innocent and tentative that day had been a sweet little break from what had come before and what would come after and it was almost like an illusionwe both knew it couldnt last but we were willing to pretend this kiss was something else it started gently enough like the first one had kaz brushed my lips with his but then it changed the first time wed kissed kazs tongue had lightly caressed my lips and i had been surprised to discover i liked it id thought about it a thousand times since id wished i had been brave enough to take it further i wanted a doover i wanted to kiss him forever and now it felt like that was what i was doing from the second our lips met it was like i was tasting him only the more i tasted the more i wanted and things moved so fast and were so hot i couldnt keep track and i didnt want to i didnt even know who started itonly that neither one of us was resisting there was fear and danger in itand also longing and need this is passion was what i was thinking when we finally stopped we opened our eyes and i was embarrassed and about to look away when i saw the intensity in kazs expression we were locked in a moment when time seemed to stop we stayed that way for a long timeor maybe it only felt like a long time maybe it was a half a secondand then we did it all again when kaz finally pulled me against him with a low groan i realized that it was night i glanced down the path and saw a pair of middleaged women watching us their expressions amused and i blushed we were in public in the middle of the city and i had forgotten that had forgotten everything includingif only for a momentchub and prairie i had practically forgotten my own name hailey kaz whispered almost like he was reading my mind im glad youre here i nodded not trusting myself to speak its cold he said after a while and gently pulled away from me do you want my sweatshirt i hadnt even noticed the cold until that moment but it was true my arms were covered with goose bumps i started to say no that i was fine but kaz unzipped his sweatshirt and held it for me while i put my arms into the sleeves and the sensation of his warmth wrapped around me weve got to get going he said gently and we should probably get a good nights sleep i said before we figure out whats next yeah uh the thing is we cant go back to my house well i stared at a spot in the middle of his chest he had on a tar heels lacrosse tshirt and i focused on the twined n and c we could um theres motels i guess i mean unless we want to find a shelter or something i dont have much money probably about sixty dollars ive only got about thirtyfive i did a quick calculation the motels id stayed in with prairie had cost close to a hundred dollars and even if we did have enough that wouldnt leave anything for food or a toothbrush or anything at all unless i do have a debit card i rooted around in my backpack came up with the designer wallet id talked prairie into buying for meright then i wished i had the cash shed spent on it insteadand took out the cards that were part of my fake identity the ones we had been planning to destroy the ones i was now glad id kept there was an id card that identified me as a sophomore at green valley high where id supposedly gone to school until my parents tragic car accident and then there was the debit card it was set up so the money came out of prairies accounther fake account registered to holly garrett kaz knew of a motel not too far away we started walking holding hands like we were any other young couple on a date the cracked sidewalk was littered with broken glass and trash it wasnt a great neighborhood i could tell but people sat out on their porches enjoying the spring night and lights shone brightly inside little grocery stores and restaurants i remembered my first day in the city it had been only a few months earlier but it felt like forever ago i tried to remember a time when i hadnt known how the night sky looked when the stars competed with the lights from all the buildings i tried to remember the sky over gypsum the way the stars looked almost like mist there were so many of them i saw it clearly when i closed my eyes i wasnt a seer like kaz and i didnt know what the next day would bring or how we were going to solve any of the problems we were facing but when i shut my eyes kazs hand warm around mine as we waited for the light to change so we could cross the busy street to the motel the whole world sparkled the bed didnt feel nice chub lay as quietly as he could and made himself small the covers were scratchy and they smelled wrong this was not like his new bigboy bed in the room next to haileys room that bed was soft and the covers were fuzzy and they were blue and there were airplanes with propellers and wings these were new words words he could say now instead of just thinking them he could say words now because of hailey before words didnt come out right but then a lot of things happened and prairie came and gram was gone and he and hailey went to live with prairie and now he could say words he missed hailey but it was okay because she would come soon chub knew that for sure because he saw it in his mindpictures and yesterday he saw a mindpicture of the tall man with the beard and he was scared of the man and he told hailey but hailey was making his waffle and she didnt hear him but he should have told hailey again because the jacket men came when he was at school and he was scared and one of the jacket men was talking to miss goode and the other one the other one went sneak sneak sneak and then he picked him up and ran and his arm got twisty and there was shouting then push and shove and owget in the car big glove hand on his face push hard fall on seat and then nothing no talking something smelled funny and then he slept a long time and then he woke up and they went in the building and he had to go with the lady with the brown glasses and where was prairie and where was hailey all day today the glasses lady had been trying to make him talk but chub knew about not talking and he was better at it than she was at making him talk and he stayed quiet he could tell that made the lady with the brown glasses kind of mad but she didnt do anything about it except try harder to play with him but she wasnt very good at playing she had square cards with pictures on them apple bell truck on a table there was a hiding thing and on the floor in a box were an apple and a bell and a truck and lots of other things the lady with the brown glasses would take something out of the box and put it on the table but it was behind the hiding thing so he couldnt see it then she would ask him which thing was on the table he didnt know he couldnt see behind the hiding thing he could have told her that but that would mean he would have to say words and today he wasnt saying words for lunch there was a sandwich but not like hailey made them chips with bumps chub only liked plain chips he drank his milk and ate his sandwich he didnt want to make the lady mad she didnt eat with him but she watched him eat he wished she would stop watching him he started to miss hailey more and he almost let the words out but then he didnt he wanted to go outside bad and almost told the lady but then he didnt after lunch it was the table with the hiding thing again he got sleepy but the lady didnt know about taking a nap so she didnt let him take a nap and he didnt tell her at dinner he cried a little even though it was a good dinner a hamburger with ketchup the lady with the brown glasses came back with a man chub hadnt seen before and that was scary for a minute he thought maybe the lady was mad and brought the man to spank him but he didnt he just asked chub the same things the lady asked him did he know where hailey was but chub kept the words inside extra tight he didnt know where she was but he was afraid the words would come out anyway he kept them inside the lady with brown glasses gave him a new pair of pajamas the ones from yesterday were gone he didnt know where they were yesterdays pajamas had lions on them todays pajamas had stripes on them he liked the lions and he liked the stripes but he did not like the way the pajamas smelled chub cried but quiet so the words couldnt get out and then he went to bed and was very quiet and the brownglasses lady left after a while but now he had woken up and there was a small light in the corner in the shape of a star enough to see that there was no one in the room with him just the bed and shelves and the desk with the hiding thing but the lady had taken her toys away with her chub knew it was okay to cry because hailey said it was fine to cry if he felt like it but he was too scared right now he closed his eyes and squeezed himself even smaller and made a mindpicture of haileys face and then prairie and anna and kaz these were his very own mindpictures the ones he made himself not the ones that just opened up bright in his head sometimes chub couldnt help being very scared but prairie was somewhere near he knew that and hailey and kaz were coming because a mindpicture of them popped in between the ones he was making by himself hailey and kaz right here in this room there was one other mindpicture hed seen a few times but he didnt like this one at all it was monster man monster man lay in a bed with things stuck in him white looping lines that went into machines monster man was covered up mostly with white covers and there were lights coming from the machines but they werent very bright where monster mans hands should have been were giant white pillows and his face his face was broken red and black and pink where there werent more white bandages he didnt have any hair just shiny red skin his eyes were regular except crazy crazy and there was a bandage where his nose went and a hose thing that went into his mouth hole but his mouth hole wasnt a mouth it was red and it was a hole and the hose went in it and even though the mindpictures didnt have sounds he could tell the monster man was screaming almost all the time the mouth hole shaking and the eyes going up inside his head chub wished he didnt have to see that mindpicture a long time ago he was a baby and his name was jacob and he lived in a room with a lady who slept a lot and she was broken and he was always hungry then he went to live with gram and she talked too loud and she was broken too but then there was hailey chub wondered how long it would take her to get there until she came he would be very small and he would wait i woke up with the sun in my eyes i blinked and for a moment i couldnt remember where i was couldnt identify the boxy room with strips of sunlight slanting in on the two beds and the plain brown furniture but then i saw kaz adjusting the blinds dressed in the jeans hed had on yesterday and a worn gray tshirt that fit him snugly showing off the muscles in his arms and back then i remembered good morning i said stretching and yawning hailey kaz turned from the window took a step toward me stopped looking selfconscious and jammed his hands in his pockets sorry i didnt mean to wake you up i brought you some coffee bagels what time is it i ran my fingers through my hair hoping that it wasnt doing that stickingup thing it had been prone to since prairie had cut and dyed it pale blond remembering that haircut brought all my guilt back the makeover was only the first of many things prairie had done to try to protect me nearly nine you slept in kaz picked up one of the coffee cups sitting on the desk peeled back the plastic lid and handed it to me i held it under my chin and let the steam bathe my face i was wearing only a thin tank top and my underwear i pulled the covers up under my arms id have to put my clothes on in the bathroom maybe wait until kaz wasnt looking to get out of bed i felt my face get warm when i thought of his having spent the night just a few feet away in a separate bed but still we had taken turns in the bathroom kaz going first because he was faster and when id come out after washing my face and brushing my teeth and combing my hair hed already been asleep one arm thrown over his head the other hand clutching the blankets to his chest i thought it would take me ages to unwind enough to sleep prairie and chub getting kidnapped running from the scene kissing kaz waiting in the lobby while he checked us in with the debit cardall of it had left me anxious and unsettled but i didnt remember a thing after getting into bed how long have you been up i asked taking a sip of the hot bitter brew a while kaz said and hesitated like he wanted to say something more what nothing nothing its okay he said quickly but listen hailey does quadrillon mean anything to you quadrillon i repeated confused yeah its some sort of hightech company they built an office park out east of gypsum when i was a little kid back during the whole hightech boom because they got the land really cheap plus tax incentives or something quadrillon was supposed to move in first only that never happened they went bust right before construction was finished and its been empty ever since sometimes kids go out there break windows and drink or whatever and the sheriff comes around i guess eventually itll just fall apart and turn into a landfill kaz nodded as though id confirmed a bad suspicion thats where they took them where they took chub anyway i saw it this morning right when i woke up the word quadrillon with a sort of squaredoff fourleafclover logo and then i realized it was a sign on a building i saw chub going in the door over and over he was with two guys in a car with black windows only the building looks brandnew i dont know how thats possible i said slowly that building was rundown unless they could have fixed it up that fast all they would have had to do is lease it under some bogus name and get the power turned on and they could move in fix up the place theyve had two months thats plenty of time youre saying theyre in gypsum it makes sense hailey thats where the other banished are if theyve started up the lab again theyre where they can get all the research subjects they need the seers i said slowly rattler would provide the seers it might even have been his idea to set up there the thought infuriated me rattler would be feeding the weaker banished to the general in exchange for cash all the while building his own new clan of purebloods speaking of rattler kaz said what does he look like does he have longish brown hair a scar on his forehead a little shorter than me oh no i whispered you saw him too kaz turned away from me blew out a long breath i woke up because i was having a migraine hailey it happens when they come too fast when the visions take over only now did i notice that his hands shook slightly that his face was pale and his jaw tight from the pain im sorry no kaz shook his head this is good this can help us now we know where to find them what was rattler doing was he at quadrillon too i couldnt tell but he was he looked really angry he was hitting something with his fist a wall ori dont knowa post or something over and over oh i felt the fear deepen inside me id seen rattler angry before but now i wondered who the target wasand given what i had done to him the last time id seen him it could easily be me as if we didnt already have enough obstacles ahead of us you didnt see prairie she wasnt with chub i dont know it wasnt you know all that definitive hey cheer up hailey kaz said forcing a smile its not all bad news i got us a car whathow i went to see a friend from school this morning a guy from the team i had him come up here then we drove to my car and switched he said we can take it for a few days kaz you went to your neighborhood dont worry my car was parked on the street nobody saw us but they could have i thought they could so easily have been watching the car what if theyd seen you but they didnt they didnt hailey look i know this is hard and im sorry im just so damn sorry to be taking these risks putting everyone i care about in danger but i dont know what else to do because it had never occurred to him not to try i felt my fear retreat a little kaz wasnt reckless only determined and brave and committed i tried to smile at him you must have been up for hours and i didnt even hear you get up kaz looked relieved that i was letting it go nah you were out woke me up with your snoring i figured i might as well get out for a while i felt my mouth drop open my face flooding with embarrassment i never snoredat least prairie had never said anything or chub for that matter then kaz grinned at me that big slightly crooked grin and i knew hed been kidding so your friend didnt mind getting stuck with my clunker his grin turned rueful hes a good guy hailey youd like him and its not like he traded me a bmw or anything dont get too excited his car isnt a whole lot better than mine i wasnti dont care i protested and i didnt care not about what kind of car we drove as nice as it had been to drive with prairie in the relatively new camry it was still a novelty to have a car at all i had spent most of my first sixteen years riding the bus and walking i just you know does he know where youre planning on taking it kaz raised an eyebrow at that and lowered himself to the other bed he was close enough that i could smell soap on him and his hair was still a little damp from the shower so id slept through that too i told him we were going for a drive in the country he picked up one of the pillows and set it next to him smacked it a few times you know with cows and all i couldnt help smiling you say cows like youve never seen one before ive seen plenty after theyve been made into burgers i laughed seriously how close have you ever been to one kaz pretended to think football field a few hundred yards they have some in the lincoln park zoo i think why have you like petted them or something you dont really pet cows i said but it wasnt entirely true walking half a mile through the woods in back of grams house took you to grazing acreage where bud eisle kept half a dozen head of black angus id taken chub there a few times once he was old enough to make the walk i picked him up so he could put his hand on top of the cows velvety noses when they stood at the fence chewing showing only the faintest interest it was before he could talk but he loved to pet the soft muzzles but that wasnt the kind of thing i could explain to kaz i cant believe im going back there i said when i left gypsum i thought id never go back it wont be forever kaz said softly he reached out for my hand and i took hisand then suddenly it was the most natural thing in the world for him to tug me gently next to him he kissed my hair and i let him draw me closer against him until i could feel his heartbeat through his tshirt this wasnt like yesterdays kiss this was comfort and a promisethat he would be there for me with me prairie had made me such a promise it had taken me a while to believe herhad taken a shared experience of danger the blood bond of violencebut with kaz i simply knew he wouldnt let me face what waited in gypsum alone maybe that was why i felt safe enough to say the rest you know i was different there kaz murmured yes tucking my head under his chin and holding me i had told him about what it was like to live with gramthe rundown house the constant struggle to keep enough food on the table the stream of drugbuying customers id explained about the morriesthe kids from the banished families who attended gypsum highand the meanness and poverty that defined their life in trashtown what i hadnt explained was where i fit into the high school how id never had a best friend or any real friends at all how id been mocked and ridiculed for my clothes my hair my rusty bike how the other kids had whispered about gram calling her a witch and worse i knew kaz wouldnt judge me for these things but i was afraid that if i returned i would lose the confidence that had come at a high price i was afraid that even though i knew i had changed on the outsidethe way i looked and dressedi would stop believing i had changed on the inside i dont want to go back i whispered against his soft shirt i know kaz said but you wont be alone kaz had told the truth the car was only a slight improvement over his rustedout civic it was a dented brown bonneville with a creased bumper the one splurge his friend had made was to upgrade the sound system with a set of good speakers the last time id made this drive traveling in the opposite direction was the first time i had ever left missouri now the hours passed more swiftly i was well rested and music filled the car we didnt talk much but occasionally kaz reached for my hand and gave it a squeeze whenever my thoughts turned to chub i forced myself to take deep breaths and remember only good things the way he laughed with his mouth wide open showing all his baby teeth the sound of his voice when he said my name the one word he sometimes pronounced the way he always had hayee i knew that kaz had to be desperately worried about leaving his mother in chicago but he didnt say anything about it when he caught me looking at him he smiled as though nothing was wrong but after wed been in the car a few hours his expression changed it was a subtle change at first a tightening of his jaw a clenching of his hands on the wheel i watched him carefully and saw that his skin had gone pale and a faint sheen of sweat stood out on his brow whats wrong nothing much its just he glanced at me his expression troubled im getting flashes little ones visions not a full vision not yet but i probably will when this happens its usually a sign of one coming a new one not the ones i already had not quadrillon or rattler this one is darker he winced and i could tell it hurt what do you see kaz shook his head nothing specific its that damn flicker the way i get just the pieces its water i think its all wavery and shimmering and therestheres somethingsomeone i said nothing it could be anything a sink an ocean a pan boiling on a stove the only thing i felt sure of was that it wouldnt be good are you okay to drive i asked prairie had begun teaching me to drive but so far id only got as far as lurching from one end of the apartmentcomplex parking lot to the other oh yeah ill be fine maybe why dont we get some lunch we stopped at a pizza hut outside springfield i wasnt hungry but i forced myself to eat one of the things id learned in recent months was that you could never count on your next meal or place to sleep when you were banished and on the run in the car again kaz seemed better the afternoon wore on clouds lazily drifting in and obscuring the april sun we drove around saint louis the skyline visible in the distance the arch beautiful against the darkening sky i knew that from saint louis it was another three and a half or four hours i passed the time by trying to remember all the good times id had with chub and then when that stopped working and my mind pitched and rolled with fears i couldnt contain i forced myself to think about math the subject id struggled with the most i imagined the textbook pages the numbers and equations running into each other taunting me i was so intent on keeping my mind occupied that when kaz cleared his throat i was startled see that he was even paler than before with one hand pressed to his forehead as though he was trying to keep the pain inside are you okay i demanded i think id better pull over sometimes i think i might be getting a bigger one once or twice ive he swallowed and blinked hard once i passed out but dont worry that wont happen yet i just need to get someplace where i can shut my eyes and rest a tall exxon sign lit up the darkening purple sky at the next exit a wendys and a long john silvers shared a parking lot with the gas station and the lot was nearly full with travelers stopping for dinner kaz bypassed the parking lot continuing down the road which narrowed as it wound into the farmland beyond in the distance the lights of a couple of houses winked on as the last of the suns glow faded from the horizon kaz drove until he found a farm lane with a gated cattle guard then pulled over and parked in the weeds im sorry he said i just need to be away from the lights hailey ill be okay really just give me ten minutes i nodded but already kaz had reclined his seat and covered his eyes with his hand i watched him breathe his chest rising and falling regularly i wasnt sure but his color seemed to be a little better already maybe if he just let the vision come maybe hed been suffering because hed been resisting it i knew the feeling when i had first felt the urge to healwhen a girl had got hurt in gym classit had been nearly impossible to resist as i waited to put my hands on the girls broken skull to say the ancient words an urgency that was almost painful overtook me but was it pain no it was just a wrongness a deep and unmet need that grew sharper and more demanding until i gave in to it maybe kazs visions were the same way i sat as still as i could and watched him five minutes turned into ten the time passing achingly slowly i wondered if he had fallen asleep and decided that might be for the best it grew harder to see him in the dark but i knew he was there next to me and that was good enough down the road the cars came and went from the parking lot hungry travelers weary families people trying to get to their next destination nothing sinister nothing out of the ordinary there was really no reason for the anxiety that had been gnawing away at me ever since wed left chicago a raw and seething layer underneath all my other fears kaz rested i waited rattler shifted almost imperceptibly on the wood shelf that served as a seat next to him derek startled caught napping derek was no good at waiting he had no patience rattler bit down hard on his disgust the banished blood was weak indeed in derek but he was all rattler had for now but the futureten years from now thered be new blood all around town young strong boys and girls with at least one fullblood parentand a few with two when rattler grew old his many children would make him proud and there would be grandchildren and greatgrandchildren all banished all strong and determined and they would live well here they would take their rightful place as the leaders of gypsum they would drive fancy cars and live in bigass houses and the biggest one of all would be the one he would build for him and prairie he and his prairie they would grow old together they would look out their front door and see what was theirs their land their town just like the village of their ancestors if something displeased prairie rattler would blast it skyhigh if someone made her unhappy he would remind them by force who was the leader of the banished who had returned them to their rightful glory no one would make prairie unhappy twice if they did rattler would make them taste their own blood as they died they would see they would all see so far they hadnt understood and maybe just maybe some of that was his fault he had failed with prairie once but she had been under the influence of that other one of mr chicago with his slick wayshe saw that now he hadnt seen that then when mr chicago had offered rattler money to turn prairie and hailey over but that was then and this was now rattler worked up a gobbet of spit and let fly narrowly missing dereks boot derek was wise enough not to say anything he just moved his foot out of the way the memory disgusted rattler mr chicago with his stack of hundreds peeling peeling peeling waiting for rattler to signal when it was enough well hed taken the mans moneywhy shouldnt hebut it was never enough it would never be enough and see what had happened to mr chicago who had thought he could buy rattler charred and dead burnt up in his own squalor a fitting end not that there was anything wrong with making a little money from the gifts no nothing wrong at all he needed cash he needed capital others had stepped up to take mr chicagos place and rattler had showed them hadnt he he had taught them a blood lesson they would not forget now they would respect him he would set a high price for their services his and haileys and prairies and he would bring the others the trashtown riffraff who possessed only a shadow of the gifts let them experiment on his lesser brethren let them play their games with the pissweak stock even as rattler was beginning to rebuild the clan he would be like a broker he would be the businessman hed always known he could be his sons would take up the yoke someday he would teach them train them and in his home prairie would raise the girls and they would be strong and beautiful like her it would be as it should be next to him derek cleared his throat we been out here shut up rattler said automatically drink rattler knew that derek had a flask in his pocket there was rarely a time when derek didnt have a flask in his pocket topped off with cheap whiskey that was okay though what he needed derek for didnt require quick reflexes rattler just needed an extra hand in case the boy gave him any trouble the boy was expendable rattler had armed himself with the ruger just in case but he hoped not to use it just put the boy on the road and send him back that was all that was called for but he needed the girl because the girl was the next step to prairie and she was his firstborn a healer like her mother so she was rightfully his as well she had to know it too otherwise why was she coming back here had to be scared seeing what shed seen he understood that a sheltered girl like her all she knew was the home her granny had made for her that retard boy theyd taken in the mongrel that ran in the yard her granny didnt let her talk to the morries and that was good and right the few times rattler had seen one of the morrie boys talk to her hed made sure it was the last time he might not have been the most involved father but a girl didnt need that anyway she needed a dad who looked out for her who knew what was right and what was wrong rattler did the right thing when it was important he kept the boys away he would make sure that when the time came it was a pureblood boy who came to call and no other she must have known that because where after everything that had happened to her was she coming to find safety back here to gypsum oh rattler didnt have any illusions that she was coming to him she had in mind to come see a girlfriend maybe a favorite teacher who knew with girls they were delicate things emotional things hell he thought ruefully rubbing the socket around his scarred eye they could be quick and unpredictable and a man had to be on his toes around them but now she was on her way back rattler had seen it with his blind and spinning eye that morning as hed lain in bed hed seen the car the girl the boy the exxon sign lit up in the sky above them derek took a dispirited swig from his tarnished flask and returned it to his pocket he didnt bother offering it to rattler everyone knew rattler didnt drink he never had even when they were kids rattler and derek and armand and the rest of them skipping class to smoke behind the elks lodge even then rattler knew drink was poison it was what had led so many of their fathers away from the banished drink made them lazy distracted them and then they married outside they sired their bastard broods and drank and did drugs and pissed away their pride and their birthright no more if they was comin theyd be here by now derek said a little more loudly disgust in his phlegmy voice the liquor gave him courage a cheap and deceptive kind of courage but one that had to be dealt with all the same true the man had let rattler take over the old house on his dead pappys land and rattler owed him for that maybe though a man whod live in his mothers trailer instead of cleaning up the mess his own father had left behind wasnt much of a man in rattlers book but rattler had taken something from derek and he would remember that when it came time for splitting up the spoils derek would be taken care of that was the future now was now rattler moved fast his hand shot out and seized dereks ear and twisted it and as derek squirmed and mewled like a puppy rattler twisted harder and forced dereks head around so he would have to look across the field to where night was etching a layer of purpleblack on the fading glow where earth met sky guess you dont know nothing rattler said softly as an old brown sedan pulled slowly off the road and came to rest a few feet shy of the cattle guard how could we have slept i woke with my head resting against the cold glass of the passenger window the night thick and black on the ground only kazs outline visible as he slept next to me i had been dreaming something awful something disturbing enough to wake me id been back in the locked room in the lab fire raging behind me the zombies rising from their chairs staring at me with their unblinking eyes their rotting impassive faces and coming at me their feet on the floor clacked and slapped a rhythmic sound as they came closer and closer and but the sound the clacking did not stop even though i was awake it was in my ear on the glass and i jerked away from it too late seeing that there was something someone out there silhouetted against the stardotted sky i grabbed kazs arm and yanked it hard trying to force his name from my lips but fear had stolen my voice what is it kaz woke instantly hailey whats going on outside i managed to croak and then i gasped because there was another figure on his side of the car this one thin and stooping then a brilliant beam of light shone in our faces blinding me open up it was a rasping gravel voice thick with the drawl of trashtown my fathers voice rattler i whispered clutching kazs arm harder as if to confirm the thought the tapping resumed gently now but the light shone pointedly on the barrel of a gun the thing rattler had been using to tap the glass and it was pointed at me come on now haileygirl rattler crooned almost a singsong come on outta there were goin for a drive he wont shoot me i said but he would shoot kaz without a second thought kaz knew it too because i could see him hesitating reaching for the keys dangling in the ignition trying to figure out whether he could get the car in motion before rattler took a shot the grinning figure on the other side leering through the window seemed to make up kazs mind slowly he took his hand off the keys rattler had known we were coming he and kaz both seers were plagued with visions of the things that stirred them most the things that they held dearest or that threatened the greatest harm that was how it always worked kaz had seen the quadrillon sign because chub was there rattler though cared most about prairie i lowered the window a crack shes not with us you know rattlers expression didnt so much change as drive over a speed bump for a flash of a second it was shot through with anguish and even worry something id never seen on his face before i know it he muttered now get out kaz reached for my hand and gave it a squeeze and then we both got out my mind raced looking for ways to fight back to escape but rattler seized my arm roughly and guided me toward kaz and the other man rattler was much stronger than me and the other man held a gun loosely at the small of kazs back as they headed for the road a car drove past in a blur of headlights and spun gravel the people inside probably didnt even see us walking along the ditch beside the road and even if someone stopped and inquired whether everything was all right i was sure rattler had a reply at the ready help wouldnt come in that form we walked toward the lights of the gas station and fastfood restaurants ahead not even a quarter of a mile away i shook my head in disgust as we came within fifty yards of the giant exxon sign choosing to stop here in the shadow of this sign was like sending rattler a postcard inviting him to come find us id made another rookie mistake i kept pretending that i could stay a step ahead of all the dangers that surrounded us and i kept failing first id led the generals men straight to us and now rattler i couldnt keep letting things like this happen i had to be sharper think faster at the edge of the long john silvers parking lot was a big old sedan sagging on its wheels and rattler and the other man led us to it in the parking lots bright lights i got a better look at the man and realized i knew him he had been one of grams regulars derek pollitt hed been one of the quieter ones never putting a hand on me or even joking with me and for that i was grateful he opened the passenger door for kaz and then got in the drivers seat rattler opened my door but before he released my arm he stood looking into my face it was the first good look id had of the eye id stabbed and it was a transfixing sight the skin below the eye was rimmed with a red ragged scar the eyeball was milky and pale and it seemed to spin as rattler stared at me but surely that was an illusion i looked away first and rattler laughed a harsh bonechilling sound aw dont be that way with your daddy he said you and me we got off on the wrong foot after all this time we both got a little makin up to do id say now im not going to hold this against you he pointed at his wrecked eye it was truerattler didnt look angry only slightly amused and somehow very much alive sparking with the manic energy id always associated with him you and me we got the same goal here he added as he pushed me gently into the car were gonna get your auntie back and then were gonna set out to restore the good family name i slammed the car door trying to shut out the sound of his laughter i knew where we were going after just a few miles when derek took a right at the fork in the road past sugar creek we were headed for his daddys land mostly poor clay soil that had yielded stingy crops of alfalfa and soybeans until mr pollitt died eight or nine years back everyone thought derek the pollitts only son would take over but instead he leased off what he could and let the rest go fallow and moved in with his mama at the far edge of trashtown dereks mama hailed from the banished his daddy did not mrs pollitt was long divorced from her husband and was at first more than happy to house and feed her only child and wash his clothes i guessed it had gotten old fast as derek never seemed to be able to hold on to a job more than a few weeks at a time next to me kaz gave me a reassuring smile and took my hand in his derek who was leaning over the seat keeping an eye on us guffawed aw check it out young love leave em alone rattler snapped at boys got pure blood in his veins which is a damn sight moren you can say i saw a look of hurt pass across dereks dull face but he shut up i hadnt realized that rattler knew kaz was banished but it made sense i was still getting used to the ability to sense other banished the curious magnetism that was like a stirring of the cells when they were near prairie had explained that it would become second nature before long kaz had said that for him it was like yet another layer of vision on top of the reality that everyone else saw and the pictures that occasionally flashed through his mind i closed my eyes and willed myself to be open to it and sure enough i got a faint sense from derek but the connection with rattler was almost overwhelming like an invisible thread binding our destinies it combined fear and familiarity with something else something inevitable and dark but also part of me for my first sixteen years i had believed that my father was dead as gram had wanted me to believe how many times had i wished for a father to rescue me from grams rundown house to protect me to cherish me and now bizarrely i had what i had wished for he wont hurt us i whispered to kaz we turned onto a weedchoked gravel drive leading into a hollow where the old pollitt farmhouse was tucked behind a stand of poplar trees home sweet home rattler announced but i was certain i saw derek flinch as he looked at the old boardframed house the sagging porch with its toppled flowerpots spilling dirt the padlock on the front door was brandnew gleaming in the beam of rattlers flashlight as derek fumbled in his pocket for the key inside there was a smell of decay overlaid with bleach rattler snapped on the lights and i saw that we were standing in a plain square parlor that contained only a couple of straightbacked chairs a threadbare sofa and a dusty braided rug near the door were half a dozen trash bags overflowing with junk someone had been cleaning preparing for our arrival no doubt this was meant to be our new home after you rattler said grandly but kaz didnt budge come on now boy dont be like that youn me were practically kin you bein fullblood and all kaz and i followed derek through the parlor and up the stairs he turned on the lights as he went none of the bulbs were very bright and the dim light added to the gloom of the place illuminating torn wallpaper worn carpets stained and cracked ceilings upstairs was a narrow hallway with a bathroom and three closed doors two of them bore shiny padlocks just like the one on the front door rattler stepped in front of us and opened the first one this was supposed to be your aunties room he said but you can use it till she gets here when he turned on the light i stopped short at a loss for words rattler had fixed the place up with care a prison for his beloved that hed filled with the things he thought she would like the bed was neatly made up with a faded quilt but there were extra pillows and laceedged sheets an embroidered runner had been draped on the little table next to the bed and a jar of flowers stood by a dish filled with small polished pebbles i had once had a collection like that in my own room stones that had been tumbled smooth from a thousand years in the bottom of sugar creek clothes were folded over an armchair pulled up to a wooden desk they were brightly colored things i knew prairie would never wear she favored dark plain shirts and pants gray and black and navy blue in the stack i saw fuchsia and pink and red and orange the colors of a summer flower bed a sadness stole through my heart surprising me had there been a day when rattler and prairie were children when these had been my aunts favorite colors as a little girl playing with the other banished kids had prairie ever been carefree had she and my mother picked flowers and chased dragonflies and splashed in the creek before things went bad before they started school and learned how much the townspeople hated trashtown before the other children refused to play with them had prairie once owned a pink dress had she worn it for the high school boyfriend who shed long ago lost i looked around the rest of the room the old furniture had been polished the floors scrubbed a stack of shiny new magazines lay on the little desk next to a photo in a silver frame i stepped closer in the frame was a photo of two kids around eleven or twelve years old a girl with dark hair almost down to her waist balanced on a rock in the middle of a creek a look of intense concentration on her face the bottom of her jeans wet a tall wiry boy leaned toward her from the edge of the photo almost out of the frame grinning and reaching for her all summertanned skin and white teeth and toolong hair pants too short and sleeves barely reaching his wrists a boy who was growing toward manhood as fast as he could who even then wanted nothing more in the world than he wanted that girl i swallowed hard and glanced at rattler and for the first time ever he refused to meet my eyes dont you wear her things now haileygirl he muttered derek go on in that other room and get whatall i bought the girl derek was back in moments with a stack of jeans and tshirts new and shiny with the price tags still attached which he laid on the bed without a word had to guess at your sizes rattler said and i aint got anything for you son but we can get that took care of i didnt guess id be hostin you here or i would have been prepared now come on we got a phone call to make i shouldnt have been surprised to see the setup on the kitchen tablerattlers cell phone was attached to a sleek compact speakerexcept the technology was so incongruous with the worn sparse old furnishings yallll be able to hear im just fine rattler promised and more important hell be able to hear you too i need a lil somethin before we start derek said and i noticed that his hands shook as he opened an old metal cabinet and took out a bottle he splashed liquor into a brown coffee mug and took a greedy drink hell you dont even need tbe here you dont want rattler said impatiently its my house derek protested half angry half forlorn rattler nodded and his lips curved in a slight smile that it is buddy he said softly while he waited for derek to cap the bottle and put it back when we were all sitting down rattler picked up the phone and thumbed a few keys instantly we heard the ringing as though it was right in the room almost immediately the call was picked up but after the click of the connection being made there was silence its me rattler said not bothering to mask his drawl your good friend rattler sikes and this had better be the man in charge or im hangin up i dont mean to speak to nobody else dont hang up a deep clipped voice said this is alistair prentiss speaking i am the man in charge as you say thank you for calling mr sikes well now it just seemed like the right thing to do after yall sent them folks to pay me a visit thother day prentiss coughed slightly and rattler caught my gaze and winked i felt a shiver of nerves run through my body id expected rattler to be furious given the way i had injured him the damage id done to his eye at best id expected him to trade me to prentiss to sell me for whatever he could get them to pay but hed treated me well enough since finding us pulled off the road i didnt trust him of course i figured hed go after kaz first maybe see what he could get for him a seer with a great deal of power before starting to negotiate for me about that prentiss said you do understand mr sikes that was only business rattler laughed a hearty rich laugh from deep in his chest you sent a couple guys to drag me out of my own home threatened to put me in the ground if i didnt go with em that all in a days work for you yes mr sikes in your case but it seems i underestimated you rattler had been sitting tipped back on an old kitchen chair but at prentisss words he slammed the chair down on the floor and laid his forearms flat on the table glaring at the speaker as though it had offended him hell yeah you did and your hired men paid the price that dont speak to a whole lot a balls you ask me indeed i wont make that mistake again rattler let the moment lie his thick black brows knit in fury slowly he relaxed getting control over his emotions across the table derek looked from rattler to the speaker and back mouth slightly open as he tried to keep up with the conversation so prentiss i got somethin i believe you want got the healer yall were trying so hard to get your hooks into little gal called hailey say hello hailey i pressed my lips together i didnt want to speak aw come on now sweetheart just say hello to the man nothin more he dont need to know any of your private stuff this is just business like he says rattlers expression stayed neutral as he spoke but he was staring at me intently and i knew exactly what he meant by private stufflike the fact that i was his daughter no one knew that besides prairie and anna and kaz its true i muttered my name is hailey tarbell there was no response from prentiss and i imagined him assimilating this new information in my minds eye he was a large man only slightly diminished by age broad shouldered and muscular wearing an immaculate uniform with medals on his chest ms tarbell he said after a long pause it is an honor to make your acquaintance acquaintancei bristled at the word he made it sound as though we had met at a party in a fancy restaurant as though we were shaking hands when he had been behind a plan to imprison me to force me to create zombies i remembered how prairies eyes used to waver with fear whenever she mentioned the general she was even more terrified of him than she was of bryce now prentiss ive got one other person here might be of interest to you rattler continued young mans a fullblood well that is good news prentiss said smoothly i am assuming you refer to kazimierz sawicki i have already had the pleasure of making mr sawickis acquaintance though only over the phone i do look forward to meeting him in person if rattler was surprised he covered it well youll meet him ifn when i say so as you and i have discussed in the past i am sure we can work out a mutually beneficial arrangement wherein you provide subcontractors for a generous finders fee yeah for your research studies rattler said sarcastically aw now dont go gittin ahead of yourself boys doin just fine here for now im sure you realize that my terms are up for a major renegotiation my people are worth a hell of a lot more to you than the few thousand bucks you threw my way last time i mean to make sure you appreciate that fact before we do business again mmm prentiss said i do agree that these are precious resources of course mr sikes and we do intend to compensate themand youappropriately now hang on a minute rattler said his voice going deadly the manic fury that always swirled underneath the surface threatened to emerge he sat up straight and gripped the edge of the table in one strong hand i dont think youre in a position to be callin the shots here oh did i forget to mentionim sorry mr sikes theres one additional piece of information that may make you a bit more amenable to my proposal his voice was cold almost bored you see a little earlier today several of my associates stumbled onto an unexpected opportunity to bring a person of interest into our little family and were delighted to have her of course what are you saying rattler demanded the color draining from his face he knew even before prentiss answered weve got prairie tarbell the nightshirt rattler had bought me was too big and it flapped around my knees while i got ready for bed rattler had at least let me use the bathroom by myself waiting outside in the hall with his chin ducked down almost like he was embarrassed to be there i took my time brushing my teeth i needed to think and i wasnt looking forward to being locked into my room for the night come on now haileygirl rattlers rough voice growled through the door dont be takin all night big doings tomorrow i knew he hadnt thought of anything else since prentiss had told him they had prairie neither had i hearing prentisss cold arrogant voice on the phone only deepened my horror that i had led him to her and chub still i hoped rattlers obsessing might make him careless i wasnt about to tell him anything about her capture i guessed he was waiting for a vision to give him direction and i didnt plan on helping i splashed water on my face and blotted it dry with the thick soft towel rattler had given me then opened the door rattler grunted and led me back to the room hed prepared for prairie he pointed to the bed see you dont muss it up now it aint meant for you after he locked me in i slid under the blankets the floral sheets were clearly expensive soft and silky the pillowcase was embroidered and edged with lace everything was too frilly for meflowers and lace and pastelsbut i could imagine rattler choosing the finest things he could find storing them up for the day he brought prairie home i lay in the bed unable to sleep thoughts of chub and prairie and anna circled through my mind my fears alternating with schemes and plans i abandoned one after another finally i got out of bed and snapped on the delicate lamp that sat on the bedside table i went to the wall that joined my room with kazs and tapped gently putting my mouth close to the plaster kaz i said in a low voice can you hear me in a few moments there was an answering knock and then the murmur of his voicetoo low for me to make out his words i didnt dare speak any more loudly rattler and derek were downstairs and while i guessed that derek might keep drinking until he passed out i knew rattler never drank i looked around the room wondering if there was anything i could use to cut into the wall maybe make a small hole behind a picture or under a flap of wallpaper but there was nothing still i felt better knowing that kaz was close by i got the pillow and comforter from the bed lay down on the floor next to the wall and knocked one more time to let him know i was near after that i was asleep in moments rattlers voice woke me what the hell are you doing down there i sat up slowly rubbing sleep from my eyes it took me a moment to remember what i was doing on the floor as i stared at a pair of wellused black work boots i scrambled to my feet drawing the comforter around me like a robe rattler beckoned impatiently come on down here i got something to tell you i had to beg him for a few minutes in the bathroom and i could hear him tapping his foot on the floor the entire time if id had any illusions that his attitude toward me was softening they were laid to rest when he made a point of showing me the handle of his gun above his belt git on now kaz sat at the table with derek eating a bowl of cereal with a banana sliced on top a tall glass of orange juice and a cup of coffee sat next to his bowl in front of derek were a bottle of aspirin and a glass of water though he sat up a little straighter when we came into the room hailey kaz said and pushed back his chair i wished i could touch him hug him but rattler got there first and shoved kaz back into the chair as though he was a child rather than a twohundredpound man kaz was strong but rattler was too sit back down boy he growled are you all right kaz asked never taking his eyes off me i nodded and kaz slowly pulled his chair back up to the table derek git er something to eat tell her to git it herself i aint get up pollitt rattler ordered as he took a seat and motioned to me to do the same get off your lazy ass and earn your keep derek reluctantly got up clutching his temple and shaking his head i dont see why she caint why they both caint fix their own breakfast theyre both you leave the thinking to me rattler said cutting him off dont tax yourself seein as you probably kilt a few thousand more brain cells last night derek refused to look at rattler while he got up and stumbled to the counter where he got another bowl and poured cereal and milk into it muttering to himself rattler waited until the bowl was set down in front of me then rested his elbows on the table and looked from me to kaz and back narrowing his eyes shrewdly you seen anything new boy he asked id been wondering the same thing but i prayed kaz would keep it to himself if he had but rattler didnt wait for an answer cause i just had me a nice little view of haileys aunt also a couple a guys gonna wish theyd never laid a finger on her time were through my heart skipped did they hurt her rattlers expression tightened with fury his black eyebrows knitting together his lip curling and his jaw going tight no not yet and they aint gonna get the chance did you see where she was kaz asked hotel room rattler said chicago i could see the skyscrapers out of the window up on a high floor got her locked up like a damn bird in a cage his fury was even stronger than before i thought i knew why a hotel room with a view like that would be expensivefar more luxurious than anything he could provide for her the ironythat he wanted to imprison her just as prentisss men had that only the location was differentseemed to escape him do you know which hotel i asked not yet he muttered but i will what are you going to do if you find her kaz demanded not if boywhen rattler snapped im gonna bring her here where shes meant to be were going to be a family me her my daughter he hooked a thumb at me his words giving me a chill aw dont look at me that way girl he added noting my reaction gonna have sisters before long youre gonna help raise em up a whole mess a healers im gonna make things right around here put things back the way theyre supposed to be no more giving away our destiny our bloodline how are you going to do that kaz demanded round up banished women and lock them up here youre gonna run out of room pretty quick the blow that sent kaz crashing onto the floor came so fast that i didnt even see it but suddenly rattler was standing over kaz with a boot on his chest dont you sass me again boy he spit and i realized that even without the gun he held in his hand he was more than a match for kaz there was something almost inhuman about his coiled energy his sheer power kaz was strong his body tuned and hardened by lacrosse but he was not a fighter and in a match with rattler he would lose it aint your place to question me boy rattler continued in a voice that was eerily soft i run this house i will lead the banished i know where the blood runs strongest and i what about me derek demanded in a whining voice his skin was pale and clammy and there were purple bags under his eyes you promised me a woman you promised yeah right rattler said smoothly his expression flattening out as he turned to derek i realized that derek had to be really stupid not to know he was being lied to to me it was obvious but then again i was the mans daughter there was more to the blood than i wanted to acknowledge rattler would never be my dad but in fathering me he had passed on more than pure banished blood i was able to read him sense his moods youll have your pick derek any woman you want i better derek mumbled taking a drink of his water some of it dribbling down his chin i just better rattler took his boot off kaz and offered him a hand which kaz refused as kaz got to his feet rattler shrugged there may be a place for you son once you realize im your best shot here hailey stays with me you work with me maybe you can stay too he turned away so he didnt see the look kaz gave him but i did and kazs silent fury mirrored my own feelings rattler was strong and he was smart but we would find a way to be stronger and smarter after rattler left his old truck spinning gravel as he peeled out onto the road derek got more and more agitated i suspected that it was because he wasnt drinking as much as i knew he wanted to he was too afraid of rattler who had made him promise to watch us around the clock and keep us out of trouble ought to just lock yall up in them rooms upstairs derek muttered several times the minutes ticked by i had found a stack of old time magazines in a drawer and kaz and i tried to read them while derek played with the change from his pockets pushing the coins into patterns on the table i thought id go crazy from boredom but i didnt want to provoke derek into following through with his threat at least i had kaz for company as long as he let us remain downstairs a little before noon there was a knock at the front door what was that derek said his hands shaking with nervous energy as he set his coffee cup down harder than necessary bitter brew sloshing onto the table i could see the front door of the rundown house from the kitchen staring through the gloomy dusty sitting room i thought i could see it tremble on its hinges as the sound came again a methodical rhythmic pounding we dont got to answer that derek said he swallowed hard pushing his chair back from the table and brushing at his lap we wait a bit why theyll leave like as not whoever that is mr pollitt i said in a low voice if someones come all the way out here odds are they arent going to give up just because we dont answer the door this house your familys home its been uh empty for a while now and im guessing everyone knows it lets say they saw us drive in maybe theyre worried about a breakin or something being a good neighbor and checking it out if you dont talk to them theyre going to make some calls trust me on this theyre not going to let it lie no matter who was therea neighbor a traveling salesman someone from the phone companythere was a chance it could turn into an opportunity for escape as long as derek didnt panic and do something crazy the farm road was thinly populated and even a little extra trafficrattlers and dereks driving back and forth to town as they stocked and outfitted the housemight easily have been noticed i wondered how rattler could have expected any differentpeople in gypsum knew everything about each otherbut then i realized that he just didnt care he meant to keep me and prairie here under lock and key as long as necessary but he was banking on it not taking all that long on our staying willingly soon enough despite everythingdespite prairie rejecting rattler over and over when they were children despite her leaving town with no intention of ever returning despite his having brutalized her sister and fathered me even despite my having tried to kill himhe had faith in his vision of us as a family a family that would swell with more children and grow to include any banished he deemed worthythose whose blood was pure the rest would be relegated to the grunt work like derek rattlers belief in his vision gave him power and his power terrified me we would need every advantage we could find to fight him haileys right kaz told derek do you want me to get the door stay there boy he ordered kaz i guess this is still my damn house ill answer my own goddamn door with his hand on the knob he turned and glared at us yall keep quiet and ease on back where they caint see you we complied flattening ourselves against the kitchen wall out of sight of the front door kaz stood close behind me his warm breath on my neck as soon as derek turned his back i peeked around the corner i wondered if i should scream when derek opened the door yell that we were being held hostage but derek had his gun in his hand and i didnt doubt hed use iton the visitor if not on us he opened the door and i could see a tall figure standing in the bright morning sun but i couldnt make out his features in the blinding light yeah derek said i help you with somethin so it wasnt someone he knew a neighbor or someone from town my dread grew as i wondered if prentiss could have found us already if even now a team was circling the house covering all the escape routes but the visitor said nothing he didnt appear to have a weapon his hands hung loose at his sides after a moment he took a step crossing the threshold and stopping inches from derek hey what the holy shit derek yelped and suddenly he stumbled backward scrabbling to aim his gun at the intruder dont you come any closer but the man took another step out of the pool of sunlight and into the cool dimness of the house and as my eyes adjusted i saw that something was terribly wrong ill shoot ill shoot you derek said but his hand was shaking badly and he was practically tripping over himself trying to get away from the man that was when the smell reached us it was the sicklysweet smell of dying flesh of infectionracked tissue losing its battle with rot and gangrene bile rose in my throat and i thought for a moment that i would throw up on the kitchen floor but kaz tightened his hand around my arm is that he said but then a shot rang out and derek staggered backward and the man stopped coming and wobbled on his feet a new hole in his soiled white buttondown shirt derek had shot the thing the thing that prentiss had sent here the thing that had once been a man but was now just a body and not a fresh body by the looks of it once before i had seen the undead closeup when i had accidentally stumbled into their storage room next to the lab the fire was raging by then burning down the entire building but the zombies sat motionless in their chairs until they saw me and then they stood up and came for me they cared about nothing else they had been told to kill and that was all they meant to do i fought them with everything i had but it was a losing battle until kaz found me and threw himself into the struggle and together we pushed and shoved and kicked and bitoh god yes i even sank my teeth into their dead cold fleshand we managed to lock them in there finally to die completely to burn and burn until only piles of bones remained as i stood frozen staring in shock i realized something that had escaped me in the lab i would never be able to look at one of these creatures and forget what they had once been this one had been a man a young man with a full head of longish hair that was bleached at the tips his hair still looked normal like it might have once been something he was proud of but the rest of him was ruined when the dying are healed they do not live forever in the undead state what remains rots and disintegrates though more slowly than ordinary dead flesh this man had been notdead for a while long enough that his skin had started to crack and peel in some places in others it was swollen and black and oozing literally rotting away his eye sockets sagged his unseeing eyeballs a sickly yellow and his mouth hung open his lips shrunk back against his gray teeth so it looked as though he was leering at me except heitdidnt look at me at all once it regained its balance it took another clumsy step forward toward the center of the house ignoring derek who was trying to aim again gibbering with fear dont you eveni shot you damn itstop right there he still hadnt figured it out he managed to steady his aim and shot the intruder again hitting it this time in the gut blowing a hole that left the fabric of its shirt ragged and flapping but this time it barely bothered to register the blow instead swiveling and heading toward derek i tried to scream but somehow the sound got stuck in my throat i had to warn derek tell him he was no match for the killing machine that had been cobbled together from the ruins of a human but as i struggled to form the word no kaz dragged me backward his powerful arms circling me from behind my feet sliding across the old scarred wood floors he was saying something yelling into my ear but i couldnt make it out over dereks screams as the thing wrapped its blistered peeling hands around his neck and started to squeeze derek fought hard for a man whod already given so much of his life over to alcohol and despair i watched him struggle flailing at the things hands trying in vain to kick at its legs right until the end derek gave his all but finally he sagged backward his head lolling to the side and the thing let him drop to the floor the formless bag of bones that had been derek coming to rest in an awkward pose next to a spindly side table a scream filled the air and when the thing took two more steps into the foyer i realized that the sound was coming from me but i couldnt stop as the zombie shuffled toward the center of the house i saw what was strapped around its waist half a dozen cylinders taped in place a cord leading to one of its hands bombs and then i understood prentiss had somehow found this placethis humble house in which rattler planned to begin building his empireand he meant to burn it to the ground it made a crazy kind of sense prentiss couldnt compete with rattlers powers his visions his ability to summon and manipulate the banished he couldnt force rattler to work for him or to provide fodder for his experiments hed already tried to recruit him offered rattler money to bring the banished to him when that hadnt worked hed sent a team to capture rattler at his house only rattler had a vision that they were coming he lay in wait sly and strong and quickwitted for prentisss menand then he killed them all so prentiss had switched tactics somehow he knew that rattler was hiding out in dereks fathers house so he sent in one of his zombies to blow it up he expected rattler to see it coming but he knew that rattler couldnt stay on the run forever he expected rattler to slip up eventually and when that day came prentiss would be there to capture him and force him to do his work but prentiss didnt know everything about the visions they couldnt be predicted or controlled they showed danger and destruction and pain and loss before it happened but rattler didnt care about the shack and he didnt care about derek not really and more important his mind his entire being was focused on prairie right now any visions rattler had would be of her kaz was trying to drag me toward the back door my feet slipping along the splintered wood but when i understood what was going to happen next i grabbed his hand and ran i glanced back once to see the thing that had been a boy with surfer hair stop and hold the cord up in front of him his eyes unfocused and uncaring his grotesque face indifferent and then kaz threw open the screen door and pushed me out into the bright morning and i stumbled on the leaning steps and kaz was dragging me across a weedy yard with a clothesline strung between a tree and a shed that was missing a door and the last thing i noticed as he threw me to the ground next to the shed was the sweet smell of soil and mold and a pile of flowerpots mounded in the shade and then the world exploded the flash came first a whiteyellow blink followed a second later by a boom that shook the earth and blasted through my skull i felt kaz frantically trying to cover me with his body but i pushed him off twisting to see the little house burst shingles flying and foundations splintering a cloud of yellow flame blooming from within a piece of window sash sailed into the yard and crashed inches from where we lay its jagged edge impaling a fat hosta plant glass splintered from the window and rained down along with charred and smoking debris my head echoed with the force of the blast and though i could see kazs lips moving as he screamed at me all i could hear was a dull roar i let him pull me to my feet and only when i stood did i notice that he was bleeding bright pulsing blood was literally pouring from his forehead and he stumbled never letting go of my hand and touched his skull his fingers coming away glistening red he swayed and i tried to catch him in my arms but he staggered backward and we both fell into the shadow of the shed coming down hard on the packed dirt his wounded head bouncing on the grass kaz i screamed as his eyes fluttered and rolled up in their sockets i could hear my own voice but it was as though it was coming from a distance as though someone else was screaming as i ran my fingers lightly along the jagged tear in kazs skull and felt broken shards of bone no no this couldnt be happening not to kaz my knee pressed into something sharp and i realized that debris thrown from the explosion had hit the garden pots and cracked them into dozens of sharpedged pieces whether it was a piece of pot or something from the house that had struck kaz didnt matter now i felt my heart seize with fear and shock but i forced myself to brush kazs hair out of the way and gently check his wound the urge to heal grew within me a longing so powerful it was as if my body itself transformed from flesh into pure need the words filled my brain an ageless whispering chant and they were on my lips and i had to clamp my mouth shut biting my tongue to stop myself from saying them my fingers thrummed with the electric desire to touch kaz as a healer to knit together his broken skull his torn flesh to still the blood flow and repair the tissues but i couldnt let myself not yet not until i knew if kaz was too far gone because if i healed him after the life left his body he would not come back as the boy i loved he would become just like the thing in the house the thing that had come on an errand of destruction and now was torn to bits by the blast shreds of bone and skin whose soul had long since left if kaz passed on before i tried to heal him i would create a zombie kaz kaz i screamed can you hear me for long seconds he lay motionless his eyes unseeing my soul shattered with grief at the thought of losing him of losing the one person besides prairie who really saw me when he looked at me who understood who i was and loved me anyway i felt my eyes fill with tears hot and stinging and as i blinked one fell on his forehead and trailed into his blood and mixed with it where it had fallen the ragged torn skin blurred and skimmed over even my tears were a healers i seized kazs hands and squeezed them you have to show me now i said choking back my sobs if youre alive you have to show me i cant i cant but he said nothing at all and i couldnt feel his pulse couldnt find the thread of his life and the unfairness of it nearly cleaved me in two id come so far only to lose everything chub had been stolen from the streets where wed finally thought he was safe prairie had been taken too and now kaz lay broken on the hardpacked earth of the miserable town id fought so hard to leave i couldnt escape them all on my own rattler and prentiss and his men i needed kaz together we were more than a couple of scared kids together our history and our gifts made us strong i lowered my face to kazs and kissed his bloodied forehead his parted lips and he stirred just a little a tremor a twitchbut i knew he was still there hailey he breathed licking his cracked lips his eyes flickered and the life came back to them and he sought me with his gaze i felt him squeeze my hands in return is there anyone its just me and you kaz i said i didnt want to upset him further but i knew he needed the truth derek couldnt have survived that he shook his head with effort no i mean anyone out front but i had seen enough now that i knew that kaz still lived i gave myself over to the powerful pull of my gift i let my eyes drift shut and touched my fingertips very gently to the edges of kazs wound feeling him wince in pain the voices in my head swelled and rushed through in a current of nearmelodic phrases and i spoke the words murmuring softly while the gift gathered strength and my hands moved of their own volition under my fingertips i felt the flesh knitting the shattered skull fragments melding together heat and energy and power were all focused into the touch as i chanted the ancient words the energy flowed from within me to him take what you need of me i willed the forces at work on his wounds use me use me up i had healed kaz once before when fire and bullets had threatened to take him from me then my gift was new and i was unsure and afraid but each time i healed my touch grew more assured and the words came more easily to my lips when the last broken bits of his skull had smoothed back together when i felt only his sweet regular breath against my wrists i laid my head on his chest and rested feeling the reassuring rise and fall and slowly my other senses returned first i noticed the smell a horrible combination of char and chemicals and smoke i blinked several times my vision momentarily blurry as it always was after a healing but as it cleared i made out the house behind the wall of flame and smoke pouring from its center the trees that lined the drive were unharmed their branches waving in the billowing smoke on the ground a few feet away lay a shred of flowered fabric that i recognized as part of the curtains that had hung in the kitchen farther away were broken dishes the face of a clock half a splintered chair all spread out as though a giant had sprinkled the ruins of the house from his hand my hearing was returning quickly healers were stronger than other people we never got sick and though we couldnt heal each other wounds that would kill ordinary people were nothing to us i was grateful for my strength and resilience now though i had healed kaz i knew we would both need our strength for what lay ahead we needed to get away from here before prentiss sent someone to make sure his zombie had carried out its task wed been dealt an incredible stroke of luck in that no one had seen rattler bring us here last evening darkness had surely helped but we couldnt count on that luck lasting i felt kaz tense up his muscles going rigid my heartbeat quickened with fear what is it are you all right but before he could speak something pressed into the small of my back stand up slowly hands where i can see them a hard clipped voice said you first hailey i didnt know the voice but i knew that we were in big trouble chub put down his book the glasses lady was talking to the lunch man the lunch was on the plate with the green cover just like before chub didnt know what it was even though the glasses lady asked him could he guess he said macaroni but it smelled like chicken dinosaurs hailey made him chicken dinosaurs sometimes and he liked them and he didnt like anything here he didnt like it here and he was scared a lot and he didnt like to go to the bathroom in this bathroom he didnt like it here but now he had a mindpicture and he put down his book if the glasses lady knew she would make him say but chub didnt want to say it was the monster man and they were making the monster man play the bad games too not the same games because there was no hiding thing and the glasses lady wasnt there chub couldnt see who was there but someone was making the monster man play a game with numbers there were numbers chub couldnt see the numbers but he knew there were numbers at school miss kathy said to count and chub could count a lot one two three four five six and more and more numbers sometimes you could put the numbers on the magnet board and sometimes you wrote the numbers on a pad and the monster man had numbers too and he was hiding them inside his head chub knew about that sometimes he hid things in his head for a long time he hid his words there and nobody knew they werent a secret they just didnt come out then hailey helped him let the words out of his head and that was good but sometimes he still liked to hide things there sometimes it was for fun and sometimes he just didnt want to tell the monster man didnt want to tell before but now he wanted to tell the numbers the mindpicture went wavy and then it was gone and then it was back and chub went by the bookshelf so the glasses lady didnt see him watching the picture they were doing something with the lunch he put his book on the shelf and took another book down and put it on the floor the monster man kept the numbers in his head but now he was telling the numbers it wasnt a game no not a game he wanted to tell the numbers because it could help someone the monster man was a helper he was so scary before but now chub saw he wasnt as scary his face wasnt a monster face now someone had fixed his face he didnt hurt as bad he wanted to be a helper helping was good but chub wasnt going to tell the glasses lady helping was good but she didnt know that they covered our faces with loose black fabric hoods but that didnt matter i knew exactly where we were going gypsum wasnt that large not even when you included all the farms that circled the edges of town the fields full of earlyseason soybeans and alfalfa and corn the grazing acreage and the rich land along the creek growing up here for sixteen years with no friends and no brothers or sisters no mother or father to entertain me i had explored every inch of town on foot and occasionally on a brokendown bike id found abandoned at the dump all my exploring had been cut short when chub had arrived then id begun living for him and our exploring was limited to the fields and forest around our house paths and secret hideouts known only to me places where a little boy could walk and play but i still carried the map of gypsum in my mind and as the car navigated the gravel drive and then the pavement of the roads leaving the smoking ruin of the house and dereks body for the fire team whose sirens we heard in the background i knew exactly where we were they were smart our captorsa pair of men so like the ones whod first come after me and prairie a few months earlier that it was almost funny rentathug i thought but who knew how many more of these guys prentiss had on standby if anything this team was even better trained than the first one maybe prentiss had stepped up his demands after the first team was killed in grams home when they tried to kidnap us mustache as id nicknamed the one whod pressed his boot into my back was tall and darkskinned and seemed to be in charge he gave us short clipped orders as his partner who had a shaved head a freckled red face and a tattoo around his arm cuffed our hands behind us and forced us into the back of the car as we rode i leaned against kaz his chin resting on the top of my head and traced our path in my mind they took the first turn on a dirt road that looped around the back of a drainage pond and crossed a brackish swale before heading through a mile or so of newplanted fields and coming out on state road by then i could hear sirens in the distance the smoke cloud above the pollitt land could probably be seen all over gypsum soon neighbors would head over to see what had happened it was more excitement than gypsum usually saw in a month and half the town was likely to show up along with the entire sheriffs department and the fire crew from casey meanwhile the sedan turned down hidden drives and doubled back and looped and only by concentrating hard did i follow its patheven though id known from the start that it would eventually make its way to the abandoned business park by the time it hit the last stretch i could no longer hear the sirens we parked and when my door was opened all i heard was the buzzing of a few crickets we were led up a walk and i stumbled once or twice not being able to see the ground in front of me a whoosh of an electric door opening was followed by a blast of cool air we took a walk down a long hallway and then we were guided through one last door and our hoods were taken off we were in a conference room its long narrow table and the dozen chairs around it looking brandnew the whiteboard pristine the projection system humming softly above us at the head of the table was a tall broadshouldered man in his sixties he had a neatly trimmed beard and a buzz cut and he gave us a tight smile welcome prentissthe man whose voice wed heard on the phone wheres chub i demanded he held up a hand and chuckled slow down young lady youve barely arrived why dont you get comfortable ill have some sodas brought in surely you would like to refresh yourselves after your unfortunate adventure he gestured at my scratched arms and filthy ruined shirt at kazs disheveled hair and the faded bruises and cuts that remained after the healing i know exactly where we are you know i said furiously you could have had those guys drive me around for hours and id still know we were in the business park i mean its not like theres anywhere else in town thats got this kind of money poured into it ah that prentiss said inclining his head in a parody of an apology procedure i am afraid youll learn hailey and kaz my young friends that discipline is at the heart of every successful venture procedure chain of command what branch of the services did you come from kaz demanded was it even ours prentiss scrutinized kaz one eyebrow raised youre questioning my patriotism young man he said softly kaz glared silently and prentiss made a show of pretending to remember something snapping his fingers in the air oh dear i forgotyou lost your father in the gulf war a brave man tanek sawicki he was proud of his citizenship kaz was he not proud of fighting in the army of his adopted nation kaz said nothing but i could sense his fury escalating i reached for his hand and held it tightly until i felt him respond his grip relaxing slightly i needed him to be focused to remember why we were herenot to avenge his fathers death but to rescue his mother and chub only a look of fake sorrow passed over prentisss features there is more to the story i am afraid details of his last engagement that were classified have you wondered what really happened that day kaz kaz did not speak he just held my hand more tightly as i thought kaz i was during that chapter of our nations history close to shall we say the heart of the intelligence community i had access to information that was never made public i could tell me you bastard kaz hissed if you know anything about my father tell me no i whispered i knew what prentiss was doingtrying to draw kazs focus away to break him down to weaken our bond to turn him against the government so that he would agree to participate in the research a seer like kazhe would be of great value to them wait a minute a seer like kaz prentiss had been there with access to classified information about the troops stationed in iraq you knew i said accusingly you knew his father was a seer ah hailey you impress me again prentiss said clapping his hands in delight there was an experimental psychic viewing program that was begun back in when we first found evidence of psychic prodigies among the new recruits kaz your father was far more gifted than any subject before or since when word of his abilities reached me i immediately called for his transfer to a more stable location where he could enter our program safely but he waved his hands impatiently paperwork red tape bureaucracy in the end i was not able to transfer him soon enough not before that terrible day in al busayyah your father did not have to die there in the dirt it was if you care to know the last straw in my frustration with working from within the reason i decided to go independent you might say i glanced at kaz his features were frozen in hatred grief would come later i suspected when he was alone if prentiss thought he could sway kaz with this story he was mistaken prentiss might have tried to save his father as he claimed but it was only so prentiss could use him and we both knew it now we have an opportunity to work together kaz prentiss pressed on you can save the lives of american soldiers like your father well begin with a few simple tests get to know one another so to speak before we begin exploring your marvelous gift and then ill share what i know as two colleagues might because that is what i want you to see me as kaz your colleague your comrade with a shared goal not to mention the promise of handsome rewards so now youre bribing him i demanded enraged are you insane why would he ever agree to help you prentiss frowned at me eyes narrowed the good humor disappeared from his expression you would do well to remember that we also have jacob oh excuse me chub as you know him his words chilled me what do you mean jacob alan turlock born at home rushed to casey general hospital to deal with complications at birth fetal alcohol syndrome and but you dont want to hear the whole list now do you hailey they knew everything they knew where chub had come from they knew things about him that i had never known and i realized that it wasnt only kaz who was under their thumb prentiss had me as i thought he said softly he signaled to the men whod brought us here we have so much to talk about why dont you two freshen up change into clean clothes have something to eat and then we will talk again i have nothing to say to you kaz said he shook off the guards hand as he stood oh i very much doubt that prentiss said mildly i foresee many interesting conversations ahead for the three of us i have nothing to say to you either i said is that so prentiss gave me his full attention drilling me with his cold stare his eyes were slightly bulging and watery there are carrots and sticks my young friends i am a civilized man a peaceful man at heart a merchant i would far prefer to employ carrots rewards we can do smart business together and you will be handsomely compensated you can have a rich and rewarding future with us or you can fight me but then i will use a stick and trust me on this those who have felt the force of my stick wish they had never challenged me prentiss was prepared to be more than generous with the carrots if the accommodations he provided for me were any indication the room i was led to had a broad window overlooking the fields rolling away to the east far in the distance i could see a stand of black willows lining the bend in sugar creek a mile or so after that the creek took a turn to the south and joined up with beaver creek and eventually flowed into the lake of the ozarks i had never been to the lake of the ozarks kids at school were always talking about family trips to the campsites and motels that lined the hundreds of miles of shoreline they talked about days spent lying on the beaches with their truckedin sand and weedy bottoms paddling canoes and going to waterslides and eating barbecue there were waterskiing and wakeboarding sunburns and mosquitoes and car stereos playing loud and i had never experienced any of it i took a hot shower and dried off with a fluffy towel then dressed in the clothes that had been left for me they were plainblack pants and a black silky tshirtbut the quality was very fine and the fit was almost perfect i dried my hair and treated my cuts with antibiotic ointment i found in the medicine cabinet i looked through the cosmetics that stocked the shelves wondering who had chosen themprobably some junior member of prentisss staff a woman selected because she was young herself or because she had a daughter my age for a moment i felt myself softening and then i realized i had to steel myself against everyone here i couldnt afford to forget for a minute that they had kidnapped prairie and chub that they meant to put us to work making zombies i slammed the medicine cabinet leaving the cosmetics untouched then there was nothing to do but wait the sun was high in the sky a weak sun filtered by filmy clouds that signaled rain later in the day far off in a field of corn i saw someone making his way down the rows with a ground sprayer but he was too far away for me to see his features by now the local farmers must have noticed the activity at the office park no matter how careful prentiss was he couldnt hide the deliveries of all the equipment and supplies or the staff arriving from around the country possibly even around the world the best in their fields the ones who could be swayed by salaries far above what they could earn in the public sector orfor those who valued their work above moneywho would do anything for a chance to work on the cutting edge but how hard would it be to convince the people of gypsum that the activity at the park was innocent no one would scrutinize the details too closely if money was coming into the community if prentiss was smart hed seed the town with payouts for everyone sign up for food delivery from the local distributors hire landscapers laundry service waste serviceall the while posing as some company that manufactured computer components or medical supplies he could pay off a few inspectors so they wouldnt look too closely at the research labs and paint a few trucks with fake logos and as long as the money kept flowing no one would ask questions sometime down the line people would start to wonder why there were no jobs for locals why no one ever saw the inner workings of the facilitybut prentiss was probably betting that by then he would have everything he needed and he could exit the town as stealthily as he had arrived his reason for locating here was to be close to the seer population but maybe he thought he could win them over with his endless cash resources and he was probably right once the banished men got used to a steady paycheck they would probably be just as willing to relocate for prentiss as the rest of his staff was there was a knock at the door and after a moments hesitation i opened it standing in the doorway was a woman i hadnt seen before she was around forty thin with brown hair pulled back in a severe ponytail she wore a pressed white lab coat glasses a slash of red lipstick and a smile that looked like she had to work at it im dr grace its nice to meet you hailey i ignored the hand she held out for me to shake wheres chub where are you keeping him her smile faltered and she withdrew her hand i should tell you that there are security cameras throughout the building we are being observed and if you do anything to threaten my safety armed personnel will be here in a matter of seconds good to know i said sarcastically i guess i wont use my vulcan death grip on you then she didnt speak as she led me down the hall i looked at every door we passed hoping to catch a glimpse of chub but they were all closed it smelled like new construction and fresh paint and i guessed this wing had been turned into a residence for the staff including the reluctant ones like me and kazthe ones who had to be locked in we descended a set of stairs below ground level to a cafeteria the smell of cooking made my stomach growl and i realized i hadnt eaten since breakfast a dozen people lined up with trays and others sat at tables in pairs and small groups eating and talking i couldnt help being impressed that theyd gotten all this up and running so quickly an entire selfsustained community within the office park there was no reason for any of the staff to venture outside the buildings trucking in the food and supplies had to cost a fortune but money didnt appear to be a concern to prentiss well be in the private dining room dr grace said and pushed open a glass door to a bright and sunny room the long table in the center was laid with white linens fresh flowers and china prentiss and kaz were already seated at one end along with a man dressed like dr grace prentiss stood when we entered followed quickly by the other man reluctantly kaz stood too i could tell he was battling between good manners and not wanting to give prentiss the satisfaction of complying with him once we were inside i saw that there was one more person in the room the guard from earlier the tall one with the mustache stood by the door his expression impassive lunch will be brought in shortly prentiss said as dr grace and i took our seats i hear theres fresh catfish today they do it very well here with a light breading and a lemon sauce im sure youll love it and if you dont they are happy to accommodate special requests cut to the chase kaz said you said youd tell me when hailey got here what do we have to do to see chub prentisss expression turned thoughtful im afraid he is on a slightly different meal schedule at the moment dr grace feels that jacobuh chubwill benefit from a program of limited contact with others as hes probably terrified i interrupted realizing as soon as the words were out of my mouth that that was exactly what the general intended he was isolating chub to force him to cooperate with the testing in exchange for the simplest of comfortsa lap to sit in a story to be read to him or a chance to see me now that i was here i wont eat until you let me see him kaz said folding his arms across his chest youll have to knock me out and put a tube in me oh dear theres no need for all this drama prentiss sighed as a young woman wheeled a cart into the room have a nice lunch dear boy if youre worried about being poisoned you can take your pick of any of the dishes thank you mavis he added as the server began setting salads at each place if youll just a muted chirping caused him to frown he pulled out a sleek phone and spoke quietly yes youre sure where how did he cutler and greybull youre positive i could make out the frantic tone of the voice on the other end but not the words i knew it had to be about prairie she was the only loose end still out there the rest of us had all been brought here how long had it been since rattler set out for chicago nine hours ten just about long enough to reach chicago if hed driven fast just as rattler had known where to intercept me and kaz he could have known where her captors were going to stop for gas or lunch i glanced at kaz who was watching me with his eyes narrowed his expression told me he was thinking the same thing i was dead prentisss face which was already tight with anger twisted into a mask of consuming rage how the hell did you let that happen my pulse spiked with fear had prairie been killed in a fight with prentisss men or rattler or had she somehow managed to fight backand win how fast can you get there i heard fury building in prentisss tightly controlled voice youve got half that secure the bodies call gurz hell assist with the troopers and police im on my way ill be right behind you he hung up without further comment mustache lowered his hand from his ear and i realized hed been listening in patched into the call already he was dialing another number code black he muttered prentiss took a deep breath and shut his eyes for a moment when he opened them his placid expression was nearly restored and he managed a brief smile im terribly sorry but i have been called away on an urgent matter hailey kaz i leave you in dr graces capable hands and well speak again tomorrow is she all right i demanded prairie is she all right the general didnt answer jasmine rattler thought she smelled like jasmine the first white blooms of spring on the shrubs that still grew along the edges of trashtown long after the person whod planted them had died and been forgotten he closed his eyes and let himself remember a longago july morning before the sun scorched the sky chasing prairie into the hedge he just wanted her to stop screaming so he hooked a foot around her leg and sent her facedown in the dirt under the jasmine hedge he slid down next to her rolled her over saw the scratches on her tearstained cheeks held her wrists so she couldnt lash out at him he wanted to make the tears go away wanted her to stop screaming so he could just tell her what was inside him the way she made him feel but he didnt know the words so hed ground her hands into the dirt and made her cry harder all the while breathing in that springbright smell of jasmine but they werent kids anymore they were grown and rattler was a man and she was his woman and she would mind him his hands were in her hair and he seized a handful and yanked hard enough to jerk her head back hush your mouth he growled but she hadnt said anything she just stared at him her green eyes throwing sparks her lip curled in a sneer that let him know she wasnt half broke yet for a minute he felt rage rise in him and he wanted to break her devil be damned right here in a driedup wash somewhere in central illinois he didnt know this land didnt know who owned the tidy white barn a quarter mile away the row of black walnut trees the hound baying at the end of its chain what he did know the blood on their clothes had been spilled by his own hand and hed spill more if more bloodshed was what it took hed do anything for prairie and for the life they were meant to lead it had been almost too easy to take out the ones whod had her locked up his spinning eye showed him the way told him what to do he shot the first man right through the door the other didnt have time to get out of the chair but rattler didnt notice the beatup mess of a woman in the corner until she came at him like she was hungry for the bullet dragging her chainedup chair behind her rattler didnt want to shoot a banished but she wouldnt stop and she wouldnt stop no matter he told her to stay back that messed him up he hadnt wanted to shoot her and as she gurgled her last breath rattler felt his rage at prentiss growing stronger the man kept taking what was his and rattlers wrath was a living thing now a hungry beast that would tear his enemies limb from limb that would roar so loud that everyone in gypsum would hear the ground would disappear in a lake of blood before he let prentiss win he raged and he beat his fist on the wall in that fancy hallway and that was how the last one got away a fastmoving thing with long curly hair she darted out the door and down the hall and disappeared into the stairwell and rattler could catch her easy but then he saw prairie through that door the curlyhair one left open prairie with her pretty mouth open a little like she was saying his name prairie with her fancy shoes and her fancy hair he wanted to mess up with his hands prairie who knew him like no other he let the curlyhair one go he took prairie because prairie was his and they rode the elevator together and when it stopped on the other floors rattler stared down every man or woman who wanted to get in the little box with them the box was not big enough to hold him and his feelings the world was not big enough to hold him and prairie and his feelings but first things first which was why hed pulled off the road for a little talk once theyd got good and far out of the city and night had come down to hide them a talk and then a nights rest that was what they needed now before i give you this girl he said to prairie you git to thinking on what youre gonna do cause seems you and me got the same goal here least in the short term were going after hailey and the rest we work together we might just save that little bastard child and them polacks you shoot me down they dont stand a chance prairie still said nothing but she gave him the tiniest of nods slowly reluctantly rattler eased off her slid his hands from her hair leaned back in the drivers seat then he handed her his favorite gun he watched her settle it into her hands it looked good on her warm steel shimmering silver when she lifted it and pointed it at him he allowed himself a smile she was brave a natural hunter the blood ran as thick in her veins as it did in his now listen well he said as she raised the gun until it was inches from his crazy spinning eye and sighted down the barrel i seen water i seen more dead before tomorrows done and i seen you by my side mind me well girl and do as i say he turned away from her then and eased his seat back fixing to get his sleep and put that thing down you know you aint gonna shoot menot tonight anyway prentiss and mustache hurried out of the cafeteria as alarms sounded elsewhere in the building several other staffers abandoned their lunch and followed barking orders into cell phones dr grace stared at us nervously she and kaz and i were alone in the dining room now everything is fine she said uncertainly im sure they will be back soon meanwhile why dont we um take a tour i can show you the recreation facilities we have a gym sauna a volleyball i dont care about any of that i just want to see chub i interrupted kaz caught my eye he shook his head subtly and i followed his gaze to the ceiling above the door mounted in the corner was a tiny security camera i glanced around the rest of the room but didnt see any others dr grace was shaking her head you know that is not possible not without prentiss onsite but im sure hell be back by tomorrow and once things are back to normal i can suggest a visit perhaps you can observe me working with him kaz mouthed something but i couldnt make out the words um i said dr grace looked at me suspiciously have you been spending much time with chub i am his principal contact yes dr grace said i am in charge of his testing as well as his daily regimen when you say testing i said trying to keep her talking kaz had a plan and i needed to keep dr grace from noticing i forced myself to look curious what exactly are you looking for well as you undoubtedly already know chub is a high psychic with a strong tendency toward precognition she said her features relaxing as she warmed up to her subject kaz raised his glass to his lips and drank the rest of his tea as dr grace talked about chubs abilities he slammed the glass down on the edge of the table smashing it into several pieces he catapulted from his chair picking up the largest shard and pressing it against dr graces throat wrapping an arm around her neck so she couldnt move he gripped the glass so tightly that it cut into his own flesh and blood ran down his arm in glistening red rivulets it was just like what had happened with jess and i froze at the memory lock the door hailey he said and i snapped out of it forcing myself to move i threw myself at the heavy glass door pushing it shut there was a loud click as it latched into place through the door i saw the cafeteria erupt in commotion as staff raced toward us weapons drawn heres whats going to happen now kaz said talking fast im guessing that door is reinforced and itll take a few minutes for anyone with the right code to get down here but kaz we cant i stopped myself before i said it cant leave here not without chub kaz stared deep into my eyes and said trust me hailey only once before had anyone said those words to me it was the night gram was shot prairie and i were careering across a moonlit field in her old volvo pursued by grams killers in a much faster car until that moment id never believed i could trust another human being but i closed my eyes and did my best and we survived now for the second time ever i put my life in someone elses hands open this door one of the men yelled his voice was only slightly muffled by the glass ill kill dr grace kaz shouted i knew that it was a bluff that kaz wouldnt take a life unless he was defending himself or someone he loved but he looked convincing the sharp piece of glass had grazed the tender skin of dr graces neck and her blood trickled down and mixed with kazs dripping to the floor as he held her immobile the men outside conferred in whispers empty the cafeteria kaz ordered the guards hesitated then one barked a command and the remaining diners filed out followed by the kitchen staff now set your weapons against the wall and lie on the floor kaz yelled when we come out we will take your guns you will not get up you will remain where you are and order the hallways to be cleared we will take one of you with us and if we see anyone as we exit the building we will kill both you and dr grace do you understand the shorter guard who seemed to be in charge shook his head no way i said id kill her kaz roared jerking dr grace around so that the guards could see her terrified face then do it the guard said the outcome is the same either way youre screwed of course dr graces life was not a big enough bargaining chip they would rather let her die than risk losing the two of us a seer and a healer after all we were the keys to all the work they were doing here no matter how brilliant dr grace was they could always find another scientist they couldnt find more healers or pureblood seers and they knew it more important prentiss knew it and i had no doubt he had communicated his priorities very clearly life here was not sacred kazs gaze met mine and i knew he had reached the same conclusion if youre going to do it dr grace said her voice shaking her eyes squeezed shut in fear please make sure you kill me clean if you dont it was a moment before she managed to complete her sentence if you dont finish me theyll turn me into one of them i knew it was true they wouldnt waste a dying woman they would force me or prairie to turn dr grace into a zombie that was it the end of hope as kaz looked at me with terrible regret the shard of glass clattered to the floor he didnt need to tell me that he wouldntcouldntkill dr grace but the way she sagged against the wall with relief made it clear that she hadnt been sure outside the two guards smirked we had played our last card now they knew our limits and we were no longer a threat to them i thought of rattler so far the only one of us banished to stand up to prentiss and win i wondered who was the greater evil prentiss who thought nothing of creating and selling human killing machines or rattlermy fatherwho wanted to turn us all into a twisted kind of family in which love was laced with fear and tainted with spilled blood whose destiny came from a cursed patch of earth in ireland rattler was a killer but his life and his history were bound forever with mine in that moment i couldnt help being glad he had seized prairie from prentiss at least now she had a chance dr grace crossed her arms tightly over her chest and pressed herself into the wall as though she wanted to disappear the taller man who had a thick drawl and a texas longhorn tattoo on his forearm tapped his gun against the glass open this door the shorter guard who was wearing a tightfitting shirt that showed his powerful arms shook his head we need to just leave them in there until prentiss gets back with her are you crazy texas said theres no telling what theyll do you saw thatthey didnt kill her when they had the chance texas snorted yeah but theres no telling how theyll feel in an hour you keep them locked up im bringing em out no biceps stepped between texas and the door with prentiss and barbieri and the others gone im next in command texas looked surprised then pissed off really what are you employee number thirty or something bryce brought me in on the ground floor anyones going to take care of business until they get back its me in case you havent noticed bryce is a crispy critter biceps shot back no one gives a shit what he thinks texas pushed biceps out of the way and started to open the door but i was focused on what hed just said bryce is a crispy is not was not dead alive i looked at kaz and saw that he had heard it too his eyes wide with surprise we had seen bryce taken from the building seen the burnt flesh the missing shoe the sheet covering his bodybut what if he had somehow lived what if someone had covered him to disguise his still being alive prentiss with all his connections might have gotten to him first prentiss had access to the best technology available could it have been enough to save bryce but there was no time to think about it now as biceps grabbed kaz roughly and pushed him toward the door i tried to follow but texas stepped between us where do you think youre taking them texas demanded what do you care theyll be secure why dont you take care of rearming the controls dont you tell me ill tell you whatever i want biceps said im in command remember ill write you up stop just stop it dr grace said finally finding her voice bickerings not going to help anything we need to work together until prentiss gets back ive got it under control genevieve biceps interrupted her coldly she glared at him and i could tell she didnt care for being addressed by her first name or for being told what to do by these men who moments before had told kaz to kill her tensions were high and the haste with which prentiss had assembled his team clearly hadnt helped only a few months had passed since bryces lab was destroyed and prentisswith all his money and connections and resourceshad rebuilt with astonishing speed but some things could not be rushed and unity was one of them there were serious cracks in the organization i wondered how we could take advantage of them biceps forced kaz to walk in front of him and waved me along to join them texas stepped aside but the glare he gave us was furious im writing this up he repeated and biceps flipped him off as we walked single file toward the elevator look kaz said to biceps when the elevator doors shut theres no reason for the gun were cooperating if you just shut it boy scout biceps snapped kaz shrugged but he kept quiet move biceps ordered when the elevator doors opened onto the twostory atrium at the intersection of the buildings wings he led us toward the hall opposite the residential wing but the scenery outside caught my attention a flagstone patio led to the pond that had been on this land since before the park was built though it didnt resemble the cattailedged pond it had once been it had been sculpted into an oval and planted with water lilies and overhanging willows when i was a kid the morries used to fish there now it was ringed by benches and picnic tables no one was enjoying the scenery now though in fact there was no one in the hall besides us our footsteps echoed on the tiled floors and i wondered if prentiss was operating with fewer staff than had worked for bryce had some of his team defected after the lab was destroyed or was it possible that theyd had second thoughts about the mission ive got a little education in mind for you two biceps said his voice dripping with sarcasm we could just wait in our rooms i suggested until things are you know more stable yeah you could thats what bonaventure would like for us all to just sit around with our thumbs up our asses until prentiss gets back here biceps scowled only ive got a better idea he stopped in front of a reinforced door the grand tour ends here he flipped up the top of a keypad and punched in a long series of digits before the door clicked open ladies first he said stepping aside with a flourish and i stepped into the room it was all too familiar a choked gasp escaped my throat as i stumbled backward but biceps shoved me back in i grabbed kazs arm pressing against him while my heart stampeded the room was full of them half a dozen zombies sat in folding chairs only their eyes moving when they saw us i recoiled remembering the terrifying experience of being attacked a few months earlier in bryces lab when id accidentally stumbled on the room where he kept his specimens a room very much like this one right down to the folding chairs and the white tshirts and khakis they wore i tried to turn away but i found that i couldnt stop looking they had all been young men four of them looked as though they had turned recently their skin mostly intact though pale and waxy one of these four was very thin and had lost all its hair and looked like it had been sick for a long time the other three had been injured they had jagged scars on their faces and skulls bruises from ivs and feeding tubes limbs twisted and mangled and in one case missing with a bandaged stump where the arm had been but the two who had turned less recently were even more horrifying when a healer heals a person at the moment of their death they dont die but they dont live either they enter an undead state able to follow instructions but unable to communicate no longer human just functional shells that once held souls the undead are hard to kill they can be burned to death or drowned or beheaded or torn limb from limb but anything else barely slows them down eventually though the undead deteriorate just as any corpse does and expire prairie had told me it takes about three times as long as an ordinary dead body but these two zombies looked like they were getting close their flesh had swollen and ruptured viscous fluids seeping into their clothes dripping puddles on the floor one of them was missing an eye the cavern of the socket dripping pus and its tongue was blackened and swelling and protruded from its mouth the other had lost entire patches of flesh and its bones and tendons were visible in its arms and its neck a flap of skin hung from its jaw revealing its gray shrunken gums and teeth in a skeletal leer like these guys biceps demanded his voice laced with amusement some of our finest too bad these are all still test models working out a few of the final kinks and then we start production for real want to guess what just one of these babies goes for on the open market who are you gonna sell to first kaz demanded angrily whos offering the most for suicide bombers these days oh thats right youre the big patriot biceps said lost your daddy in iraq and now you think its your job to carry on in his shoes is that it i felt kaz tense and i thought he was going to attack but he forced himself back under control you dont have to love your country to believe people shouldnt blow each other up he said through clenched teeth and doing it for moneys evil biceps laughed pretty boy you aint going to hurt my feelings calling me names im a capitalist thats all an opportunist you must not have been paying attention in history class because thats how this country got builtpeople taking advantage of their circumstances you sit still you get run over while i watched a glistening trail of pinkish fluid leaked from the damaged skull of one of the more recent zombies trailing down the side of its face and dripping onto its lap it didnt blink didnt flinch but a wave of nausea passed through me heres a little something you ought to know about these fellas biceps said almost cheerfully theyve been trained to respond only to certain voices its a new thing were doing so we can set it up so they follow only the buyers orders bryce turned us on to it actually i thought bryce was dead i said biceps chuckled well he wishes he was anyway stay on track here kids this bunch wont listen to anybody but prentiss and his top people which includes me whatever i tell them theyre gonna do no questions asked but you can holler at em all day long and its like they wont even hear you got that of course i got that i was a healer didnt he understand that the knowledge of what had been done to these poor menboys really no doubt taken from battlefields overseas where they could be conveniently lost by prentisss corrupt contacts in the servicesweighed deep in my soul because i too possessed the power to do this who did this i demanded somehow theyd found another healer but where the tarbells were the only ones left unless youre not the only healer around little miss biceps smirked you should have been a little more careful when you sent your friend zytka packing i couldnt breathe id watched her wave goodbye id watched her walk toward her gate at ohare rolling her small suitcase behind her but i hadnt seen her get on the plane hadnt seen it take off hadnt talked to her after it landed prentiss had gotten to her i didnt know how but i wasnt surprised the more i knew about him the more i feared him he had connections and resources far beyond my comprehension somehow hed kidnapped zytka and forced her to make zombies for him just as hed forced her sistersjust as he meant to force me now youve managed to piss me off biceps continued so youre gonna chill here for tonight dont worry if you follow instructions youll be just fine okay boys he addressed the zombies our guests are going to stay in this box here see with the toe of his shoe he traced a square on the floor following the pattern of the tile he pushed a few empty chairs out of the way to make the square about six feet across now if they stay in their box you leave them alone hear the zombies stared at him their eyes empty of emotion but i knew they were absorbing his words but if they step so much as an inch outside it you tear em up kill them got it nod if you understand as if they were puppets joined by a single string all six nodded the decomposing ones loose skin swaying gently now id get on in there if i was you biceps said prodding me forward kaz and i stood together inside our imaginary prison holding each other tightly boys come stand around them okay make like a ringaroundtherosie the clatter of chairs being pushed back made me feel faint and i squeezed my eyes shut and pressed my face against kazs shirt and wished that i could just stay like that pretending we were somewhere else back in chicago in the little neighborhood park and that when i opened my eyes id see tall buildings and cars going by and kazs gray eyes shining in the spring sun i forced myself to lift my head and look the zombies shuffled slowly into a circle around us their movements jerky and uncoordinated the one who was missing an arm stumbled and fellthere was something very wrong with one of its legsbut it kept coming crawling along the floor and dragging its damaged leg behind it a terrible smell wafted from one of the rotting ones and bits of crusted scabbed flesh fell from it as it came closer they found their places spaced evenly around our square and stood staring at us with no expression at all not menace or anger or craftinessjust nothing but i knew that the minute we ventured past the boundary biceps had drawn along the edge of the tiles they would set on us like rabid dogs it had happened to me once before and i would never forget the feel of their bony cold fingers on my flesh the sickening sponginess of their rotting bodies as i fought them prentiss isnt going to like this kaz said uncertainty flashed briefly across bicepss face but he forced a laugh i remembered the way hed acted with the other guardfull of swagger itching for a fight he was a guy with something to prove prentisss got bigger things to worry about besides as soon as he calls in you can come out of there this is just a little activity to keep you busy and a chance for him to prove himself among the staff left behind i thought tata biceps said giving us a limp little wave before letting himself out of the room we watched him go but the zombies didnt their eyes stayed fixed on us when the door shut i wrapped my arms even tighter around kaz and forced myself to stay calm id survived being afraid before i will get through this i said the words in my mind making myself believe them id survived being shot at and hunted and kidnapped and i would survive this too piece of cake i said shakily we just have to wait around a little while yeah kaz agreed but i could tell he was worried hailey i think we should sit down and rest but we have to be careful that was an understatement he was taller than the square was wide and there would be no exceptions all it would take was a hand or a footeven a lock of my haircrossing the lines and the zombies would be on us going for blood they didnt know any other way we sat down gingerly steering clear of the edges of our cell kaz sat crosslegged and i leaned back against him his arms around me that was when i realized that his hands were still bleeding from the broken glass let me i said softly and i held his hands in mine and lost myself in the healing it was a good place to go it calmed me and chased my fears away if only for a moment when i released kazs hands there was no mark on them and i knew that i had done well that one looks like hes going to expire at any minute kaz said the most decomposed zombie was barely standing swaying on legs that were hardly able to hold up its rotting body its head lolled on its neck and its empty socket stared but it stayed in its spot for a moment anyway then a convulsion shuddered through its body and it collapsed into our square it landed in a heap body fluids spattering flesh tearing loose from the bones its crablike skeletal elbow inches away i screamed and felt kaz tightening his arms around me forcing me to stay in place but i fought him i had to get away from it and i wrestled against kaz trying to crawl away from the motionless thing the seeping puddle in which it lay stop fighting me kaz yelled into my ear and i finally went slack against him he was right we had to stay in our square even if it meant sharing it with the zombie hailey shut your eyes just let me hold you stop he kept up like that rocking me in his arms whispering in my ear for what felt like hours until i finally stopped shaking it took a long time i kept my eyes closed and kaz talked and i listened he told me about his childhood about the first time hed had a vision about missing his dad about helping his mom in the salon about his best friend who moved to kansas in middle school about the first girl he kissed about his dreams of learning to fly of joining the air force i listened and we rocked and i tried to pretend we were back in the park after a very long time i felt a little better and i told him about me things i had never told another soul about wishing i had known my mother wondering who my father was about the imaginary friend id had who played with me in the woods behind the house we talked and talked until our voices were hoarse the night passing slowly and when there was a sound at the door my eyes flew open and the sight of the zombiesstill standing guard motionless and readysent a fresh shock through me i had almost managed to forget they were there dr grace opened the door and her eyes widened what the hell is going on she shut the door behind her and leaned on it her hand over her heart what on earthnever mind all of youback off go sit in your chairs the zombies shuffled away from their posts around the square back to their chairsall except for the one next to us a trickle of black fluid leaked from its mouth and a fly buzzed around its crusted ruined flesh what happened dr grace demanded the guardhe told us to stay in here kaz said in where this square he traced the floor tiles to show her or else he told them to uh i knew he didnt want to say it so i said it for him to kill us dr graces expression hardened thatsoh for petes sake theres little danger with the specimens as long as everyone follows procedure we arent supposed to issue any orders at all that arent clearly outlined on the test plan all of youstay where you are you are to leave these two alone she directed the command at the zombies but they gave no indication that they had heard what about next time i demanded i mean how many people can just walk in here andandtell them to do anything they want dr grace shook her head impatiently a line etched between her eyebrows its not like that its only the research team and security and prentiss of course look im not saying its perfect but this is alli mean nobody expected what happened today anyway youre safe now you can get up i stood and brushed grit off my clothes i forced myself to back out of the square holding kazs hand tightly what about that one kaz asked pointing at the broken body on the floor it was finally at peace its rotting flesh no longer able to sustain life after death dr grace sighed ill call for cleanup the tissues are sterile if thats what youre worried about kaz laughed shortly you think id worry about that when i practically got ripped to shreds by those things how can you stand it i asked how can you stand to work here knowing what theyre going to do with them dr grace blinked behind her glasses and frowned at me my area of expertise is precognition and psychokinesis she said hedging im head of psychic research but my contact with the specimens is really quite limited i work with our psychic subjects who are i assure you all very much alive so as long as you get to study whatever it is you want to study that makes all of thisi gestured at the rows of zombiesokay id like to secure the lab now dr grace said before turning away from me and muttering an order into a small handheld device answer her question kaz said we deserve to know dr grace frowned considering finally she gave us a brisk nod i dont think you want to be here when the cleanup teams working so lets go we can talk on the way dr grace kept up a fast pace through the halls it was early morning the sun streaming through windows set high in the walls we hadnt slept at all and it was a struggle to keep up with her you dont understand how hard it is to find funding for what most people consider a pseudoscience she said you of all people should be sympathetic to that hailey me i demanded why because you yourself have a gift that society doesnt understand how many people would believe you if you went out into the world and announced you were a healer there was a bitter edge to her voice that told me she was speaking from experience even when you can provewhen you have evidence ofnaturally occurring psychic phenomena the scientific community is so inbred and resistant she paused and bit her lip in frustration ive known since i started my doctoral thesis that precognition is real and i could back it up but when i left the university do you know how many job offers i had zero no one would touch me with a tenfoot pole so let me guess when you met prentiss he was your dream come true right dr grace glanced at me suspiciously if you are implying im not implying anything i said im just saying that if he was the only guy around willing to pay you to do the work you wanted i guess that made it awfully hard to be judgmental when he told you that they were breeding zombies in here only i cant help thinking that even then you would have a problem with what they do with the zombies who theyre selling them to she gave me a patronizing look hailey just because somethings illegal doesnt make it immoral or unnecessary the specimens are used in settings where its simply too dangerous to send a living human like when they have to do repairs on an oil rig or defuse explosives things like that what i demanded is that what they told you prentisss selling them to foreign militaries kaz added for war applications dr graces face darkened dont be ridiculous just because prentisss background is military doesnt mean but she didnt finish her sentence i could see her thinking it through coming to the inevitable conclusion that shed been lied to theres no time for this she finally sputtered look if you do as i say ill let you talk to the boy youll let us see chub i asked the zombies temporarily forgotten now yes but there is one conditionyou must tell him to cooperate with me cooperate how i was immediately suspicious she waved her hand impatiently nothing you need to worry about nothing that will harm him just simple tests what kind of tests she sighed and walked faster chub shows remarkable psychic ability my work here is to find ways to identify high psychics more readily and train them to exercise greater control over their skills he is a perfect subject but hes been reluctant i wondered if dr grace knew about the banished the seers what exactly had prentiss told his staff after the first lab had been destroyed it was coming together in my mind as long as his employees didnt understand the applications for the work they were doing they werent likely to balk at helping him build his war machines it was how bryce had convinced prairie to work for him telling her that their work would benefit people then used her for her talents ill tell him to cooperate i said good because hes been remarkably resistant almost selectively mute i can count on two hands the number of words hes spoken since arriving here arrivingas though hed come some other way than having been kidnapped and thrown in the back of a car i bit back a sharp retort dr grace stopped in front of an unremarkable door opening it with a key from her pocket chub was kneeling on the floor of a small carpeted room playing with a toy made from stiff colored wire strung with beads he looked up frowning with concentration at the sound of the door and then he burst into a smile that nearly broke my heart hayee kaz he shouted and raced over to us wrapping his arms around my legs the way he had since hed first come to live with us two years earlier after giving me a noisy kiss he went for kaz who pretended to stumble backward from the impact making chub squeal with laughter kaz picked him up and swung him in a circle before handing him gently to me and i took him in my arms and hugged him hard tears in my eyes ive missed you i whispered i set him down but kept my body between him and dr grace holding his hand tightly chubs room was a smaller version of mine with the same subtly colored walls the soft drapes the bathroom off to the side there were bookshelves filled with board books and toys a bed a dresser a mobile of planets hung out of reach from the ceiling a rocking horse stood in the corner there was one big difference though whereas my room had a broad window with a view of the fields stretching out into the distance chubs window was fake i could see the painted wall between the slats of the blinds that filled the false frame kaz had noticed too he went to the wall and jerked the blinds cord pulling them up to reveal the square of wall underneath you couldnt even let the poor kid see the sun dr grace shrugged we are keeping distractions to a minimum during the testing you mean because he wouldnt talk to you i said accusingly youre punishing him not so all of our subjects in the psychic evaluation program are kept in a distractionfree environment who else have you got i asked but i knew something that she didntthe subjects prentiss meant to bring into the lab would all be banished that was why hed contacted rattler it was what they had been arguing about on the phone the day before prentiss probably figured he could convince seers to cooperate with or without rattlerbut he had enough doubt that hed been trying hard to force rattler to be his middleman and that was why prentiss had taken prairie which meant that he knew how rattler felt about prairie i had to hand it to prentisshis intelligence was remarkable dr grace shrugged there are other subjects who ive studied at length she said in chicago thats not something we need to discuss now i suggest you make the most of your time together she looked at her watch you have fifteen minutes fifteen minutes i thought with a sinking heart not a lot of time can you at least leave us alone dr grace shook her head im afraid not but ill stay out of the way you wont even notice me but it was hard not to notice the way she watched us sitting in a straightbacked chair in the corner i turned my back on her but i could still feel her eyes on me the fifteen minutes passed more quickly than id imagined possible kaz and chub rolled on the floor in a tickle fight chub crawled into my lap and pretended to read a book about birds pointing at each page and telling me what he saw this a red bird it has a worm see i was proud of my little adopted brother hed continued to learn and develop even here his preschool teachers in chicago had told prairie during his first week that he was catching up with the other kids as i held him and listened to him chatter i was so full of hope for his future that i thought my heart would burst he chattered on about ducks and monsters and numbers about games he had played with dr grace he told me about playing hideandseek with numbers and good monsters and bad monsters and i was relieved that being cooped up in the room hadnt dampened his spirits or taken his imagination away times up dr grace said rising from her chair chub tell hailey and kaz goodbye you did very well today if you can talk to me the way you talk to them tomorrow when we do our games together maybe you can see them again chub pressed against me holding on to my arm with his hands i dont like her games he mumbled dr grace blinked theyre fun she said unconvincingly prairie was a scientist too but she was nothing like dr grace she was lively and intuitive and interested in the world around her and she loved me of that i was certain watching dr grace i wasnt convinced that she loved anyone or anything other than her work she was a zealot that was the key that prentiss had figured out zealots were devoted but they were also dangerous because they were so focused on a single passion they ignored everything else allowing terrible things to happen in her own way dr grace was as dangerous as prentiss i glanced around the room looking for a camera there it was up in the corner over the door i caught kazs eye and he gave me a tiny nod to show hed seen it but what could we do id be surprised if someone wasnt monitoring chub at all times and the rest of us too for that matter somewhere there was undoubtedly a bank of monitors showing all the rooms including mine and kazs there was no way we would be able to make a move without being observed at least i had seen for myself that chub was all right dr grace led us back into the hall my last glimpse of chub was of him standing in the middle of the room watching us without blinking a sad pout on his face it nearly broke my heart i cant wait until tomorrow to see him again i said let me stay with him i can sleep on the floor dr grace shook her head that is not possible i felt my frustration escalate i was tired to the point of breaking who the hell are you to say whats possible you let prentiss order you around you let him tell you what to study and how and you think youre really doing the work you were trained to do now wait just my aunt was just like you i continued she believed bryce she did everything he told her to right up until the day he tried to have her killed you saw how they were downstairs how they were ready to let us kill you is that really what you want prentiss doesnt prentiss only cares about one thing kaz interrupted and its not you look well help you with your research well get chub to cooperate with you but you have to do something for us like what let hailey stay in the room with chub kaz looked at me as he said it his gray eyes gentle he knew how badly i needed to be with chub i cant do that dr grace protested theres a video feed theres no way i could get away with it theres someone watching the monitor twentyfour hours then she paused looking thoughtful what i demanded there is something a small favor that i can do for you but only if you promise that youll do everything you can to help me with chub kaz and i exchanged looks depends on what it is dr grace gave him a small smile i can let you see your mother shes here kaz demanded my heart sankhad they kidnapped her too she shook her head no but theyve put surveillance cameras in your house she looked embarrassed and didnt meet kazs eye i can take you to the viewing room and you can watch the live feed youll be able to see her onscreen real time the resolution is quite good kaz and i looked at each other and i could see that he was trying to contain his fury but it was nothing that we hadnt expected we both knew they would be keeping close tabs on anna all right he said quietly it was the best deal we were going to get and we both knew it but how can you justify bringing us there wont prentiss mind dr grace shrugged dismissively prentiss isnt here and besides i outrank everyone in security so it all came down to her position within the organization i thought as we followed her back toward the center of the complex she was intimidated by prentiss and there was little trust among her and the other senior staffbut she didnt care about those whose rank was below hers that was the arrogance that had contributed to bryces downfall the belief in ruling with intimidation he had thought that as long as he was in charge he was invulnerable dr grace was making the same dangerous mistake and i wondered how we could use it against her she led us to the tower that anchored the main building rising above the rest of the office park i had thought it was decorative and in fact the top of it probably was with its tall arched windows but there was a floor below that i hadnt noticed from outside and that was where dr grace took us the room was octagonal windowless and ringed with large monitors as dr grace had promised the resolution was remarkable at first glance i saw the cafeteria empty now except for a lone custodian moving the tables out of the way to vacuum displayed on a fourfootwide screen and the courtyard out front where a gardener in coveralls tended a row of small trees four people wearing headsets were seated at workstations watching the dozen monitors making notes on their laptops they glanced up as dr grace walked in and one of them moved his earpiece out of the way and looked at her questioningly its all right chetan she said theyre here to observe with me the man shrugged and adjusted his earpiece there was an empty area in the middle of the room behind the bank of workstations and dr grace led us there we had an unobstructed view over the heads of the other viewers you have five minutes she whispered look at the screen over there i spotted anna immediately she was standing at a window of her bedroom already dressed for work in her nursing scrubs she had her back to the camera her long wavy chestnut hair pulled into a low ponytail her sharpangled shoulders sloped in defeat next to me kaz sucked in his breath shes all right i said softly she doesnt know that i am though he muttered that must be killing her almost as though she could hear us speaking anna turned away from the window and regarded the rest of her room bleakly the bed was neatly made a stack of folded laundry waiting to be put away she touched the edge of the bed smoothing out the spread and then she slowly lowered herself to the floor for a moment i thought she had collapsed but when she folded her hands together under her chin i realized she had knelt to pray kaz squeezed my hand and my heart constricted with pain for him i had seen kaz fearless in the face of incredible odds even deathbut watching his mother struggle seemed like more than he could bear i turned away to give him privacy dr grace was conferring quietly with one of the technicians going over something he was showing her on a log sheet i looked at the other banks of monitors which displayed every corner of the facility there were bedrooms like chubs but with real windows and more personal detailsstaff quarters i assumed there were views of the parking garage the courtyard the research facilities some were empty and in others people worked at computers and banks of equipment there was the specimen room i saw that the zombies were lined up in their chairs where wed left them the one that had nearly fallen on us had been removed but there was a stain on the floor where it had lain i glanced quickly away from that screen there was a hospital bed with a lumpy still form under a white sheet another zombie but something wasnt right it took me a moment to absorb what i was seeing sensors blinked and tubes protruded from the bodys throat and extremities as i watched the body shifted slightly its arm skittering a few inches on the sheet clawed fingers scrabbled at nothing but what was wrong with them they were hideously deformed mere stumps crusted with what was that i squinted at the face exposed at the head of the bed and felt my stomach turn the skin had melted from the bone a mask of peeling bandaged shreds attached to a skull a lipless mouth pulled back from leering teeth its eyes stared piteously at the ceiling its lashes and eyebrows gone there was no hair on its skull and its ears were mere knobs of flesh and that was when i knew this tortured body had been horribly burned and then saved by extraordinary measures the best medical care money could buy it would have been far kinder to let it die its every moment was screaming torture but its lungs had been too badly damaged to produce a scream it was bryce safian the man we had left for dead the man whod been pulled from the inferno of his laboratory carried out on a stretcher one charred foot dangling free from what i could see most of his body had been burned beyond recognition but prentiss had contacts everywhere sources i could only imagine if there was a way he would buy or steal it he would pay people to perform miracles on bryce and pay others to look the other way in the old lab the one we had destroyed bryce had been in charge and i had feared him he tried to imprison me to use me and prairie to learn how to turn ordinary people into healers had he succeeded he could have produced the seeds of world war iii giving every army that could afford to pay access to zombies who would carry out their acts of war we had destroyed bryces lab his databut we hadnt destroyed his backups we didnt think it mattered with him dead the passwords and locations were lost forever but with him alive that was why he was here even if all he could do was scrawl on a pad of papereven if all he could do was blink yes or nowith enough patience and enough time they could make him tell everything first would be the passwords then they would force him to explain the data by keeping him alive they had roundtheclock access to a consultant whose every moment was clearly agony my heart sank if they had already got the passwords from him everything was lost there was no way we would be able to pull off burning down a lab a second time i had no doubt theyd redoubled the security here they would be on high alert for any kind of invasion but bryce was still alive and there had to be a reason as much as i hated prentiss i didnt believe he was deliberately cruel bryce held the key to the work being done here so we had to get to bryce i glanced at dr grace again but she was engrossed in the report she was reading tracing a column of numbers with her fingernail next to me kaz watched his mother pray and held my hand tightly in his after a moment dr grace summoned us times up im afraid she said we need to get you two to your rooms so you can get some rest if youll follow me as he turned to go kaz traced a fleeting sign of the cross on his forehead chest and shoulders and mouthed the words i love you to his mother she continued to pray her lips moving steadily her back straight as we left the lab iwho had never set foot in a churchsaid the most desperate prayer of my life keep us safe and help us do what must be done the brownglasses lady brought her toys and she put a duck behind the hiding thing chub knew it was a duck because she left the top off the box when she came in and the duck was at the top of the box and when she put something behind the hiding thing the duck was not on the top of the box chub had a duck like that prairie gave it to him and it went in his tub when he had a bath and when he didnt have a bath it went in the blue basket so hailey could take her bath hailey did not have a duck and she didnt play with his duck either when she took her bath chub wanted the duck that the lady brought except it wouldnt be the same as his duck it looked the same but it wouldnt be the same nothing was the same here and he wanted to go home hailey came yesterday and kaz came yesterday but it wasnt time to go home yet they could only play with him a little while hailey was sad when they had to go she didnt want to go and kaz didnt want to go the brownglasses lady made them leave and he wished the lady would leave but she came back the lady pretended she was very smart but she wasnt very smart because the bagel she said if chub didnt eat the bagel she would have to take the bagel away but chub put the bagel in his pocket the pants today had a pocket and he put the bagel in the pocket and the lady didnt know he put the bagel there the pants were red his shirt had a bug on it a bug picture chub was waiting to see if he liked the bug or not he put his hand on the bug picture a lot it was shiny so chub can you tell me what is behind the screen ask ask ask the lady asked questions and asked chub had to let some words out today because he told hailey he would he said words he said no and dog and thank you because everyone likes when you say thank you the lady liked it when he said thank you but then her mouth was mad again is it the dog or maybe the shovel or the cup chub looked at her mouth making words it was not the dog it was not the shovel or the cup it was the duck she knew the duck was behind the hiding thing she wanted him to say duck duck the brownglasses lady jumped up fast and chub thought she might climb over the hiding thing but then she sat down on her chair again the lady looked happy and chub made a smile for her because hailey said to help the nice lady but chub was thinking about prairie because prairie was in his mindpicture this morning and prairie looked sad and the eye man was there and he put his hand on prairies face and she looked sad the eye man used to come visit gram and he was scary and hailey pushed a stick in his eye and made it crazy hailey pushed that stick in his eye but now he put his hand on prairies face and then he put his face on her face and chub wanted to tell prairie to skedaddle but it was only a mindpicture and he couldnt tell her anything thats right it is a duck chub arent you a smart boy arent you a good boy chub was a smart boy and he was a good boy but he wished the lady would close her mouth and he wished hailey and kaz would come back and he wished the eye man would leave prairie alone it was not dr grace who came to my room at dinnertime but a tall bald man in white scrubs that barely covered the holster on his belt i asked him if prentiss had returned yet and i could tell by the way he avoided the question that he hadnt that made me feel a little better because i knew it meant they hadnt caught up with prairie yet even if she was with rattler i felt like her odds were better than if she ended up here trapped with the rest of us when we arrived in the dining room i was relieved to see kaz sitting alone with a full plate of food in front of him pushing pasta around with a fork can i sit with him i asked you can sit anywhere you want my escort said dr grace will be here for you sometime in the next half hour so eat up i went through the line quickly taking the first things i saw and piling them on a tray when kaz saw me sliding into the chair across from him some of the tension eased from his face you look tired i said his skin was pale and he had dark circles under his eyes i had slept fitfully after dr grace escorted us back to our rooms my thoughts swirling and nagging at me it looked like kaz hadnt fared any better he covered my hand with his own his touch warm and enveloping i had a vision hailey i wanted to tell him about bryceabout what id seen on the monitor about what it meantbut that would have to wait what did you see i dont know he said crumpling a napkin in his fist clearly frustrated ive been sitting here trying to figure it out describe it step by step i suggested maybe with both of us kaz rubbed his forehead in frustration pushing back the hair that always fell in his eyes it was bryce he was disappearing i dont know how to describe it it was like he was fading away from the bottom up he didnt have any hair but there wasnt a scratch on him i swear thoughi swear it was him my heart thrummed with excitement and fear thats because hes alive what i explained what id seen earlier on the monitors the body in the bed the machines keeping him alive his burntoff fingers and ears the lips that had melted away from his gums they saved him somehow kaz i concluded i dont know how and i dont know how long he can survive in that condition but hes here but in the visionhailey he wasnt burned i dont know maybe i mean what if the vision was really from the past you know that doesnt make sense your visions are never about the past but theres no other way to no you saw that vision i interrupted suddenly sure of what it meant thats because he gets healed it has to be kaz slowly closed his mouth and i could see him putting it all together so we have to find a way to stop them they must be planning to use the healer they have here and i dont think so i said i think its me who heals him you but why why would you im not sure i admitted but its me i just know it what i didnt say was that ever since id seen bryce on the monitors i had felt it stirring inside the desirethe needto heal the words were a whispered chorus under my thoughts and my fingers tingled and twitched with the longing to touch his ravaged body but if you heal him prentissll have everything he needs to recreate the lab and no i think i need to heal him so that he can help us destroy the backups i said did you see anything that would help us find where in the complex theyre keeping him or how we might be able to bust him out kaz was silent for a moment concentrating i dont know i mean it was just bryce and he was fading away he had like this expression sort of manic you know kind of crazed what about what you saw on the monitor anything about the room that would tell you where it was i closed my eyes and concentrated remembering all that equipment the wires and tubes snaking from his destroyed body the screens blipping and blinking but most of all i remembered the pure agony on what was left of his face nothing i whispered its okay i might have an idea remember when we went to bryces lab you went first to create a distraction yeah and then you and prairie took off down the hall and yeah but before that the guard what was his name maynard maynard i repeated remembering he had been a heavyset guy in his late fifties sitting behind a desk sleepily reading a newspaper id pretended to be upset told him thered been an accident begged him to come outside and seeso kaz and prairie could sneak past him into the labbut he wouldnt listen he had wanted to make some calls i remembered his softpalmed hand reaching for the phone remembered my panic as id seen our entire scheme going down the drain and then id reached across the desk almost without thinking and my hand had settled on the soft warm skin of his neck and idi remember good because you have to do it one more time he looked troubled his eyes avoiding my gaze i knew there was something he wasnt telling me what is it i asked tell me i need to know i cant do this unless i know everything there was that wasnt the only vision i had my throat went dry with fear the vision of bryce had been bad enough what more could he have seen what was it well it was a place a little neighborhood in the middle of nowhere full of rundown houses there were two streets that crossed in the middle of the neighborhood there were dogs lying in the street kids fighting over nothing old cars up on blocks boardedup windows thats trashtown i murmured rattler was there and he had prairie with him rattler hung his head with shame because the worn old dress was no thing worthy of prairie but with all her pretty new clothes burned up at the pollitt house this dress was all he had to offer his dead mamas sunday dress that she wore until she quit getting dressed at all he should have got shut of it should have burnt up all his mamas things when she died instead hed scrubbed the house down to raw woodfloors walls ceilingshed scrubbed away the coughing and moaning of her last months and hed scrubbed away the memories of her face swoll up from his daddys fist and hed scrubbed away every longago morning she turned him out to run wild through trashtown so she could take her cure the box of her things stayed sealed up neat in the closet upstairs rattler would drive it to the dump he would get new clothes for prairie her new clothes would hang in the closet just so prairie would do woman things to the house curtains and fancy soap and such that was not a job for rattler but hed scrubbed until the skin rubbed off his knuckles and hed split and stacked the wood and beat the rugs and caned the chairs and rubbed the dust from the lamps the shirt prairie wore was too hot for june and she didnt have nothing else with her prairie had come to him with nothing and that was as it should be before long prairie would shed the city like a king snake sheds its skin her hair would get long and her green eyes would grow bright again for him put it on girl rattler said roughly holding the worn dress out to her he hated to see her standing so straight and still in his kitchen in the warm evening sweat on her brow her shirt buttoned up to her neck he would buy a fan he would buy a fan for every window aint much but itll keep you cool well go to town soon and git you things i dont need anything she said not looking at him crazy talk this was her home now she should be looking at her new cups and plates and her new silver chest that had been his mamas she should be thinking where did she want the chairs the dish drainer the broom she didnt look at any of her new things didnt notice the flowers in the jar on the table the cloth from so long ago rattler didnt know who had stitched it which he took out of the hutch just for her rattler sighed and bunched the old dress in his fist he would throw out his mothers things he would pour prairie a glass of water he would tell her to fetch him a shined apple rub his knottedup shoulders sing him one of the old songs he would make her sit down he would make her mind him he would see himself in her wide green eyes rattler looked at prairie and he didnt know what to do so he had taken her home i sat without speaking thinking about it i shouldnt have been surprised now that dereks family farm had been blown skyhigh rattler had nowhere else to take her it was hard to imagine that his house the house he had grown up in which had been his fathers before him was much worse than the abandoned farmhousebut i knew enough about trashtown to know that it could be a lot worse he wont like that i said thats going to make him all the more determined to sell the seers out to prentiss so he can afford something nicer for prairie he really loves her i frowned i guess you could say that i mean if you can call that love no i only meant that if she asked him to help us get chub out maybe hed do it get rattler to help us after he tried to lock us up its just a thought hailey were sort of running out of options here yeah but before i could finish the thought dr grace appeared checking her watch and holding a sheaf of papers bound by a large clip all right you two she said with forced cheer we have a couple of hours before were done for the night and id like to use it with you kaz hailey you can come along if you like who knows maybe youll come in handy you want to start testing me before prentiss gets back kaz said dr grace blinked thats not did they find prairie i demanded she pressed her lips together and didnt answer leave your trays someone will clean up lets go just answer that one question and we wont give you any trouble i said come on it doesnt make a difference ill find out eventually anyway she hesitated rubbing her temples they reported in and theyll be back very soon im sure they will find her soon and her abductor abductor kaz demanded incredulously seriously uh isnt that incredibly hypocritical since you people kidnapped her first look dr grace said angrily i am tired of being forced to defend things that are outside of my purview i dont know what is going on up there and i dont really want to i have a job to do and i would like to get started so if youll kindly theres a reason you want to start now before they get back kaz said as he and i followed her out of the dining room everyone else had finished eating and the dining room was empty youre afraid that prentiss wont let you why is that dr grace nothing could be further from the truth dr grace snapped in a brittle tone that implied hed come very close to the truth my guess was that she had spent the last several hours thinking about what we had told her about what the zombies were really going to be used for maybe she was having a moral crisis wondering if she could continue working for a man who committed such atrocities i wanted to believe that and maybe knowing that she wouldnt be working here much longer she wanted to spend as much time as possible with her most promising subjects chub and now kaz as we started up the ornate curving stairs to the upper floor kaz touched my arm and i fell back with him he silently pointed to the stairs that curved above us and mouthed the word now as we neared the landing between floors kaz tackled dr grace around the waist her feet swung off the floor and she made an oof sound as the air was knocked out of her do it hailey kaz whispered before dr grace could recover enough to scream i put my hand to her neck closed my eyes and felt the swirling dark sensation as my blood rushed and roiled and then she went limp id done itthe same thing i had done to the security guard i hadnt injured her id just put her into a deep sleep my touch acting like a powerful magnet that temporarily blunted her conscious mind what now i demanded theyre going to get her keys fast he held her under the armpits and started dragging her across the landing toward a door id missed earlier a plain flat door set into the stretch of wall behind the curving staircase i scrambled through her pockets for the ring of keys id seen her use earlier i found it and then on an impulse reached for the holster attached to her belt and took her gun too surprised at its weight in my hand jackpot i whispered as i slipped the gun into my pocket and jammed one of the two keys on the heavy silver ring into the lock it worked i guessed it was a master key one that would open many different rooms in the complex one of the perks of seniority kaz shouldered the door open and i slipped into the darkness behind him and pulled the door shut plunging us into total darkness my knees struck something sharp and hard and i went down landing on a cold floor then i was stillas still as i could belistening to the metallic echo of my impact and our breathing after what seemed like a long time kaz whispered im going to set her down okay where are we janitors closet i think i noticed it at lunch the way the stairway curves they have cameras at the bottom and the top but they missed this one spot i reached blindly for the object id tripped on and felt the shape of a wheeled mop bucket i backed up on my hands and knees until i found the wall behind me i leaned back against brooms hanging from hooks pulling my knees up to my chest i waited for my eyes to adjust to the darkness but there was no light not even a slim crack coming from under the door im going to wake her up i whispered what she could make all kinds of noise in here i got her gun right yes but she knows we wont kill her since we didnt when we had the chance but she doesnt know how badly were willing to hurt her lets take advantage of her doubts i was pretending a bravery i didnt feel if we were caught our few tiny freedoms would be taken away id be a prisoner in my cell twentyfour hours a day there would be no more visits with chub no chances for kaz to see his mom and id never know if prairie was safeunless they found her in which case theyd drag her here to be a prisoner like the rest of us now lets make her take us to bryce i said i thought youd want to get chub kaz we cant not yet we cant go for him until were ready until were sure as much as i longed to free chub right away he would only slow us down and if there was a chance to end this for good it lay with bryce i longed to see chub to hug him and kiss his soft downy cheeks but we had to fix this first or die trying the thought flashed through my mind before i could stop it we were at a point of no return having taken a hostage in the past the staff hadnt shot to kill because we were too valuable they might still spare my life because my healing gift was too rare for them to risk losing but kaz no one knew the extent of his gift but me there was no reason for the guards to let him live if we got into a firefight this has to work i whispered as i reached for kaz we squeezed each others hands in the dark and then he guided my fingers to dr graces neck and pressed them against her skin the thing i did when i closed my eyes and emptied my mind was the opposite of what id done before the swirl was the same the rushing blood the voices but i reversed the power of my touch willed the stilled soul of dr grace to awaken i felt her stir and then struggle to sit up wherewhat i fumbled for the gun in my pocket it was a good fit heavy and smooth and warm from my body i pressed the barrel against dr graces neck careful not to touch the trigger i would notcould notshoot her this is your gun i whispered you are here with me and kaz and in a moment we are going to open the door and you are going to take us to see bryce who dr grace asked and i realized she was thinking fast nice try but i know you know who i mean i said bryce safian i know hes here i saw him on the monitors i dont i jabbed a little harder against her neck with the barrel of the gun i dont have a lot of patience right now make it look natural kaz said lead us directly to him dont stop and dont talk to anyone ill keep the gun hidden but i wont hesitate to shoot you this time dont be stupid dr grace said if you shoot me youll be dead in minutes i dont think so i said im way too valuable to them and im a damn good shot kaz said another lie but he made it sound plausible ill take out as many as i can before i go down who knows we might even get to the exit you willing to take that chance there was a silence while we waited for dr grace to think it through ill open the door now i said remember straight to safian if it makes you feel better think about the fact that if we succeed youll be free to go find some nice legitimate lab somewhere and do your little experiments in peace and then i took a deep breath and felt for the doorknob and we stood blinking in the bright sun there was no one in sight i handed the gun to kaz and gave dr grace a gentle shove the walk to bryces room was uneventful a couple of people passed us but one was talking angrily into his phone and the other was so distracted by a printout he was carrying that he barely acknowledged us the longer prentiss was gone the more the place was falling apart when dr grace stopped in front of a door and reached for her keys she came up with nothing i palmed her keys from my own pocket resisting the urge to gloat but when i opened the door one glance inside the room wiped the smirk off my face kaz herded us inside and pushed the door closed behind us then took my arm and pulled me close i pressed my face against his chest not wanting to go any closer to the thing in the bed it was like the scene on the monitor only real in person bryces body was even more horrifying the scabbed flesh red and black his face a nightmare of agony after a moment i regained my composure and forced myself to step closer can you see us i asked my voice shaking bryces eyes rolled in his head but then they focused on me do you know who we are i asked swallowing my revulsion and forcing myself to approach the edge of the bed i was close enough that if i wanted to i could touch his ruined skin instead i worked hard to focus my gaze on his eyes hehh he said a terrible rasping moan issuing from deep in his throat heeehhhlie hailey thats right and kaz is here too and dr grace he looked at them moving his head only the tiniest bit his body racked with painful convulsions by the effort suddenly the hatred i had stored up against him withered and i felt only pity mr safian can you help us destroy the data he stared at me with a question in his eyes a need a hunger and as much as i longed to shrink away from him into kazs strong arms i forced myself to stay where i was yehhhh ihhh you kihhhh eee i glanced at kaz unable to understand bryces words his lips had split and peeled and burnt away and he could barely move his tongue kaz shrugged but i saw in his eyes a reflection of my own horror that anyone even someone as evil as bryce was forced to remain alive in this condition for weeks now his every moment had been agony i was surprised that he hadnt gone insane im sorry i said my voice softening i dont understand youll help us right just nod if you can he ducked his chin a fraction of an inch but his gaping mouth worked spittle forming at the corners and he tried again kihhh eee kihhh eee hes saying kill me kaz said is that right bryce managed a nod he wanted us to kill him to put him out of his misery i rested my trembling hands gently on the starched white linens of the bed there was no way i could do what he asked even if it was the humane choice but i could offer him something else i can heal you i whispered i dont know if i can bring you all the way back ive neveryour injuries are too but i might be able to heal you enough it would be the greatest challenge i had faced as a healer i would not have attempted it a month earlier or even a few days earlier but i had healed jess i had healed kaz and each time i laid my hands on a wound each time i felt the force within me summon itself and gather and strengthen as the voices murmured and swelled i grew stronger and it wasnt just my skill that was growing there was something elsesomething tied to my deepest understanding of who i was the emotions that had defined me before id discovered my giftfear insecurity hopelessnesswere slipping away in their place was a growing conviction that i could do the things that had been ordained for me that i was a true and rightful healer and that my gift was meant to be used and used well we know youve been helping prentiss reconstruct your work but we need you to help us destroy it kaz said all the backups everything but it will take too long if we have to talk this way i added i need to heal you nnnnn nnn nnn bryce gasped as tears formed at the corners of his eyes welling up and then coursing down his ruined face he didnt want me to try to heal him was terrified that i might bring him only partway back forcing him to live like this indefinitely but there was no other way im sorry i said i have to touch you i closed my eyes and let the voices come let the ancient rhythms spin and unfurl the voices built until they reached my lips and my need to say the words overwhelmed me i tried to ignore bryces frantic terrified mewling as i laid my shaking hand against his chest i was as gentle as i knew how to be but my touch made him scream the most horrible sound i had ever heard pure pain compressed into a wail i felt my own tears come as the words whispered forth from my lips and my blood danced and rushed with a stronger force than id ever felt this was different from any healing id done before i could sense my gifts being drawn from further and further within the depths of my soul stretched and taxed almost unbearably as i struggled to meet the challenge of bryces terrible wounds it was too much under my hands bryces flesh thrummed once weakly but then i felt the healing change course and excruciating pain shot backward into me into the nerves of my fingers and along my arms into my very core an agony so exquisite it was unlike anything i had known anything i had imagined i wavered on the brink of consciousness all i had to do was let go take my hands off bryce and the pain would abate it would slip back into the shadows like a rubber band released like a wave racing back to the ocean as i hesitated the pain intensified a burning raw rasp along every nerve ending in my body black spots danced in front of my eyes and i heard nothing except for my own screams but even they were locked inside since the pain was greater than my will the pain ruled me preventing me from making a sound i felt my fingers tremble against bryces body and i knew that the pain was going to win that it was going to beat me i cant i said or dreamed i said i couldnt be sure the voices were fading the lyrical syllables chasing themselves into the darkness a whisper and then a sigh almost gone almost forgotten hailey i heard kazs worried voice but it was far away so far away all i had to do was let go there was no reason to be afraid i would let go i would send the pain hurtling back to the source to bryce it would leave my body and seek its host the burned and melted flesh of the man who had once sought to imprison me and use me to make zombies bryce deserved the pain he had brought it on himself he deserves this i almost gave in i nearly convinced myself to turn away the voices had faded to a faint hum and it was all i could do to keep from passing out the black spots in my mind bloomed and ran together like a nightmare played at high speed but then something shifted i hadnt come this far fought so hard lost so much only to give up when i was tested i might have questioned and even despised my gift i might have wished it away but it was as much a part of me as the heart that beat in my chest it wasnt merely chance that had brought me together with the damaged and the wounded i was meant to heal them i was meant to use my gift t√° m√© mol seo dra√≠ocht i whispered my lips trembling with the ancient words and before i could draw another breath the voices joined in stronger than before a chorus that wound up and down a beautiful dark scale a harmony that only i could hear i gave in to the voices but not before i tightened my fingers on bryces ruined flesh i felt his body spasm with agony but i held on na anam an corp cara √°r comhoibr√≠ i saw nothing the room fell away and we were alone me and bryce and the ancients my ancestors whose voices encouraged and strengthened me misgiving left me first and then doubt and finally pain i felt nothing at all except for the energy flowing between my fingertips and bryce other voices twined with the chant speaking words i did not know a mans voice sure and gentle and a womans soft murmur in answer i understood that they were the most ancient the ones who had been there at the beginning the original banished were beside me within me guiding me and in that moment i knew that they would be with me for the rest of my life and then i felt bryce respond just a tiny little tic a blip in the flow of energy but id felt it i started the chant one last time from the beginning and as i spoke the words clear and strong the other voices faded away one by one until the only one left was mine i felt sorrow for their absence as my body returned to me my vision flickered and i was aware of kaz next to me and there was a part of me that longed to follow the voices into the past into a place that time and death could not reach where i would be with my ancestors forever then i heard kaz whisper my name and i returned i finished the verse and lifted my hands from bryce letting my exhausted body fall into kazs arms as my vision cleared i saw bryce tremble and then go still his flesh crackled with energy his body sealing over the fissures on its own repairing the cracked and blackened tissues bursting forth with new cells i had done it i had healed the man whod tried to kill me and prairie the man whod come closer to pure evil than anyone else i had met our struggles were far from over and we were still in great danger but i had used my gift and used it well i felt strong arms around me and i knew that kaz would not let me falter he held me as i watched bryces tremors slowly subsiding i couldnt judge how far bryce had come but he was better his eyes no longer quivered in their sockets he licked his restored lips his exposed neck showed pink areas where healing appeared in the sheen of the flesh are you all right kaz demanded i nodded i felt finebetter in fact than i had before i touched bryce we need to go yeah look safian were out of here its gonna hurt like hell and we cant be dragging all this crap along so youre just going to have to hope that what hailey did was enough i pushed kaz gently away i could stand on my own and i was ready to run on my own and fast i had no idea how much longer we had before someone figured out what we were up to and came after us we need a laptop you heard her kaz said to dr grace who had been watching with a combination of fascination and horror he handed me the gun and started shoving the equipment away from bryces bed yanking out the tubes and peeling back the gauze from his body to free the ivs in his arms i kept the gun pointed at dr grace while i scanned the room spotting a laptop sitting on a desk crowded with papers the program open on the screen made no sense to me a chart with dozens of data points and a lot of scientific language along the bottombut that didnt matter im guessing this is password protected right i asked dr grace but i bet you have an override she shook her head no sorry i something in me snapped my new strength was accompanied by an impatience that bordered on rage we hadnt been through this much only to stop now i pointed the gun directly at dr graces heart and said try again im not as patient as he is reluctantly she went to the computer and typed a quick series of keystrokes i disabled password protection she said launch the browser she did so and when i was satisfied that it worked i snapped the laptop shut and tucked it under my arm so you dont need me now dr grace said ive given you the password and you have bryce go and ill stay here and i promise i wont sound the alarm you can even lock me in here and by the time they find me youll be long gone nice try kaz snapped but youre coming with us just in case we run into any trouble with the computer i dont know anything more about the programs than i just showed you she protested dont sell yourself short i said sarcastically but i didnt mention the other plan i had for her once we had destroyed the data i was going to make dr grace help us free chub lets go kaz said rolling bryces hospital bed away from the wall bryce had quieted down and i could see perspiration on his face on the skin that looked almost human again take us to your car kaz ordered dr grace i dont have a i pulled her keys out and shook them in her face i had noticed the logo on one of them its an audi dr grace does that refresh your memory and do you really want to take your chances with me now that you know how easily i can put you out she shook her head fear showing in her eyes so why dont you tell me about your car its a uh an a white thats better i said pocketing the keys again i know i dont need to tell you this kaz said but take us by whatever route passes the fewest people dr grace nodded and after i checked to make sure the hall was empty she led us through a part of the building i hadnt yet seen we took an elevator down two floors to a subbasement the cinderblock walls and concrete floors lit by fluorescent lights and after another brief walk we took a freight elevator back up and paused in front of a set of double doors this leads to the garage dr grace said go ahead i turned dr graces key in the lock and was getting ready to push when kaz stopped me no wait how do we know its really the garage she could have brought us anywhere i stared at the doors the freshly painted surfaces the gleaming hardware and realized that kaz had a point i rolled bryces bed backward away from the door but while kaz hesitated dr grace threw herself at the doors and they crashed open revealing a windowless room where three men worked at desks in a fraction of a second they bolted from their chairs and reached for their weapons one hit the floor and rolled and another fired at the doorframe sending splinters flying get them dr grace yelled but we were already on the move kaz shoved her from behind propelling her into the room and i threw the doors shut i heard a scream on the other side and realized that dr grace had been hit kaz yanked the bed linens off bryce revealing his wasted body in a hospital gown and muttered sorry before lifting bryce over his shoulder i flinched when bryce cried out from the pain come on kaz yelled and we dashed back down the hall the laptop heavy under my arm we rounded a corner and saw that the freight elevator was still waiting with open doors and we threw ourselves into it and i jabbed at the close button in seconds we were descending again i was half expecting the doors to open on someone pointing a gun in our faces but the corridor was still eerily quiet bryce moaned as kaz shifted his weight on his shoulders this way i said guessing a door marked authorized personnel only was propped open i felt for a switch found a bank of lights and shoved them all on kaz followed me into the room and i kicked the doorstop out of the way the door slammed and we were aloneand safe for the moment we were in the industrial heart of the building a cavernous room housing massive heating and cooling units with dozens of huge white pipes curving into the ceiling ladders and fire extinguishers were mounted on the wall the equipment hummed echoing off the concrete floors im setting you down kaz said easing bryce to the floor and then standing painfully massaging the strain from his shoulders bryce flopped like a rag doll and lay still we cant take him out of the building now i said i knew they must be sounding the alarm throughout the building trying to find us you have to do it here but hes out kaz said i knelt down next to him ill just heal him a little more i said then i have to go go where to get rattler and prairie ive been thinking about what you said you cant go out there now kaz protested its too dangerous i have to we need them to help us get chub out but theres and you have to stay here with bryce and make him help you destroy it all our eyes locked for a moment kazs fear for me battling his determination and then he nodded there was no other way there was a diagram on the wall that showed the heating and cooling infrastructure throughout the building see if you can figure out a route to the garage i suggested and then i took bryces hand i was pretending bravado i didnt feel but as i bent over bryce i forgot my fears and focused on making him just a little bit better i had to be careful i would be no good to anyone if i let the healing sap too much of my strength i needed only to keep bryce conscious and alert for the first time ever i was aware of holding back i had said the words often enough that they came automatically to my lips and i envisioned a barrier in my mind a black velvet curtain lowering and sealing off most of my energy releasing only enough of my gift to settle and calm bryces overtaxed heart to restore enough health to his lungs and throat that he could breathe and talk and then i pulled back i sensed the gift returning to me and swallowed the healing words but it had helped bryces skin looked better and a downy fuzz of hair had appeared on his skull his eyes were bright and alert and he licked his lips and raised his hand to scratch at his neck he no longer seemed to be drowning in pain mr safian i said carefully worried that he would turn back into a ruthless maniac now that he was feeling better you must help kaz now you need to tell him the commands to wipe out your remote backups can you do that for a moment he said nothing and i wondered what we would do if he refused now that i had brought him some relief from his suffering i doubted he would be as cooperative not only might he have decided he no longer wanted to diebut he might be eager to protect his lifes work i will do that he said his voice sounding rusty from lack of use its really important i said you have to make sure that no more bryce rasped no more healing no more zombies he pointed to himself i was wrong i deserved to die the things i have seen them do since they brought me hereevil things i never understood im sorry im so sorry his hand lifted weakly off the floor and he pressed his fingers to my face they were barely warm but i didnt pull away how can i believe you i asked before i wanted money power since i came here i have wanted only to die i never sleep the pain keeps me awake and i think of those young men every one of them they never leave me i didnt know what to say his regret seemed genuine the tears sparkling in his eyes real i wanted to believe but after everything he had done hailey you have to go now kaz said well be fine here come take a look at this he led me to the diagram and showed me that the garage was located directly above us one floor below ground level look here kaz said pointing to a box with an x in the far corner of the square labeled hvac this vent goes straight into the garage he pointed to the corner of the room where a large square grate had been installed in the ceiling you want me to crawl up there i asked skeptically thats got to be fifteen feet off the ground kaz pointed to the ladders at first the task seemed hopeless even with the ladder we dragged over my fingertips barely touched the grate i could reach one of the clips holding the grate in place but even if we moved the ladder so i could loosen each of them id still have no way to get up there i need your help i said a boost i climbed down to the floor and kaz hoisted me onto his shoulders i blushed when he grabbed my ankles to keep me steady but he didnt seem to mind he climbed the ladder slowly my hands wrapped tightly under his chin until he was standing on the top step now that i could reach all the clips i worked at them frantically looking down was scary and several times kaz wavered and i almost lost my balance but healers arent like ordinary people were stronger faster hardier and more coordinated and when the last of the clips clattered to the floor i reached up for one of the braces holding the ceiling in place i gripped it tightly and swung myself up sliding my feet into the opening and scooting into the tight space i blinked away cobwebs and saw that beyond the opening was a large hollow vent go i said to kaz you have to hurry wait hailey i turned my hair falling in my face and saw him framed in the opening his gray eyes flickering with uncertainty just be careful he finally said and held up his hand i reached back down and our fingers touched for a second i closed my eyes and let the energy travel between us the attraction of the banished the strength of our blood and our history and then i pushed forward as though all our lives depended on it soon soon hailey had come to see him and that was good and kaz came and that was good too he showed hailey the book with the worm he wanted to show hailey the book with the spider but hailey and kaz had to go hailey had to fix the monster man and kaz had to help chub was ready but he was scared he had a mindpicture of where he had to go and he had to go soon and he hadnt had a chance to tell hailey he had to go the mindpicture showed him where that way and then turn and turn and turn big room box piles all the boxes and the cans the door at the end the door at the end was open and that was where he had to go chub was scared but he knew he wouldnt get in trouble he was scared and he wished he could have told hailey where he had to go but the mindpicture didnt come until after she left he wasnt going to tell anyone else something was wrong with the lady with the brown glasses she wasnt coming someone else would come soon soon chub stood right next to the door hide hide hide because when the person came he was going to run fast the mindpicture showed him where to go and he would be fast and the person would not be fast enough to catch him chub waited ready to run the sun was sinking into the horizon when i pulled out onto the road the car bucking and lurching in my uncertain hands the brakes on dr graces car were far more sensitive than the ones on prairies camry and the steering wheel spun too easily making the car swerve and dip as i barreled down the road away from the office park the garage had been nearly empty when i popped the grate only a dozen yards from where id climbed into the ceiling id counted fewer than two dozen cars and it had been easy to find the audi i didnt see anyone as i drove it out of the complex but i knew the garage was monitored and i didnt know how much of a lead i could count on i half expected to see headlights in my rearview mirror but i had an advantage sixteen years in gypsum sixteen years of exploring every road and field and farm so i knew exactly which roads intersected others which dirt tracks overgrown with weeds led to leaning barns and which to shortcuts to neighboring land i took a looping haphazard route and when i finally wound back to state road there was no one behind me no telltale dust cloudnothing at all except the purple evening sky the first fireflies of the night dancing in the air when i passed the house i had lived in until a few months earlier i saw that all the windows had been broken plywood was nailed over a few of them but the front door had been ripped from the hinges and a sodden pile of tornout carpet lay in the yard everyone in town knew that gram had dealt drugs and not long ago three people had died here no wonder someone had trashed the place before i could think of a single thing to miss about the old house it was in my rearview mirror and the thickening evening obscured the woods as i drove the last mile to the edge of trashtown i eased the car to the side of the road and watched the lights winking on in the rows of shacks lining both sides of morrin street the morries all lived here the scrawny meaneyed boys with dirt under their nails the pale mumbling girls with long stringy hair obscuring their faces there were fifteen maybe twenty morrie kids in my old high school more in the younger grades sullen brothers and sisters whose past was entwined with mine and prairies even annas and kazs their futures were bleak their weak banished blood condemned them to meanness and shiftlessness and addiction hardscrabble lives lived out here in trashtown few would escape the way prairie had or even the way i had by accident the morries had always hated me though maybe not as much as they hated gram even while their fathers and uncles and older brothers fell further and further into her debt buying her weed and prescription drugs maybe they blamed me for that if the morries knew about prentisss plan to round up the seers and put them to work they might even be pleased prentiss would pay themfar more than they got from the state or from their occasional construction and factory jobs with the lab right here in town it would be almost like an office job the kind for which they were routinely passed over for a moment despair clouded my mind pressing against my temples making my breath come in ragged gasps not ten miles away chub was still trapped and kaz was in danger but i was the only one who could help now and i would do what needed to be done i put the car in gear again and lurched down morrin street i thought of the very few times id been brave enough to ride my bike around the edges of trashtown before i knew i was banished spying on the people who lived there as they went about their lives longing to join them and not understanding why now that i was finally on the inside it looked even more broken down more desperate junker cars and trucks were parked in the dirt porches sagged roofs were missing shingles even in the twilight i knew rattlers truck the minute i passed it hed driven the old green ford around town for years it seemed as though it was held together by rust the sound of its grinding gears and wornout muffler used to be enough to set my heart pounding with fear but now i was relieved to see it i parked behind it and trailed my hand along the side as i hurried past it to the house the hood was warm the truck had been driven recently the lawn hadnt been mowed in weeks and my shoes slapped against the weedy grass i took the rotting uneven porch steps with care the house was no different from its neighbors weathered wood showing through the peeling paint an old black iron mailbox hanging at an angle from a single nail an overturned bucket the only object on the sloped porch through a limp gray curtain a weak light shined but the upper windows were dark i smelled mildew and garbage and smoke i took a breath and thought of chub and prairie and raised my hand to knock before my fist could strike the door it opened and i was staring into the harshplaned face and spinning milky eye of rattler sikes it was like he had been waiting there for me still as a snake ready to strike haileygirl he said softly come to see your papa prairie stepped from the shadows she pushed rattler out of the way and gathered me into her arms with a soft cry and i knew her from her scent from her silky hair from the tight embrace that seemed as though it would go on forever when she finally released me her voice was choked with tears of relief thank god she breathed and i almost broke prairie i there were a thousand things i wanted to say to her most of them apologies i was sorry id lied to her sorry id thought i could protect us better than she could sorry id taken her for granted sorry id let evil find us sorry i hadnt been there for her but there wasnt time so i settled for the most important i love you rattler raised his hand and i flinched waiting for the blowbut he only turned on a light switch illuminating a neat parlor with furniture that looked like it was a century old the arms covered with crocheted doilies and wood floors swept clean my girls he said as though it amused him weve struck a deal prairie said stiffly what do you mean i asked rattler had a vision hailey all of you out at quadrillon he says troubles coming tonight big trouble rattler echoed death dealin and blood runnin youre going to help us i demanded hell yes i am rattler drawled fact we were just on our way when you showed up i got the truck loaded up ready prairie steered me back onto the porch we need to go we can talk on the way only then did i see that she had a belt slung around her waist that was clearly too big a holster holding a handgun clipped to the front i gasped and prairies expression turned grim whyhow its rattlers she said hes got one for you too hailey what exactly is this deal you made she looked deep into my eyes her expression sad you dont need to know the particulars hailey oh yes i do i protested refusing to step out of her way prairie sighed and put her hand to her throat and i knew she was touching the ruby pendant that matched mine all right she finally said rattlers going to help us get chub out well find kaz and the three of you will go back to chicago rattlers promised he wont look for you there ever again youll be free hailey but what about you i asked my blood suddenly running cold because i already knew the answer i knew the deal that prairie had made shed traded herself to rattler to buy our freedom rattler drove straight through town not bothering to disguise his route i knew that people got out of the way when they saw rattlers truck coming because any encounter with rattler was bad news whether you were banished or not no one followed us it was past the dinner hour now and people were at home for the night the trucks shocks had seen better days and every jolt and bump jarred my spine but rattler didnt seem to mind i was wedged against the passenger door between us prairie rode with her hands folded in her lap and her head held high i knew better than to try to argue with her now but i couldnt believe she had agreed to stay with rattler once this night was done shed done it for me and chub and for anna and kaz shed done it so that rattler would never come after us never drag us back to trashtown to live out our lives in poverty and abuse i felt sick at heart knowing what she was willing to sacrifice to save us i told her almost everything about how sorry i was that wed left her behind about our pulling over to rest and rattler and dereks finding us about surviving the explosion only to end up in prentisss new headquarters about seeing chub and dr grace and bryce and about the terrible thing prentiss had asked me to do about nearly falling for the trap and escaping to the utility room and about kazs plan to destroy the data before we got back there were a few things i didnt tell her about like the night kaz and i had stayed in the motel and the kiss wed shared and the room rattler had set up for her with the photo of the two of them when they were children those things i saved to tell her later because that way i could pretend that there would be a later that she would be leaving with me when everything was over throughout the trip rattler drove with a half smile on his face every now and then he rested one of his big callused hands on prairies knee it was as though he was trying to reassure himself that she was really there as though he didnt quite trust his spinning eye not to conjure her image from nothing if rattler was afraid he didnt show it and if prairie was afraid her fear had little to do with the next few hoursand much to do with what would follow we fell silent as we pulled off the road we approached the circular drive in front of the complex on foot staying in the shadows cast by the decorative landscape lighting the foyer was dark the reception desk empty but i knew that inside a frantic search was going on if it hadnt already concluded with kazs capture i was waiting for the doors to open with shouts and gunfire when a small figure shot out of the bushes and came running toward us at a gallop then collided with me nearly knocking me down hayee it was chub we tumbled together hugging each other chub babbling excitedly me holding on for dear life prairie was next she scooped him up and kissed his cheeks his forehead he laughed and shrieked with delightand then suddenly he stopped he regarded rattler solemnly from the safety of prairies arms your eye hurts rattler chuckled no little man it dont this heres a magic eye it tells me tales but chub shook his head and ducked his chin it hurts he repeated it makes you sad rattlers grin faltered but he played along winking at chub i aint sad youre lookin at a man whats about to do what he does best gonna bust some ass and take whats mine is what were fixin to do we cant take chub in there with us i protested he can wait in the truck rattler said jes as soons he shows us how he got out here in the first place we followed chub back along a brick path that wound behind lattice screens thick with wisteria shielded from view the path took a turn toward the back of the complex where dumpsters were clustered next to a loading dock the air smelled of garbage and flies buzzed i saw that i saw that door chub said proudly pointing sure enough a door stood open trash bags were stacked haphazardly outside as though someone had been interrupted in the middle of a task by an alarm sounding through the complex for instance ill take the youngun back rattler said reaching for chub but chub backed away from him clearly frightened oh now i wont hurt you none rattler crooned the sound curdled my blood my fathers voice was not one that would ever sing a lullaby or soothe an injured child there was no comfort in it and chubwho knew far more than most little boysdidnt trust it not until i told him to i hated doing it but there was no other way chub you go with mr sikes now i said kneeling down to give him a hug and a kiss you get to sit in his nice big truck and wait just a little while and then ill be back for you lie down and try to sleep and maybe youll have a nice dream chub looked skeptical but he reluctantly went to rattler rattler was back in moments we were barely inside the building when we heard a womans scream i had become familiar enough with the layout of the place to know that the scream came from the direction of the atrium at the center of the complex i led the way fear boosting my adrenaline behind me rattler jogged along holding weapons in both hands i didnt know guns so i wasnt sure what they were but one looked like a regular handgun and the other like something out of a video game big and heavy the scream came again stark with horror and fear dr graces voice it sounded like as we rounded the last turn i saw that i was right dr grace her hands bound behind her was standing on a circular coffee table turning one way and then another nearly tripping herself in her panic a red stain on one shoulder revealed where shed been shot it looked like the bullet hadnt done much damage it certainly wasnt the reason she was screaming circling the table where she stood was a ring of zombies holy i heard rattler mutter behind me and just in time i turned to see him raising both his weapons in the air dont i said you cant kill them like that rattler glared at me but he didnt shoot and we stopped at the edge of the atrium stunned by the scene dr grace was not alone bryce had been propped up on the floor against the coffee table at dr graces feet he was conscious his eyes tracking the action in the room and his color was returning as his flesh continued to knit next to him crouched kaz pleading with dr grace in a low voice telling her to stay calm many of the chairs in the room were occupied and i recognized the staff id encountered over the last couple of days biceps texas the servers from the cafeteria the security staff the researchers id passed in the halls and up front standing on a huge flagstone hearth was prentiss watching the proceedings as though they amused him he caught my eye and gave me a chilling smile hailey prentiss called how delightful to see you and prairie what a nice surprise i had hoped to welcome you personally but things did get fouled up didnt they nevertheless we are pleased you could make it and mr sikes my intrepid partner his voice turned cold youve supplied me with one challenge after another shut your mouth you damn windbag rattler snapped you got whats mine one a my people let im go now and well be on our way your people prentiss pretended to be confused oh you must mean young mr sawicki i am afraid i will be requiring his services in fact we were just having a staff meeting to introduce him and of course to discipline dr grace who was careless enough to allow him and young hailey to cause quite a disruption and now youve brought the tarbells to join us how very expedient kaz had gotten to his feet and clambered up onto the coffee table where he was trying to quiet dr grace he shot me a smile that didnt reach his eyes ima start shootin now rattler said ill drop one a your folks at a time until you start talkin sense before anyone could react a shot echoed through the space and there was a sharp exclamation the man who had served me my lunch the day before fell to the carpet clutching his arm and moaning i hadnt even seen him move jes so you know if ida meant to kill im hed be a dead man rattler added placidly prentiss chuckled impressive i suppose when one hails from a backwater town such as this only dont forget my dear man that im always a step ahead of you he motioned with his outstretched arms and the staff rose from their seats endearing really your bravado prentiss said on the floor the injured man moaned and clutched his elbow especially when my men could exterminate you in three seconds flat oh yes on my signal they rattlers guns exploded a second time several bursts in quick succession a man fell from the secondfloor balcony hitting the ground with a sickening thud and another lurched from the shadows across the room took two tottering steps and fell in a spray of his own blood for a moment rattler and prentiss stared at each other and then prentiss continued in a tight voice as though rattler hadnt just shot two of his guards are ready to act on my command is what i was going to say mr sikes my men are disciplined they respond only to my orders although if you really want to see impressive loyalty you need only look to the subjects of my study my passion you might call them the results of millions of dollars and years of research the fruit of a collaborative effort that your own people as you call them have made possible there was silence as all eyes turned to the zombies who had stayed motionless prentiss walked slowly across the room gentlemen he said when he was only a few feet from the ring of zombies seize the tarbells the gasp that went up throughout the room echoed my own shock i staggered backward to prairie and grabbed her hand and we held tightly to each other i frantically searched the room for an escape but the only exits were blocked by prentisss men the zombies did not hurry they shambled their steps uncertain and almost comic the motions of a drunkard their hands reached out toward us and their mouths opened with flesh lust and i heard my own whimper of fear no another voice rasped out and the zombies slowed they turned one after another tottering on their rotting limbs staring without emotion at the source of the voice bryce he had managed to drag himself into one of the chairs his face red with exertion no do not do what prentiss says no waitgo to prentiss now stop prentiss barked you forgot bryce said all the training protocols the recordings the sessions whose voice were they in general dont call me that prentiss protested his cultivated voice going high and thin oh but thats what i always called you back in the day bryce said with effort he pushed himself into a standing position leaning against the chair for support the general you used to like it dont you remember made you feel important made you feel like you were a part of the team the zombies approached prentiss clustering together like a secondgrade class on a field trip but you were never part of the team general bryce went on it seemed almost like he was starting to enjoy the conversation i was the one who made it work i was the one who figured out the impossible and now im the one who has destroyed it all you hear me general its gone every last backup the boy and i made sure of it and now its time for you to be gone too prentisss mouth worked in terror but nothing came out no one will grieve you when youre gone bryce continued no one will remember you at all didnt you ever learn general that prides a sin one of the men at the periphery had been stealthily advancing creeping along the bases of the chairs trying to get a clear shot at rattler as bryce rambled on rattler suddenly whipped around toward the creeping guard and took his shot and the guard fell to the carpet prides a sin bryce repeated almost reflectively and i guess no one knows that more than me deactivate alistair prentiss please prentiss stood his ground for ten maybe even twenty seconds sputtering and making threats before he turned and tried to bolt from the room but hed gone only a step or two before rattler shot the ground at his feet and he spun and cried out in fear after that it was just a matter of waiting we all waited the staff cowering in their small groups clutching each other for comfort me and prairie who had never let go kaz who wrapped his arms around dr grace to block out the sounds most of all prentiss waited his eyes going twitchy with terror as the first of the zombies set upon him i wont describe the rest i turned away after a few seconds the zombies kept coming relentless and it was a mercy that they set upon his throat first so we didnt have to listen to his screams it was over fast when prentiss was dead the pack dropped him to the floor without ceremony their task finished and then bryces voice was heard again now come to me they started across the floor festooned with prentisss blood and bryce stood tall and proud a slight tremor the only evidence of his bodys frail state the zombies circled him in an evertightening scrum and when they were so close that they bumped into each other he took a deep breath and spoke in a calm voice open those doors and take me down into the waters with you and keep me there until the breath has left us all i opened my mouth to protest prairie tensed and held me even more tightly but no one tried to stop them the zombies did as they were told they were not humans anymore just flesh sacks that could follow orders and they picked up bryce as though he weighed nothing and carried him out the glass doors overlooking the pond it was lovely in the moonlight its blueblack surface broken only by the occasional water bug our view through the spotless windows was perfectly clear as the zombies held bryce aloft like a treasured trophy and walked into the water indifferent they waded through the cluster of lily pads then they began to submerge one by one their expressionless faces sinking into the moonlit water up to their chins their noses and finally their eyes until those too were extinguished at last it was only bryce who remained cradled in a dozen decaying hands and then even his serene face slipped below bubbles rose to the surface and then disappeared i trembled with the horror of what id witnessed but now i knew bryce really had repented in the end hed done the one thing that would prevent anyone from forcing him to replicate his work ever again hed given kaz the passwords and together theyd wiped out the data once and for all anyone else rattler demanded id noticed the staff slipping away one by one toward the doors skirting the mess that had been prentiss kaz gave dr grace a little push and she stumbled after the others i said anyone else want to step up rattler demanded again no well be leaving then i imagine your little deal with the townfolks officially over now this placell be crawlin soon and i was you i guess id be trying to get outta here kaz reached for my hand and drew me close i hugged him hard making room for prairie to join us but she didntand then i saw that rattler was holding her hand tightly when her gaze met my eyes for a moment i thought i saw something of her old spirit therea flash of defiancebefore she turned away but then her shoulders slumped as she trailed behind rattler she was his now she had bought our freedom with her promise chub had fallen asleep in the cab of rattlers truck curled up with his fist pressed to his cheek he woke when i opened the door then he yawned and held up his arms prairie picked him up and held him close and he wrapped his arms around her neck and went back to sleep as she kissed him ill ride up front prairie said she had directed her words to rattler who was stowing his firearms in a metal box behind the seat but there was a note of uncertainty in her voice she was asking his permission my heart constricted this was her new life then rattler was now her mate and her master and she would have to beg for every favor and freedom shed done it for me and kaz and anna and chub i wanted to protest to tell her that she and i would take our chances together i had survived too much to be afraid and id go anywhere with prairie face anything and i knew kaz would too but the problem was that it wasnt just us rattler snapped the lid of the box and spun the padlock then put a hand on the driver door and considered prairie who was shivering in the cool of the evening you ride next to me put the boy on your lap you two in back prairie complied without a word settling chub onto her lap where he snuggled in and fell back asleep kaz shut her door gently then it was just me and kaz out on the road i saw the first of the cars peeling out of the garage county fire and emergency would not be here for a while i guessed since prentiss had no doubt paid them handsomely to keep their distance eventually though they would come and they would find the place deserted except for the bodies in the atrium bryce and the zombies would wash up on the edges of the pond depending how long it took maybe their decomposition would be chalked up to the time in the water one thing was sure no one would ever know what had really happened here bryce and prentiss were dead the research was finally destroyed the banished once again would be free to live their lives in peace kaz offered me a hand and we scrambled up the bumper into the truck bed the cold wind whipped our faces but kaz wrapped his arms around me and i closed my eyes and held on but the truck didnt move i waited shivering in kazs arms for the engine to turn over off to the west of the office park i saw a bobbing flickering light someone had had the sense to find a flashlight before running good for themtheyd be glad to have it when the moon went behind a cloud after several long moments the passenger door opened and prairie got out carrying chub he was sleeping soundly loose as a rag doll in her arms get out hurry she said i need you to hold him what about rattlers taken care of prairie cut me off flashing me a quick humorless smile come on hailey that trick you pulled with maynard what youre not the only girl in town who can do that prairie added only i did it with a kiss i imagined how it had gone rattler alone with his love at last chub sleeping between them rattler unable to wait stealing a kiss before he took her home to start his new empire the determination and loathing id glimpsed which shed kept coiled and hidden all through her ordeal bursting free coursing through her body into his intensified by the blood bond between them the eternal attraction of the banished hurry prairie urged and kaz and i scrambled out of the truck bed i took chub from her and hitched him up on my shoulder as she leaned back into the truck and rooted around behind the seat when she straightened she was holding one of rattlers gunsthe smaller one which still seemed plenty big to me it looked at home in her hand and i realized that id never asked her if she knew how to shoot she seemed to read my mind as she gestured at rattler with the gun he was slumped over the steering wheel his arms limp at his sides who do you think taught me she asked her voice as hard and cold as steel him and dun acey first it was bb guns in the woods didnt take long to move on from there she took aim and i almost stopped her because i was remembering the photo in the room rattler had prepared for her two skinny kids playing in the creek the look of longing on his face as she sparkled and danced in the sun hed been a dangerous and reckless child hed grown into a dangerous and twisted man but he had loved her always and that love refused to die he was my father but hed never loved me only one woman would ever shine for him and every terrible thing hed done since i met him hed done for her that was my last thought before she shot him prairie wanted to leave him there lying in the dirt outside the office park she figured his death would be chalked up as one more casualty of the nights violence and i knew she was right but i insisted we take him home to die he never regained consciousness blood bubbled from his nostrils and trailed from his slack mouth prairie had shot him in the chest and there was a rattling wheeze as he struggled to breathe we laid him out in the passenger seat and i held chub on my lap in the back with kaz as prairie drove through town and into the darkened streets of trashtown curtains moved and lights flickered in the windows of the houses along morrin street despite the late hour people were up restless souls looking for a high bitter men looking for a target for their anger fearful women hiding in their own homes the audi was still parked in front of rattlers house where id left it and i imagined that everyone in town had noticed it and wondered who had come to call unsettled by indecipherable waking dreams of water and blood the seers would have known something was coming prairie parked and we got out of the truck chub slept on oblivious kaz opened the passenger door and our eyes met ill carry him in why dont you and prairie get in the audi with chubill be right back no the firmness of my voice surprised me im coming no one spoke for a moment prairie slowly got out of the car wiping blood from her arm she stared at rattler like shed never seen him before and i realized that in a way she hadnt at least shed never looked at him without fear before never known him when he wasnt a danger to her give prairie the keys kaz said gently i did then i handed chub over and prairie cradled him in her arms and walked slowly toward the audi without looking back it was down to kaz and me he dragged rattler from the car and got him over his shoulders in a firemans carry it took effort rattler was solidly built every ounce of him muscle and bone i walked ahead and when we reached the front door i knew the knob would turn in my hand id guessed that rattler would not lock his home that he would not be afraid of any threat that could come through his front door i was right inside i snapped on a light switch and the front parlor was lit with the ocher glow from a china lamp on a battered hutch even in the dim light i could see that rattler had made an effort to prepare his home for prairie every surfacethe humble pine floors the old furniture the paneled wallswas scrubbed and gleaming yellowed laceedged linens were draped over tables crumbling crocheted doilies covered chair backs jars of wildflowers lined the windowsills my heart hitched as kaz laid rattler on a faded sofa his long legs extending far past the end it had been important to me that my father die here in his home among the banished there was no love between us i knew that besides prairie and chub he was the only family i had leftbut more important he was my link to my ancestors and the blood that ran in my veins was his blood i owed at least some part of my strength my determination even my bravery to him as i knelt in front of him i could feel the energy of the place the low thrumming familiar heartbeat of my ancestors who lived on in the very soil here the blood shed in these streets was banished blood the tears that fell in the rooms of these shacks were banished tears our people had gone terribly wrong since theyd left the ancient village centuries earlier but as i watched my dying father take his last struggling breaths i knew that i would never be able to turn my back on them on who i was i looked up at kaz he was watching me his expression full of concern youre going to heal him he whispered he knew it before i did but once he said the words my hands were already reaching for rattler i was going to heal him not because i wanted to but because i had to compared to healing bryce healing my father was simple the words slipped from my lips the energy traveled smoothly through my fingertips into his damaged flesh almost instantly i felt the jagged edge of the bullet wound begin to skim over beginning the process was easy stopping it was hard i took a deep breath squeezed my eyes shut and wrenched my hands away in the middle of the verse a splitting pain sliced through my head and my hands twitched as though id been electrocuted i almost fell but kaz crouched beside me and put his arms around me whats wrong he demanded what happened im okay i said hoarsely disentangling myself from his arms and easing myself into a straight chair next to the sofa i just need to talk to him for a minute would you mind i need to do this alone kaz hesitated but he bent and kissed me on the forehead ill be right outside he whispered before stepping out onto the front porch rattler was awake now and he was watching me his eyes narrowed and his mouth a tight line i knew he was in a lot of pain i could sense it in the connection between us i also knew he would live if i left right nowif he got to a hospital quickly enough if they took the bullet out if he followed doctors orders i had not healed him all the way i had stopped well shy of restoring his flesh id slowed the leaking of his blood and i sensed that i had fixed something critical that had been severedthat much i could tell from the exchange of energy that ran between us youll be all right i muttered i didnt want rattler to die i didnt want his death on my conscience i wasnt afraid of him not really not anymore his gifts were strong but so were mine as hard as he fought for what he believed was rightfully his i would fight harder if i needed to but there was prairie to consider and there was chub i leaned closer so that our faces were only inches apart up close i saw how fine and unlined his skin still was and something else for the first time i noticed that his nose his chin his eyebrowsall of them were similar to mine he was unquestionably my father but i owed him nothing you cant have her i said softly he started to speak then grimaced with pain when he tried again it was through gritted teeth bb bitch shot me shell do it again i said and so will i if you evereverthreaten any of us again if you so much as show your face to me or her or chub or kaz or anna this is your one chance next time i let you die rattlers eyes sparked with fury and his mouth curled with contempt id li li like to see you try he said and then he passed out his words barely registered in my mind i was already long gone epilogue july they were setting fireworks off over the lake tonight kaz told me about ithow they loaded the fireworks on barges and floated them off the lakeshore the colorful explosions competing with the beauty of the chicago skyline i couldnt imagine anything more spectacular but there would always be next year we were staying with anna and kaz it had been a week since the terrible night in the office park after we left trashtown kaz had driven all night long and we got to their house as the sun rose high in the sky above the north side of chicago hed called ahead and anna was waiting on the back porch for us the dark circles under her eyes testament to her worry since wed been gone a week later the dark circles had faded and there was laughter in the house as chub chased the cat and sang elmo songs and anna cooked one delicious polish meal after another and prairie and i slept late and we all took long walks along the lakefront we didnt talk about what had happened that would come soon i was sure as would discussions about the futurewhere wed live where id go to school in the fall what prairie would do for work but a few things were certain we werent changing our names again we werent going to run anymore and we were all going to stay in each others lives somehow evenespeciallyme and kaz i knew this not as a seer knows thingsi didnt know what shape our relationship would take or where our paths would leadbut i knew he would always be there for me just as i knew the exact shade of his eyes and the way his heartbeat felt when i leaned against his chest this morning prairie announced that we had a special mission to take care of from the looks she and anna exchanged i knew theyd already talked about it but it wasnt until prairie and i were in the car that she told me anything more anna and kaz stayed behind with chub but anna gave prairie a small plastic bag as we left prairie slipped it into her purse but not until id glimpsed the syringe it held you remember vincent prairie said softly as we drove northwest through the city neighborhoods how could i forget i remembered his vacant staring eyes his wasted body motionless in the hospital bed his waxy skin and shrunken form kept alive only by the extraordinary efforts of experimental medicine but most of all i remembered the anguish in prairies eyes when she looked at him even after so many years had passed since her greatest mistake the first time i saw vincent i was horrified by prairies choice she had brought vincent back from death healed him after the last breath left his body it was the one thing i knew must never be done and id been sure i would never be tempted but that was before i fell in love as we drove through the night i thought about kaz lying wounded in the dirt after the pollitt house blew up i remembered my terror when his eyes rolled up in his head my desperate grief when i couldnt find his pulse i remembered my tears falling on his beautiful face and the warmth of his hand in mine and i wondered if i would have had the strength to let him go when we arrived at the tidy brick convalescent home prairie chose a parking space at the far end of the parking lot out of the glare of the streetlamps she cut the engine and turned to me this is risky she said you dont have to come im coming i thought youd say that she hesitated a moment longer and then she brushed her hand across my cheek a simple gesture that made my heart tighten i loved her so much i didnt know how to put it into words but i would never take her for granted again if there was any way i could be there for her i would never let her face another difficult moment by herself not only had she risked her own safety for me over and over but she and i had both had enough of being alone in the world neither of us had parents neither of us had siblings but we had each other when we entered the lobby prairie held her head high and pasted on her fake friendly smile if i hadnt known her so well i would have thought she was just another pretty career woman her face obscured by the sweep of glossy hair that fell over one eye at the desk she paused to sign the guest register i dont think weve met she said to the attendant a boredlooking young woman with her finger marking her page in a book im veronica here visiting my dad im just a temp the attendant said stifling a yawn everyone wanted off for the holiday lucky them prairie murmured as we walked away at vincents door she quickly looked up and down the hall and then we slipped inside and it was just as id remembered vincent must have been handsome at one time id tried imagining him the way prairie described himthe football star full of life dancing with her at the high school prom vowing to be with her forever driving to the lake the night before he planned to buy her a promise ring the accident he wasnt handsome anymore the extraordinary efforts of the researchers had seen to that preserving his tissues long after they should have crumbled to dust at his bedside prairie stiffened and made a small sounda single choked soband then she put her hand on my arm and gently but firmly pushed me away this will only take a minute she said and her voice was steady i retreated to the corner of the room the single lamp created shadows across the scene before me but i saw prairie take the small bag from her purse prepare the syringe and slip the needle into the skin between his fingers he didnt react i didnt know if it should have hurt it didnt matter moments passed prairies shoulders stiff and unmoving the thing that had once been vincent did not move its eyes did not blink at last prairie turned away from the bed and i saw that tears streaked her smooth face its done she said softly and we left the room for the last time back at the house she and anna had a quick whispered conversation and then anna hugged her i didnt know what had been in the syringe i did know that anna with her nursing school training and access to the hospital pharmacy must have given her something deadly and hard to detect not that i was worried i was pretty sure that no one would question the death of a nursing home patient whose very existence was still a mystery to researchers after all these years kaz came into the kitchen carrying chub upside down chub was giggling so hard his cheeks had turned bright pink anna took the plastic off a platter sitting on the kitchen table and i saw that she had made almond rogaliki my favorite and decorated them with red white and blue piped icing and i have a treat she said her eyes dancing with excitement she ushered us out into the backyard and took a long narrow box from her apron sparklers id never held one before each of usme prairie and chub his hand firmly enclosed in kazs large oneheld a sparkler to the lighter anna produced from another pocket and i gasped when the long wands burst into magnificent showers of dancing light we laughed as the tiny pinpricks of heat bounced off our skin and we trailed our sparklers through the night writing our names in the air and making giant swirls and spirals at last the final sparkler fizzled out and we were left in the dark once again but there was a bright moon above us and i could see kazs smile the one he saved just for me far in the distance i heard the echoing boom of fireworks but when kaz wrapped his arms around me all i heard was his heart beating strong and sure much later i was the only one still awake in the little house i was sharing a room with chub listening to him sigh and murmur in his dreams while i stared out the window at the same silvery moon i didnt know the future i didnt know who i would be tomorrow but i had made peace with who i had been until now i couldnt change the past that had brought me this far but i knew where i was now in this moment i was with people who loved me other banished who had made the long journey over time and distance and bloodshed and battle and loss i was safe loved and cherished and it was enough about the author sophie littlefield also writes crime fiction and urban fantasy for adults her first novel about hailey tarbell
