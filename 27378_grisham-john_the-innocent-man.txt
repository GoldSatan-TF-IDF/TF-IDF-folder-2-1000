john grisham the innocent man chapter the rolling hills of southeast oklahoma stretch from norman across to arkansas and show little evidence of the vast deposits of crude oil that were once beneath them some old rigs dot the countryside the active ones churn on pumping out a few gallons with each slow turn and prompting a passerby to ask if the effort is really worth it many have simply given up and sit motionless amid the fields as corroding reminders of the glory days of gushers and wildcatters and instant fortunes there are rigs scattered through the farmland around ada an old oil town of sixteen thousand with a college and a county courthouse the rigs are idle thoughthe oil is gone money is now made in ada by the hour in factories and feed mills and on pecan farms downtown ada is a busy place there are no empty or boardedup buildings on main street the merchants survive though much of their business has moved to the edge of town the cafes are crowded at lunch the pontotoc county courthouse is old and cramped and full of lawyers and their clients around it is the usual hodgepodge of county buildings and law offices the jail a squat windowless bomb shelter was for some forgotten reason built on the courthouse lawn the methamphetamine scourge keeps it full main street ends at the campus of east central university home to four thousand students many of them commuters the school pumps life into the community with a fresh supply of young people and a faculty that adds some diversity to southeastern oklahoma few things escape the attention of the ada evening news a lively daily that covers the region and works hard to compete with the oklahoman the states largest paper theres usually world and national news on the front page then state and regional then the important items high school sports local politics community calendars and obituaries the people of ada and pontotoc county are a pleasant blend of smalltown southerners and independent westerners the accent could be from east texas or arkansas with flat is and other long vowels its chickasaw country oklahoma has more native americans than any other state and after a hundred years of mixing many of the white folks have indian blood the stigma is fading fast indeed there is now pride in the heritage the bible belt runs hard through ada the town has fifty churches from a dozen strains of christianity they are active places and not just on sundays there is one catholic church and one for the episcopalians but no temple or synagogue most folks are christians or claim to be and belonging to a church is rather expected a persons social status is often determined by religious affiliation with sixteen thousand people ada is considered large for rural oklahoma and it attracts factories and discount stores workers and shoppers make the drive from several counties it is eighty miles south and east of oklahoma city and three hours north of dallas everybody knows somebody working or living in texas the biggest source of local pride is the quarterhorse bidness some of the best horses are bred by ada ranchers and when the ada high cougars win another state title in football the town struts for years its a friendly place filled with people who speak to strangers and always to each other and are anxious to help anyone in need kids play on shaded front lawns doors are left open during the day teenagers cruise through the night causing little trouble had it not been for two notorious murders in the early s ada would have gone unnoticed by the world and that would have been just fine with the good folks of pontotoc county as if by some unwritten city ordinance most of the nightclubs and watering holes in ada were on the periphery of the town banished to the edges to keep the riffraff and their mischief away from the better folks the coachlight was one such place a cavernous metal building with bad lighting cheap beer jukeboxes a weekend band a dance floor and outside a sprawling gravel parking lot where dusty pickups greatly outnumbered sedans its regulars were what you would expectfactory workers looking for a drink before heading home country boys looking for fun latenight twentysomethings and the dance and party crowd there to listen to live music vince gill and randy travis passed through early in their careers it was a popular and busy place employing many parttime bartenders and bouncers and cocktail waitresses one was debbie carter a twentyoneyearold local girl whod graduated from ada high school a few years earlier and was enjoying the single life she held two other parttime jobs and also worked occasionally as a babysitter debbie had her own car and lived by herself in a threeroom apartment above a garage on eighth street near east central university she was a pretty girl darkhaired slender athletic popular with the boys and very independent her mother peggy stillwell worried that she was spending too much time at the coachlight and other clubs she had not raised her daughter to live such a life in fact debbie had been raised in the church after high school though she began partying and keeping later hours peggy objected and they fought occasionally over the new lifestyle debbie became determined to have her independence she found an apartment left home but remained very close to her mother on the night of december debbie was working at the coachlight serving drinks and watching the clock it was a slow night and she asked her boss if she could go offduty and hang out with some friends he did not object and she was soon sitting at a table having a drink with gina vietta a close friend from high school and some others another friend from high school glen gore stopped by and asked debbie to dance she did but halfway through the song she suddenly stopped and angrily walked away from gore later in the ladies restroom she said she would feel safer if one of her girlfriends would spend the night at her place but she did not say what worried her the coachlight began closing early around am and gina vietta invited several of their group to have another drink at her apartment most said yes debbie though was tired and hungry and just wanted to go home they drifted out of the club in no particular hurry several people saw debbie in the parking lot chatting with glen gore as the coachlight was shutting down tommy glover knew debbie well because he worked with her at a local glass company he also knew gore as he was getting in his pickup truck to leave he saw debbie open the drivers door of her car gore appeared from nowhere they talked for a few seconds then she pushed him away mike and terri carpenter both worked at the coachlight he as a bouncer she as a waitress as they were walking to their car they passed debbies she was in the drivers seat talking to glen gore who was standing beside her door the carpenters waved goodbye and kept walking a month earlier debbie had told mike that she was afraid of gore because of his temper toni ramsey worked at the club as a shoeshine girl the oil business was still booming in oklahoma in there were plenty of nice boots being worn around ada someone had to shine them and toni picked up some muchneeded cash she knew gore well as toni left that night she saw debbie sitting behind the wheel of her car gore was on the passengers side crouching by the open door outside the car they were talking in what seemed to be a civilized manner nothing appeared to be wrong gore who didnt own a car had bummed a ride to the coachlight with an acquaintance named ron west arriving there around west ordered beers and settled in to relax while gore made the rounds he seemed to know everyone when last call was announced west grabbed gore and asked him if he still needed a ride yes gore said so west went to the parking lot and waited for him a few minutes passed then gore appeared in a rush and got in they decided they were hungry so west drove to a downtown cafe called the waffler where they ordered a quick breakfast west paid for the meal just as hed paid for the drinks at the coachlight he had started the night at harolds another club where hed gone looking for some business associates instead he bumped into gore who worked there as an occasional bartender and disc jockey the two hardly knew each other but when gore asked for a ride to the coachlight west couldnt say no west was a happily married father with two young daughters and didnt routinely keep late hours in bars he wanted to go home but was stuck with gore who was becoming more expensive by the hour when they left the cafe west asked his passenger where he wanted to go to his mothers house gore said on oak street just a few blocks to the north west knew the town well and headed that way but before they made it to oak street gore suddenly changed his mind after riding around with west for several hours gore wanted to walk the temperature was frigid and falling with a raw wind a cold front was moving in they stopped near the oak avenue baptist church not far from where gore said his mother lived he jumped out said thanks for everything and began walking west the oak avenue baptist church was about a mile from debbie carters apartment gores mother actually lived on the other side of town nowhere near the church around am gina vietta was in her apartment with some friends when she received two unusual phone calls both from debbie carter in the first call debbie asked gina to drive over and pick her up because someone a visitor was in her apartment and he was making her feel uncomfortable gina asked who it was who was there the conversation was cut short by muffled voices and the sounds of a struggle over the use of the phone gina was rightfully worried and thought the request strange debbie had her own car a oldsmobile and could certainly drive herself anywhere as gina was hurriedly leaving her apartment the phone rang again it was debbie saying that she had changed her mind things were fine on her end dont bother gina again asked who the visitor was but debbie changed the subject and would not give his name she asked gina to call her in the morning to wake her so she wouldnt be late for work it was an odd request one debbie had never made before gina started to drive over anyway but had second thoughts she had guests in her apartment it was very late debbie carter could take care of herself and besides if she had a guy in her room gina didnt want to intrude gina went to bed and forgot to call debbie a few hours later around am on december donna johnson stopped by to say hello to debbie the two had been close in high school before donna moved to shawnee an hour away she was in town for the day to see her parents and catch up with some friends as she bounced up the narrow outdoor staircase to debbies garage apartment she slowed when she realized she was stepping on broken glass the small window in the door was broken for some reason her first thought was that debbie had locked her keys inside and been forced to break a window to get in donna knocked on the door there was no answer then she heard music from a radio inside when she turned the knob she realized the door was not locked one step inside and she knew something was wrong the small den was a wrecksofa cushions thrown on the floor clothing scattered about across the wall to the right someone had scrawled with some type of reddish liquid the words jim smith next will die donna yelled debbies name no response she had been in the apartment once before so she moved quickly to the bedroom still calling for her friend the bed had been moved yanked out of place all the covers pulled off she saw a foot then on the floor on the other side of the bed she saw debbiefacedown nude bloody with something written on her back donna froze in horror unable to step forward instead staring at her friend and waiting for her to breathe maybe it was just a dream she thought she backed away and stepped into the kitchen where on a small white table she saw more words scribbled and left behind by the killer he could still be there she suddenly thought then ran from the apartment to her car she sped down the street to a convenience store where she found a phone and called debbies mother peggy stillwell heard the words but could not believe them her daughter was lying on the floor nude bloodied not moving she made donna repeat what she had said then ran to her car the battery was dead numb with fear she ran back inside and called charlie carter debbies father and her exhusband the divorce a few years earlier had not been amicable and the two rarely spoke no one answered at charlie carters a friend named carol edwards lived across the street from debbie peggy called her told her something was terribly wrong and asked her to run and check on her daughter then peggy waited and waited finally she called charlie again and he answered the phone carol edwards ran down the street to the apartment noticed the same broken glass and the open front door she stepped inside and saw the body charlie carter was a thickchested brick mason who occasionally worked as a bouncer at the coachlight he jumped in his pickup and raced toward his daughters apartment along the way thinking every horrible thought a father could have the scene was worse than anything he could have imagined when he saw her body he called her name twice he knelt beside her gently lifted her shoulder so he could see her face a bloody washcloth was stuck in her mouth he was certain his daughter was dead but he waited anyway hoping for some sign of life when there was none he stood slowly and looked around the bed had been moved shoved away from the wall the covers were missing the room was in disarray obviously there had been a struggle he walked to the den and saw the words on the wall then he went to the kitchen and looked around it was a crime scene now charlie stuffed his hands in his pockets and left donna johnson and carol edwards were on the landing outside the front door crying and waiting they heard charlie say goodbye to his daughter and tell her how sorry he was for what had happened to her when he stumbled outside he was crying too should i call an ambulance donna asked no he said ambulance wont do no good call the police the paramedics arrived first two of them they hustled up the stairs into the apartment and within seconds one was back outside on the landing vomiting when detective dennis smith arrived at the apartment the scene outside was busy with street cops paramedics onlookers and even two of the local prosecutors when he realized it was a potential homicide he secured the area and sealed it off from the neighbors a captain and seventeenyear veteran of the ada police department smith knew what to do he cleared the apartment of everyone but himself and another detective then he sent the other cops throughout the neighborhood knocking on doors looking for witnesses smith was fuming and fighting his emotions he knew debbie well his daughter and debbies youngest sister were friends he knew charlie carter and peggy stillwell and couldnt believe that their child was lying dead on the floor of her own bedroom when the crime scene was under control he began an examination of the apartment the glass on the landing came from a broken pane in the front door and it was shattered both to the inside and to the outside in the den there was a sofa to the left and its cushions had been thrown around the room in front of it he found a new flannel nightgown a walmart tag still attached to it on the wall across the room he examined the message which he immediately knew had been written in nail polish jim smith next will die he knew jim smith in the kitchen on a small white square table he saw another message apparently written in catsupdont look fore us or ealse on the floor by the table he saw some jeans and a pair of boots he would soon learn that debbie had been wearing them the night before at the coachlight he walked to the bedroom where the bed was partially blocking the door the windows were open the curtains pulled back and the room was very cold a mighty struggle had preceded death the floor was covered with clothing sheets blankets stuffed animals nothing appeared to be in place when detective smith knelt by debbies body he noticed the third message left by the killer on her back in what appeared to be dried catsup were the words duke gram he knew duke graham under her body was an electrical cord and a westernstyle belt with a large silver buckle the name debbie was engraved in the center of it as officer mike kieswetter also of the ada police department was photographing the scene smith began gathering evidence he found hair on the body the floor the bed on the stuffed animals he methodically picked up each hair and placed it in a sheet of folded paper a bindle then recorded exactly where he found it he carefully removed tagged and bagged the bedsheets pillowcases blankets the electrical cord and belt a pair of torn panties he found on the floor of the bathroom some of her stuffed animals a package of marlboro cigarettes an empty up can a plastic shampoo bottle cigarette butts a drinking glass from the kitchen the telephone and some hair found under the body wrapped in a bedsheet and found near debbie was a del monte catsup bottle it too was carefully bagged for examination by the state crime lab its cap was missing but would later be found by the medical examiner when he finished gathering evidence detective smith began the fingerprinting process something hed done many times at many crime scenes he dusted both sides of the front door the casings around the windows all wooden surfaces in the bedroom the kitchen table the larger pieces of broken glass the telephone the areas of painted trim around the doors and windows even debbies car parked outside gary rogers was an agent with the oklahoma state bureau of investigation or osbi who lived in ada when he arrived at the apartment around he was briefed by dennis smith the two were friends and had worked many crimes together in the bedroom rogers noticed what appeared to be a small bloodstain near the bottom of the south wall just above the baseboard and close to an electrical outlet later after the body was removed he asked officer rick carson to cut out a fourinch square section of the sheetrock and preserve the bloody print dennis smith and gary rogers shared the initial impression that there was more than one killer the chaos of the scene the absence of bind marks on debbies ankles and wrists the extensive trauma to her head the washcloth stuffed deep in her mouth the bruises on her sides and arms the likely use of the cord and beltit just seemed like too much violence for one killer debbie was not smallfive feet eight inches tall pounds she was feisty and would certainly have fought valiantly to save her life dr larry cartmell the local medical examiner arrived for a brief inspection his initial opinion was that the cause of death was strangulation he authorized the removal of the body and released it to tom criswell owner of the local funeral home it was taken in a criswell hearse to the state medical examiners office in oklahoma city where it arrived at pm and was placed in a refrigerated unit detective smith and agent rogers returned to the ada police department and spent time with the family of debbie carter as they tried to console them they also gathered names friends boyfriends coworkers enemies exbosses anybody who knew debbie and might know something about her death as the list grew smith and rogers began calling her male acquaintances their request was simple please come down to the police department and provide us with fingerprints and samples of saliva and head and pubic hair no one refused mike carpenter the bouncer at the coachlight whod seen debbie in the parking lot with glen gore around that morning was one of the first to volunteer evidence tommy glover another witness to debbies encounter with gore was quick to provide samples around pm december glen gore showed up at harolds club where he was scheduled to spin records and tend bar the place was practically empty and when he asked why the crowd was so thin someone told him about the murder many of the customers and even some of harolds employees were down at the police station answering questions and getting fingerprinted gore hustled over to the station where he was interviewed by gary rogers and d w barrett an ada policeman he told them that he had known debbie carter since high school and had seen her at the coachlight the night before the entire police report of gores interview reads as follows glen gore works at harolds club as a disc jockey susie johnson told glen about debbie at harolds club about pm glen went to school with debbie glen saw her monday dec th at harolds club glen saw her at the coachlight they talked about painting debbies car never said anything to glen about having problems with anyone glen went to the coachlight about pm with ron west left with ron about am glen has never been to debbies apt the report was prepared by d w barrett witnessed by gary rogers and filed away with dozens of others gore would later change this story and claim that hed seen a man named ron williamson pestering debbie at the club on the night of december this revised version would be verified by no one many of those present actually knew ron williamson a somewhat notorious carouser with a loud mouth none remembered seeing him at the coachlight in fact most of those interviewed stated emphatically that he was not there when ron williamson was in a bar everyone knew it oddly enough in the midst of all the fingerprinting and hair clipping on december gore fell through the cracks he either slipped away or was conveniently ignored or was simply neglected whatever the reason he was not fingerprinted nor did he give saliva and hair samples over three and a half years would pass before the ada police finally took samples from gore the last person seen with debbie carter before her murder at the following afternoon december dr fred jordan a state medical examiner and forensic pathologist performed an autopsy present were agent gary rogers and jerry peters also with the osbi dr jordan a veteran of thousands of autopsies first observed that it was the body of a young white female nude except for a pair of white socks rigor mortis was complete meaning she had been dead for at least twentyfour hours across her chest written in what appeared to be red fingernail polish was the word die another red substance probably catsup was smeared over her body and on her back also in catsup were the words duke gram there were several small bruises on her arms chest and face he noticed small cuts inside her lips and shoved deep into the back of her throat and extruding out through her mouth was a bloodsoaked greenish washcloth which he carefully removed there were abrasions and bruises across her neck in a semicircle her vagina was bruised her rectum was quite dilated upon examining it dr jordan found and removed a small metal screwtype bottle cap his internal examination revealed nothing unexpectedcollapsed lungs dilated heart a few small bruises along the scalp but no underlying brain injury all injuries had been inflicted while she was still alive there was no indication of binding on her wrists and ankles a series of small bruises on her forearms were probably defensive wounds her blood alcohol content at the time of death was low swabs were taken from her mouth vagina and anus microscopic examinations would later reveal the presence of spermatozoa in her vagina and anus but not in her mouth to preserve evidence dr jordan clipped her fingernails scraped off a sample of the catsup and nail polish combed out the loose pubic hairs and also cut a portion of hair from her head the cause of death was asphyxiation which was caused by the combination of the washcloth choking her and either the belt or the electrical cord strangling her when dr jordan finished the autopsy jerry peters photographed the body and collected a complete set of finger and palm prints peggy stillwell was distraught to the point of being unable to function and make decisions she didnt care who planned the funeral or what was planned because she would not attend she couldnt eat and she couldnt bathe and she certainly could not accept the fact that her daughter was dead a sister glenna lucas stayed with her and slowly took control services were planned and peggy was politely informed by her family that she would be expected to attend on saturday december debbies funeral was held in the chapel at criswell funeral home glenna bathed and dressed peggy then drove her to the service and held her hand throughout the ordeal in rural oklahoma virtually all funerals take place with the casket open and positioned just below the pulpit so that the deceased is in view of the mourners the reasons for this are unclear and forgotten but the effect is to add an extra layer of agony to the suffering with the casket open it was obvious that debbie had been beaten her face was bruised and swollen but a highcollared lacy blouse hid the strangulation wounds she was also buried in her favorite jeans and boots with a widebuckled cowboy belt and a diamond horseshoe ring that her mother had already bought her for christmas the reverend rick summers conducted the service before a large crowd afterward with a light snow falling debbie was buried in rosedale cemetery she was survived by her parents two sisters two of her four grandparents and two nephews she was a member of a small baptist church where she had been baptized at the age of six the murder rocked ada though the town had a rich history of violence and killings the victims had usually been cowpokes and drifters and such men who if they hadnt taken a bullet wouldve probably discharged their share in due time but such a brutal rape and murder of a young woman was terrifying and the town seethed with gossip speculation and fear windows and doors were locked at night strict curfews were laid down for teenagers young mothers hovered near their children as they played on the shaded front lawns and in the honkytonks there was talk of little else since debbie had made the rounds many of the regulars knew her shed had her share of boyfriends and in the days following her death the police interviewed them names were passed along more friends more acquaintances more boyfriends dozens of interviews produced more names but no real suspects she was a very popular girl well liked and sociable and it was hard to believe anyone would want to harm her the police put together a list of twentythree people who were at the coachlight on december and interviewed most of them no one recalled seeing ron williamson though most knew him tips and stories and recollections of strange characters poured into the police department a young lady named angelia nail contacted dennis smith and told him of an encounter with glen gore she and debbie carter were close friends and debbie had been convinced gore had stolen the windshield wipers from her car it had become a running dispute she had known gore since high school and was afraid of him a week or so before the murder angelia drove debbie to the house where gore was living for a confrontation debbie disappeared inside the house and had a chat with gore when she returned to the car she was angry and convinced he had taken the wipers they drove to the police station and talked to an officer but no formal report was prepared both duke graham and jim smith were well known to the ada police graham along with his wife johnnie ran his own nightclub a fairly civilized place where they tolerated little trouble altercations were rare but there had been a particularly ugly one with jim smith a local thug and smalltime criminal smith was drunk and causing trouble and when he refused to leave duke whipped out a shotgun and ran him off threats were exchanged and for a few days things were tense around the club smith was the type who might return with his own shotgun and start blasting away glen gore had been a regular at dukes place until he spent too much time flirting with johnnie when he became a bit too aggressive she stiffarmed him and duke took charge gore was banished from the place whoever killed debbie carter tried awkwardly to pin the murder on duke graham and scare away jim smith at the same time smith was already put away he was serving time in a state prison duke graham drove to the police station and provided a solid alibi debbies family was informed that the apartment shed been renting needed to be vacated her mother was still not functioning her aunt glenna lucas volunteered for the unpleasant task a policeman unlocked the apartment and glenna entered slowly nothing had been moved since the murder and her first reaction was one of raw anger there had obviously been a brawl her niece had fought desperately for her life how could anyone inflict such violence on such a sweet pretty girl the apartment was cold with an offensive smell one she could not identify the words jim smith next will die were still on the wall glenna gawked in disbelief at the killers badly scrawled message it took time she thought he was here for a long time her niece had finally died after a brutal ordeal in the bedroom the mattress was against a wall and nothing was in place in the closet not a single dress or blouse was still on a hanger why would the killer strip all the clothing from the hangers the small kitchen was disorganized but showed no signs of a struggle debbies last meal had included frozen potatoestater totsand the leftovers sat untouched on a paper plate with catsup a saltshaker was next to the plate which was on the small white table she used for her meals near the plate was another crude messagedont look fore us or ealse glenna knew that the killer had used catsup for some of his writings she was struck by the misspelled words glenna managed to block out the terrible thoughts and begin packing it took two hours to collect and box the clothing and dishes and towels and such the bloody bedspread had not been taken by the police there was still blood on the floor glenna had not planned to clean the apartment just to gather debbies belongings and get out as soon as possible it was strange though leaving behind the killers words written in debbies fingernail polish and there was something wrong with leaving her bloodstains on the floor for someone else to clean up she thought about scrubbing the place every inch of it to remove every remaining trace of the murder but glenna had seen enough she was as close to the death as she cared to be the roundup of the usual suspects continued in the days following the murder a total of twentyone men gave fingerprints and samples of either hair or saliva on december detective smith and agent rogers drove to the osbi crime lab in oklahoma city and delivered the evidence taken from the murder scene along with samples taken from seventeen of the men the fourinch square of sheetrock was the most promising piece of evidence if the bloody print had indeed been left on the wall during the struggle and murder and if it did not belong to debbie carter then the police would have a solid lead that would eventually take them to the killer osbi agent jerry peters examined the sheetrock and carefully compared its markings with the prints hed taken from debbie during her autopsy his first impression was that the prints did not belong to debbie carter but he wanted to review his analysis on january dennis smith submitted more fingerprints on the same day the hair samples from debbie carter and from the crime scene were given to susan land an osbi hair analyst two weeks later more crime scene samples landed on her desk these were cataloged added to the others and placed in a long line to someday be examined and analyzed by land who was overworked and fighting a backlog of cases like most crime labs oklahoma s was underfunded understaffed and under enormous pressure to solve crimes while they waited on results from the osbi smith and rogers plowed ahead chasing leads the murder was still the hottest news in ada and folks wanted it solved but after talking to all the bartenders and bouncers and boyfriends and latenight characters the investigation was quickly settling into drudgery there was no clear suspect there were no clear leads on march gary rogers interviewed robert gene deatherage a local deatherage had just completed a short stint in the pontotoc county jail for drunk driving he had shared a cell with one ron williamson also locked up for a dui the jailhouse chatter about the carter murder was rampant with plenty of wild theories about what happened and no shortage of claims of inside knowledge the cell mates talked about the killing on several occasions and according to deatherage such talk seemed to bother williamson they argued often and even exchanged blows williamson was soon moved to another cell deatherage developed the vague opinion that ron was somehow involved in the murder and suggested to gary rogers that the police concentrate on williamson as a suspect it was the first time ron williamsons name had been mentioned in the investigation two days later the police interviewed noel clement one of the first men to volunteer fingerprints and hair samples clement told the story of how ron williamson had recently visited his apartment supposedly looking for someone else williamson walked in without knocking saw a guitar picked it up and began discussing the carter murder with clement during the conversation williamson said that when he saw police cars in his neighborhood the morning of the murder he figured the cops were after him hed had some trouble in tulsa he said and he was trying to avoid more of it in ada it was inevitable that the police would find their way to ron williamson indeed it was odd that it took them three months to question him a few including rick carson had grown up with him and most of the cops remembered ron from his high school baseball days in he was still the highest draft pick ada had ever produced when he signed with the oakland as in many people certainly including williamson himself thought he just might be the next mickey mantle the next great one from oklahoma but the baseball was long gone and the police now knew him as an unemployed guitar picker who lived with his mother drank too much and acted strange he had a couple of duis one arrest for public drunkenness and a bad reputation from tulsa chapter ron williamson was born in ada on february the only son and last child of juanita and roy williamson roy worked as a doortodoor salesman for the rawleigh home products company he was a fixture in ada trudging down the sidewalks in coat and tie with his heavy sample case filled with food supplements spices and kitchen products he always carried a pocketful of candy for the kids who eagerly greeted him it was a hard way to make a living physically grueling and with long hours of paperwork at night his commissions were modest and soon after ronnie was born juanita took a job with the hospital in ada with both parents working ronnie naturally fell into the lap of his twelveyearold sister annette and she could not have been happier she fed him cleaned him played with him pampered and spoiled himhe was a wonderful little plaything shed been lucky enough to inherit when annette wasnt in school she was babysitting her brother as well as cleaning the house and preparing dinner renee the middle child was five when ron was born and though she had no desire to care for him she soon became his playmate annette bossed her around too and as they grew older renee and ronnie often tagteamed against their motherlike guardian juanita was a devout christian a headstrong woman who had her family in church every sunday and wednesday and whenever other services were offered the children never missed sunday school vacation bible school summer camp revivals church socials even a few weddings and funerals roy was less devout but nonetheless adhered to a disciplined lifestyle a faithful church attendance absolutely no alcohol gambling swearing card playing or dancing and complete devotion to his family he was strict with his rules and quick to yank off his belt and deliver bold threats or an actual lick or two usually to the backside of his only son the family worshipped at the first pentecostal holiness church an energetic fullgospel congregation as pentecostals they believed in a fervent prayer life the constant nurturing of a personal relationship with christ faithfulness to the church and all aspects of its work diligent study of the bible and a loving embrace of other members worship was not for the timid with vibrant music fiery sermons and emotional participation from the congregation which often included the speaking of unknown tongues onthespothealing or laying on of hands and a general openness in expressing loudly whatever emotion the spirit was pulling forth young children were taught the colorful stories of the old testament and were prompted to memorize the more popular bible verses they were encouraged to accept christ at an early ageto confess sin ask the holy spirit to enter their lives for eternity and follow the example of christ with a public baptism ronnie accepted christ at the age of six and was baptized in the blue river south of town at the end of a long spring revival the williamsons lived quietly in a small house on fourth street on the east side of ada near the college for relaxation they visited relatives in the area stayed busy with church work and camped occasionally at a nearby state park they had little interest in sports but that changed dramatically when ronnie discovered baseball he started playing with the other boys on the street pickup games of a dozen varieties and endless rule changes from the beginning it was obvious that his arm was strong and his hands were quick he swung the bat from the left side of the plate he was hooked on the game from day one and was soon bugging his father to buy him a glove and a bat spare money was scarce around the house but roy took the kid shopping an annual rite was bornthe early springtime trip to haynes hardware for the selection of a new glove and it was usually the most expensive one in the store when he wasnt using the glove he kept it in a corner of his bedroom where he erected a shrine to mickey mantle the greatest yankee and the greatest oklahoman in the major leagues mantle was idolized by kids throughout the country but in oklahoma he was godlike every little leaguer in the state dreamed of being the next mickey including ronnie who taped photos and baseball cards of the mick to a poster board in the corner of his room by the age of six he could recite every mantle statistic as well as those of many other players when he wasnt playing in the streets ronnie was in the living room swinging the bat with all the force he could muster the house was very small the furnishings modest but irreplaceable and whenever his mother caught him flailing away and barely missing a lamp or a chair she ran him outside minutes later he was back to juanita her little boy was special though somewhat spoiled he could do nothing wrong he was also very confusing he could be sweet and sensitive unafraid to show his affection to his mother and sisters and a moment later bratty and selfish making demands of the entire family his mood swings were noticed early in life but were the cause of no particular alarm ronnie was simply a difficult child at times perhaps it was because he was the youngest and had a houseful of women doting on him in every small town there is a little league coach who loves the game so much that he is constantly on the prowl for fresh talent even that of an eightyearold in ada the guy was dewayne sanders coach of the police eagles he worked at a corner service station not far from the williamson home on fourth street word reached coach sanders about the williamson kid and he was soon signed up even at such an early age it was obvious ronnie could play the game and it was odd because his father knew very little about baseball ronnie had picked it up on the streets in the summer months baseball began early in the day as the boys gathered and talked about the yankee game the day before only the yankees they studied the box score talked about mickey mantle tossed the ball around as they waited for more players a small group meant a game in the street dodging the occasional car breaking the occasional window when more kids showed up the street ball was abandoned and they headed for a vacant lot for serious games that would last all day late in the afternoon they would drift back home just in time to clean up eat a bite put on a uniform and hurry over to kiwanis park for a real game the police eagles were usually in first place a testament to the dedication of dewayne sanders the teams star was ronnie williamson his name first appeared in the ada evening news when he was just nine years oldthe police eagles used hits including homers by ron williamson who also had doubles roy williamson was at every game watching quietly from the bleachers he never yelled at an umpire or a coach nor did he yell at his own son occasionally after a bad game he would offer fatherly advice usually about life in general roy had never played baseball and was still learning the game his young son was years ahead of him when ronnie was eleven he moved up to the ada kids league and was the top draft pick of the yankees sponsored by the oklahoma state bank he led the team to an undefeated season when he was twelve still playing for the yankees the ada paper followed the teams season oklahoma state bank scored runs in the bottom of the first inning ronnie williamson had triples june the yankees went to bat only three times but the booming bats of roy haney ron williamson and james lamb told the story williamson tripled june the oklahoma state bank yankees scored twice in the opening inning ron williamson and carl tilley got two of the four hits each being a double july meanwhile the bank team bounced into the second place nest ronnie williamson had two doubles and a single july in the s byng high school was about eight miles north and east of the ada city limits it was considered a country school much smaller than the sprawling ada high school though the neighborhood kids could attend ada high if they chose and if they were willing to make the drive virtually all opted for the smaller school primarily because the byng bus ran through the east side of town and the ada bus did not most of the kids on rons street chose byng at byng junior high school ronnie was elected secretary of the seventhgrade class and the following year he was voted president and a class favorite of the eighth grade he entered the ninth grade at byng high school in one of sixty freshman byng did not play footballthat was unofficially reserved for ada whose powerful teams annually competed for the state title byng was a basketball school and ronnie picked up the game his freshman year and absorbed it as quickly as he had baseball though never a bookworm he did enjoy reading and made as and bs math was his favorite subject when he was bored with textbooks he plowed through dictionaries and encyclopedias he grew obsessive with certain topics in the midst of a dictionary binge he would pepper his friends with words theyd never heard of chiding them if they did not know the meanings he studied every american president memorized countless details about each one then for months talked of nothing else though he was steadily growing away from his church he still knew dozens of verses of scripture which he often used to his advantage and more often used to challenge those around him at times his obsessions wore thin with his friends and family but ronnie was a gifted athlete and thus very popular in school he was elected vice president of his freshman class the girls noticed him liked him wanted to date him and he certainly was not shy around them he became very particular about his appearance and fussy about his wardrobe he wanted nicer clothes than his parents could afford but he pushed hard for them anyway roy began quietly buying himself secondhand clothes so his son could wear better ones annette had married and was living in ada in she and her mother opened the beauty casa a hair salon on the ground floor of the old julienne hotel in downtown ada they worked hard and soon built a brisk business one that included several call girls who used the upper floors of the hotel these ladies of the evening had been a fixture in the town for decades and had taken their toll on a few marriages juanita could barely tolerate them annettes lifelong inability to say no to her little brother came back to haunt her as he constantly wheedled money out of her for clothes and girls when he somehow discovered that she had a charge account at a local clothing store he began adding to it and he never thought of buying the cheap stuff sometimes he would ask permission often he would not annette would explode theyd argue then he would con her into paying the bill she adored him too much to say no and she wanted her little brother to have the best of everything in the middle of every fight he always managed to tell her how much he loved her and there was no doubt that he did both renee and annette worried that their brother was growing too spoiled and putting too much pressure on their parents at times they lashed out at him some of the fights were memorable but ronnie prevailed he would cry and apologize and make everybody smile and laugh the sisters often found themselves sneaking him money to help buy things their parents couldnt afford he could be selfabsorbed demanding egocentric downright childishthe obvious baby of the familyand then with a burst of his oversized personality he would have the entire family eating out of his hand they loved him dearly and he loved them right back and even in the midst of their bickering they knew he would get whatever he wanted the summer after ronnies ninth grade a few of the luckier boys planned to attend a baseball camp at a nearby college ronnie wanted to go too but roy and juanita simply couldnt afford it he persisted it was a rare opportunity to improve his game and maybe get noticed by college coaches for weeks he talked of nothing else and pouted when things looked hopeless roy finally acquiesced and borrowed the money from a bank rons next project was the purchase of a motorbike something roy and juanita were opposed to they went through the usual series of denials and lectures and claims that it was something they simply couldnt afford and too dangerous anyway so ronnie announced he would pay for it himself he found his first job an afternoon paper route and began saving every penny when he had enough for the down payment he bought the motorbike and arranged monthly payments with the dealer the repayment plan was derailed when a tent revival came to town the bud chambers crusade hit ada big crowds lots of music charismatic sermons something to do at night ronnie went to the first service was deeply moved and returned the next nightwith most of his savings when they passed the offering plate he emptied his pocketsbut brother bud needed more so ronnie returned the next night with the rest of hismoney the next day he scraped up all the loose cash he could find or borrow and hustledback to the tent that night for another rowdy service and another hardearned donationfor the entire week ronnie somehow managed to give and give and when the crusade finally left town he was flat broke then he quit the paper route because it interfered with baseball roy scraped together the money and paid off the motorbike with both sisters out of the house ronnie demanded all the attention a less beguiling child might have been intolerable but he had developed an immense talent for charm warm outgoing and generous himself he had no problem expecting unwarranted generosity from his family as ronnie was entering the tenth grade the football coach at ada high approached roy and suggested that his son enroll in the larger school the kid was a natural athlete by then everybody in town knew ronnie was an outstanding basketball and baseball player but oklahoma is football country and the coach assured roy that the lights were brighter playing on the gridiron for the ada cougars with his size speed and arm he could quickly develop into a top player possibly a recruit the coach offered to stop by the house each morning and give the kid a ride to school the decision was ronnies and he stuck with byng for two more years anyway the rural community of asher sits almost unnoticed on highway twenty miles north of ada it has few peoplefewer than five hundred no downtown to speak of a couple of churches a water tower and a few paved streets with some aging homes scattered about its pride is a beautiful baseball field just past its tiny classb high school on division street like most very small towns asher seems an unlikely place for anything noteworthy but for forty years it had the winningest high school baseball team in the nation in fact no high school in history public or private has won as many games as the asher indians it all began in when a young coach named murl bowen arrived and inherited a longneglected programthe team did not win a game things changed quickly within three years asher had its first state title dozens would follow for reasons that are unlikely to ever become clear oklahoma sanctions varsity baseball in the fall but only for those schools too small for football during his career at asher it was not unusual for coach bowens teams to win a state title in the fall then follow it up with another in the spring during one remarkable stretch asher qualified for the state finals sixty straight timesthirty years in a row fall and spring in forty years coach bowens teams won games lost only hauled home fortythree state championship trophies and sent dozens of players to college and minorleague baseball in bowen was named the national high school coach of the year and the town rewarded him by upgrading bowen field in he received the same award again it wasnt me he says modestly looking back it was the kids i never scored a run maybe not but he certainly produced enough beginning each august when temperatures in oklahoma often reach a hundred degrees coach bowen would gather his small group of players and plan the next assault on the state playoffs his rosters were always slimeach graduating class at asher had about twenty kids half girlsand it was not unusual to have a squad of only a dozen players including an occasional eighth grader with promise to make sure no one quit his first order of business was to pass out the uniforms every kid made the team then he worked them beginning with threeaday practices the workouts were beyond rigoroushours of conditioning sprinting running bases drilling in the fundamentals he preached hard work strong legs dedication and above all sportsmanship no asher player ever argued with an umpire threw a helmet in frustration or did anything to show up an opponent if at all possible no asher team ever ran up the score against a weaker school coach bowen tried to avoid weak opponents especially in the spring when the season was longer and he had more flexibility with the schedule asher became famous for taking on the big schools and beating them they routinely thrashed ada norman and the a and a giants from oklahoma city and tulsa as the legend grew these teams preferred to travel to asher to play on the pristine field that coach bowen maintained himself more often than not they left on a quiet bus his teams were highly disciplined and some critics said very well recruited asher became a magnet for serious baseball players with big dreams and it was inevitable that ronnie williamson would find his way to the school during the summer leagues he met and became close to bruce leba an asher boy and probably the secondbest player in the area a step or two behind ronnie they became inseparable and soon were talking of playing their senior year together at asher there were more scouts both college and professional hanging around bowen field and there was an excellent chance of winning the state titles in the fall of and the spring of rons visibility would be much higher just up the road changing schools meant renting a place in asher a huge sacrifice for his parents money was always tight and roy and juanita would have to commute back and forth to ada but ronnie was determined he was convinced as were most baseball coaches and scouts in the area that he could be a high draft pick the summer after his senior year his dream of playing professionally was within reach he just needed an extra push there were whispers that he just might be the next mickey mantle and ronnie heard them with covert help from some baseball boosters the williamsons rented a small house two blocks from asher high school and ronnie reported in august to coach bowens boot camp at first he was overwhelmed by the level of conditioning the sheer time spent running and running and running the coach had to explain several times to his new star that iron legs are crucial to hitting pitching baserunning making long throws from the outfield and surviving the late innings of the second game of a doubleheader with a thin roster ronnie was slow to see things this way but he was soon influenced by the fierce work ethic of his pal bruce leba and the other asher players he fell in line and was soon in great shape one of only four seniors on the team he was soon an unofficial captain and with leba a leader murl bowen loved his size speed and rocket throws from center field he had a cannon for an arm and a big power swing from the left side some of his battingpractice shots over the right field wall were remarkable when the fall season started the scouts were back and soon taking serious notes on ron williamson and bruce leba with its schedule loaded with small nonfootball schools asher lost only one game and walked through the playoffs for another title ron hit with six home runs bruce his friendly rival hit with six homers they pushed each other both certain they were headed for the major leagues and they began playing hard off the field as well they drank beer on the weekends and discovered marijuana they chased the girls who were easy to catch because asher loved its heroes partying became a routine and the clubs and honkytonks around ada proved irresistible if they got too drunk and were afraid of driving back to asher they would land at annettes where they would wake her up and usually want something to eat apologizing profusely the entire time ronnie would beg her not to tell their parents they were careful though and managed to avoid trouble with the police they lived in fear of murl bowen plus the spring of held such great promise basketball at asher was little more than a good way for the baseball team to stay in shape ron started at forward and led the team in scoring there was some interest from a couple of small colleges but none from him as the season was winding down he began receiving letters from probaseball scouts saying hello promising to watch him in just a few weeks requesting schedules asking him to attend tryout camps during the summer bruce leba was getting letters too and they had a grand time comparing their correspondence phillies and cubs one week angels and athletics the next when the basketball season ended in late february it was showtime in asher the team warmed up nicely with a few walkovers then hit full stride when the big schools came to town ron began with a hot bat and never cooled off the scouts were buzzing the team was winning life was good at asher high since they usually faced the ace of their opponents staff coach bowens players saw great pitching every week with more scouts in the bleachers ron proved with each game that he could handle anybodys pitching he hit for the season with five home runs and fortysix rbis he rarely struck out and walked a lot because teams tried to pitch around him the scouts liked his power and discipline at the plate his speed to first base and of course his arm in late april he was nominated for the jim thorpe award for the outstanding high school athlete in the state of oklahoma asher won twentysix lost five and on may defeated glenpool to win another state championship coach bowen nominated ron and bruce leba for allstate consideration they certainly deserved it but almost took themselves out of consideration a few days before their graduation with a drastic change in life facing them they realized that asher baseball would soon be behind them they would never be as close as they had been during the past year a celebration was needed a particularly memorable night of hellraising at the time oklahoma city had three strip clubs they selected a fine one called the red dog and before heading out they took a fifth of whiskey and a sixpack of beer from the leba kitchen they left asher with the loot and by the time they arrived at the red dog they were drunk they ordered more beer and watched the strippers who grew prettier by the minute lap dances were called for and the two boys began burning through their cash bruces father had laid down a strict am curfew but the lap dances and the booze kept pushing it back they finally staggered out around am two hours from home bruce driving his new soupedup camaro sped away but stopped suddenly when ron said something that upset him they began cursing each other and decided to settle the matter then and there they spilled out of the camaro and began fistfighting in the middle of tenth street after a few minutes of slugging and kicking both grew weary and agreed on a quick truce they got back in the car and resumed their drive home neither could remember the cause of the fight it was just one of the nights details forever lost in a fog bruce missed an exit took a wrong turn then very lost decided to make a long loop on some unknown country roads heading back he thought in the general direction of asher with the curfew blown he was flying across the countryside his cohort was comatose in the backseat things were very dark until bruce saw red lights approaching rapidly from the rear he remembered stopping in front of the williams meat packing company but wasnt sure what town was nearby wasnt sure of the county either bruce got out of the car the state trooper was very nice and asked if hed been drinking yes sir did you realize you were speeding yes sir they chatted and the officer seemed to have little interest in writing a ticket or making an arrest bruce had convinced him that he could drive safely home when suddenly ron stuck his head out the back window and yelled something incomprehensible in a thick slurry voice whos that the officer asked just a friend the friend yelled something else and the state trooper told ron to get out of the car for some reason ron opened the door away from the highway and when he did he fell into a deep ditch both were arrested and taken to jail a cold damp place with a shortage of beds a jailer threw two mattresses on the floor of a tiny cell and there they spent the night shivering terrified still drunk they knew better than to call their fathers for ron it was the first of many nights behind bars the next morning the jailer brought them coffee and bacon and advised them to call home both did with great hesitation and two hours later they were released bruce drove his camaro home alone while ron for some reason was forced to ride in the car with mr leba and mr williamson it was a very long twohour ride made even longer by the prospect of facing coach bowen both fathers insisted that the boys go straight to their coach and tell the truth which they did murl gave them the silent treatment but did not withdraw their nominations for postseason honors they made it to graduation without further incident bruce the class salutatorian gave a wellhoned speech the commencement address was delivered by the honorable frank h seay a popular district court judge from next door in seminole county the asher high class of had seventeen students and for all of them graduation was a significant event a milestone cherished with their proud families very few of their parents had the opportunity to attend college some had not finished high school but to ron and bruce the ceremony meant little they were still basking in the glory of state titles and much more important dreaming of the majorleague draft their lives would not end in rural oklahoma a month later both were named allstate and ron was runnerup for oklahoma player of the year in the annual state allstar game they played before a packed house which included scouts from every majorleague team and many colleges after the game two scouts one for the phillies and one for the oakland as pulled the two aside and made them offtherecord offers if they would agree to a bonus of each the phillies would draft bruce and the as would take ron ron thought the offer was too low and declined bruce was beginning to worry about his knees and he too thought the money was low he tried to squeeze the scout by saying he was planning to play for two years at seminole junior college more money might persuade him but the offer stood a month later ron was selected by the oakland athletics in the second round of the freeagent draft the fortyfirst player chosen out of eight hundred and the first picked from oklahoma the phillies did not draft bruce but did offer him a contract again he declined and headed to junior college their dream of playing together professionally began to fade oakland s first official offer was insulting the williamsons had no agent or lawyer but they knew the as were trying to sign ron on the cheap he traveled alone to oakland and met with team executives their discussions were not productive and ron returned to ada without a contract they soon called him back and on his second visit he met with dick williams the manager and several of the players the as second baseman was dick green a friendly sort who showed ron around the clubhouse and field they bumped into reggie jackson the unabashed superstar mr oakland himself and when reggie learned that ron was the teams secondround pick he asked what position he played dick green needled reggie a bit by replying rons a right fielder reggie of course owned right field man youre gonna die in the minors he said as he walked away and with that the conversation was over oakland was reluctant to pay a large bonus because they projected ron as a catcher but had yet to see him catch negotiations dragged on with little money being offered there were discussions at the dinner table about going to college ron had verbally committed to accept a scholarship from the university of oklahoma and his parents pushed him to consider that option it was his one chance for a college education something that could never be taken away ron understood that but he argued that he could always do college later when oakland suddenly offered him as a signing bonus ron just as suddenly grabbed the money and forgot about college it was big news in asher and ada ron was the highest draft pick ever from the area and for a brief period the attention had a humbling effect on him his dream was coming true he was now a professional baseball player the sacrifices by his family were paying off he felt led by the holy spirit to get things right with god he went back to church and in a sunday night service walked to the altar and prayed with the preacher then he addressed the congregation and thanked his brothers and sisters in christ for their love and support god had blessed him he indeed felt lucky as he fought back tears he promised to use his money and talents solely for the glory of the lord he bought himself a new cutlass supreme and some clothes he bought his parents a new color television then he lost the rest of the money in a poker game in the oakland athletics were owned by charlie finley a maverick whod moved the team from kansas city in he fancied himself a visionary but acted more like a buffoon he delighted in shaking up the baseball world with such innovations as multicolored uniforms ball girls orange baseballs an idea with a very brief life and a mechanical jackrabbit that hauled fresh baseballs to the home plate umpire anything for more attention he bought a mule named it charley o and paraded it around the field and even into hotel lobbies but while he was hogging the headlines with his eccentricities he was also building a dynasty he hired an able manager dick williams and put together a team that included reggie jackson joe rudi sal bando bert campaneris rick monday vida blue catfish hunter rollie fingers and tony larussa the as of the early s were without a doubt the coolest team in baseball they wore white cleatsthe first and only team to do soand they had a dazzling array of uniforms different combinations of green gold white and gray california cool with longer hair facial hair and an air of nonconformity for a game that was by then over a hundred years old and demanded that its traditions be worshipped the as were outrageous they had attitude the country was still hungover from the s who needed authority all rules could be broken even in such a hidebound place as pro baseball in late august ron made his third trip to oakland this time as an athletic a member of the club one of the boys a star of the future though hed yet to play a game as a professional he was well received got the pats on the back and the words of encouragement he was eighteen years old but with a round baby face and bangs down to his eyes he looked no more than fifteen the veterans knew that the odds were stacked against him as they were for every kid who signed a contract but they nonetheless made him feel welcome theyd once been in his shoes less than percent of those who sign pro contracts make it to the big leagues for just one game but no eighteenyearold wants to hear it ron loitered around the dugout and the field hung out with the players took in pregame batting practice watched the rather thin crowd file into oakland alameda county coliseum long before the first pitch he was led to a prime seat behind the as dugout where he watched his new team play the following day he returned to ada determined more than ever to breeze through the minors and crack the show at the age of twenty maybe twentyone hed seen felt absorbed the electric atmosphere of a majorleague ballpark and he would never be the same his hair got longer then he tried to grow a mustache though nature failed to cooperate his friends thought he was rich and he certainly worked hard to give that impression he was different cooler than most folks around ada hed been to california throughout september he watched with great amusement as the as won games and clinched the american league west soon hed be up there with them catching or playing center wearing the colorful uniforms long hair and all part of the hippest crew in the game in november he signed a contract with topps chewing gum giving the company the exclusive right to exhibit print and reproduce his name face photo and signature on a baseball card like every boy in ada hed collected thousands of them saved them swapped them framed them hauled them around in a shoe box and saved his coins to buy more mickey mantle whitey ford yogi berra roger maris willie mays hank aaron all the great players with the valuable cards now he would have his own the dream was rapidly coming true his first assignment though was coos bay oregon class a in the northwest league far from oakland his spring training in mesa arizona had not been remarkable hed turned no heads caught no ones attention and oakland was still trying to figure out where to play him they put him behind the plate a position he did not know they put him on the mound simply because he could throw so hard bad luck hit late in spring training his appendix ruptured and he returned to ada for surgery as he waited impatiently for his body to heal he began drinking heavily to pass the time beer was cheap at the local pizza hut and when he grew tired of that place he drove his new cutlass over to the elks lodge and washed things down with a few bourbon and cokes he was bored and anxious to get to a ballpark somewhere and for some reason he wasnt sure why he found refuge in booze finally he got the call and left for oregon playing parttime for the coos baynorth bend athletics he had hits in atbats an unimpressive average of he caught fortysix games and played a few innings in center field late in the season his contract was assigned to burlington iowa of the midwest league still classa ball but a step up and much closer to home he played in only seven games for burlington then returned to ada for the offseason every stop in the minor leagues is temporary and unsettling the players earn very little and live off meager meal money and whatever generosity the host club might offer at home they live in motels offering bargain monthly rates or cluster in small apartments on the road along the bus routes its more motels and bars and nightclubs and strip joints the players are young rarely married far away from their families and whatever structure that gave them and so they tend to keep late hours most are barely out of their teens immature pampered for most of their short lives and all are convinced theyll soon be making the big bucks playing in the big ballparks they party hard games start at pm over by a quick shower and its time to hit the bars staying out all night sleeping all day either at home or on the bus drinking hard chasing women playing poker smoking grassits all part of the seedier side of the minors and ron embraced it with enthusiasm like any father roy williamson followed his sons season with great curiosity and pride ronnie called occasionally and wrote even less but roy managed to keep up with his statistics twice he and juanita drove to oregon to watch their son play ronnie was suffering through his rookie year trying to adjust to hard sliders and sharp curveballs back in ada roy received a phone call from an as coach rons offfield habits were of some concernlots of partying drinking late nights hangovers the kid was being excessive which was not that unusual for a nineteenyearold in his first season away from home but perhaps a strong word from the father might settle him down ron was making calls too as the summer wore on and his playing time remained marginal he became frustrated with the manager and staff and felt he was being underutilized how could he improve if they left him on the bench he chose the risky and seldomused strategy of going over the heads of his coaches he began calling the as front office with a list of complaints life was miserable way down in a ball he simply wasnt playing enough and he wanted the big shots whod drafted him to know all about it the front office had little sympathy with hundreds of players in the minors and most of them miles ahead of ron williamson such calls and complaints quickly wore thin they knew rons numbers and knew he was struggling word came down from the top that the boy needed to shut up and play ball when he returned to ada in the early fall of he was still the local hero now with some california edges and affectations he continued his latenight routines when the oakland as won the world series for the first time in late october he led a boisterous celebration in a local honkytonk thats my team he yelled repeatedly at the television while his drinking buddies admired him rons habits changed suddenly though when he met and began dating patty obrien a beautiful young lady and former miss ada the two quickly got serious and saw each other regularly she was a devout baptist drank nothing and didnt tolerate bad habits from ron he was more than happy to clean up and promised to change his ways in he found himself no closer to the big leagues after another mediocre spring in mesa he was reassigned to the burlington bees where he played in only five games before being transferred to the key west conchs of the florida state league class a in fiftynine games there he hit a dismal for the first time in his life he was beginning to wonder if he would make it to the big leagues with two very unimpressive seasons behind him he had quickly learned that professional pitching even at the classa level was far more difficult to hit than anything hed seen at asher high school every pitcher threw hard every curveball broke sharper every player on the field was good some would make it to the big leagues his signing bonus had long since been spent and wasted his smiling face on a baseball card was not nearly as exciting as it had been only two years earlier and he felt as though everyone was watching him all his friends and the fine folks of ada and asher were expecting him to fulfill their dreams to put them on the map he was the next great one from oklahoma mickey cracked the show at nineteen ron was already behind schedule he returned to ada and to patty who strongly suggested that he find meaningful employment in the offseason an uncle knew someone in texas and ron drove to victoria and worked several months with a roofing contractor on november ron and patty were married in a large wedding at the first baptist church in ada her home church he was twenty years old still a prospect as far as he was concerned ada saw ron williamson as its biggest hero now hed married a beauty queen from a nice family his life was charmed the newlyweds drove to mesa for spring training in february a new wife added pressure to finally make his move upmaybe not to triple a but at least to double a his contract for was with burlington but he had no plans to go back there he was tired of burlington and key west and if the as sent him back to those places then the message was clearthey no longer considered him a prospect he pushed harder in training ran more took extra batting practice worked as hard as he had back at asher then during routine infield practice one day he made a hard throw to second base and a sharp pain shot through his elbow he tried to ignore it telling himself as all players do that he could simply play through it it would go away just a little springtraining soreness it was back the next day and worse after that by late march ron could barely toss a ball around the infield on march the as cut him and he and patty made the long drive back to oklahoma avoiding ada they settled in tulsa where ron got a job as a service representative with bell telephone it wasnt a new career but rather a paycheck while his arm healed and he waited for some baseball person someone who really knew him to call after a few months though he was doing the calling and there was no interest patty got a job in a hospital and they went about the business of getting themselves established annette began sending them and a week just in case they needed help with the bills the little supplements stopped when patty called and explained that ron was using the money for beer something she did not approve of there was friction annette was worried because he was drinking again she knew little though of what was happening in the marriage patty was very private and shy by nature and never really relaxed around the williamsons annette and her husband visited the couple once a year when ron was passed over for a promotion he quit bell and began selling life insurance for equitable it was and he still had no baseball contract still no inquiries from teams looking for neglected talent but with his athletic confidence and outgoing personality he sold a lot of life insurance selling came naturally and he found himself enjoying the success and the money he was also enjoying late hours in bars and clubs patty hated the drinking and couldnt tolerate the carousing his pot smoking was now a habit and she detested it his mood swings were becoming more radical the nice young man shed married was changing ron called his parents one night in the spring of crying and hysterical with the news that he and patty had fought bitterly and separated roy and juanita as well as annette and renee were shocked at the news and hopeful that the marriage could be saved all young couples weather a few storms any day now ronnie would get the phone call get back in a uniform and resume his career their lives would be on track the marriage would survive a few dark days but it was beyond repair whatever their problems ron and patty chose not to talk about them they quietly filed for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences the separation was complete the marriage lasted less than three years roy williamson had a childhood friend named harry brecheen or harry the cat as he was known in his baseball days both had grown up in francis oklahoma harry was scouting for the yankees roy tracked him down and passed along his phone number to his son rons powers of persuasion paid off in june when he convinced the yankees that his arm was fully healed and better than ever after seeing enough good pitching to realize he couldnt hit it ron decided to play to his strengthhis right arm it had always caught the attention of the scouts oakland had continually talked of converting him to a pitcher he signed a contract with the oneonta yankees of the new yorkpenn league class a and couldnt wait to get out of tulsa the dream was alive again he could certainly throw hard but oftentimes had little idea where the ball was going his breaking stuff was unpolished hed simply not had enough experience throwing too hard too quick the soreness came back slowly at first then practically a fullblown limpness the twoyear layoff took its toll and when the season was over he was cut again again avoiding ada he returned to tulsa and sold insurance annette dropped by to check on him and when the conversation shifted to baseball and his failures he began crying hysterically and couldnt stop he admitted to her that he had long dark bouts of depression once more accustomed to life in the minors he fell into his old habits hanging around bars chasing women and drinking a lot of beer to pass the time he joined a softball team and enjoyed being the big star on a small stage during a game on a cool night he fired a throw to first base and something snapped in his shoulder he quit the team and gave up softball but the damage was done he saw a doctor and put himself through a strenuous rehab program but felt little improvement and he kept the injury quiet hoping once again that a good rest would have things healed by spring rons final sally into professional baseball came the following spring in he again talked his way into a yankee uniform he survived spring training still as a pitcher and was assigned to fort lauderdale in the florida state league there he endured his final season all games half of them on the road on the buses as the months dragged by and he was used as sparingly as possible he pitched in only fourteen games thirtythree innings he was twentyfour years old with a damaged shoulder that wouldnt heal the glory of asher and the murl bowen days were far away most players get a sense of the inevitable but not ron there were too many people back home counting on him his family had sacrificed too much hed bypassed college and an education to become a major leaguer so quitting was not an option he had failed at marriage and he was not accustomed to failure plus he was wearing a yankee uniform a vivid symbol that kept the dream alive every day he gamely hung on until the end of the season then his beloved yankees cut him again chapter a few months after the season was over bruce leba was casually walking through the southroads mall in tulsa when he saw a familiar face and stopped cold just inside toppers menswear was his old pal ron williamson wearing very nice clothes and peddling the same to customers the two bearhugged and launched into a lengthy session of catchup for two boys whod practically been brothers they were surprised at how radically theyd drifted apart after graduating from asher they went their separate ways and lost touch bruce played baseball for two years at a junior college then quit when his knees finally gave out rons career had not fared much better each had notched one divorce neither knew the other had been married neither was surprised to learn that the other had continued a fondness for the nightlife they were young nicelooking single again working hard with money in their pockets and they immediately began hitting the clubs and chasing women together ron had always loved the girls but a few seasons in the minors had brought an even higher intensity to his skirt chasing bruce was living in ada and whenever he passed through tulsa it was time for an allnighter with ron and his friends though the game had broken their hearts baseball was still their favorite topic the great days at asher coach bowen the dreams theyd once shared and old teammates whod tried and failed just like them helped mightily by two bad knees bruce had managed a clean break from the game or at least the dreams of majorleague glory ron had not he was convinced he could still play that one day something would change his arm would miraculously heal someone would call life would be good again at first bruce shrugged it off it was just the residue of fading fame as he had learned himself no star fades faster than that of a high school athlete some deal with it accept it then move on others keep dreaming for decades ron was almost delusional in his belief that he could still play the game and he was greatly troubled even consumed by his failures he constantly asked bruce what people were saying about him back in ada were they disappointed in him because he had not become the next mickey mantle were they talking about him in the coffee shops and cafes no bruce assured him they were not but it didnt matter ron was convinced that his hometown saw him as a failure and the only way to change their minds was to get one last contract and claw his way up to the major leagues lighten up pal bruce kept telling him let go of the game the dream is over rons family began to notice drastic changes in his personality at times he was nervous agitated unable to concentrate or focus on one subject before ricocheting to the next at family gatherings he would sit quietly mutelike for a few minutes then barge into the conversation with comments only about himself when he spoke he insisted on dominating the conversation and every topic had to relate to his life he had trouble sitting still smoked furiously and developed the odd habit of simply vanishing from the room for thanksgiving in annette hosted the entire family and covered the table with the traditional feast as soon as everyone was seated ron without a word abruptly bolted from the dining room and walked across ada to his mothers house no explanation was given at other family gatherings he would withdraw to a bedroom lock the door and stay by himself which though unsettling for the rest of the family did allow them some time for pleasant conversation then he would burst out of the room ranting about whatever happened to be on his mind always a subject completely disconnected from what everybody else was chatting about he would stand in the middle of the den and rattle on like a madman until he got tired then dash back to the bedroom and relock the door once his rowdy entrance included a guitar which he began strumming furiously while singing badly and demanding that the rest of the family sing along after a few disagreeable songs he gave up and stomped back to the bedroom deep breaths were taken eyes were rolled then things returned to normal sadly the family had become accustomed to such behavior ron could be withdrawn and sullen pouting for days over nothing or everything then a switch would flip on and the gregarious personality was back his baseball career depressed him and he preferred not to talk about it one phone call would find him dejected and pitiful but during the next he would be hyper and jovial the family knew he was drinking and there were strong rumors of drug use maybe the alcohol and chemicals were causing an imbalance and contributing to the wild mood swings annette and juanita inquired as delicately as possible and were met with hostility then roy williamson was diagnosed with cancer and rons problems became less important the tumors were in his colon and progressing rapidly though ronnie had always been a mamas boy he loved and respected his father and he felt guilty for his behavior he no longer attended church and was having serious problems with his christianity but he clung to the pentecostal belief that sin gets punished his father whod led a clean life was now being punished because of the sons long list of iniquities roy s failing health added to rons depression he dwelled on his selfishnessthe demands hed made on his parents for nice clothes expensive sports gear baseball camps and trips the temporary move to asher all repaid in glorious fashion with a single color television set extracted from the signing bonus the as gave him he remembered roy quietly buying secondhand clothes so his spoiled son could dress with the best in high school he recalled his father trudging along the hot sidewalks of ada with his bulky sample cases peddling vanillas and spices and he remembered his father up in the bleachers never missing a game roy underwent exploratory surgery in oklahoma city early in the cancer was advanced and spreading and the surgeons could do nothing he returned to ada rejected chemotherapy and began a very painful decline during his final days ron drove home from tulsa and hovered over his father distraught and tearful he apologized repeatedly and begged his father to forgive him roy at one point had heard enough its time to grow up son he said be a man stop all the crying and hysterics get on with your life roy died on april in ron was still in tulsa and sharing an apartment with stan wilkins an ironworker four years his junior the two had a fondness for guitars and popular music and spent hours strumming and singing ron had a strong untrained voice and promising talent with his guitar an expensive fender model he could sit and play it for hours the disco scene was hot in tulsa and the two roommates went out often after work theyd have a few drinks then head for the clubs where ron was well known he loved the ladies and was utterly fearless in his pursuit of them he would survey the crowd pick out the hottest woman and ask her to dance if she agreed to dance then he usually took her home his goal was a different woman every night though he loved to drink he was careful when he was on the prowl too much booze might hamper his performance certain chemicals however did not cocaine was roaring through the country and widely available in the clubs in tulsa there was little thought given to sexually transmitted diseases the biggest concern was herpes aids had yet to appear for those so inclined the late s were wild and hedonistic and ron williamson was out of control on april the tulsa police were called to the apartment of lyza lentzch when they arrived she told them that ron williamson had raped her he was arrested on may posted bail of and was released ron hired john tanner a veteran criminal defense attorney and freely admitted to having sex with lentzch he swore it was consensual theyd met in a club and shed invited him back to her apartment where they eventually went to bed tanner actually believed his client a rare occurrence to rons friends the idea of rape was ridiculous women practically threw themselves at him he could take his pick in any bar and he wasnt exactly stalking young maidens at church the women he met in the clubs and discos were looking for action though he was humiliated by the charges he was determined to act as though nothing bothered him he partied as hard as ever and laughed off any suggestion that he was in trouble he had a good lawyer bring on the trial privately though he was frightened by the process and for good reason to be charged with such a serious crime was sobering enough but to face a jury that could send him to prison for many years was a terrifying prospect he kept most of the details from his family ada was two hours awaybut they soon noticed an even more subdued personality and even wilder mood swings as his world became gloomier ron fought back with the only tools he had he drank more kept even later hours chased even more girls all in an effort to live the good life and escape his worries but the alcohol fueled the depression or maybe the depression required more alcoholwhatever the combination he became moodier and more dejected and less predictable on september the tulsa police received a call regarding another alleged rape an eighteenyearold woman named amy dell ferneyhough returned to her apartment around am after a long night in a club she was feuding with her boyfriend who was in the apartment asleep with the doors locked she couldnt locate her key and since she really needed to find a restroom she hustled down the block to an allnight convenience store there she bumped into ron williamson who was also enjoying another late night the two did not know each other but struck up a conversation then disappeared behind the store and into some tall grass where they had sex according to ferneyhough ron struck her with his fist ripped off most of her clothes and raped her according to ron ferneyhough was mad at her boyfriend for locking her out of their apartment and agreed to a quick roll in the weeds for the second time in five months ron posted bail and called john tanner with two rapes hanging over his head he finally throttled back on the nightlife then went into seclusion he was living alone and talking to virtually no one annette knew a few of the details because she was sending money bruce leba knew very little about what was happening in february the ferneyhough rape went to trial first ron testified and explained to the jury that yes indeed they had had sex but it had been by mutual consent oddly enough the two had agreed to have relations behind a convenience store at four in the morning the jury deliberated for an hour believed him and returned a verdict of not guilty in may another jury was impaneled to hear the accusations of rape by lyza lentzch again ron gave a full explanation to the jury he had met lentzch in a nightclub danced with her liked her and she evidently liked him because she invited him back to her apartment where they had consensual sex the victim told the jury that she decided she didnt want to have sex that she tried to stop it long before it got started but she was afraid of ron williamson and finally gave in to keep from being hurt again the jury believed ron and found him not guilty being called a rapist the first time had humiliated him and he knew the label would stick for many years but few people got tagged with it twice and in less than five months how could he the great ron williamson be branded as a rapist regardless of what the juries said people would whisper and gossip and keep the stories alive they would point at him when he walked by he was twentysix years old and for most of his life hed been the baseball star the cocky athlete headed for bigleague glory later he was still the confident player with a sore arm that just might heal itself people in ada and asher hadnt forgotten him he was young the talent was still there everybody knew his name it all changed with the rape charges he knew he would be forgotten as a player and would be known only as an accused rapist he kept to himself withdrawing more each day into his own dark and confused world he began missing work then quit his job at toppers menswear bankruptcy followed and when hed lost everything he packed his bags and quietly left tulsa he was crashing spinning downward into a world of depression booze and drugs juanita was waiting and she was deeply concerned she knew little about the trouble up in tulsa but she and annette knew enough to be worried ron was obviously a mess the drinking the wild nasty mood swings the increasingly bizarre behavior he looked awfullong hair unshaven face dirty clothes and this was the same ron williamson who had enjoyed being so stylish and dapper who sold fine clothes and had always been quick to point out that a certain tie did not exactly match the jacket he parked himself on the sofa in his mothers den and went to sleep it wasnt long before he was sleeping twenty hours a day always on the sofa his bedroom was available but he refused to even walk into it after dark something was in there something that frightened him though he slept soundly he sometimes jumped up screaming that the floor was covered with snakes and there were spiders on the walls he began hearing voices but wouldnt tell his mother what they said then he began answering them everything tired himeating and bathing were enormous chores always followed by long naps he was listless unmotivated even during short stretches of sobriety juanita had never tolerated alcohol in her houseshe hated drinking and smoking a truce of sorts was reached when ron moved into a cramped garage apartment next to the kitchen there he could smoke and drink and play his guitar and not offend his mother when he wanted to sleep he drifted back to the den and crashed on the sofa and when he was awake he stayed in his apartment occasionally the moods would swing his energy would return and he needed the nightlife again drinking and drugs chasing the ladies albeit with a little more caution he would be gone for days living with friends bumming money off any acquaintance he ran into then another shift in the wind and he was back on the sofa dead to the world juanita waited and worried endlessly there was no history of mental illness in the family and she had no idea how to handle it she prayed a lot she was very private and worked hard to keep ronnies problems away from annette and renee both were married and happy and ronnie was her burden not theirs ron occasionally talked of finding a job he felt rotten for not working and supporting himself a friend knew someone in california who needed employees so much to the relief of his family ron went west a few days later he called his mother crying saying he was living with some devil worshippers who terrified him and wouldnt allow him to leave juanita sent him a plane ticket and he managed to escape he went to florida and new mexico and texas looking for work but never lasted more than a month each brief trip away exhausted him and he crashed even harder on the sofa juanita eventually convinced him to see a mental health counselor who diagnosed him as manicdepressive lithium was prescribed but he wouldnt take it regularly he worked parttime here and there never able to keep a job his only talent had been in sales but in his current state he was in no condition to meet and charm anyone he still referred to himself as a professional baseball player a close friend of reggie jacksons but by then the locals in ada knew better late in annette made an appointment with the district court judge ronald jones at the pontotoc county courthouse she explained her brothers condition and asked if the state or the court system could do anything to help no judge jones said not until ron became a danger to himself or to others on one particularly good day ron applied for training at a vocational rehabilitation center in ada the counselor there was alarmed at his condition and referred him to dr m p prosser at st anthony hospital in oklahoma city where he was admitted on december trouble soon began when ron demanded privileges that the staff could not provide he wanted far more than his share of their time and attention and acted as though he was their only patient when they did not comply with his wishes he left the hospital only to return a few hours later and ask to be readmitted on january dr prosser noted this boy has demonstrated rather bizarre and sometimes psychopathic behavior whether he is manic as the counselor in ada thought or a schizoid individual with sociopathic trends or the reverse sociopathic individual with schizoid trends may never be determined long term treatment may be required but he does not feel he needs treatment for schizophrenia ron had been living in a dream since early adolescence since his glory days on the baseball field and had never accepted the reality that his career was over he still believed that theythe powers that be in baseballwere going to come get him put him in the lineup and make him famous this is the real schizophrenic part of his disorder dr prosser wrote he just wants to get in the ballgame and preferably as one of the stars longterm treatment for schizophrenia was suggested but ron would not consider it a complete physical exam was never completed because he was uncooperative but dr prosser did observe a healthy young muscular active ambulatory man in better trim than most persons his age when he could function ron peddled rawleigh home products doortodoor through the same ada neighborhoods where his father had worked but it was tedious labor the commissions were small he had little patience with the required paperwork and besides he was ron williamson the great baseball star now going doortodoor hawking kitchen products untreated unmedicated and drinking ron became a regular at the local watering holes around ada he was a sloppy drunk talking loud bragging about his baseball career and bothering women he frightened many people and the bartenders and bouncers knew him well if ron williamson showed up to drink everyone knew it one of his favorite clubs was the coachlight and the bouncers there watched him closely it didnt take long for the two rape charges in tulsa to catch up with him the police began watching sometimes following him around ada he and bruce leba were barhopping one night and stopped to fill their car with gas a cop followed them for a few blocks then stopped them and accused them of stealing the gas though it was nothing but harassment they narrowly avoided being arrested the arrests however began soon enough in april two years after his father died ron was jailed on his first drunkdriving charge in november juanita williamson convinced her son to seek help for his drinking at her prodding ron walked into the mental health services of southern oklahoma office in ada and was seen by duane logue a substance abuse counselor he freely admitted his problems said hed been drinking for eleven years and doing drugs for at least the past seven and that the booze increased dramatically after the yankees cut him he did not mention the two rape charges in tulsa logue referred him to a facility called the bridge house in ardmore oklahoma sixty miles away the following day ron presented himself at the bridge house and agreed to twentyeight days of alcohol treatment in a lockdown environment he was very nervous and kept telling the counselor hed done terrible things within two days he became a loner sleeping long hours and missing meals after a week he was caught smoking in his bedroom a clear rule violation and announced that he was through with the place he left with annette who happened to be in ardmore to visit him but the next day he was back asking to be readmitted he was told to return to ada and reapply in two weeks fearing the wrath of his mother he chose not to go home but instead drifted for a few weeks without telling anyone where he was on november duane logue sent ron a letter requesting an appointment on december logue said in part i am concerned about your wellbeing and i hope to see you then on december juanita informed mental health services that ron had a job and was living in ardmore he had met some new friends had become involved with a church had accepted christ again and no longer needed the help of the mental health service his case was closed it was reopened ten days later when he was seen again by duane logue ron needed longterm treatment but he would not agree to it nor would he consistently take the prescribed medications primarily lithium at times he would freely admit to abusive drinking and drug use then he would adamantly deny it just a few beers he would say if asked how much since he couldnt keep a job he was always broke when juanita refused to loan him money he would roam around ada looking for another source not surprisingly his circle of friends was shrinking most people avoided him several times he drove to asher where he could always find murl bowen at the baseball field theyd chat ron would deliver another hardluck tale and his old coach would fork over another twenty bucks while ron was promising to pay it back murl was delivering a stern lecture about cleaning up his life rons refuge was bruce leba who had remarried and was living a much quieter life in his home a few miles out of town about twice a month ron would stagger up to the door drunk and disheveled and beg bruce to give him a place to sleep bruce always took him in sobered him up fed him and usually loaned him ten bucks in february ron was again arrested for drunk driving and pleaded guilty after a few days in jail he went to chickasha to see his sister renee and her husband gary they found him in their backyard one sunday when they returned from church he explained that he had been living in a tent behind their rear fence and he certainly looked the part further he had just escaped from some army men down the road in lawton and these soldiers had stashed weapons and explosives in their homes and were planning to overthrow the base luckily he had escaped in time and now needed a place to live renee and gary allowed him to stay in their sons bedroom gary found him a job on a farm hauling hay a gig that lasted two days before he quit because he said hed found a softball team that needed him the farmer later called and told gary that ron was not welcome back and that in his opinion he had some serious emotional problems rons interest in american presidents was suddenly rekindled and for days he talked of nothing else not only could he quickly name them in order and reverse order but he knew everything about thembirth dates birthplaces terms vice presidents wives and children administration highlights and so on every conversation around the simmonses home had to center on an american president nothing else could be discussed as long as ron was present he was thoroughly nocturnal though he was willing to sleep at night he was incapable of doing so plus he enjoyed allnight television at full volume with the first rays of sunlight he became drowsy and drifted away the simmonses tired and redeyed enjoyed a quiet breakfast before going off to work he often complained of headaches gary heard noises one night and found ron sorting through the medicine cabinet looking for something to deaden the pain when the nerves had frayed enough gary sat ron down for the inevitable serious chat gary explained that ron was welcome to stay but he had to adjust to their schedule ron showed no signs of understanding that he had problems he left quietly and returned to his mothers where he was either comatose on the sofa or holed up in his apartment twentyeight years old and unable to admit that he needed help annette and renee were worried about their brother but there was little they could do he was as headstrong as always and seemed content to live the life of a drifter his behavior was getting even stranger there was little doubt he was deteriorating mentally but this subject was offlimits they had made the mistake of broaching it with him juanita could cajole him into seeing a counselor or seeking treatment for his drinking but he never followed through with prolonged therapy each brief stint of sobriety was followed by weeks of uncertainty about where he was or what he was doing for enjoyment if he had any he played his guitar usually on the front porch at his mothers house he could sit and strum and sing to the birds for hours and when he grew bored with the porch he would take his act on the road often without a car or without money to buy gas he would simply roam around ada and could be seen at various places and at all hours with his guitar rick carson his childhood friend was an ada policeman when he pulled the graveyard shift he often saw ron strolling down sidewalks even between houses strumming chords on the guitar and singing well past midnight rick would ask him where he was going no place in particular rick would offer a ride home sometimes ron said yes other times he preferred to keep walking on july he was arrested for being drunk in public and pleaded guilty juanita was furious and insisted that he seek help he was admitted to central state hospital in norman where he was seen by a dr sambajon a staff psychiatrist rons only complaint was that he wanted to get help his selfesteem and energy were very low and he was burdened with thoughts of worthlessness hopelessness even suicide he said i cannot do good to myself and the people around me i cannot keep my job and i have a negative attitude he told dr sambajon that his first serious episode with depression had been four years earlier when his baseball career ended at about the same time his marriage collapsed he admitted abusing alcohol and drugs but believed such behavior did not contribute to his problems dr sambajon found him to be unkempt dirty untidy careless in his grooming the patients judgment was not grossly impaired and he had insight into his present condition the diagnosis was dysthymic disorder a chronic form of lowgrade depression dr sambajon recommended medications more counseling more group therapy and continued family support after three days at central state ron demanded his release and was discharged a week later he was back at the mental health clinic in ada where he was seen by charles amos a psychological assistant ron described himself as a former professional baseball player whod been depressed since the end of that career he also blamed his depression on religion amos referred him to dr marie snow the only psychiatrist in ada and she began seeing him weekly asendin a commonly used antidepressant was prescribed and ron showed slight improvement dr snow tried to convince her patient that more intensive psychotherapy was needed but after three months ron was finished on september ron was again charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol he was arrested jailed and later pleaded guilty chapter three months after the murder of debbie carter detectives dennis smith and mike kieswetter went to the williamson home and interviewed ron for the first time juanita was present and took part in the meeting when asked where he was on the night of december ron said he did not rememberit had been three months earlier yes he frequented the coachlight as well as the other clubs around ada juanita went to her diary checked the date and informed the detectives that her son had been at home at ten that night she showed them the entry for december ron was asked if he knew debbie carter he said he wasnt sure he certainly knew the name because everybody in town had talked of little else since the murder smith produced a photograph of the victim and ron studied it carefully maybe hed met her before maybe not later he asked to see the photo again she was vaguely familiar he vehemently denied knowing anything about the murder but did offer the opinion that the killer was probably a psychopath who followed her home broke in on her then fled town as soon as the crime was committed after about thirty minutes the police asked ron if he would provide fingerprint and hair samples he agreed to do so and followed them to the station when the interview was over three days later on march they were back with the same questions ron again stated that he had nothing to do with the murder and that he was at home on the night of december the police also interviewed a man by the name of dennis fritz whose only possible link to the murder investigation was his friendship with ron williamson according to an early police report fritz was a suspect or at least an acquaintance of a suspect in the carter murder case dennis rarely went to the coachlight and had not been there for months prior to the murder no witness placed him there in fact by march no witness had mentioned his name he was new to the area and not well known around town he had never driven ron williamson to the coachlight he did not know debbie carter wasnt sure hed ever seen her before and had no idea where she lived but since the investigators were now on the trail of ron williamson and were apparently operating under the kneejerk theory that there were two killers they needed another suspect fritz was their man dennis fritz grew up near kansas city finished high school there and earned a degree in biology from southeastern oklahoma state university in in his wife mary gave birth to their only child elizabeth they were living in durant oklahoma at the time mary was working for a nearby college and dennis had a good job with the railroad on christmas day while dennis was working out of town mary was murdered by a seventeenyearold neighbor shot in the head as she sat in a rocking chair in her own den for two years afterward dennis was unable to work he was emotionally scarred and did nothing but care for elizabeth when she started school in he managed to pull himself together and get a job teaching junior high science in the town of konawa after a few months he moved into a rental home in ada not far from the williamsons and not far from the apartment debbie carter would one day lease his mother wanda joined him in ada to help with elizabeth he took another job teaching ninthgrade biology and coaching basketball in the town of noble an hour away the school officials allowed him to live in a small trailer on campus and he commuted back and forth on weekends to spend time with elizabeth and his mother noble had no nightlife and occasionally dennis would drive to ada on a weeknight to see his daughter then get a drink or perhaps meet a girl one night in november dennis was in ada he was bored and wanted a beer so he drove to a convenience store parked outside and sitting in the front seat of his mothers old buick was ron williamson strumming his guitar and watching the world go by dennis also played the guitar and just happened to have his in the backseat the two struck up a conversation about music ron said he lived a few blocks away and invited dennis over for a jam session both men were looking for friends the apartment was cramped and dirty a sad little place fritz thought ron explained that he lived with his mother who didnt tolerate tobacco or alcohol he had no job and when dennis asked what he did all day he replied that he usually slept he was friendly enough easy with conversation and quick with a laugh but fritz noticed a detached air he would gaze off for long periods of time then stare at dennis as if he werent there a strange guy thought dennis but they enjoyed playing their guitars and talking about music after a few visits fritz began to notice rons excessive drinking and mood swings ron loved beer and vodka and his routine was to start drinking late in the afternoon once he was fully awake and away from his mother he was flat and depressed until the booze kicked in then his personality came to life they began to frequent the bars and lounges in town dennis stopped by one afternoon earlier than usual and before ron had a drink he chatted with juanita a pleasant but longsuffering soul who said little but seemed to be fed up with her son she disappeared and dennis found ron in his bedroom staring at the walls the room made ron nervous and he seldom entered it there were large color photos of patty his exwife and of himself in various baseball uniforms she was beautiful fritz said looking at patty i once had it all ron said with sadness and bitterness he was twentyeight years old and had thoroughly given up barhopping was always an adventure ron never entered a club quietly and once inside he expected to be the center of attention one of his favorite routines was to wear a nice suit and claim to be a rich dallas lawyer by he had already spent enough time in courtrooms to have the lingo and the mannerisms and his tanner act was played out in lounges all over norman and oklahoma city fritz would stay in the background and enjoy the show he gave ron plenty of room he was also becoming a little tired of the adventures a night out with ron usually involved a conflict of some sort and an unexpected ending during the summer of they were returning to ada after a night in the bars when ron announced he wanted to go to galveston fritz had made the mistake of telling a story about deepsea fishing out of galveston and ron claimed that hed always wanted to do that they were drunk and an unplanned eighthour drive did not seem totally farfetched they were in denniss pickup truck as always ron had no car no license and no money for gas school was out fritz had some cash in his pocket so why not go fishing they bought some more beer and headed south somewhere in texas dennis needed a nap so ron took the wheel when dennis woke up there was a strange black man in the back of the pickup picked up a hitchhiker ron said proudly somewhere in houston just before dawn they stopped at a convenience store to buy beer and food and when they returned the truck was gone stolen by the hitchhiker ron said he forgot and left the keys in the ignition and upon further reflection admitted that he had not only left the keys in the ignition but had probably left the engine running as well they drank a few beers and pondered their bad luck fritz insisted on calling the police but ron wasnt so sure they argued and dennis called them anyway when the cop heard the story he laughed in their faces they were in a very rough part of town but they found a pizza hut they ate pizza and drained several pitchers of beer and began roaming around the city quite lost at dusk they stumbled upon a black honkytonk and ron was determined to go inside and party it was a crazy idea but fritz soon realized that things were probably safer inside the club than out at the bar dennis sipped a beer and prayed no one would notice them ron typically began talking loud and attracting attention he was wearing a suit and was now the hotshot dallas lawyer dennis was worrying about his truck and hoping they didnt get knifed while his sidekick was telling tall tales about his close personal friend reggie jackson the main man of the club was a guy named cortez and he and ron soon became pals when ron told the story of the stolen pickup cortez roared with laughter when the honkytonk closed ron and dennis drove away with cortez whose apartment was nearby and did not have enough beds the two white boys slept on the floor when he awoke fritz was hungover angry about his truck and determined to get back to ada in one piece he jolted ron out of his coma and together they convinced cortez to drive them for a small fee to a bank where dennis could hopefully withdraw some money at the bank cortez waited in the car while ron and dennis went inside dennis got the cash and as they were leaving a dozen police cars came screaming from all directions and surrounded cortez heavily armed officers yanked him out of his car and threw him into the backseat of one of theirs ron and dennis ducked back into the bank quickly assessed the raid in the parking lot and made a hurried exit on the other side they bought bus tickets the ride home was long and painful fritz was sick of ron and angry that hed let the truck get away from them he vowed to avoid him for a long time a month later ron called dennis and wanted to go out since the adventure in houston the friendship had cooled considerably fritz enjoyed going out for a few beers and some dancing but he kept things under control ron was fine as long as they were having a drink and playing guitars in his apartment but once he hit the bars anything could happen dennis picked him up and they went out for a drink fritz explained that it would be a short night because he had a rendezvous with a young lady planned for later he was actively on the prowl for a love interest his wife had been dead for seven years and he longed for a stable relationship ron did not women were for sex and nothing else ron though proved difficult to shake that night and when dennis went to visit his lady friend ron went with him when he finally realized he wasnt welcome he got mad and left but not on foot he stole denniss car and drove to bruce lebas house fritz stayed with the woman and when he got up the next morning he realized his car was gone he called the police filed a report then called bruce leba and asked if hed seen ron bruce agreed to drive ron and the stolen car back to ada and when they arrived both were stopped by the police the charges were dropped but dennis and ron did not speak for months fritz was at home in ada when he received a phone call from detective dennis smith the police wanted him to come down to the station and answer some questions what kinds of questions fritz asked well tell you when you get here smith replied fritz reluctantly went to the station he had nothing to hide but any such encounter with the police was unnerving smith and gary rogers asked him about his relationship with ron williamson an old friend he hadnt seen in months the questions were businesslike at first but slowly became accusatory where were you on the night of december dennis wasnt sure at that moment hed need some time to think about it did you know debbie carter no and so on after an hour fritz left the station mildly concerned that he was even involved in the investigation dennis smith called again and asked fritz if he would take a polygraph with his science background fritz knew that polygraphs are wildly unreliable and he wanted no part of an exam at the same time hed never met debbie carter and he wanted to prove this to smith and rogers he reluctantly agreed and a test was scheduled at the osbi offices in oklahoma city as the day approached fritz became more and more nervous and to calm his nerves he took a valium right before the exam the test was administered by osbi agent rusty featherstone with dennis smith and gary rogers lurking nearby when it was over the cops huddled over the graphs grimly shaking their heads at the bad news fritz was informed that he had severely flunked the exam impossible was his first response youre hiding something they said fritz admitted to being nervous and finally confessed that hed taken a valium this upset the cops and they insisted that he take another polygraph he felt as though he had no choice a week later featherstone brought his machine to ada and set it up in the basement of the police department fritz was even more nervous than before but answered the questions truthfully and easily he severely flunked it again only this time even worse according to featherstone smith and rogers the postpolygraph interrogation began with a fury rogers playing the bad cop began cursing and threatening and saying youre hiding something fritz over and over smith tried to play the role of fritzs true friend but it was a juvenile act and an old one at that rogers was dressed like a cowboy boots and all and his style was to strut around the room fuming cursing threatening talking about death row and lethal injections then suddenly he would lunge at fritz jab him in the chest and tell him that he was going to confess the routine was frightening enough but not very effective fritz said over and over get out of my face rogers finally accused him of the rape and murder he got angry and his language became even more abusive as he described how fritz and his sidekick williamson broke in on the girl raped her and killed her and now he rogers was demanding a confession with no evidence only a confession couldve solved the case and the cops were desperate to squeeze one out of fritz but he didnt budge he had nothing to confess but after two hours of verbal abuse he wanted to give them something he told the story of a road trip he and ron had made to norman the previous summer a rowdy night in bars looking for girls one of whom hopped in the backseat of denniss car and became hysterical when he wouldnt let her out she finally jumped ran away called the cops and ron and dennis slept in the car in a parking lot hiding from the police no charges were filed that story seemed to placate the cops for a few minutes anyway their clear focus was williamson and now they had more proof that he and fritz were friends and drinking buddies the relevance to the carter murder was unclear to fritz but then most of what the cops were saying made little sense fritz knew he was innocent and if smith and rogers were after him then the real killer had little to worry about after hammering away for three hours the cops finally quit they were convinced fritz was involved but the case wouldnt be solved with a confession good police work was needed so they began watching fritz following him around town stopping him for no reason several times fritz woke up to the sight of a police car parked in front of his house fritz voluntarily submitted hair blood and saliva samples why not give them everything he had nothing to fear the thought of talking to a lawyer crossed his mind briefly but why bother he was completely innocent and the cops would soon realize this detective smith dug into fritzs background and discovered a conviction for growing marijuana in the town of durant armed with the information an ada policeman contacted the junior high school in noble where dennis was teaching and informed the authorities that fritz not only was under investigation for murder but also had a drug conviction hed neglected to disclose when he applied to teach fritz was fired immediately on march susan land at the osbi received from dennis smith the known scalp and pubic hairs of fritz and williamson on march ron went to the police station and voluntarily submitted to a polygraph test administered by b g jones another examiner with the osbi jones declared the exam to be inconclusive ron also gave a saliva sample a week later this was submitted to the osbi along with a sample from dennis fritz on march jerry peters with the osbi completed his fingerprint analysis in his report he stated without qualification disclaimer or equivocation that the palm print on the sheetrock sample did not belong to debbie carter dennis fritz or ron williamson this should have been good news for the police find a match to the palm print and they had their killer instead the police quietly informed the carter family that ron williamson was their prime suspect though they did not have enough evidence they were pursuing all leads and slowly methodically building a case against him he certainly seemed suspicious he acted strange kept weird hours lived with his mother didnt have a job was known to pester women was a regular at the honkytonks and most damning of all lived close to the murder scene by cutting through a back alley he could be at debbie carters apartment in minutes plus hed had those two problems up in tulsa the man had to be a rapist regardless of what the juries decided not long after the murder debbies aunt glenna lucas received an anonymous phone call in which a male voice said debbies dead and you next will die glenna recalled with horror the words scrawled in nail polish jim smith next will die the similarities sent her into a panic but instead of notifying the police she called the district attorney bill peterson a heavyset young man from a prominent ada family had been the prosecutor for three years his district covered three countiespontotoc seminole and hughesand his office was in the pontotoc county courthouse he knew the carter family and like any smalltown prosecutor he was anxious to find a suspect and solve the crime dennis smith and gary rogers were routinely updating peterson on the investigation glenna described the anonymous call to bill peterson and they agreed that ron williamson was probably the caller and the killer by walking a few steps from his garage apartment to the back alley he could actually see debbies place and by walking a few steps down his mothers driveway he could see glennas home he was right there in the middle the weird man with no job and strange hours just watching the neighborhood around him bill peterson arranged for a recorder to be placed on glennas phone but there were no other calls her daughter christy was eight years old and very aware of the familys ordeal glenna kept her close never allowed her to be alone or use the phone and made sure she was watched carefully at school there were whispers around the house and around the family about williamson why would he kill debbie what were the police waiting for the whispers and gossip continued fear quickly spread throughout the neighborhood then the entire town the murderer was loose out there for all to see and everybody knew his name why didnt the police get him off the streets a year and a half after his last session with dr snow ron certainly needed to be off the streets he was in desperate need of longterm care in an institution in june again at the urging of his mother he made the familiar trek on foot over to the mental health clinic in ada he asked for help again saying he was depressed and unable to function he was referred to another facility in cushing and there he was evaluated by al roberts a rehabilitation counselor roberts noted that rons iq was in the brightnormal range of intellectual functioning but cautioned that he might be suffering some degree of brain impairment because of the alcohol abuse roberts wrote this man may be exhibiting a cry for help ron was insecure tense worried nervous and depressed he is a very nonconforming person and is resentful of authority his behavior is going to be erratic and unpredictable he does have problems with impulse control he is very suspicious and distrustful of others around him he lacks social skills and is very uncomfortable in social situations this individual is one who would accept little responsibility for his own behavior and he is likely to strike out in anger or hostility as a defense against being hurt he sees the world as a very threatening and scary place and defends himself by being hostile or being withdrawn ron seems very immature and will present a picture of one who is rather unconcerned ron applied to a vocational training program at east central university in ada stating that he wanted to get a degree in chemistry or in the alternative one in physical education so he could coach he agreed to a more thorough psychological evaluation using a series of tests the examiner was melvin brooking a psychological assistant with vocational rehabilitation brooking knew ron and the williamson family well perhaps too well his behavorial observations were loaded with anecdotes and he referred to him as ronnie on his athletic career brooking wrote i dont know what kind of student ronnie was in high school but i do know that he was an outstanding athlete but was always handicapped by temper tantrums on and off the court and generally rude immature behavior and a highly selfcentered arrogant attitude his prima donna attitude his inability to get along with people and his disregard for rules and regulations made him an unfit player about everywhere he went on the family he said ronnies mother has been a hard working woman all of her life she has owned and operated a beauty shop downtown for many years both ronnies mother and father have stood by him through many many crises and his mother is evidently still providing support although she is just about emotionally physically and financially drained on the failed marriage he wrote he married a very beautiful girl who was a former miss ada but she finally could not tolerate ronnies mood swings and inability to make a living and divorced him evidently ron was forthcoming about his alcohol and drug abuse brooking observed ronnie has had serious alcohol and drug abuse problems in the past he has been a serious pill taker most of his drug taking seems to be an attempt to medicate himself out of serious depression he says that he is no longer drinking or doing drugs brooking began his diagnosis with bipolar disorder and described it as follows bipolar disorder means that this young man suffers from tremendous mood swings going from manic highs to stupor level depressive lows i will diagnose depressed type because that is characteristically where he stays most of the time his manic highs are usually drug induced and short lived for the last three or four years ronnie has been seriously depressed living in the back room of his mamas house sleeping most of the time working very very little and totally dependent on those around him for his upkeep hes come out of the house three or four times and made major moves as though he were going to rehabilitate himself but theyve never worked out brooking also diagnosed a paranoid personality disorder because of a pervasive and unwarranted suspiciousness and mistrust of people hypersensitivity and restricted affectivity and for good measure he added alcohol and substance dependence his prognosis was guarded and he concluded by saying this young man has never gotten it together since he left home more than ten years ago his life has been a series of problems and devastating crises he continues to try and get his feet on solid ground but so far he has never been able to make it brookings job was to evaluate ron not to treat him by the late summer of rons mental condition was worsening and he was not getting the help he needed longterm institutionalized psychotherapy was required but the family couldnt afford it the state couldnt provide it and ron wouldnt agree to it anyway his application to east central university included a request for financial aid the request was granted and he was notified that a check was available at the business office of the school he arrived to pick it up in his usual unkempt condition with long hair and a mustache accompanied by two other shady characters both of whom seemed very interested in the prospect of ron getting some money the check was made payable to ron but also to an officer of the school ron was in a hurry but he was told to wait in a long line he felt the money was rightfully his and he didnt feel like waiting his two buddies were anxious to get the cash so ron quickly forged the name of the school official he left with the forgery was witnessed by nancy carson the wife of rick carson rons childhood friend who was an ada policeman mrs carson worked in the business office and had known ron for many years she was appalled at what she had just seen so she called her husband an official from the college knew the williamson family he drove straight to juanitas beauty shop and told her about rons forgery if she would reimburse the school the no criminal charges would be pursued juanita quickly wrote a check for the money and went to find her son the following day ron was arrested for uttering a forged instrument a felony that carried a maximum prison sentence of eight years he was placed in the pontotoc county jail he could not post bail and his family couldnt help him the murder investigation was proceeding slowly there was still no word from the osbi lab on the initial fingerprint hair and saliva submissions samples from thirtyone ada men including ron williamson and dennis fritz were being processed glen gore still had not been asked to provide hair and saliva by september all hair samples were on the backlogged desk of melvin hett an osbi hair analyst on november ron while in jail submitted to another polygraph exam this one also administered by the osbi agent rusty featherstone it was a twohour meeting with lots of questions before ron was wired for the polygraph he continually and adamantly denied any involvement in or knowledge of the murder the test was again deemed inconclusive and the entire interview was videotaped ron adjusted to life behind bars he kicked the booze and pills because he had no choice and he managed to continue his habit of sleeping twenty hours a day but without medication or treatment of any type he continued a slow mental decline later in november another inmate vicki michelle owens smith told detective dennis smith an odd story about ron dennis smith made the following report at or hours saturday morning ron williamson looked out his window and saw vicki williamson yelled that she was a witch and that vicki was the one who took him to debbie carters house and now she had brought him debbies spirit into his cell and it was haunting the hell out of him williamson also screamed for his mother to forgive him in december one year after the murder glen gore was asked to stop by the police station and give a statement he denied any involvement in the death of debbie carter he said hed seen her at the coachlight a few hours before she was killed and added the new wrinkle that she had asked him to dance with her because ron williamson was making her uncomfortable the fact that no one else at the coachlight reported seeing ron there was apparently insignificant but as anxious as the cops were to paste together a case against him the evidence was simply too scant there was not a single fingerprint lifted from the carter apartment that matched either ron or dennis fritz a gaping hole in the theory that the two were there during the prolonged and violent attack there were no eyewitnesses no one heard a sound that night the hair analysis always shaky at best was still bottlenecked in melvin hetts office at the osbi the case against ron consisted of two inconclusive polygraph exams a bad reputation a residence not far from that of the victims and the delayed halfbaked eyewitness identification of glen gore the case against dennis fritz was even weaker one year after the murder the only tangible result of the investigation had been the firing of a ninthgrade science teacher in january ron pleaded guilty to the forgery charge and was sentenced to three years in prison he was transported to a correctional center near tulsa and it wasnt long before his odd behavior attracted the attention of the staff he was transferred to an intermediate mental health unit for observation dr robert briody interviewed him on the morning of february and noted he is usually subdued and appears in control of his actions but during an interview that afternoon dr briody saw a different person ron was hypomanic loud irritable easily excited has loose associations flight of ideas irrational thoughts and some paranoid ideation further evaluation was suggested security was not tight at the intermediate unit ron found a baseball field nearby and enjoyed sneaking over at night for the solitude a policeman found him once napping on the field and escorted him back to the unit the staff slapped his wrist and made him write a report it reads i was feeling down the other nite and needed some time to think things out ive always felt peaceful on a ballfield i strolled out to the ballfields southeast corner and kind of like an old bluetick hound i curled up under the shade tree a few minutes later a police officer asked me to go back to the ctc building i met brents halfway up the field and we walked in the front door together he said that after seeing i wasnt up to no good that hed forget it however as this letter attests ive been given a writeup with the prime suspect behind bars the investigation into the murder of debbie carter came to a virtual halt weeks passed with little activity dennis fritz worked for a short time in a nursing home then a factory the ada police harassed him occasionally but eventually lost interest glen gore was still in town but of little interest to the cops the police were frustrated tensions were high and the pressure was about to increase dramatically in april another young woman was murdered in ada and though her death was unrelated to debbie carters it would eventually have a profound impact on the lives of ron williamson and dennis fritz denice haraway was a twentyfouryearold student at east central who worked parttime at mcanallys convenience store on the eastern edge of ada she had been married for eight months to steve haraway also a student at east central and the son of a prominent dentist in town the newlyweds lived in a small apartment owned by dr haraway and were working their way through college on saturday night april around a customer was approaching the entrance to mcanallys when he was met by an attractive young woman who was leaving the store she was accompanied by a young man his arm was around her waist they appeared to be just another pair of lovers they walked to a pickup truck where the woman got in first on the passengers side then the young man got in and slammed the door and a few seconds later the engine started they left going east away from town the truck was an old chevrolet with a spotty grayprimered paint job inside the store the customer saw no one the cash register drawer was open and had been emptied a cigarette was still burning in the ashtray beside it was an open beer can and behind the counter was a brown purse and an open textbook the customer tried to find the clerk but the store was empty then he decided that perhaps there had been a robbery so he called the police in the brown purse an officer found a drivers license belonging to denice haraway the customer looked at the photo on the license and made a positive identification that was the young lady hed passed on the way into the store less than half an hour earlier yes he was sure it was denice haraway because he stopped at mcanallys often and knew her face detective dennis smith was already in bed when the call came treat it like a crime scene he said then went back to sleep his orders though were not followed the manager of the store lived nearby and he soon arrived he checked the safe it had not been opened he found in cash under the counter awaiting transfer to the safe and he found in another cash drawer as they waited for a detective the manager tidied up the place he emptied the ashtray with a single cigarette butt in it and threw away the beer can the police didnt stop him if there were fingerprints they were gone steve haraway was studying and waiting for his wife to come home after mcanallys closed at pm a phone call from the police stunned him and he was soon at the store identifying his wifes car textbooks and purse he gave the police a description and tried to remember what she was wearingblue jeans tennis shoes and a blouse he couldnt recall early sunday morning every policeman on ada s thirtythree man force was called in for duty state troopers arrived from nearby districts dozens of local groups including steves fraternity brothers volunteered to help in the search osbi agent gary rogers was assigned to lead the investigation from the state level and once again dennis smith was to direct the ada police they divided the county into sections and assigned teams to search every street highway road river ditch and field a clerk at jps another convenience store a half a mile from mcanallys came forward and told the police about two strange young men whod stopped by and spooked her not long before denice disappeared both were in their early twenties with long hair and weird behavior they shot a game of pool before leaving in an old pickup truck the customer at mcanallys had seen only one man leaving with denice and she did not appear to be frightened by him his general description sort of matched the general description of the two weird boys at jps so the police had the first hint of a trail they were looking for two white males between twentytwo and twentyfour years of age one between five feet eight and five feet ten with blond hair below his ears and a light complexion the other with shoulderlength light brown hair and a slim build the intense manhunt on sunday produced nothing not a single clue dennis smith and gary rogers called it off after dark and made plans to reassemble early the next morning on monday they obtained a college photograph of denice and printed flyers with her pretty face and general descriptionfive feet five inches tall pounds brown eyes dark blond hair light complexion the flyer also listed a description of the two young men seen at jps along with one of the old pickup truck these were placed in every store window in and around ada by cops and volunteers a police artist worked with the clerk from jps and put together two sketches when the drawings were shown to the customer at mcanallys he said that one of them was at least in the ballpark the two composites were given to the local television station and when the town got its first look at the possible suspects calls poured in to the police station ada had four detectives at the timedennis smith mike baskin d w barrett and james foxand they were soon overwhelmed with the number of calls more than a hundred with about twentyfive names given for potential suspects two names stood out billy charley was suggested by about thirty of the callers so he was invited in for questioning he arrived at the police station with his parents who said that he had been at home with them throughout saturday night the other name given by about thirty concerned citizens was that of tommy ward a local boy the police knew well tommy had been arrested several times for misdemeanorspublic drunkenness petty theftbut nothing violent he had family all over ada and the wards were known as generally decent folks who worked hard and tended to their own business tommy was twentyfour years old the second youngest of eight children a high school dropout he voluntarily came in for questioning detectives smith and baskin asked him about last saturday night hed been fishing with a friend karl fontenot then theyd gone to a party stayed out until am then walked home tommy didnt own a vehicle the detectives noticed that wards blond hair had been cut very short a hack job that was uneven and obviously unprofessional they took a polaroid of the back of his head and dated it may the suspects in the composites both had long lightcolored hair detective baskin found karl fontenot a man he did not know and asked him to stop by the station for some questions fontenot agreed but never arrived baskin didnt pursue it fontenot had long dark hair as the search continued with great urgency in and around pontotoc county denice haraways name and description were broadcast to law enforcement officials nationwide calls came from everywhere but not one was of any benefit denice had simply vanished without leaving a single clue when steve haraway wasnt handing out flyers or driving the back roads he was secluded in his apartment with a few friends the phone rang constantly and with each call there was a moment of hope there was no reason for denice to run away they had been married less than a year and were still very much in love both were seniors at east central looking forward to graduation and leaving ada for a life somewhere else she had been taken against her will he was certain of that each passing day brought a greater likelihood that denice would not be found alive if she had been grabbed by a rapist she would have been released after the assault if she had been kidnapped someone would have demanded a ransom there were rumors of an old lover down in texas but they came and went and there were rumors of drug traffickers and such but then most bizarre crimes had a few of those ada again was shocked by the crime debbie carter had been murdered seventeen months earlier and the town had just settled down from that nightmare now doors were locked and doublelocked curfews were tightened on teenagers and there was a brisk run of gun sales at the local pawnshops what was happening to the nice little college town with two churches on every corner weeks passed and life slowly returned to normal for most of ada s population it was soon summertime and the kids were out of school the rumors died down but didnt stop altogether a suspect in texas boasted of killing ten women and the ada police raced off to interview him a womans body was found in missouri with tattoos on her legs denice had no tattoos and so it went through the summer and into the fall not a single break or piece of evidence of any kind that would lead the police to the body of denice haraway and no progress in the carter investigation with two sensational murders remaining unsolved the atmosphere around the police department was heavy and strained long hours were worked with nothing to show for the time old leads were reviewed and chased again with the same results the lives of dennis smith and gary rogers were consumed with the two murders for rogers the pressure was even worse one year before the disappearance of denice haraway a similar crime had been committed in seminole thirty miles north of ada an eighteenyearold girl named patty hamilton was working at an allnight convenience store when she vanished a customer walked in and found the store empty the cash register cleaned out two open soft drink cans on the counter no sign of a struggle her locked car was found outside the store she was gone without a clue and for a year the police had assumed shed been abducted and murdered the osbi agent in charge of the patty hamilton case was gary rogers debbie carter denice haraway patty hamiltonagent rogers had the unsolved murders of three young women on his desk when oklahoma was still a territory ada had a colorful and richly deserved reputation as an open haven for gunslingers and outlaws disputes were settled with sixshooters and the quickest on the draw walked away with no fear of punishment from civil authorities bank robbers and cattle thieves drifted to ada because it was still indian territory and not a part of the states sheriffs when they could be found were no match for the professional criminals who settled in and around ada the towns reputation for lawlessness changed dramatically in when the locals finally got fed up with living in fear a respected rancher named gus bobbitt was gunned down by a professional killer hired by a rival landowner the killer and three conspirators were arrested and an epidemic of hanging fever swept through the town led by the masons the upstanding members of ada a lynch mob formed early on the morning of april forty members marched solemnly out of the masonic hall on twelfth at broadway in downtown ada and arrived at the jail a few minutes later they subdued the sheriff yanked the four thugs out of their cells and dragged them across the street to a livery stable that had been chosen for the occasion each of the four had his wrists and ankles bound with baling wire then each was ceremoniously hanged early the next morning a photographer set up his camera in the barn and took some pictures one survived over the years a faded black and white that clearly shows all four men suspended by their ropes motionless almost peaceful and quite dead years later the photo was reproduced on a postcard and handed out at the chamber of commerce office for decades the lynchings were ada s proudest moment chapter with the carter case dennis smith and gary rogers not only had an autopsy hair samples and suspicious polygraph exams but also were confident they had their killerron williamson was away for a spell doing time but he would be back theyd nail him sooner or later with haraway though they had nothingno body no witnesses not a single solid clue the sketches by the police artist could realistically fit half the young men in ada the cops were due for a break it came out of nowhere early in october when a man named jeff miller walked into the ada police department and asked to speak to detective dennis smith he said he had information about the haraway case miller was a local boy with no criminal record but the police knew him vaguely as one of the many restless young people in the town who kept late hours and moved from job to job usually in factories miller pulled up a chair and proceeded to tell his story the night denice haraway disappeared there had been a party near the blue river at a spot some twentyfive miles south of ada jeff miller had not actually been at the party but he knew two women who were there these two womenand he gave smith their nameslater told him that tommy ward was there and that at some point early in the party there was a shortage of alcohol ward who did not own a vehicle volunteered to go get some beer and he borrowed a pickup truck from one janette roberts ward left by himself in the truck was gone for a few hours and when he returned without the beer he was distraught and crying when asked why he was crying he said hed done something terrible what everyone at the party wanted to know well for some reason he had driven all the way back to ada passing many beer stores along the way and had found himself at mcanallys out east of town where he snatched the young female clerk raped her killed her disposed of her body and now he felt awful about it confessing all this to a random group of hard drinkers and dope smokers seemed like the logical thing to do miller offered no clue as to why the two women would tell him and not the police nor did he suggest any reason why they had waited five months as absurd as the story was dennis smith quickly pursued it he tried to find the two women but they had already moved away from ada when he finally tracked them down a month later they denied being at the party denied seeing tommy ward there or at any other party denied ever hearing a story about a young female store clerk getting kidnapped and killed or any other young female for that matter and denied everything jeff miller had included in his tale dennis smith located janette roberts she was living in norman seventy miles away with her husband mike roberts on october smith and detective mike baskin drove to norman and dropped in unannounced on janette they asked her to follow them down to the police station for a few questions which she reluctantly did during the interview janette admitted that she mike tommy ward and karl fontenot among many others had often partied down by the blue river but she was almost positive they had not done so on the saturday night the haraway girl disappeared she often loaned tommy ward her pickup but he had never left with it from a party at the river or any other place nor had she ever seen him crying and upset nor had she ever heard him blubbering about raping and murdering a young woman no sir that had never happened she was quite certain the detectives were pleasantly surprised to learn that tommy ward was living with the robertses and working with mike the two men were employed by a siding contractor and putting in long hours usually from sunrise to dark smith and baskin decided to stay in norman until ward came home from work then ask him some questions tommy and mike stopped for a sixpack on the way home and the beer drinking was one reason not to go chat with the cops more important tommy just didnt like them he was reluctant to go to the police station in norman the ada cops had quizzed him about the murder months earlier and he thought the matter was closed one reason hed left ada was because so many people commented on how much he looked like one of the suspects in the police composites and he was tired of it hed looked at the drawing many times and could see no resemblance it was just another sketch drawn by a police artist whod never seen the suspect and never would then broadcast to a community quite anxious to link the face to someone living in ada everybody wanted to help the police solve the crime it was a small town the disappearance was big news at one time or another everybody tommy knew had ventured a guess as to the likely identities of the suspects tommy had been through several runins with the ada police over the years nothing serious or violent but they knew him and he knew them and tommy preferred to avoid smith and rogers if at all possible in janettes opinion if tommy had nothing to hide then it was safe to go to the police station and chat with dennis smith and mike baskin tommy had nothing to do with the haraway girl but he didnt trust the police after wrestling with the issue for an hour he asked mike to drive him to the norman police department smith and baskin took him downstairs to a room with video equipment and explained that they wanted to make a tape of the interview tommy was nervous but agreed the machine was turned on and they read him his miranda rights and he signed the waiver the detectives began politely enough it was just another routine interview nothing important they asked tommy if he remembered the last interview five months earlier of course he did had he told them the truth then yes was he telling the truth now yes within minutes smith and baskin going back and forth with the questions confused tommy with the days of the week back in april on the day denice haraway disappeared tommy had worked on the plumbing in his mothers home then showered and gone to a party at the robertses home in ada hed left at four in the morning and walked home five months earlier hed told the cops this had happened the day before the disappearance i just got my days mixed up he tried to explain but the cops could not be convinced the detectives replies were when did you realize you hadnt told us the truth and are you telling us the truth now and youre getting yourself into more serious trouble the tone became harsh and accusatory smith and baskin lied and claimed to have several witnesses who would testify that tommy was at a party by the blue river that saturday night and had borrowed a pickup truck and left wrong day tommy said sticking to his version hed gone fishing on friday partied at the robertses on saturday and gone to a party at the river on sunday why were the cops lying tommy asked himself he knew the truth the lying continued isnt it true you were going to rob mcanallys weve got people who are going to testify to that tommy shook his head and held firm but he was deeply troubled if the police were willing to lie so casually what else might they do dennis smith then pulled out a large photograph of denice haraway and held it close to tommys face do you know that girl i dont know her ive seen her did you kill that girl no i didnt i wouldnt take nobodys life from them who did kill her i dont know smith continued to hold the photo while asking if she was a pretty girl her family would like to bury her theyd like to know where she is so they could bury her i dont know where shes at tommy said staring at the photo and wondering why he was being accused would you tell me where shes at so her family could bury her i dont know use your imagination smith said two guys took her got her in a pickup took her away what do you think they did with the body no telling use your imagination what do you think she could be alive for all i know for all you know for all anyone knows smith continued to hold up the photo as he asked questions every answer by tommy was immediately disregarded treated as if it werent true or werent heard by the detectives they asked him repeatedly if he thought she was a pretty girl did he think she screamed during the attack dont you think her family should be able to bury her tommy have you prayed about this smith asked he finally put the photo aside and asked tommy about his mental health about the composite sketches about his educational background then he picked up the photo again thrust it near tommys face and started over with questions about killing the girl burying the body and wasnt she a pretty girl mike baskin attempted a tearjerker when he talked about denices familys ordeal all it would take to end their suffering would be to tell where shes at tommy agreed but said he had no idea where the girl was the machine was finally turned off the interview lasted an hour and fortyfive minutes and tommy ward never wavered from his original statementhe knew nothing about the disappearance of denice haraway he was quite rattled by the meeting but agreed to take a lie detector test in a few days the robertses lived only a few blocks from the norman police station and tommy decided to walk to their home the fresh air felt good but he was angry at being treated so harshly by the cops they had accused him of killing the girl they had lied repeatedly to try to trick him driving back to ada smith and baskin were convinced they had found their man tommy ward looked like the sketch of one of the strangeacting boys whod stopped by jps store that saturday night hed changed his story about where he was on the night denice vanished and he seemed nervous during the interview they had just completed at first tommy was relieved that he would be taking a polygraph exam he would tell the truth the test would prove it and the cops would finally stop hassling him then he began having nightmares about the murder the accusations by the police the comments about his resemblance to the man in the sketch the pretty face of denice haraway and her familys anguish why was he being accused the police believed he was guilty they wanted him to be guilty why should he trust them with a lie detector exam should he talk to a lawyer he called his mother and told her he was scared of the police and the polygraph im afraid theyll make me say something im not supposed to say he told her tell the truth she advised him and everything will be fine thursday morning october mike roberts drove tommy to the osbi offices in oklahoma city twenty minutes away the exam was to take about an hour mike would wait in the parking lot then the two would drive to work their boss had given them a couple of hours off as mike roberts watched tommy enter the building he could not imagine that the boy was taking his last steps in the free world the rest of his life would be behind prison walls dennis smith met tommy with a big smile and a warm handshake then put him in an office where he waited alone for half an houra favorite police trick to make the suspect even more nervous at he was led to another room and waiting there was agent rusty featherstone and his trusty polygraph smith disappeared featherstone explained how the machine worked or how it was supposed to work as he strapped tommy in and hooked up the electrodes by the time the questions started tommy was already sweating the first questions were easy family education employmenteverybody knew the truth and the machine complied this could be a cakewalk tommy started thinking at featherstone read tommy his miranda rights and began probing into the haraway matter for two and a half hours of tortuous questioning tommy gamely stuck to the truthhe knew nothing about the denice haraway matter without a single break the exam lasted until when featherstone unplugged everything and left the room tommy was relieved even elated because the ordeal was finally over he had aced the test finally the cops would leave him alone featherstone was back in five minutes poring over the graph paper studying the results he asked tommy what he thought tommy said he knew hed passed the exam the matter was over and he really needed to get to work not so fast featherstone said you flunked it tommy was incredulous but featherstone said it was obvious he was lying and clear that he was involved in the haraway kidnapping would he like to talk about it talk about what the polygraph doesnt lie featherstone said pointing to the results right there on the paper you know something about the murder he said repeatedly things would go much smoother for tommy if he came clean talked about what happened told the truth featherstone the nice cop was anxious to help tommy but if tommy refused his kindness then he would be forced to hand him over to smith and rogers the nasty cops who were waiting ready to pounce lets talk about it featherstone urged him theres nothing to talk about tommy insisted he said again and again that the polygraph was rigged or something because he was telling the truth but featherstone wasnt buying it tommy admitted to being nervous before the exam and anxious while it was under way because he was late for work he also admitted that the interview six days earlier with smith and rogers had upset him and caused him to have a dream what kind of dream featherstone wanted to know tommy described his dream he was at a keg party then he was sitting in a pickup truck with two other men and a girl out by the old power plant near ada where he grew up one of the men tried to kiss the girl she refused and tommy told the man to leave her alone then he said he wanted to go home youre already home one of the men said tommy looked through his window and he was suddenly at home just before he woke up he was standing at a sink trying in vain to wash a black liquid off his hands the girl was not identified neither were the two men that dream doesnt make sense featherstone said most dreams dont tommy retorted featherstone remained calm but continued to press tommy to come clean tell him everything about the crime and especially tell him where the body was and he threatened again to turn tommy over to those two cops waiting in the next room as if a lengthy torture session could be in the works tommy was stunned and confused and very frightened when he refused to confess to featherstone the nice cop turned him over to smith and rogers who were already angry and seemed ready to throw punches featherstone stayed in the room and as soon as the door closed smith lunged at tommy yelling you karl fontenot and odell titsworth grabbed that girl took her out to the power plant raped and killed her didnt you no tommy said trying to think clearly and not panic talk to us you little lying sonofabitch smith growled you just flunked the polygraph we know youre lying and we know you killed that girl tommy was trying to place odell titsworth a name he had heard but a man hed never met odell lived somewhere around ada he thought and he had a bad reputation but tommy could not remember meeting him maybe hed seen him once or twice but at the moment he couldnt remember because smith was yelling and pointing and ready to punch him smith repeated his theory about the three men snatching the girl and tommy said no no i had nothing to do with it i dont even know odell titsworth yes you do smith corrected him stop lying karl fontenots involvement in their theory was easier to understand because he and tommy had been friends off and on for a couple of years but tommy was bewildered by the accusations and terrified of the smug certainty of smith and rogers back and forth they went with their threats and verbal abuse the language deteriorated and soon included every profanity and obscenity on the list tommy was sweating and dizzy and trying desperately to think rationally he kept his responses short no i didnt do it no i wasnt involved a few times he wanted to lash out with sarcastic comments but he was scared smith and rogers were erupting and armed and tommy was locked in a room with them and featherstone his interrogation showed no signs of ending anytime soon after sweating through three hours with featherstone and suffering an hour of torment from smith and rogers tommy really needed a break he needed to find a restroom and smoke a cigarette and clear his head he needed help to talk to someone who could tell him what was going on can i take a break he asked just a few more minutes they said tommy noticed a video camera on a nearby table unplugged and neglecting the verbal battering under way surely he thought this cannot be standard police procedure smith and rogers repeatedly reminded tommy that oklahoma uses lethal injection to kill its killers he was facing death certain death but there might be a way to avoid it come clean tell what happened lead them to the body and they would use their influence to get him a deal i didnt do it tommy kept saying he had a dream featherstone informed his two colleagues tommy repeated the dream and again it was met with disapproval the three cops agreed that the dream made little sense to which tommy replied again most dreams dont but the dream gave the cops something to work with and they began adding to it the other two men in the truck were odell titsworth and karl fontenot right no tommy insisted the men in his dream were not identified no names bullshit the girl was denice haraway right no the girl was not identified in his dream bullshit for another hour the cops added the necessary details to tommys dream and every new fact was denied by him it was just a dream he kept saying over and over and over just a dream bullshit said the cops after two hours of nonstop hammering tommy finally cracked the pressure came from fearsmith and rogers were angry and seemed perfectly able and willing to slap him around if not outright shoot himbut also from the horror of wasting away on death row before finally getting executed and it was obvious to tommy that he would not be allowed to leave until he gave the cops something after five hours in the room he was exhausted confused and almost paralyzed with fear he made a mistake one that would send him to death row and eventually cost him his freedom for life tommy decided to play along since he was completely innocent and he assumed karl fontenot and odell titsworth were too then give the cops what they want play along with their fiction the truth would quickly be discovered tomorrow or the next day the cops would realize that the story did not check out they would talk to karl and he would tell the truth they would find odell titsworth and he would laugh at them play along good police work will find the truth if his dream confession was sufficiently ridiculous how could anyone believe it didnt odell go in the store first sure why not tommy said it was only a dream now the cops were getting somewhere the boy was finally breaking under their clever tactics robbery was the motive right sure whatever it was only a dream throughout the afternoon smith and rogers added more and more fiction to the dream and tommy played along it was only a dream even as the grotesque confession was happening the police should have realized they had serious problems detective mike baskin was waiting back in ada at the police department sitting by the phone and wishing he was at the osbi in the thick of things around pm gary rogers called with great newstommy ward was talking get in the car drive out to the power plant west of town and look for the body baskin raced off certain the search would soon be over he found nothing and realized he would need several men for a thorough search he drove back to the police station the phone rang again the story had changed there was an old burned house on the right as you approach the power plant thats where the body is baskin took off again found the house picked through the rubble found nothing and drove back to town his goose chase continued with the third call from rogers the story had changed yet again somewhere in the vicinity of the power plant and the burned house there was a concrete bunker thats where they put the body baskin rounded up two more officers and some floodlights and took off again they found the concrete bunker and were still searching when darkness fell they found nothing with each call back from baskin smith and rogers made modifications to tommys dream the hours dragged on the suspect was beyond fatigue they tagteamed back and forth good cop bad cop voices low and almost sympathetic then bursts of yelling cursing threatening you lyin little sonofabitch was their favorite tommy had it screamed at him a thousand times youd better be glad mike baskin aint here smith said or he would blow your brains out a bullet to the head would not have surprised tommy after dark when they realized that the body would not be found that day smith and rogers decided to wrap up the confession with the video camera still unplugged they walked tommy through their story beginning with the three killers riding around in odell titsworths pickup planning the robbery realizing denice would identify them so they grabbed her then decided to rape and kill her the details on the location of the body were vague but the detectives felt sure it was hidden somewhere near the power plant tommy was braindead and barely able to mumble he tried to recite their tale but kept getting the facts mixed up smith and rogers would stop him repeat their fiction and make him start over finally after four rehearsals with little improvement and their star fading fast the cops decided to turn on the camera do it now they said to tommy do it right and none of that dream bullshit but the story aint true tommy said just tell it anyway the cops insisted then well help you prove its not true and none of that dream bullshit at pm tommy ward looked at the camera and stated his name he had been interrogated for eight and a half hours and he was physically and emotionally wasted he was smoking a cigarette his first of the afternoon and sitting before him was a soft drink can as if he and cops were just finishing up a friendly little chat everything nice and civilized he told his tale he karl fontenot and odell titsworth kidnapped denice haraway from the store drove out to the power plant on the west side of town raped her killed her then tossed her body somewhere near a concrete bunker out by sandy creek the murder weapon was titsworths lockblade knife it was all a dream he said or meant to say or thought he said several times he used the name titsdale the detectives stopped him and helpfully suggested the name titsworth tommy corrected himself and plodded on he kept thinking any blind cop could see that im lying thirtyone minutes later the video was turned off tommy was handcuffed then driven back to ada and thrown in jail mike roberts was still waiting in the parking lot of the osbi building hed been there for almost nine and a half hours the next morning smith and rogers called a press conference and announced they had solved the haraway case tommy ward age twentyfour of ada had confessed and implicated two other men who were not yet in custody the cops asked the press to sit on the story for a couple of days until they could round up the other suspects the newspaper complied but a television station did not the news was soon broadcast over southeastern oklahoma a few hours later karl fontenot was arrested near tulsa and driven back to ada smith and rogers fresh from their success with tommy ward handled the interrogation though a video recorder was ready no tape was made of the questioning karl was twenty years old and had been living on his own since he was sixteen he grew up in ada in wretched povertyhis father had been an alcoholic and karl had witnessed his mothers death in an auto accident he was an impressionable kid with few friends and virtually no family he insisted he was innocent and knew nothing about the haraway disappearance karl proved to be considerably easier to break than tommy and in less than two hours smith and rogers had another taped confession one suspiciously similar to wards karl repudiated his confession immediately after he was placed in jail and would later state ive never been in jail or had a police record in my life and no one in my face telling me id killed a pretty woman that im going to get the death penalty so i told them the story hoping they would leave me alone which they did after i taped the statement they said i had a choice to write it or tape it i didnt even know what the word statement or confessing meant till they told me i confessed to it so thats the reason i gave them an untrue statement so they would leave me alone the police made sure the story got to the press ward and fontenot had made full confessions the haraway mystery was solved most of it anyway they were working on titsworth and expected to charge all three with murder in a matter of days the site of the burned house was located and the police found the remains of what appeared to be a jawbone this was soon reported in the ada evening news in spite of the careful coaching karls confession was a mess there were huge discrepancies between his version of the crime and tommys the two were in direct contradiction on such details as the order in which the three raped denice whether or not she was stabbed by her attackers during the rape the location and number of stab wounds whether or not she managed to break free and run a few steps before being caught and when she finally died the most glaring discrepancy was how they killed her and what they did with her body tommy ward said she received multiple knife wounds while lying in the back of odells pickup during the gang rape she died there and they flung her body into a ditch near a concrete bunker fontenot didnt recall it that way in his version they took her into an abandoned house where odell titsworth stabbed her stuffed her beneath the floor then poured gasoline over her and burned down the house but the two were in almost complete agreement on odell titsworth he had been the organizer the mastermind who rounded up ward and fontenot to go riding in his pickup to drink some beer smoke some pot and at some point rob mcanallys once the gang had decided on which store to rob odell went in and stole the money grabbed the girl and told his buddies they would have to kill her so she couldnt identify them he drove out to the power plant he directed the gang rape going first himself he produced the weapon a sixinch lockblade knife he stabbed her killed her and either he burned her or he did not though they admitted their involvement the real blame rested on odell titsworth or titsdale or whatever his name was late in the afternoon of friday october the police arrested titsworth and questioned him he was a fourtime convicted felon with a lousy attitude toward cops and far greater experience with their interrogation tactics he didnt budge an inch he knew nothing about the haraway case didnt give a damn what ward and fontenot said on tape or off he had never met either of the gentlemen no video was made of his interrogation titsworth was thrown in jail where he soon recalled that on april he had broken his arm in a fight with the police two days later when denice disappeared he had been at his girlfriends house wearing a heavy cast and in great pain in both confessions he had been described as wearing a tshirt with tattoos covering his arms in truth his left arm had been covered with a cast and hed been nowhere near mcanallys when dennis smith investigated this he found hospital and police records that clearly verified odells story smith spoke with the treating physician who described the break as a spiral fracture between the elbow and shoulder and very painful it would have been impossible for titsworth to carry a body or commit a violent attack only two days after the fracture his arm was in a cast and the cast was in a sling impossible the confessions continued to unravel as the police sifted through the rubble of the burned house its owner appeared and asked what they were doing when he was told that they were looking for the remains of the haraway girl and that one of the suspects had confessed to burning her with the house the owner said that was not possible hed burned the old house himself in june ten months before she disappeared the state medical examiner completed an analysis of the jawbone and concluded that it came from a possum this was given to the press however the press was not told of the burned house or odell titsworths broken arm nor of the fact that ward and fontenot had immediately repudiated their confessions in jail ward and fontenot were adamant about their innocence and told anyone who would listen that the confessions were extracted by threats and promises the ward family scraped together enough money to hire a good lawyer and tommy described to him in great detail the tricks used by smith and rogers during the interrogation it was just a dream he said a thousand times there was no family for karl fontenot the search for the remains of denice haraway continued in earnest the obvious question asked by many was if those two confessed then why dont the police know where the body is buried the fifth amendment to the us constitution protects against selfincrimination and since the easiest way to solve a crime is to get a confession there is a thick and rich body of law that governs police conduct during interrogations much of this law was well established before a hundred years earlier in hopt v utah the supreme court ruled that a confession is not admissible if it is obtained by operating on the hopes or fears of the accused and in doing so deprives him of the freedom of will or selfcontrol necessary to make a voluntary statement in the court in bram v united states said that a statement must be free and voluntary not extracted by any sorts of threats or violence or promises however slight a confession obtained from an accused who has been threatened cannot be admissible in in blackburn v alabama the court said coercion can be mental as well as physical in reviewing whether a confession was psychologically coerced by the police the following factors are crucial the length of the interrogation whether it was prolonged in nature when it took place day or night with a strong suspicion around nighttime confessions and the psychological makeupintelligence sophistication education and so onof the suspect and in miranda v arizona the most famous of all selfincrimination cases the supreme court imposed procedural safeguards to protect the rights of the accused a suspect has a constitutional right not to be compelled to talk and any statement made during an interrogation cannot be used in court unless the police and the prosecutor can prove that the suspect clearly understood that he had the right to remain silent anything said could be used against him in court and he had a right to an attorney whether or not he could afford one if during an interrogation the accused requests an attorney then the questioning stops immediately miranda was decided in and became instantly famous many police departments ignored it at least until guilty criminals were set free because they had not been properly advised of their rights it was harshly criticized by lawandorder types who accused the court of coddling the bad guys it worked its way into our culture with every cop on tv spitting out the words you have the right to remain silent as he made his arrest rogers smith and featherstone knew its importance because they made sure tommys miranda procedure was properly recorded what was not seen on the video was the five and a half hours of nonstop threats and verbal abuse the confessions of tommy ward and karl fontenot were constitutional disasters but at the time in october the cops still believed they would find the body and thus some credible evidence any trial was months away they still had plenty of time to build a solid case against ward and fontenot or so they thought but denice was not found tommy and karl had no idea where she was and they repeatedly told this to the police months dragged on with no evidence not a shred of it the confessions became more and more important indeed they were to become the only evidence the state had at trial chapter ron williamson was well aware of the haraway case he had the best seat in the housea bed in the pontotoc county jail after serving ten months of his threeyear sentence he was paroled back to ada and placed under house arrest a rather loose arrangement that severely restricted his movements not surprisingly it didnt work ron was unmedicated and unable to keep track of time and dates or anything else in november while living at home he was charged with willfully and wrongfully having been sentenced to confinement with the department of corrections for the crime of uttering a forged instrument and while on house arrest status did escape from such status and confinement by leaving his house during a time not consented to by the doc rons version was that he walked down the street to buy a pack of cigarettes and returned home thirty minutes later than expected he was arrested jailed and four days later charged with the felony of escape from a penal institution he made a paupers oath and requested courtappointed counsel the jail was buzzing with the haraway matter tommy ward and karl fontenot were already there the inmates with absolutely nothing to do talked and talked ward and fontenot had center stage because their crime was the most recent and certainly the most sensational tommy described the dream confession and the tactics used by smith rogers and featherstone the detectives were well known to his audience tommy insisted over and over that he had nothing to do with denice haraway that the real killers were out there laughing at the two stupid boys who confessed and the cops who tricked them into it without the body of denice haraway bill peterson had an enormous legal challenge his case consisted of the two taped confessions with absolutely no physical evidence as a foundation indeed the truth contradicted virtually everything on the tapes and the confessions clearly contradicted each other peterson had the two sketches of the suspects but even they were problematic arguably one favored tommy ward but no one had suggested that the other drawing even remotely resembled karl fontenot thanksgiving came and went with no body then christmas in january bill peterson convinced a judge that there was sufficient evidence that denice haraway was dead during a preliminary hearing the confessions were played to a packed courtroom the reaction was generally one of shock though many noted the glaring discrepancies between wards account and fontenots nevertheless it was time for a trial with or without a dead body but the legal wrangling went on and on two judges recused themselves the search lost steam and was finally called off a year after denice disappeared most of ada was convinced ward and fontenot were guiltywhy else would they confess but there was also speculation about the lack of evidence why was it taking so long for a trial in april a year after the disappearance of denice haraway the ada evening news ran a story by dorothy hogue about the towns frustration with the pace of the investigations unsolved violent crimes haunt ada was the headline and hogue summarized both on haraway she wrote although authorities have searched many local areas both before and after the arrests of ward and fontenot no trace of haraway has ever been found however detective dennis smith said he is convinced the case is solved the alleged confessions were not mentioned on the carter case hogue wrote evidence found at the murder scene and evidence concerning the suspect were sent to the oklahoma state bureau of investigation laboratory less than two years ago and the police said they are still waiting for results the backlog at the osbi was noted dennis smith said the police have narrowed their focus to one suspect in the case but no one has ever been arrested in connection with the crime in february ron was in court on the escape charge his courtappointed lawyer was david morris a man who knew the williamson family well ron entered a plea of guilty to the escape charge and received a twoyear sentence most of which would be suspended if ron completed some mental health counseling stayed out of trouble stayed in pontotoc county and refrained from using alcohol a few months later he was arrested for public drunkenness in pottawatomie county bill peterson filed a motion to revoke his suspended sentence and to require him to serve the remainder of his sentence david morris was again appointed by the court to represent him a revocation hearing was held on july before the special district judge john david miller or at least it was attempted ron unmedicated wouldnt shut up he argued with morris judge miller and the deputies and he became so disruptive that the hearing was postponed three days later they tried again judge miller asked the jailers and deputies to warn ron about his behavior but he entered the courtroom yelling and cursing the judge warned him repeatedly and he repeatedly rebuked the judge he demanded a new lawyer but when the judge asked for a reason he had none his conduct was repulsive but even in the midst of the turmoil it was obvious that he needed help at times he seemed connected to what was happening then a moment later his rantings were incoherent he was angry bitter and lashing out at the world after several warnings judge miller ordered him back to the jail and the hearing was postponed again the next day david morris filed a motion requesting a hearing into rons mental competency he also filed a motion to withdraw as counsel in his twisted world ron saw himself as perfectly normal he was insulted by the fact that his lawyer would question his mental stability so he stopped speaking to him morris was fed up the motion for a competency hearing was granted the motion to withdraw was denied two weeks later the hearing was initiated and quickly called off ron was even crazier than before judge miller ordered a psychiatric evaluation early in juanita williamson was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and it progressed rapidly for two and a half years she had lived with the constant rumors that her son killed debbie carter and she wanted to settle the issue before she passed away juanita was fastidious about paperwork she had kept a detailed daily journal for decades her business records were perfect give her a minute and she could tell any customer the dates of her last five appointments she threw away nothingpaid bills canceled checks receipts her childrens report cards and other mementos she had checked her diary a hundred times and knew that on the night of december ron had been at home with her she had shared this with the police on more than one occasion their theory was that he could easily have sneaked out of the house darted through a back alley committed the crime then returned home forget motive forget glen gores lies about seeing ron at the coachlight that night harassing debbie carter minor points the cops had their man but the cops also knew that juanita williamson was highly respected she was devout in her christian faith and well known throughout the pentecostal churches she had hundreds of customers at her beauty shop and treated them all like close friends if juanita took the witness stand and said ronnie was at home on the night of the murder the jury would believe her maybe her son was having problems but hed certainly been raised better now juanita remembered something else in videocassette rentals were becoming popular a store down the street had discovered the business on december juanita rented a vcr unit and five of her favorite movies which she and ron watched until early the next morning he was there at home that night in the den on the sofa having a wonderful time watching old movies with his mother and juanita had the rental receipt david morris had always tended to the light legal matters juanita needed he admired her greatly and as a favor he occasionally represented ron in some of his escapades though he was far from an ideal client morris listened to her story looked at the receipt and had no doubt she was telling the truth he was also relieved because he like most folks in town had heard the constant rumors about rons involvement in the carter murder most of morriss work was criminal defense and he had little respect for the ada police but he knew them and he arranged a meeting with dennis smith and juanita he even drove her down to the police station and sat with her while she explained things to dennis smith the detective listened carefully studied the rental record and asked her if she would video a statement certainly david morris watched through a window as juanita was placed in a chair faced the camera and answered smiths questions driving home she was relieved and certain that she had laid the matter to rest if the video camera was loaded with a tape it was never seen if detective smith made a report of the interview it was never produced in the legal proceedings that followed sitting in jail killing days and weeks ron worried about his mother by august she was dying in the hospital and he was not allowed to see her that month by court order he was examined again by dr charles amos who planned to administer some tests during the first one though he noted that ron was simply marking true for all the answers when amos quizzed him he replied whats more important this test or my mother the evaluation was called off but amos did note it should be pointed out that this examiners interview with mr williamson shows a marked deterioration of emotional function since our last encounter in ron begged the police to allow him to see his mother before she died annette pleaded too over the years she had become acquainted with the officers at the jail when she took ronnie cookies and brownies she took enough for all the inmates and all the jailers she even cooked entire meals for them in the jails kitchen the hospital was not far away she reasoned it was a small town everybody knew ron and his family he was unlikely to somehow get a weapon and hurt people finally a deal was made and ron was led out ofjail after midnight handcuffed and chained surrounded by heavily armed deputies and driven to the hospital where he was placed in a wheelchair and rolled down the hallway juanita had been clear that she did not want to see her son in handcuffs annette had begged the police to comply and they had reluctantly agreed but somewhere along the way the agreement was forgotten the cuffs and leg chains were not removed ron pleaded with the copsjust remove the handcuffs for a few minutes while he saw his mother for the last time it couldnt be done he was told to remain seated in the wheelchair ron asked for a blanket to hide the handcuffs and shackles the cops hesitatedcould be a security riskthen relented they wheeled him into juanitas room and insisted that annette and renee leave they asked to stay so the family could be together one last time too risky the cops said go wait in the hall ron told his mother how much he loved her how sorry he was for the mess hed made of his life sorry for all the disappointments he cried and begged her to forgive him and of course she did he quoted some scripture intimacy though was somewhat difficult because the cops stayed in the room hovering over ron so he couldnt jump out a window or harm someone the farewell was brief the cops cut it off after a few minutes saying they had to get back to the jail annette and renee could hear their brother crying as they rolled him away juanita died on august initially the police declined the familys request to allow ron to attend the funeral they relented only after annettes husband offered to pay two former deputies two of his cousins to help guard ron throughout the service for dramatic effect the police treated his presence at the funeral as a major security event they insisted that everyone be seated first before the criminal could enter and they refused to unshackle him such precautions were obviously needed for a felon who forged a check the sanctuary was packed the open casket was in place in front of the altar so that everyone could see juanitas gaunt profile the rear doors opened and her son was escorted down the aisle by his guards his ankles were chained together as were his wrists with both chains secured to a belly chain around his waist as he shuffled along in half steps the clinking and rattling of the hardware frayed whatever nerves were left in the crowd when he saw his mother in the open casket ron began sobbing and saying im sorry mother im so sorry the sobbing turned to wailing as he neared the casket they settled him into his seat guards on both sides chains clattering with every move he was nervous upset manic and unable to be still and quiet ron sat in the first pentecostal holiness church in the sanctuary where he had worshipped as a boy where annette still played the organ every sunday morning where his mother had seldom missed a meeting and wept as he stared at her withered face a lunch was served in the churchs fellowship hall after the service ron shuffled over to it guards within striking distance hed been living off jail food for almost a year and the potluck spread before him was a feast annette asked the cop in charge to remove his handcuffs so he could eat the request was refused she quietly pleaded no came the answer family and friends watched with pity as his sisters annette and renee took turns feeding him at the grave site after some scripture and a prayer the mourners filed past annette renee and ron and offered their condolences and kind thoughts there were polite hugs and warm embraces but not from ron unable to lift his arms he was forced to respond with awkward pecks on the cheeks for the women and clumsy chainrattling handshakes for the men it was september still very hot and sweat rolled down his forehead and dripped onto his cheeks he was unable to wipe his face so annette and renee did it for him dr charles amos submitted to the court a report in which he stated that ron williamson was a mentally ill person as defined by oklahoma law that he could not appreciate the nature of the charges against him that he could not assist his attorney in his defense and that he could attain mental competency only after undergoing treatment he also stated that if ron was released without treatment he would pose a danger to himself and others judge miller adopted the findings of dr amos and entered an order that declared ron mentally incompetent he was transported to eastern state hospital in vinita for further evaluation and treatment there he was seen by dr r d garcia who prescribed dalmane and restoril for insomnia mellaril for hallucinations and delusions and thorazine for schizophrenia hyperactivity combativeness and the hyperenergy phase of manic depression the drugs were adjusted over a few days and ron settled down and began improving after a couple of weeks dr garcia concluded he is a sociopath and has a history of alcohol abuse he must continue to take thorazine loomg four times a day he is not an escape risk this was somewhat ironic since the prison sentence being revoked was for an escape answering written questions from the court dr garcia said he is a person able to appreciate the nature of the charges against him and is able to consult with his lawyer and rationally assist in the preparation of his defense and is no longer mentally ill and even if he is released without treatment therapy or training he probably would not pose a significant threat to the life or safety of himself or others not unless he becomes more sociopathic and may be considered potentially dangerous especially when drinking heavily ron was returned to ada where his revocation process was to be resumed however instead of holding a postexamination inquiry into his competency judge miller simply accepted dr garcias findings at face value ron mentally incompetent by court order was never adjudicated to be competent based on dr garcias conclusions the suspended sentence was revoked and ron was sent back to prison for the remainder of his twoyear term when he left eastern state he was given a twoweek supply of thorazine in september tommy ward and karl fontenot were put on trial in ada their lawyers had argued strenuously to have their cases separated and more important to get them out of pontotoc county denice haraway was still missing and still talked about and hundreds of locals had helped look for her her fatherinlaw was a local dentist who was greatly respected ward and fontenot had been in jail for eleven months their confessions had been hot topics in the coffee shops and beauty parlors since october when first reported in the newspaper how could the defendants expect to draw an impartial jury notorious trials are moved every day to other venues the motions to change venue were denied the other pretrial war was over the confessions attorneys for ward and fontenot attacked the statements and especially the methods used by detectives smith and rogers to obtain them the tales told by the boys were clearly not true not a shred of physical evidence backed up anything they said peterson fought back with a vengeance without the tapes he had no case whatsoever after lengthy and heated arguments the judge ruled that the confessions could be seen by the jury the state called fiftyone witnesses few of whom said anything substantive many were friends of denice haraway put on the stand to help prove she was in fact missing and presumed dead the trial had only one surprise a career criminal by the name of terri holland was called as a witness she told the jury that she was in the county jail back in october when karl fontenot was brought in the two talked occasionally and he admitted to her that he tommy ward and odell titsworth had kidnapped raped and killed the girl fontenot denied ever meeting the woman terri holland wasnt the only jailhouse snitch to testify a petty criminal named leonard martin was also behind bars the prosecution hauled him over and at trial he told the jury that he once overheard karl in his cell talking to himself and saying i knew wed get caught i knew wed get caught such was the quality of the states evidenceproof offered to persuade a jury of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt with no physical evidence the taped confessions were beyond crucial but they were filled with discrepancies and obvious lies the prosecution was forced into the bizarre position of admitting ward and fontenot were lying while asking the jurors to believe them anyway please disregard all that stuff about titsworth because he wasnt really involved please overlook such trifling matters as the burned house with the dead body because the house had been torched ten months earlier monitors were rolled in the lights were dimmed the tapes were played the grisly details emerged and ward and fontenot were headed for death row in his closing argument his first in a murder case assistant da chris ross aimed for high drama in graphic narrative he recalled the gory details from the tapesthe stab wounds the blood and guts the brutal raping and knifing of such a pretty girl then the horrible burning of her body the jurors were sufficiently angered after brief deliberations they returned with guilty verdicts and death penalties the truth though was that the body was not stabbed and it was not burned regardless of what ward and fontenot said in their bogus confessions and regardless of what bill peterson and chris ross told the jury denice haraway was killed by a single gunshot wound to the head her remains were found the following january by a hunter deep in the woods near the settlement of gerty in hughes county twentyseven miles from ada and far from any place that had been searched the true cause of death should have convinced everyone involved that ward and fontenot had indeed dreamed up their ridiculous tales and had been coerced into confessing it did not the true cause of death should have prompted the authorities to admit they were wrong and begin searching for the real murderer it did not after the trial but before the body was found tommy ward was waiting to be transferred to death row at mcalester a prison fiftyfive miles east of ada still stunned by the events that had led him to now face death by lethal injection he was frightened confused and depressed one year earlier he had been a typical ada twentysomething looking for a good job and a good party and a cute girl the real killers are out there he kept thinking laughing at us laughing at the cops he wondered if they the killers had been brazen enough to watch his trial why not they were safe one day he had visitorstwo ada cops they were his friends now his buddies very concerned about what would happen to him once he got to mcalester they were thoughtful quiet and measured with their wordsno threats yelling or cursing no promises of death by injection they really wanted to find the body of denice haraway thus they offered a deal if tommy would tell them where she was buried they would lobby hard over at petersons office and get the death sentence reduced to life they claimed to have this authority but did not the case was far beyond their control tommy didnt know where the body was he repeated what he had been saying for almost a yearhe had nothing to do with the crime now facing death tommy ward still could not give the cops what they wanted not long after the arrests of ward and fontenot their story came to the attention of a respected new york journalist robert mayer then living in the southwest he heard the story from the woman he was dating her brother was married to one of tommy wards sisters mayer was intrigued by the dream confession and the havoc it was creating why he wondered would anyone confess to a terrible crime but fill the confession with lies he went to ada and began investigating the story throughout the prolonged pretrial process then during the trial itself mayer diligently researched the town its people the crime the police the prosecutors and especially ward and fontenot ada watched him closely it was rare to have a real writer in their midst probing watching about to write god knows what over time mayer gained the trust of most of the players he interviewed bill peterson at length he sat through meetings with the defense attorneys he spent hours with the cops during one meeting dennis smith talked about the pressure of having two unsolved murders in such a small town he pulled out a photo of debbie carter and showed it to mayer we know ron williamson killed her smith said we just cant prove it yet when mayer began the project he believed that there was an even chance the boys were guilty but he was soon appalled by the actions of smith and rogers and by the legal proceedings against ward and fontenot there was no evidence other than the confessions and as shocking as they were they were so full of contradictions that they could not be believed nonetheless mayer strove to present a balanced picture of the crime and the trial his book the dreams of ada was published by viking in april and was greatly anticipated by the town the reaction was swift but predictable some people discounted the book because of the authors friendliness with the ward family others were convinced the boys were guilty because they confessed and nothing could ever change their opinions there was also a widespread belief that the police and the prosecutors had botched the case sent the wrong men to prison and left the real killers out there stung by the criticismits rare for a smalltown prosecutor to have a book written about one of his cases and a very unflattering one at that bill peterson roared into action in the debbie carter matter he had something to prove the investigation was stalethe poor girl had been dead for more than four yearsbut it was time to nail someone peterson and the police had believed for years that the killer was ron williamson perhaps dennis fritz was involved maybe not but they knew williamson was in carters apartment that night they had no evidence just gut feelings ron was out of prison and back in ada when his mother died in august he was in jail awaiting a competency hearing and staring at two more years in prison annette and renee reluctantly sold the small house where they had grown up when ron was paroled from prison in october he had no place to live he moved in with annette and her husband and son and for a few days tried hard to fit in but his old habits returnedthe latenight meals he prepared with great noise the allnight television routine at full volume the smoking and drinking and the daylong naps on the sofa after a month or so with nerves frayed and her family on edge annette had to ask him to leave the two years in prison had done nothing to improve his mental health he had moved in and out of various state hospitals with different doctors trying different combinations of drugs often there were no medications at all he would survive for a while in the general prison population then someone would notice his bizarre behavior and off hed go to another mental unit upon his release the department of corrections made an appointment for ron to see a social worker at mental health services in ada on october he met norma walker who noted that he was taking lithium navane and artane she found him to be pleasant controlled and a little strange sometimes staring without saying anything for as long as a minute at a time he planned to go to a bible college and maybe become a minister or he might start his own construction company big plans a bit grandiose thought walker two weeks later still medicated he kept his appointment and appeared to be doing fine he skipped the next two and when he showed up on december he demanded to see dr marie snow he had stopped taking his meds because hed met a girl who didnt believe in them dr snow tried to convince him to start taking his pills but he said that god had told him to give up the booze and all drugs he missed appointments on december and january on february annette called norma walker and said his behavior could not be controlled she described him as psychotic and said he had mentioned killing himself with a handgun the next day he came in very nervous but somewhat reasonable he demanded a change in medication three days later walker received a call from mccalls chapel ron was making a sceneyelling and demanding a job she advised them to treat him with caution and call the police if necessary that afternoon annette and her husband brought him in to meet with walker they were distraught and desperate for help walker observed ron to be unmedicated confused disoriented delusional detached from reality and completely unable to take care of his own food and shelter she doubted he could survive on his own even with proper medication the solution was longterm institutionalization for his diminished mental capacities and unmanageable behavior the three left with no plan and no meds ron drifted around ada and eventually disappeared gary simmons was at his home in chickasha one night chatting with two friends when the doorbell rang he answered it and his brotherinlaw rushed in and collapsed on the living room floor i need help ron said over and over im crazy and i need help unshaven filthy his hair thick and matted he was disoriented and not sure where he was i cant take it anymore he said gary s guests did not know ron and were shocked by his appearance and desperation one left and the other hung around ron became quiet then lethargic gary promised ron he would find help in some way and they eventually got him in a car the first stop was the nearest hospital where they were referred to the local mental health center from there they were sent to central state hospital in norman as they were driving ron became almost catatonic he did manage to say that he was starving gary knew a ribs place famous for its large servings but when they stopped in the parking lot ron asked where are we were getting something to eat gary replied ron swore he wasnt hungry so they drove away headed for norman why did we stop back there ron asked because you said you were hungry i did not ron was irritated by gary s actions a few miles closer to norman ron again said he was very hungry gary saw a mcdonalds and stopped what are we doing here ron asked were getting something to eat gary replied why because you said you were hungry im not hungry could we just please hurry on to the hospital they left mcdonalds and finally arrived in norman at which time ron announced he was hungry gary patiently found another mcdonalds and ron not surprisingly asked why they were stopping the last stop before the hospital was for gas at a vickers station on main street gary returned to the car with two large candy bars which ron grabbed and devoured in seconds gary and his friend were startled at how quickly he consumed them at central state ron was drifting in and out of whatever stupor he was in the first doctor became frustrated when he wouldnt cooperate and as soon as he left the room gary chastised his brotherinlaw ron responded by standing and facing a blank wall flexing his arms into a goofy bodybuilder pose and becoming rigid for several long minutes gary tried to speak to him but he was gone ten minutes passed and ron didnt flinch he stared at the ceiling without making a sound or moving a muscle twenty minutes passed and gary was ready to bolt after thirty very long minutes ron snapped out of it but still would not speak to gary fortunately the staff soon arrived and took ron to his room he told a doctor i just wanted to come here because i needed a place to go to at this time he was given lithium for depression and navane an antipsychotic drug used to treat schizophrenia once he was stabilized he checked himself out against the advice of his doctors and within a few days was back in ada gary s next road trip with his brotherinlaw was to dallas to a christian mission program for excons and addicts gary s pastor had met ron and wanted to help quietly the pastor confided to gary rons lights are on but no ones home they checked into the facility in dallas when ron was situated gary said goodbye in doing so he slipped ron in cash a violation of the rules though neither knew it gary returned to oklahoma and so did ron within hours of checking in he had used the cash to purchase a bus ticket back to ada and arrived not long after gary his next admission to central state was not voluntary on march nine days after being discharged ron attempted suicide by swallowing twenty navane pills his reason given to a nurse was that he was depressed because he could not find a job he was stabilized and placed on proper medication which he stopped taking after the third day his doctors concluded that he was a danger to himself and others and recommended a twentyeightday treatment at central state on march he was discharged back in ada ron found a room behind a small house on twelfth street on the west side of town he had no kitchen and no plumbing to shower when he bathed he used a water hose behind the house annette took him food and tried to care for him during one visit she noticed his wrists were bleeding hed cut them with a razor he said so that he could suffer like all the others whod suffered so much because of him he wanted to die and be with his parents the two people hed hurt so much she begged him to go see a doctor but he refused he also refused to get help at the mental services office where hed been so many times he was completely off his medications the old man who owned the house was kind to ron rent was cheap often free in the garage there was an ancient lawn mower with one wheel missing ron pushed it up and down the streets of ada mowing lawns for and giving the money to his landlord on april the ada police received a call from a residence on the west block of tenth street the home owner informed the patrolman that he had to leave town and he feared for the safety of his family because ron williamson had been roaming through the neighborhood at all hours of the night evidently the home owner knew ron and was watching carefully he told the cop that ron had made four trips to the circle k convenience store and two or three to loves convenience store all in one night the policeman was sympatheticeveryone knew ron was acting weirdbut there was no law against walking the streets after midnight he promised to patrol the area on april at three in the morning the police received a call from a clerk at the circle k ron williamson had been in several times acting really strange while officer jeff smith was making his report the suspect showed up again smith asked ronnie to leave which he did an hour later ron walked to the jail and rang the buzzer and announced that he wanted to confess several crimes that he had committed in his past he was given a form for a voluntary statement and began writing he admitted to stealing a purse four years earlier at the coachlight stealing a gun from a home touching two girls on their private parts and hitting and almost raping a girl up at asher but he abandoned his confession and left the jail officer rick carson followed and caught up with him a few blocks away ron tried to explain what he was doing at that hour but was very confused he finally said he was out looking for mowing jobs carson suggested that ron go home and that perhaps the mowing jobs might be easier to find during daylight hours on april ron went to the mental health clinic and frightened the workers one of them described him as drooling he demanded to see dr snow and started down a hallway to her office when told she wasnt in he left without incident three days later the dreams of ada was published as much as the police wanted to pin the carter murder on ron williamson they simply lacked sufficient proof by the late spring of they had little more evidence than theyd had in the summer of the hair analysis from the osbi had finally been completed two years after the murder some of the samples taken from ron and dennis were microscopically consistent with some of the hairs found at the murder scene but hair comparisons were wildly unreliable the prosecution had one significant obstaclethe bloody palm print on the small section of sheetrock cut from the wall in debbie carters bedroom early in jerry peters of the osbi had examined the print carefully and concluded that it was not from dennis fritz or ron williamson nor did it match debbie carter it was a print left by the killer but what if jerry peters had been wrong or perhaps in a hurry or maybe he had just overlooked something if the print actually belonged to debbie carter then fritz and williamson could not be excluded as suspects peterson seized upon the idea of exhuming her body and examining the palm prints again with luck her hands were not too badly decomposed and a new set of prints just might if examined perhaps from a different angle reveal information that could greatly assist the prosecution and finally bring the murderers to justice peggy stillwell received a call from dennis smith he asked her to come to the police station but refused to give a reason she thought as always that perhaps there had been a break in the case when she arrived bill peterson was sitting behind the desk with a sheet of paper in front of him he explained that they wanted to exhume debbies body and he needed her signature to approve it charlie carter had already stopped by and signed off peggy was horrified the idea of disturbing her daughter was shocking she said no but peterson was prepared for it he pressed on asking peggy if she wanted the murder solved of course but wasnt there some other way no if she wanted to find debbies killer and bring him to justice she had to agree to the exhumation after a few minutes peggy scribbled her signature hurried away from the police department and drove to the home of her sister glenna lucas she told glenna about the meeting with bill peterson and the plans to dig up the body she was actually excited by now anxious to see her daughter again ill get to touch her and hold her again she kept saying glenna did not share her enthusiasm and wasnt convinced such a reunion was healthy and she had doubts about the people running the investigation in the four and a half years since the murder she had been forced to chat with bill peterson several times about the case peggy was not stable she had never accepted the fact that debbie was dead glenna had repeatedly asked peterson and the police to filter any news from the investigation through herself or another family member peggy could not handle sudden developments and needed her familys protection glenna immediately called bill peterson and demanded to know what he was planning he explained that the exhumation was necessary if the family wanted ron williamson and dennis fritz brought to trial for the murder the bloody palm print stood in the way and if it actually belonged to debbie then he and the police could move with urgency against fritz and williamson glenna was confused how did peterson know the outcome of the reprinting if the body had yet to be exhumed how could he be so sure that the exhumation would incriminate fritz and williamson peggy was obsessed with seeing her daughter again at one point she said to glenna ive forgotten what her voice sounded like glenna was promised by bill peterson that the exhumation would be done quickly and be completed before anyone knew it peggy was at her station at brockway glass when a coworker walked by and asked her what was happening over at rosedale cemetery near debbies grave site she left the factory raced across town but found only an empty grave her daughter had been removed the first set of palm prints had been taken by osbi agent jerry peters on december during the autopsy at that time the hands had been perfect and peters had no doubt that he had taken a full and thorough set of prints when he issued his report three months later hed been certain in his findings that the bloody print from the sheetrock was not left by fritz williamson or the victim now though four and a half years later with the murder unsolved and the authorities looking for a break he suddenly had doubts about his earlier work three days after the exhumation he issued a revised report in which he concluded that the bloody print matched debbie carters palm for the first and only time in his twentyfouryear career jerry peters changed his mind the report was exactly what bill peterson needed armed with the proof that the bloody print did not belong to some unknown killer but had been left by debbie as she struggled for her life he was free to go after his prime suspects and it was important to alert the townsfolk the potential jurors while the authorities claimed that the exhumation and its details were confidential peterson chatted with the ada evening news anyway what we found confirmed our suspicions we were checking some evidence he was quoted as saying what exactly was found peterson wouldnt confirm the details but a source was willing to tell all the source said the body was exhumed so the womans palm prints could be made and compared with a bloody palm print found on her apartment wall the source went on elimination of the possibility that the bloody palm print was someone other than the victim was crucial to the investigation i do feel better about the case peterson said he obtained warrants for the arrests of ron williamson and dennis fritz on friday morning may kick carson saw ron pushing the lawn mower with three wheels along a street on the west side of town the two talked for a moment ron with long hair no shirt ragged jeans and sneakers looked as rough as always he wanted to get a job with the city and rick promised to stop by and pick up an application ron said he would wait at home that night carson then informed his lieutenant that he knew their suspect would in fact be hanging around his apartment on west twelfth later in the evening the arrest was planned and rick asked to be involved if ron turned violent rick wanted to make sure no one got hurt instead four other policemen were sent including detective mike baskin ron was taken into custody without incident he was wearing the same jeans and sneakers and was still shirtless at the jail mike baskin read him his miranda rights and asked if he would like to talk sure why not detective james fox joined the interview ron repeatedly said he had never met debbie carter had never been in her apartment and to the best of his knowledge had never seen her he never wavered in spite of some yelling and bullying from the cops who said over and over that they knew ron was guilty ron was placed in the county jail at least a month had passed since he had taken any medications dennis fritz was living with his mother and an aunt in kansas city keeping busy by painting houses hed left ada a few months earlier his friendship with ron williamson was a distant memory he hadnt talked to a detective in four years and had almost forgotten about the carter murder late on the evening of may he was watching television by himself he had worked all day and was still wearing his dirty painters whites the night was warm the windows were open the phone rang and an unidentified female voice asked is dennis fritz there im dennis fritz he answered and she hung up perhaps it was a wrong number or perhaps his exwife was up to something he settled back in front of the television his mother and aunt were already asleep in the rear of the house it was almost fifteen minutes later he heard a series of car doors slam nearby he got up barefoot and was walking to the front door when he saw a small army of combatready troops dressed in black and heavily armed moving across the lawn what the hell he thought for a split second he considered calling the police the doorbell rang and when he opened the door two plainclothes cops grabbed him pulled him outside and demanded to know are you dennis fritz yes i am then youre under arrest for firstdegree murder one growled while the other slapped on the handcuffs what murder are you talking about dennis asked then had a quick thought how many dennis fritzes are there in kansas city surely theyve got the wrong one his aunt appeared at the door saw the swat team advancing on dennis submachine guns aimed and ready and became hysterical his mother ran from her bedroom as the police entered the house to secure it though when questioned they were unclear as to whom and what they wished to secure dennis did not own a firearm there were no other known or suspected murderers on the premises but the swat boys had their procedures just as dennis was convinced he was about to be gunned down at the front door he glanced up and saw a white stetson hat moving his way two nightmares from his past were approaching on the driveway dennis smith and gary rogers happily joined the fracas with shiteating grins from ear to ear oh that murder dennis thought in their finest hour the two smalltown cowboys had conned the kansas city fugitive apprehension unit into conducting the dramatic but senseless raid can i get my shoes dennis asked and the cops reluctantly agreed fritz was placed in the backseat of a police car where he was joined by an ecstatic dennis smith one of the kc detectives did the driving as they left fritz looked at the heavily armed swat boys and thought how stupid any parttime deputy couldve made the arrest at the local grocery store as stunned as he was by the arrest he had to chuckle as he noticed how dejected the kc police looked his last image was of his mother standing in the front door with her hands over her mouth they took him to a small interrogation room at a police station in kansas city smith and rogers went through the miranda warnings then announced that they intended to get a confession dennis kept thinking of ward and fontenot and was determined to give them nothing smith became the nice guy his pal who really wanted to help rogers was instantly abusivecursing threatening poking dennis in the chest repeatedly four years had passed since their last session in june after fritz had severely flunked the second polygraph smith rogers and featherstone had kept him in the basement of the ada police department for three hours and badgered him they got nothing then and they were getting nothing now rogers was furious the cops had known for years that fritz and williamson raped and murdered debbie carter and now the crime had been solved all they needed was a confession i have nothing to confess fritz said over and over what evidence do you have show me the evidence one of rogers s favorite lines was youre insulting my intelligence and each time fritz was tempted to say what intelligence but he did not want to get slapped after two hours of abuse fritz finally said all right ill confess the cops were relieved since they had no proof they were about to crack the case with a confession smith hustled out to find a tape recorder rogers quickly arranged his notepad and pens lets have it when they were all set fritz looked directly at the tape recorder and said heres the truth i did not kill debbie carter and know nothing about her murder smith and rogers went ballisticmore threats more verbal abuse fritz was rattled and frightened but he held firm he maintained his innocence and they finally called off the interrogation he refused extradition to oklahoma and waited in jail for the process to run its course later that day saturday ron was led from the jail to the police station for another interview smith and rogers back from their thrilling arrest of fritz were waiting their goal was to make him talk the interrogation had been planned since the day before the arrest the dreams ofada had just been published and there was criticism of the methods of smith and rogers they decided that smith who lived in ada should be replaced by rusty featherstone who lived in oklahoma city they also decided not to use video dennis smith was in the building but stayed away from the interview room after leading the investigation for over four years and believing for much of that time that williamson was guilty he nonetheless avoided the crucial interrogation the ada police department was well stocked with audio and video equipment and it was frequently used interrogations and especially confessions were almost always recorded on tape the police were quite aware of the powerful impact of showing a confession to a jury ask ward and fontenot rons second polygraph four years earlier had been taped by featherstone at the ada police department when confessions were not recorded on video they were often taken by audio the police had plenty of tape recorders and when neither audio nor video was used the suspect was usually asked to write if he could in fact read and write his own version of what happened if the suspect happened to be illiterate then a detective would write the statement read it back to the defendant and ask him to sign it none of these methods were used on may williamson who was quite literate and had a much wider vocabulary than either of his two interrogators watched as featherstone took notes he said he understood his miranda rights and agreed to talk the police version reads as follows williamson said okay december the th i was hanging out at the coachlight frequently and i was there one night looking at a girl a pretty girl and thought i should follow her home williamson paused then acted as if he wished to say something that started with the letter f but then paused again then he continued thought what if something bad would happen that night and followed her home williamson then paused and talked about when he stole a stereo williamson then said i was with dennis and we went to the holiday inn and told a girl that we had a bar in our car and got her and she jumped williamson talked in sporadic phrases and agent rogers asked williamson to concentrate and get back to talking about the debbie carter case williamson said okay i had a dream about killing debbie was on her had a cord around her neck stabbed her frequently pulled the rope tight around her neck williamson said i am worried about what this will do to my family and then he said my mother is dead now agent rogers asked williamson if he and dennis were there that night and williamson answered yes agent featherstone asked williamson did you go there with the intention to kill her williamson responded probably agent featherstone asked why williamson responded she made me mad agent featherstone asked how do you mean mean to you a bitch williamson responded no williamson paused briefly then said oh my god you cant expect me to confess ive got my family ive got my nephew to protect my sister it will tear her up it cant hurt my mother now since she is dead its been on my mind since it happened at about hours williamson said if youre going to try me on this i want tanner in tulsa no i want david morris the mention of a lawyer spooked the detectives and they stopped the confession they called david morris who instructed them to stop interrogating ron immediately the statement was not signed by ron it was never shown to him armed with another dream confession the case was coming together nicely for the cops and prosecutors they had learned with ward and fontenot that a lack of physical evidence should not get in the way of an urgent prosecution the fact that debbie carter was not stabbed was of little consequence juries will convict if they can be adequately shocked if one dream confession could nail williamson then another could put him away a few days later a jailer named john christian stopped by rons cell he and ron had grown up in the same neighborhood the christian household was full of boys one the same age as ron and he was often included in lunch and dinner they played baseball together in the streets and the leagues and attended byng junior high untreated and unmedicated ron was far from a model inmate the pontotoc county jail is a windowless concrete bunker for some reason built on the west side of the courthouse lawn the ceilings are low the atmosphere cramped and claustrophobic and when someone screams everyone hears it ron screamed often when he wasnt yelling he was singing crying wailing complaining or either protesting his innocence or ranting on about debbie carter he was placed in one of the two solitary cells as far away from the crowded bullpen as possible but the jail was so small that ron could disrupt it from anywhere only john christian could settle him down and the other inmates came to appreciate the changing of the guard when christian arrived he immediately went to rons cell and calmed him they would talk about the old days growing up playing ball friends they had known back then they talked about the carter case and how unfair it was for ron to be charged for eight hours ron was quiet his solitary cell was a rat hole but he managed to sleep and read before christian punched out he checked on ron who was usually pacing smoking getting himself psyched up to begin the racket as soon as the new guard arrived late in the evening of may ron was awake and knew christian was at the front desk ron called him back and wanted to talk about the murder he had a copy of the dreams ofada and said he might have a dream confession of his own according to christian ron said now just imagine this i dreamed this is what took place just imagine that i was living in tulsa and id been drinking and taking quaaludes all day and i drove to buzzys club coachlight club and just imagine that i drank some more and got a bit drunker just suppose that i ended up at debbie carters door and knocked on the door and she said just a minute im on the phone just imagine i busted the door in and i raped and killed her williamson then said dont you think if i was the person that killed her that i would have gotten some money from my friends and left town christian thought little of the conversation but did repeat it to a fellow officer it was repeated again and again and finally made it to gary rogers the detective saw an opportunity for additional evidence against their killer two months later he asked christian to repeat what ron had told him rogers typed up a report added quotation marks where he thought appropriate and the police and prosecutor then had their second dream confession not a single word was included to reflect rons many denials of involvement in the crime as usual the facts were not important ron was not living in tulsa at the time of the murder he possessed neither a vehicle nor a drivers license chapter for annette hudson and renee simmons the news that their brother had been arrested and charged with murder was overwhelming since his release from prison the previous october they had been deeply concerned about his deteriorating mental health and his physical wellbeing but they had no idea murder charges were looming the rumors had been around for years but so much time had passed the family had assumed the police were busy with other suspects and other cases when juanita died two years earlier she was confident she had given dennis smith clear evidence that ron was not involved annette and renee believed this too both were living frugallyraising their families working occasionally paying the bills and saving money when possible they did not have the cash to hire a criminal defense lawyer annette talked to david morris but he had no interest in the case john tanner was in tulsa too far away and too expensive though ron had dragged them through the court system many times they were still unprepared for his sudden arrest and the allegations of murder friends backed away the stares and whispers began an acquaintance said to annette its not your fault you cant help what your brother did my brother is not guilty annette shot back she and renee repeated this continually but few people wanted to hear it forget the presumption of innocence the cops had their man why would they have arrested ron if he wasnt guilty annettes son michael then a fifteenyearold sophomore suffered through a class discussion on current local events the principal one being the arrest of ron williamson and dennis fritz for the murder since his last name was hudson none of his classmates knew that michaels uncle was the accused killer sentiments in the class ran strongly against the two men annette was at the school the following morning and got the matter resolved the teacher apologized profusely and promised to redirect class discussions renee and gary simmons were living in chickasha about ninety miles away and the distance gave them some relief annette though had never left ada and though she now desperately wanted to flee she had to stay and support her little brother the sunday may edition of the ada evening news ran a frontpage story about the arrests with a photo of debbie carter bill peterson provided most of the details he confirmed that the body had been exhumed and that the mysterious print in fact belonged to the victim he claimed that both fritz and williamson had been suspects for more than a year but did not explain why as to the investigation itself he said we came to the end of our rope in this investigation about six months ago and began to decide how to approach these things of special interest was the news that the fbi had been involved in the case two years earlier the ada police requested its assistance the fbi studied the evidence and provided the police with a psychological profile of the killers though peterson did not share this with the newspaper the following day there was another frontpage story this time with mug shots of ron and dennis even by mug shot standards their photos were menacing enough to get convictions the story repeated the details from the day before specifically that both men had been arrested and charged with firstdegree rape rape by instrumentation and firstdegree murder oddly enough officials refused to comment on whether the two men had made statements about the crime evidently the reporters in ada had become so accustomed to confessions that they assumed such statements were generic to all criminal investigations though they withheld news about their first dream confession from ron the authorities did release the affidavit used for the arrest warrants the story quoted the affidavit as saying that both pubic and scalp hair were recovered from miss carters body and bedding that were consistent microscopically with that of ronald keith williamson and dennis fritz and both men had long criminal records rons tally was fifteen misdemeanorsdrunk driving and suchplus one felony for the forgery that sent him to prison fritz had two duis some driving charges plus the old marijuana conviction bill peterson confirmed again that the body had been exhumed to reexamine a palm print which was found to be the victims he added that the two men had been suspects in the case for more than a year the story concluded by reminding everyone that carter died from asphyxiation when a washcloth was stuffed down her throat during the rape that same monday ron was led from the jail across the lawn to the courthouse about fifty steps and made his first appearance before judge john david miller the magistrate who handled preliminary matters he said he did not have a lawyer and wasnt sure if he could afford one he was taken back to jail a few hours later an inmate by the name of mickey wayne harrell allegedly overheard ron crying saying im sorry debbie this was immediately reported to the jailer ron then allegedly asked harrell if he would draw a tattoo on his arm one that said ron loves debbie with a hot new crime on the docket the gossip festered in the jail the snitching games always a part ofjail life because the police were so willing to play along began in earnest the quickest way to freedom or at least to a reduced sentence was to hear or claim to hear a prized suspect confess in whole or in part to his crime and then trade this off in an attractive plea bargain with the prosecutor in most jails snitching was rare because the informants feared retribution from other inmates in ada snitching was widely practiced because it worked so well two days later ron was taken back to court to discuss the matter of his legal representation he appeared before judge john david miller and things did not go well still unmedicated he was loud and belligerent and began by yelling i didnt do this killing im getting damned tired of being on this rap now i feel sorry for the family but judge miller tried to stop him but ron wanted to talk i didnt kill her i dont know who killed her my mother was alive at the time and she knew where i was judge miller attempted to explain to ron that the hearing was not designed to allow defendants to plead their case but ron kept on i want these charges dropped he said over and over this is ridiculous judge miller asked him if he understood the charges against him to which ron replied im innocent never been in her company never been in a car with her as his rights were being read into the record ron continued ranting ive been in jail three times and each time they have tried to say i had something to do with this murder when the name of dennis fritz was read aloud ron interrupted this guy didnt have anything to do with it i knew him at the time he didnt go to the coachlight the judge finally entered a plea of not guilty ron was led away cursing bitterly as he went annette watched and wept quietly she went to the jail every day sometimes twice if the jailers allowed she knew most of them and they all knew ronnie and the rules were often bent slightly to allow more visitation he was disturbed still unmedicated and in need of professional help he was irate and bitter for being arrested for a crime he had nothing to do with he was also humiliated for four and a half years he had lived with the suspicion that he had committed an unspeakable murder the suspicion was bad enough ada was his hometown his people his current and former friends the folks who watched him grow up in church the fans who remembered him as a great athlete the whispers and stares were painful but he had endured them for years he was innocent and the truth if the cops could ever find it would clear his name but to be suddenly arrested and thrown in jail and have his mug shot on the front page was devastating he wasnt sure if he had ever met debbie carter while dennis fritz sat in a jail cell in kansas city and waited for the extradition process to send him back to ada he was struck by the irony of his arrest murder for years he had dealt with the aftermath of his wifes and many times hed almost felt like a victim himself murder he had never physically harmed anyone he was small slightly built averse to fighting and violence sure hed been in plenty of bars and some rough places but hed always managed to slip away when the brawling began if ron williamson didnt start the fight then he would certainly stay and finish it but not dennis he was a suspect only because of his friendship with ron fritz wrote a long letter to the ada evening news to explain why he was fighting extradition he said he refused to return with smith and rogers because he couldnt believe he had been charged with the murder he was innocent had nothing to do with the crime and needed some time to get his thoughts together he was trying to find a good defense lawyer and his family was scrambling for money he summarized his involvement in the investigation because he had nothing to hide and wanted to cooperate he did everything the police asked gave samples of saliva fingerprints handwriting and hair even one from his mustache took two polygraph exams which according to dennis smith he severely flunked fritz said that he found out later that he had not flunked the polygraph tests about the investigation fritz wrote for threeandahalfyears they have had access to my fingerprints handwriting and hair samples to match up with the evidence found at the scene of the crime and any other evidence if any to have me arrested long ago but according to your paper six months ago they were at the end of their rope and had to decide how to handle these things im not that dumb to know it doesnt take no crime lab threeandahalf years to match up my volunteered evidence dennis the former science teacher had studied hair evidence years earlier after he had submitted samples his letter included this paragraph how can i be charged with rape and murder on just flimsy evidence such as hair which can only distinguish ethnic groups of people and not individual characteristics within the same group of people in the same ethnic group any expert witness in their field knows there could be over half a million people that have the same consistencies of hair he concluded with a desperate claim of innocence and asked the question am i guilty until proven innocent or innocent until proven guilty pontotoc county did not have a fulltime public defender those accused of crimes who could not afford a lawyer were required to sign a paupers oath then the judge would appoint a local lawyer as indigent counsel since few people of means get themselves charged with felonies most of the serious crimes involved indigent defendants robberies drugs and assaults were the crimes of the lower classes and since most of the defendants were guilty their courtappointed lawyers could investigate interview pleabargain do the paperwork close the file and pick up a very modest fee in fact the fees were so modest most lawyers preferred to avoid the cases the haphazard indigent defense system was fraught with problems judges often assigned cases to lawyers with little or no criminal law experience there was no money for expert witnesses and other expenses nothing makes a smalltown bar scatter more quickly than a capital murder case the visibility ensures that the lawyer will be watched carefully as he fights to protect the rights of a lowclass defendant accused of some heinous crime the hours required are burdensome and can virtually shut down a small law office the fee is nothing compared to the work and the appeals drag on forever the great fear is that no one will agree to represent the accused and that the judge will simply assign the case most courtrooms are usually teeming with lawyers when court is in session but they become empty tombs when a capital murder defendant is hauled in with his paupers oath the lawyers flee to their offices lock the doors and unplug the phones perhaps the most colorful courthouse regular in ada was barney ward a blind lawyer known for his snappy dressing hard living tall stories and penchant for being involved in most of the legal gossip in ada he seemed to know everything that went on in the courthouse barney lost his eyesight as a teenager when a high school chemistry experiment went awry he treated the tragedy as a temporary setback and finished high school he enrolled at east central in ada where his mother served as his reader after graduation he went to norman and studied law at the university of oklahoma again with his mother at his side he graduated passed the bar exam returned to ada and ran for county attorney he won and for several years served as the countys chief prosecutor in the mids he established a private practice specializing in criminal defense and soon had the reputation as a strong advocate for his clients quick on his feet barney could sniff a weakness in the prosecutions case and would pounce on opposing witnesses he was a brutal crossexaminer and loved a good scrap in one legendary encounter barney actually threw a punch at another lawyer he and david morris were in court arguing evidentiary matters both were frustrated things were tense and morris made the mistake of saying look judge even a blind man can see this barney lunged at him or in his general direction threw a roundhouse right and barely missed order was restored morris apologized but kept his distance everybody knew barney and he was often seen around the courthouse with his faithful assistant linda who read everything for him and took his notes from time to time he used a seeing eye dog to help him around though he preferred a young lady he was friendly with everyone and never forgot a voice the other lawyers elected him president of the bar association and not out of sympathy barney was so well liked that he was asked to join a poker club he produced a set of braille cards claimed that only he could deal and was soon raking in all the chips the other players decided that perhaps it was best if barney played but never dealt his winnings were somewhat reduced each year the other lawyers invited barney to deer camp a weeklong boysonly getaway with lots of bourbon and poker and dirty jokes and thick stews and time permitting some hunting barneys dream was to kill a deer in the woods his friends found a nice buck and quietly maneuvered barney into position handed him the rifle adjusted it carefully aimed it then whispered fire barney pulled the trigger and though he missed badly his friends claimed the deer had narrowly escaped death barney told the story for decades like many hard drinkers he finally had to quit at the time he was using a dog for guidance and the dog had to be replaced when he couldnt break the habit of leading barney to the liquor store evidently he went there often because one lingering bit of lore is that the whiskey store went out of business when barney went off the booze he loved to make money and had little patience with clients who couldnt pay his motto was innocent until proven broke by the mids though barney was a bit past his prime he was known to occasionally miss things in trial because he was asleep he wore thick dark glasses that covered much of his face and the judges and lawyers couldnt tell if he was listening or napping his opponents caught on and the strategy whispered because barney heard everything was to drag a case or a hearing past lunch and into the afternoon when he always took his nap if you could make it to pm your chances of beating barney rose dramatically two years earlier he had been approached by the family of tommy ward no relation but had passed on the case he was convinced ward and fontenot were innocent but he preferred not to handle capital cases the paperwork was overwhelming and not one of his strengths now he was approached again judge john david miller asked barney to represent ron williamson barney was the most experienced criminal defense attorney in the county and his expertise was needed after a brief hesitation he said yes a pure lawyer he knew the constitution inside and out and he believed strongly that every defendant regardless of how unpopular was entitled to a vigorous defense on june barney ward was appointed by the court to represent ron his first death penalty client annette and renee were pleased they knew him and they knew of his reputation as one of the best criminal defense lawyers in town the lawyer and the client got off to a rocky start ron was tired of the jail and the jail was quite tired of him conferences took place in a small visitors room near the front door a place barney found too cozy with his unruly client he made a call and arranged a mental checkup for ron a new supply of thorazine was prescribed and much to the relief of barney and the entire jail the drug worked beautifully in fact it worked so well the guards overused it to keep peace ron was sleeping like an infant again during one conference though he could barely speak barney met with the jailers the dosage was readjusted and ron sprang back to life he was generally uncooperative with his lawyer he offered little but a steady stream of rambling denials he was being railroaded into a conviction just like ward and fontenot barney was frustrated from the day he was appointed but he plowed ahead glen gore was in jail on kidnapping and assault charges his courtappointed counsel was greg saunders a young lawyer who was building a civil practice in ada during a client conference at the jail he and gore almost came to blows saunders walked next door to the courthouse and asked judge miller to remove him from the case judge miller refused so saunders said he would take the next capital murder appointment if he could get rid of gore a deal said judge miller youre now representing dennis fritz in the carter murder though greg saunders was apprehensive about his death penalty case he was also excited about working closely with barney ward as an undergraduate at east central he had dreamed of being a trial lawyer and had often cut classes when he knew barney was in action he had watched barney rip shaky witnesses and intimidate prosecutors barney respected judges but did not fear them and he could chat with a jury he never used his disability as a crutch but at crucial moments he could use it to arouse sympathy to greg saunders barney was a brilliant courtroom lawyer working independently but also quietly working together they filed a truckload of motions and soon had the district attorneys office scrambling on june judge miller called a hearing on issues raised by both the state and the defense barney was demanding a list of the names of all the witnesses the prosecution expected to use in the case oklahoma law required such disclosure but bill peterson was having trouble with the statute barney explained it to him the prosecutor wanted to disclose only those witnesses he planned to use at the preliminary hearing not so said judge miller and peterson was ordered to timely notify the defense of any new witness barney was in a feisty mood and prevailed on most of the motions he was also showing signs of frustration in one aside he commented on being court appointed and not wanting to spend too much time on the case he vowed to do a proper job but was worried about getting consumed with his first capital murder trial the following day he filed a motion requesting additional counsel for ron the state did not object and on june frank baber was appointed by judge miller to help barney the legal wrangling and paperwork battles continued as both sides prepared for the preliminary hearing dennis fritz was placed in a cell not far from ron williamson he couldnt see ron but he could certainly hear him when he wasnt overmedicated ron yelled constantly for hours he would stand at the bars in his cell door and bellow over and over i am innocent i am innocent his deep and husky voice echoed through the cramped building he was a wounded animal in a cage in dire need of help the prisoners were stressed anyway but rons screeching voice added another thick layer of anxiety other inmates would yell back at him and taunt him about killing debbie carter the bickering and cursing back and forth were occasionally amusing but generally nerveracking the jailers moved ron from his isolation cell into a bullpen with a dozen others an arrangement that proved disastrous the men had little privacy and practically lived shoulder to shoulder ron respected no ones space a petition quickly appeared it was signed by the other prisoners and begged the jailers to take ron back to isolation to prevent a riot or a killing the guards agreed then there were long periods of silence and everyone inmates and guards would breathe easier soon the entire jail knew that either john christian was on duty or the guards had given ron another toxic dose of thorazine the thorazine quieted him though at times there were other side effects it often made his legs itch and the thorazine shuffle became part of the jails routine as ron stood at the bars of his cell and ducked and weaved from side to side for hours fritz would talk to him and try to calm him but it was hopeless rons cries of innocence were painful to hear especially for dennis who knew him best it was obvious that ron needed much more than a bottle of pills neuroleptic drugs are synonymous with tranquilizers and antipsychotics and are used primarily on schizophrenics thorazine is a neuroleptic and it has a tortured history in the s it began flooding state mental hospitals its a potent drug that strongly reduces awareness and interest psychiatrists who support the drug claim it actually cures the patient by altering or repairing bad brain chemistry but critics who greatly outnumber supporters cite numerous studies that show the drug to produce a long frightening list of side effects sedation drowsiness lethargy poor concentration nightmares emotional difficulties depression despair lack of spontaneous interest in the surroundings a blunting or dulling of the patients awareness and motor control thorazine is toxic to most brain functions and disrupts nearly all of them its harshest critics have called it nothing more than a chemical lobotomy they claim that the only real purpose of thorazine is to save money for mental institutions and prisons and to make patients and inmates more manageable rons thorazine was doled out by his jailers sometimes with instructions from his lawyer often though there was no supervision he got a pill when he got too loud even though dennis fritz had remained in ada for four years after the murder he was considered an escape risk like rons his bail was exorbitant and out of the question like all defendants they were presumed to be innocent but nonetheless kept in jail so they wouldnt flee or be loose on the streets killing others presumed innocent but they would wait almost a year until they went to trial a few days after dennis arrived at the jail a man by the name of mike tenney suddenly appeared outside his cell fat and balding and not well spoken tenney nonetheless had a big smile and a friendly manner and he treated dennis like an old friend and he desperately wanted to talk about the carter murder dennis had been around ada long enough to know the jail was a cesspool of snitches liars and cutthroats and he knew that any conversation with anyone could very well be repeated in a courtroom in a version slanted sharply against the person on trial every inmate guard cop trustee janitor cook everyone was a potential snitch anxious to pick up details and then retail the information to cops tenney said he was new to the place and claimed to be a jailer but in fact he was not yet on the countys payroll though unsolicited and certainly not based on knowledge or experience tenney had plenty of advice for dennis in his opinion dennis was in deep trouble staring at an execution and the best way to save his skin was to come clean confess cut a deal with peterson over at the das office and give up the dirt on ron williamson peterson would be fair dennis just listened tenney wouldnt go away he returned every day shaking his head gravely at denniss predicament babbling on about the system and how he thought it operated giving sage advice that was absolutely free dennis just listened a preliminary hearing was scheduled for july before judge john david miller like in most jurisdictions preliminaries were crucial in oklahoma because the state was required to play its hand to show the court and everyone else who its witnesses would be and what they would say the challenge for a prosecutor at a preliminary was to show just enough evidence to convince the judge that there were reasonable grounds that the defendant was guilty while not yet revealing everything to the defense it was gamesmanship with a bit of risk normally though a prosecutor had little to worry about local judges find it hard to get reelected if they dismiss criminal charges but with such flimsy evidence against both fritz and williamson bill peterson had to push hard at the preliminary he had so little to offer that he could certainly hold nothing back and the local newspaper would be there anxious to report every word three months after its publication the dreams ofada was still being hotly debated around town the preliminary hearing would be petersons first performance in a major trial since the book came out a nice crowd gathered in the courtroom dennis fritzs mother was there as were annette hudson and renee simmons peggy stillwell charlie carter and their two daughters arrived early the regularsbored lawyers local gossips idle clerks retirees with nothing to dowaited for their first good look at the two murderers the trial was months away but the live testimony was about to be heard before the hearing and just for the sheer fun of it the ada police informed ron that dennis fritz had finally made a full confession that implicated both of them in the rape and murder the shocking news sent ron off the deep end dennis was sitting quietly with greg saunders at the defense table looking over some documents waiting for the hearing to begin ron was sitting nearby still handcuffed and shackled and glaring at fritz as if he wanted to choke him suddenly and without warning ron bolted out of his chair and began screaming at fritz who was just a few feet away a table went flying through the air and landed on barneys assistant linda dennis jumped up quickly and moved near the witness stand as the guards tackled ron dennis you no good lousy son of a bitch he screamed were gonna settle this right now his deep husky voice boomed around the courtroom barney got hit and fell out of his chair the guards grabbed ron tackled him and tried to subdue him he was kicking and thrashing about like a madman and the guards had their hands full dennis greg saunders and the court personnel quickly backed away and gawked in disbelief at the sight of the pileup in the middle of the courtroom it took several minutes to subdue ron who was bigger than any of his guards as they dragged him away ron spewed a vile stream of vulgarities and threats at fritz when the dust settled the tables and chairs were rearranged and everyone took a deep breath barney didnt see the brawl but he knew hed been in the middle of it he rose and said i want the record to show that i am now making an application to withdraw that boy wont cooperate with me at all if he was paying me i wouldnt be here i cant represent him judge i just cant do it i dont know whos going to but i cant and imif i cant get relief hereim going to see if i cant get it from the court of criminal appeals im not going to put up with this im too damned old for it judge i dont want anything to do with him under any circumstances i have no idea about his guiltthat has nothing to do with itbut im not going to put up with this the next thing you know hell be thumping on me and when he does hes in bad trouble and ill probably be in worse trouble to which judge miller quickly replied counsels motion will be overruled it was heartbreaking for annette and renee to watch their brother act like a madman and to see him dragged around in chains he was sick and needed help a long stint in an institution with good doctors who could get him well how could the state of oklahoma put him on trial when he was so obviously sick across the aisle peggy stillwell watched the madman and shuddered at the image of the violence he had inflicted on her daughter after a few minutes of order judge miller ordered williamson brought in again in the holding room the guards had explained to ron that his behavior was inappropriate for a judicial setting and that further outbursts would be dealt with sternly but as they led him in he began cursing dennis fritz as soon as he saw him the judge sent him back to jail cleared the courtroom of all spectators and waited an hour back in the jail the guards ramped up their warnings but ron didnt care bogus confessions were all too common in pontotoc county and he couldnt believe the cops had squeezed one out of dennis fritz ron was an innocent man and determined not to be persecuted like ward and fontenot if he could get his hands around denniss neck he would shake out the truth his third entry was identical to the first two as he stepped into the courtroom he yelled fritz were going to settle this nowyou and me is going to settle it judge miller interrupted him but ron didnt slow down me and you is going to settle it he yelled at dennis i aint never killed nobody hold him there judge miller said to the guards mr williamson any further outbursts of anger this hearing will be conducted without your presence thatll be fine with me ron shot back okay you understand id rather not be here if you dont mind id rather go back to my cell you wish to waive your right to be present in the preliminary hearing yes i do nobodys threatening or forcing you to do this this is your own personal im threatening ron snapped glaring at dennis has anybody threatened youthis is your own personal decision to waive your i said im threatening okay you do not wish to appear at this hearing is that correct thats correct okay you may take him back to the county jail court record will reflect that the defendant ronald k williamson does waive his right to appearance in this courtroom due to his outbursts of anger and total disruption and the court finds that this hearing cannot be conducted with his presence based onto his current statements to this court and outbursts ron went to his cell and the preliminary hearing proceeded in the us supreme court in a case known as bishop v united states ruled that the conviction of a mentally incompetent person was a denial of due process where doubt exists as to a persons mental competency the failure to conduct a proper inquiry is a deprivation of his constitutional rights after ron williamson had spent two months in jail no one involved in his prosecution or defense had questioned his mental competency the evidence was blatantly obvious his medical history was extensive and readily available to the court his rantings in jail though somewhat regulated by the arbitrary dispensing of medications by his lawyer and his jailers were clear warnings his reputation in ada was well known especially to the police and his behavior in court had been seen before two years earlier when the state attempted to revoke rons suspended sentence on the escape charge he so completely disrupted the hearing that he was sent to a mental hospital for evaluation presiding then was john david miller the same judge miller who was now holding the preliminary hearing it was judge miller who had adjudicated him to be mentally incompetent at that time now two years later and with the death penalty at issue judge miller evidently saw no need to inquire into rons state of mind oklahoma had a statute that allowed a judge including one presiding over a preliminary hearing to suspend the proceedings if the competency of a defendant became an issue no motion from the defense was required most trial lawyers would argue strenuously that their client had a history of mental problems and should be evaluated but absent such a plea it remained the judges duty to protect the constitutional rights of the defendant the silence of judge miller should have been shattered by barney ward as defense counsel he could have requested a complete psychological evaluation of his client the next step would have been to seek a competency hearing the same routine procedure david morris had pursued two years earlier a final step would have been an insanity defense with ron out of the courtroom the preliminary hearing proceeded quietly and in order it ran for several days and ron never left his cell whether he was competent enough to assist in his own defense made little difference dr fred jordan testified first and went through the autopsy and the cause of death asphyxiation by either the belt around the neck or the washcloth stuffed in the mouth or probably both the lying began with the second witness glen gore who testified that on the night of december he was at the coachlight with some friends one of whom was debbie carter a girl hed gone to school with and had known most of his life at some point during the night she asked gore to save her or to rescue her because ron williamson was there too and he was pestering her he did not see dennis fritz at the coachlight on december under crossexamination gore said he told the police about this on december but their report of his interview does not mention ron williamson nor was their report submitted to the defense as required by the rules of procedure thus glen gore became the only witness with direct evidence against ron williamson by placing him in contact and in conflict with debbie carter just hours before her murder he technically established the link between the murderer and his victim all other evidence was circumstantial only a prosecutor as determined as bill peterson would be brazen enough to allow a criminal like glen gore anywhere near his case gore had been brought to the preliminary hearing in cuffs and chains he was serving a fortyyear prison sentence for breaking and entering kidnapping and attempting to kill a police officer five months earlier gore had broken into the home of his former wife gwen and taken her hostage along with his young daughter he was drunk and for five hours held them at gunpoint when a policeman rick carson glanced through a window gore aimed fired and hit carson in the face fortunately the injuries were not serious before sobering up and surrendering gore also shot at another police officer it was not his first violent altercation with gwen in during the unraveling of their rocky marriage gore was charged with breaking into gwens house and stabbing her repeatedly with a butcher knife she survived and pressed charges and gore faced two counts of firstdegree burglary and one count of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon two months earlier hed been charged for assaulting gwen by choking her in hed been charged for forcibly entering the home of another woman gore also had an assaultandbattery charge from his army days and a long list of convictions for petty crimes one week after his name was listed as an additional witness against ron williamson a pleabargain agreement was filed at the same time one charge of kidnapping and one of assault with a dangerous weapon were dismissed when gore was sentenced his exwifes parents filed a letter with the court in which they begged for a long prison sentence it read in part we want you to be aware of how dangerous we feel this man is he intends to kill our daughter granddaughter and ourselves this he has told us we have gone to great lengths to make our daughters home burglar proof but all failed to go into detail all the times he has attacked her would make too lengthy a letter please give our daughter enough time to get the child raised before he is out of prison and the terror starts so the little one never has to live through that again for years barney ward had suspected that glen gore was involved in the carter murder he was a career criminal with a history of violence against women and he was the last person seen with the victim it was incomprehensible that the police showed so little interest in gore gores fingerprints were never submitted to the osbi for analysis prints from a total of fortyfour people were submitted but not gores at one point he agreed to take a polygraph exam but one was never administered the ada police lost the first set of hair samples gore gave them some two years after the murder he then submitted another set and perhaps another no one could remember exactly barney with his uncanny ability to hear and remember the courthouse gossip firmly believed that gore should have been investigated by the police and he knew that his boy ronnie williamson was not guilty the gore mystery was partially explained fourteen years after the preliminary hearing glen gore still in prison signed an affidavit in which he stated that during the early s he was selling drugs in ada he mentioned methamphetamine some of his transactions involved ada policemen specifically one dennis corvin whom gore described as a primary supplier and who frequented harolds club where gore worked when gore owed them money they would arrest him under false pretenses but for the most part the cops left him alone under oath he said in his affidavit however most of the time during the early s i was aware that i was receiving favorable treatment from ada law enforcement because i was involved in drug transactions with them and this favorable treatment ended when i was no longer involved in the drug business with ada police he blamed his fortyyear prison sentence on the fact that he was no longer selling drugs to the ada police regarding williamson gore said in he did not know if ron was at the coachlight the night of the murder the police showed him a lineup of photos pointed to ron and explained that he was the man they were interested in then they directly suggested that i identify mr williamson and to this day i do not know if ron williamson was at the bar on the night that debbie carter disappeared i made the identification because i knew the police expected me to do that gores affidavit was prepared by an attorney and it was reviewed by his own lawyer before he signed it the states next witness was tommy glover a regular at the coachlight and one of the last to see debbie carter his initial recollection was that she was talking with glen gore in the parking lot and that she pushed him away before driving off but four years and seven months later he remembered things a bit differently glover testified at the preliminary hearing that he saw gore speak to debbie and that she got in her car and drove away nothing more or less charlie carter testified next and told the story of finding his daughter on the morning of december osbi agent jerry peters a crime scene specialist was called to the stand it wasnt long before he was in trouble barney smelled a rat and grilled peters on his conflicting opinions about the palm print on the sheetrock a firm opinion in march then surprise an aboutface in may what prompted peters to rethink his original opinion that the palm print did not belong to debbie carter ron williamson or dennis fritz could it have been that this opinion didnt really help the prosecution peters did admit that nothing happened for four years then a phone call early in from bill peterson prompted him to ponder his earlier judgment after the exhumation and reprinting he suddenly changed his mind and issued a report that was exactly what the prosecution wanted greg saunders joined the assault on behalf of dennis fritz and it was obvious the evidence had been reconstructed but it was only a preliminary hearing not a trial that required proof beyond a reasonable doubt peters also testified that of the twentyone fingerprints found in the apartment and on the car nineteen belonged to debbie carter herself one to mike carpenter one to dennis smith and none to either fritz or williamson the prosecutions star was the amazing terri holland from october to january holland had been locked up in the pontotoc county jail for writing bad checks as far as unsolved murders went in oklahoma it was a productive and remarkable four month stay first she claimed she heard karl fontenot admit everything about the denice haraway kidnapping and murder she testified in the first wardfontenot trial in september and gave the jury all the lurid details that detectives smith and rogers had furnished tommy ward during his dream confession after she testified she was given a light sentence on the check charges in spite of having two prior felonies ward and fontenot went to death row terri holland fled the county she left behind some unpaid court fines and such nothing the authorities would take seriously under normal circumstances but they found her and brought her back anyway facing more charges she suddenly had some astounding news for the investigators when she was in jail hearing fontenots story she also heard ron williamson make a full confession what an amazing stroke of luck for the cops not only had they generated a dream confessiontheir favorite investigatory toolbut now they had another snitch their secondfavorite weapon holland was vague on exactly why she had not told anyone about rons confession until sometime in the spring of over two years had passed without a word she was never asked why she rushed to tell smith and rogers about fontenots admissions on the stand during the preliminary she had a grand time with her fiction with ron absent from the proceedings she was free to create all sorts of tales she told of one episode in which he yelled into the phone at his mother and said ill kill you just like i killed debbie carter the only telephone in the jail was on a wall in the front office on the rare occasions when inmates were allowed to make calls they were forced to lean over a counter stretch to get the receiver and talk in the presence of whoever happened to be working the front desk eavesdropping by another inmate was unlikely if not impossible terri holland testified that ron once made a phone call to a church asked someone there for cigarettes and threatened to burn down the place if they didnt bring him some again no one could verify this statement and she was not quizzed on the layout of the jail and how exactly did a female prisoner get so close to the men peterson led her along did he ever say anything that you overheard him say about what he had done to debbie carter yeah he was talking in the bullpens she answered it was right after they brought in tommy ward and karl fontenot what did he say in the bullpens in relationship to what he said he had done to debbie carter he just said thati dont know how to say it he said she thought she was better than he was and that he showed the bitch she wasnt anything else he said he made her make love to him only thats not how he said it i dont even remember how he said it he said that he shoved a cokecatsup bottle up her ass and her panties down her throat and he taught her a lesson bill peterson plowed ahead with his leading questions did he say anything in relationship about debbie should have come off of it or anything like that peterson asked yeah hed tried to go with her and she didnt want nothing to do with him and he said shed been better off if she would just come off of it and give it to him and that he would not have had to do what peterson asked desperate to prompt his shaky witness wouldnt have had to kill her it was remarkable that bill peterson as an officer of the court and charged with the duty to seek the truth could elicit such garbage a crucial part of snitching is getting paid terri holland was allowed to pleabargain herself out of trouble and out ofjail she agreed to a monthly payment plan for restitution but soon abandoned her obligations at the time few people knew that terri holland had a history with ron williamson years earlier when he was peddling rawleigh products around ada he stumbled upon a little unexpected sex he knocked on a door and a female voice asked him to step inside when he did a woman named marlene keutel presented herself completely in the nude there appeared to be no one else at home and one thing quickly led to another marlene keutel was mentally unstable and a week after the episode she committed suicide ron returned several times to sell her more products but never found her at home he did not know she was dead her sister was terri holland shortly after the sexual encounter marlene told terri about it and claimed ron had raped her no charges were brought none were contemplated though terri knew her sister was crazy she still believed that ron was responsible for marlenes death ron had long since forgotten about the quickie and had no idea who terri holland was the first day of the preliminary hearing dragged on with the laborious testimony of dennis smith who described in detail the crime scene and the investigation the only surprise came when smith discussed the various writings left behind by the killersthe message on the wall scrawled in red fingernail polish the dont look fore us or ealse in catsup on the kitchen table and the scarcely readable words on debbies stomach and back detectives smith and rogers thought such handwriting might be traceable so four years earlier they asked dennis fritz and ron williamson to write something on a white index card the detectives had virtually no experience with handwriting analysis but not surprisingly they felt strongly that they had a match the samples given by fritz and williamson words written in pen on an index card looked suspiciously similar to the red fingernail polish message left on a wall and the smeared catsup in the kitchen they took their suspicions to some unidentified agent at the osbi and according to smith this agent agreed and gave them a verbal confirmation under crossexamination from greg saunders smith testified well the handwriting according to the person we talked to was similar to the handwriting we found on the wall of the apartment what about the table both of them were similar a few minutes later barney grilled smith on the handwriting analysis he asked smith if he had a report from the osbi on rons handwriting we did not submit it smith admitted barney was incredulous why wasnt it submitted to the osbi they have the experts maybe they could have eliminated ron and dennis as suspects smith was on the defensive there were similarities in the handwriting but you know it was based on our observations and nothing really scientific i mean we were you know we saw the similarities in it but you know to compare two different types of writing like this is nearly an impossibility you have writing with a brush you have writing with a pencil and thats two different types of writing barney replied well now youre not trying to tell this court that theres a possibility that these two boys dennis fritz and ronnie williamson took turns with that fingernail brush or fingernail polish brush and wrote a statement about jim smith and the other you know one of them wrote one letter and just alternated or anything of that nature which would give you the same conclusions are you no but i think it was our opinion that both of them had a hand at the writing not necessarily on the same writing but you know there was several different writings in the apartment though the handwriting testimony was offered at the preliminary to help prod the case along it would prove too flimsy even for bill peterson to use at trial at the end of the first day judge miller was concerned about rons absence at a bench conference he expressed his worries to the lawyers ive done some reading about the absence of the defendant im going to have mr williamson brought back over about a quarter till nine and inquire one more time whether or not he still wishes not to be present if he does then hes going back again to which dr barney added helpfully do you want me to load him down with about a hundred milligrams of im not telling you what to do judge miller interrupted at the following morning ron was escorted into the courtroom judge miller addressed him by saying mr williamson yesterday you had expressed your desire not to be present during the preliminary hearing i dont want to even be up here ron said i didnt have anything to do with this killing i neveri dont know who killed her i dont know anything about it okay your conduct and your disruptive behavioryou can reclaim your right to be present if you so desire but youll have to promise and be willing not to be disruptive and disorderly and youll have to do that in order to reclaim that right do you wish to be present no i dont want to be here and you understand that you have the right to be here and listen to all the witnesses testimony i dont want to be here whatever you all do i cant help it im tired of being crazy about this its suffered me so much i just dont want to be here okay and thats your decision you do not wish to be present thats correct and youre waiving your right to confront witnesses by doing that under the constitution yes i am you all can charge me on something i didnt do you all can do anything you want to do ron then looked at gary rogers and said you scare me gary you can charge me after four and a half years of harassing me sir you all can go at it because you all is the ones in control not me ron was taken back to jail and the hearing resumed with the testimony of dennis smith gary rogers followed with a tedious narrative of the investigation then osbi agents melvin hett and mary long testified about the forensics involved in the case fingerprints hair analysis and the components in blood and saliva after the state rested its case barney called ten witnessesall jailers or former trustees not a one recalled hearing anything vaguely similar to what terri holland claimed she heard when the testimony was over barney and greg saunders asked the court to dismiss the rape charges because they had not been brought within three years of the crime as required by oklahoma law murder has no statute of limitations but all other crimes do judge miller said he would rule on the motion at a later date almost lost in the shuffle was dennis fritz the focus of petersons prosecution was obviously ron williamson and his star witnessesgore terri holland gary rogers with the dream confessionall testified against ron the only proof that remotely tied fritz to the murder was the hair analysis testimony of melvin hett greg saunders argued long and hard that the state had not met its burden of proving probable cause that dennis fritz was connected to the killing judge miller took the matter under advisement barney joined in the fray with a noisy motion to dismiss all charges because of such light evidence and greg followed suit when judge miller didnt issue a ruling immediately when it became apparent he was actually considering the merits of the defense motions the police and prosecutors realized they needed more evidence scientific experts carry great weight with juries especially in small towns and when the experts are employees of the state and called by the prosecution to testify against criminal defendants their opinions are deemed infallible barney and greg saunders knew the hair and fingerprint testimony from the osbi crowd was suspect but they needed some help to dispute it they would be allowed to crossexamine the states experts and attempt to discredit them but they also knew that lawyers rarely win such arguments experts are hard to pin down and jurors are quickly confused what the defense needed was an expert or two at its table they filed a motion requesting such assistance such motions were commonly made but rarely granted experts cost money and many local officials including judges cringed at the idea of forcing the taxpayers to cover the bill for an indigent defense that ran too high the motion was argued left unsaid was the fact that barney was blind if anyone needed help in analyzing hair fibers and fingerprints it was barney ward chapter the paperwork flew back and forth the das office amended the charges and dropped the rapes the defense lawyers attacked the new indictment another hearing was needed the district court judge was ronald jones from pontotoc county which along with seminole and hughes comprised the twentysecond judicial district judge jones was elected in and not surprisingly was known to be proprosecution and tough on defendants he believed strongly in the death penalty he was a devout christian a baptist deacon whose nicknames included ron the baptist and bythebook jones he did though have a weakness for jailhouse conversions and some defense lawyers quietly advised their clients that a sudden interest in finding the lord might prove beneficial when facing judge jones on august ron unrepentant was brought before him for an arraignment the first time the two met in court judge jones spoke to ron and asked him how he was doing he got an earful i have one thing to say sir ron began loudly thisi feel strongly for the carter family as much as their kinfolks judge jones asked for silence ron continued sir i know that you dont wanti i didnt do this sir the guards squeezed him and he shut up the arraignment was postponed so judge jones could review the transcript from the preliminary hearing two weeks later ron was back with more motions by his lawyers the jailers had fine tuned the thorazine when ron was in his cell and they wanted peace they pumped him full and everybody was happy but when he was scheduled to be in court they reduced the dosage so he would appear louder more intense more belligerent norma walker at mental health services suspected the jailers were juicing ron and made a note in her file the second appearance before judge jones did not go well ron was outspoken he professed his innocence claimed people were telling lies about him and at one point said mother knew i was at home that night he was eventually returned to the jail and the hearing continued barney ward and greg saunders had requested separate trials and they pressed hard on this issue saunders especially wanted his own jury without the baggage of a codefendant like ron williamson judge jones agreed and ordered separate trials he also broached the issue of rons mental competency telling barney in court that the matter needed to be dealt with before the trial ron was finally arraigned entered a formal plea of not guilty and went back to jail the fritz case was now on a different track judge jones had ordered a new preliminary hearing because the state had presented so little evidence against dennis at the first one the authorities didnt have enough witnesses normally a prosecution with no hard evidence would worry the police but not in ada no one panicked the pontotoc county jail was full of potential snitches the first one they found for dennis fritz was a career petty criminal named cindy mclntosh dennis had been strategically moved to a cell closer to ron so the two could talk their feud was over dennis had convinced him that he had not confessed cindy mclntosh claimed she got close enough to hear the two talk then notified the police that she had the goods according to mclntosh fritz and williamson discussed some photographs submitted during the first preliminary hearing ron wasnt there of course and he was curious about what dennis had seen the photos were of the crime scene and ron asked dennis was she debbie carter on the bed or on the floor the floor dennis replied this to the police was clear proof that both men were in the apartment and committed the rape and murder bill peterson was quickly convinced on september he filed a motion to add cindy mclntosh as a witness for the state the next snitch was james riggins though his career as such was shortlived hauled back from prison to face charges in pontotoc county riggins was being returned to his cell one night when he passed another cell inside he heard someone perhaps ron admitting that he killed debbie carter that he had two rape charges up in tulsa and that he would beat the murder rap just like hed walked on the rapes riggins wasnt clear who ron was doing all this confessing to but in the snitching world such details were not important about a month later riggins changed his mind in an interview with the police he said he was incorrect about ron williamson that in fact the man he heard doing the confessing was glen gore confessions were contagious in ada on september a young drug addict named ricky joe simmons walked into the police department and announced hed killed debbie carter and wanted to talk about it dennis smith and gary rogers had no trouble locating a video recorder and simmons began his story he admitted that he had abused drugs for years his favorite being a home brew called crank which included among many ingredients battery acid he said he had finally kicked drugs had found god and had been reading his bible one december night in he thought it was but wasnt sureand for some strange reason began wandering around ada on foot he ran into a girl presumably debbie carter but he wasnt sure and gave several conflicting versions of how he and the girl got together he might have raped her then maybe he didnt and he thought he choked her to death with his hands after which he prayed and vomited all over the apartment strange voices were telling him what to do the details were a blur and at one point simmons said it seemed like a dream oddly at this point smith and rogers did not get excited over the prospect of yet another dream confession when pressed on why he had waited almost five years to come forward he was finally able to explain that all the recent gossip around town had led him to remember that fateful night back in or maybe it was but he couldnt recall how he entered debbies apartment or how many rooms it had or in which room he killed her then suddenly he remembered the catsup bottle and scrawling words on the wall later he said a friend at work had been talking about the details simmons claimed to be clean and sober during the confession but it was obvious to smith and rogers that the crank had taken its toll they dismissed his story immediately though it had as many inaccuracies as tommy wards the detectives were not impressed smith finally heard enough and announced in my opinion you didnt kill debbie carter then he offered to get counseling for simmons simmons confused even further insisted that he had killed her the two detectives insisted he had not they thanked him for his time and sent him away good news was rare at the pontotoc county jail but early in november ron received an unexpected letter an administrative law judge awarded him disability benefits under the social security act a year earlier annette applied for the benefits on rons behalf claiming that he had been unable to work since the judge howard obryan reviewed the extensive medical history and ordered a full hearing on october ron was driven over from the jail in his decision judge obryan noted clearly the claimant has adequate medical documention to show a history of alcoholism depression that was stabilized with lithium and has been classified as having an atypical bipolar disorder complicated by an atypical personality disorder probably borderline paranoid and antisocial clearly without medications he is belligerent abusive physically violent has religious delusions and a thought disorder and there are repeated episodes of disorientation to time impaired attention span as well as impaired abstract thinking and level consciousness judge obryan had little trouble reaching his conclusion that ron had severe bipolar disorder personality disorder and substance abuse disorder further his condition was serious enough to prevent him from obtaining meaningful employment rons period of disability began on march and was continuing the administrative law judges primary job was to determine if claimants were disabled either physically or mentally and thus entitled to monthly benefits these were important cases but not life and death judges miller and jones on the other hand had a duty to ensure that every defendant especially one facing death received a fair trial it was sadly ironic that judge obryan could see rons obvious problems while judges miller and jones could not barney was concerned enough to have ron evaluated he arranged for testing at the pontotoc county health department the clinic director claudette ray administered a series of psychological tests and issued a report to barney it ended with ron is consciously anxious due to situational stress he feels helpless to alter his situation or better himself he may behave inappropriately such as not attending preliminary hearings which would benefit him because of his panic and confused thinking most individuals would be demanding to hear information and opinions that would influence their future life or death the report was tucked away in barneys file and left there a request for a competency hearing was a routine matter one barney had handled before his client was sitting in jail about a hundred feet from the courthouse a place barney visited almost every day the case was begging for someone to raise the issue of competency the prosecution of dennis fritz got a huge boost from the testimony of a semiliterate indian by the name of james c harjo at twentytwo harjo was already in jail for burglaryhe got caught after he broke into the same home twice in september and october while he was awaiting transfer to a state prison his cell mate was dennis fritz the two became somewhat friendly dennis felt sorry for harjo and wrote letters for the boy most of them going to his wife he also knew exactly what the cops had planned every other day they would pull harjo out of the cell for no apparent reasonhis court appearances were overand as soon as he returned he began quizzing dennis about the carter murder in a jail full of accomplished snitches harjo had to be the worst the scheme was so obvious that dennis prepared a oneparagraph statement that he made harjo sign every time the cops took him out it read in part dennis fritz always says he is innocent and dennis flatly refused to discuss the case with him that didnt stop harjo on november peterson listed james c harjo as a witness for the state on that same date the preliminary hearing for dennis resumed before judge john david miller when peterson announced that his next witness would be harjo dennis flinched what could this stupid boy dream up harjo under oath and lying badly explained to an earnest bill peterson that he had been cell mates with fritz and while at first things had been friendly on halloween night a conversation had turned ugly harjo was quizzing dennis about the details of the murder dennis was having trouble with the details and harjo deftly managed to poke holes in his story he became convinced that dennis was guilty so he confronted him this made dennis very nervous he began pacing around the bullpen obviously struggling with his guilt and when he returned to their cell he looked at harjo with tears in his eyes and said we didnt mean to hurt her in court dennis couldnt sit through this crap he yelled at the witness you are lying you are lying judge miller settled things down harjo and peterson plowed ahead with their tales in harjos account dennis expressed concern for his young daughter what would she think if her daddy was a murderer he asked then some truly incredible testimony dennis confessed to harjo that he and ron had taken some beer to debbies apartment and when they finished with the raping and killing they picked up the empty cans wiped down the apartment to remove their fingerprints and left on crossexamination greg saunders asked harjo if dennis explained how he and ron wiped off their invisible fingerprints while leaving dozens of others harjo had no clue he admitted that there had been at least six other prisoners nearby when dennis had made his confession halloween night but no one else heard it greg produced copies of the statements prepared by dennis and signed by harjo harjo was discredited when he took the oath but after saunderss crossexamination he looked downright foolish it didnt matter judge miller had no choice but to bind dennis over for trial under oklahoma law a judge at a preliminary hearing was not permitted to determine the credibility of a witness trial dates were set then postponed the winter of dragged on with ron and dennis enduring life in jail and hoping their day in court would soon arrive after months behind bars they still believed in the possibility ofjustice and that the truth would be revealed in the pretrial skirmishing the only significant victory for the defense had been the ruling by judge jones that they would be tried separately even though bill peterson had fought the motions for separate trials there was a huge advantage in trying one before the other put fritz on first and let the newspaper report the details to an anxious and very curious town since the day of the murder the police had insisted there were two killers and the first and only pair theyd suspected had been fritz and williamson at every step suspicion investigation accusation arrest indictment preliminary hearingthe two had been linked their mug shots were published side by side in the local paper the headlines repeatedly read williamson and fritz if bill peterson could get a conviction for fritz in the first trial the williamson jurors would take their seats and start looking for a noose in ada the notion of fairness was to try fritz first then follow immediately with ron williamsonsame courtroom same judge same witnesses and the same newspaper reporting it all on april three weeks before rons trial was to start his courtappointed cocounsel frank baber filed a motion to withdraw from the case baber had found a job as a prosecutor in another district judge jones granted the motion baber walked away barney was left with no assistanceno legal eyes to help sift through the documents exhibits photographs and diagrams that would be introduced against his client on april five and a half years after the murder of debbie carter dennis fritz was escorted into the crowded courtroom on the second floor of the pontotoc county courthouse he was cleanshaven with a fresh haircut and he wore his only suit one his mother had purchased for his trial wanda fritz was sitting in the front row as close to her son as possible seated next to her was her sister wilma foss they would not miss a single word of the trial when the handcuffs were removed dennis glanced at the crowd and wondered which of the hundred or so potential jurors would eventually make it to the final twelve which of those registered voters sitting out there would judge him his long wait was over after enduring eleven months in the suffocating jail he was now in court he had a good lawyer he assumed the judge would guarantee a fair trial twelve of his peers would carefully weigh the evidence and quickly realize that peterson had no proof the beginning of the trial was a relief but it was also terrifying it was after all pontotoc county and dennis knew perfectly well that innocent people could be framed he had briefly shared a cell with karl fontenot a simple and confused soul who was now sitting on death row for a murder he had nothing to do with judge jones entered and greeted the pool ofjurors preliminary matters came first then the jury selection began it was a slow and tedious process the hours dragged by as the aged deaf and sick were weeded out then the questions began some by the lawyers but most by judge jones greg saunders and bill peterson haggled over which jurors to keep and which to strike at one point in the lengthy process judge jones asked the following question to a prospective juror by the name of cecil smith what was your past employment cecil smith the oklahoma corporation commission no followup questions were asked by the judge or the lawyers what cecil smith failed to include in his abbreviated response was the fact that hed had a long career in law enforcement moments later judge jones asked cecil smith if he knew detective dennis smith or if he was related to him cecil smith no kin judge jones and how do you know him cecil smith oh i just know of him and talked to him several times had a few little deals with him maybe hours later a jury was sworn in of particular concern to fritz was the presence of cecil smith when he took his seat in the jury box smith gave dennis a hard look the first of many the real trial began the following day nancy shew an assistant district attorney outlined for the jury what the proof would be greg saunders rebutted by saying in his opening statement that there was indeed very little proof the first witness was glen gore whod been brought back from prison gore under direct examination from peterson presented the rather strange testimony that he did not see dennis fritz with debbie carter on the night of the murder most prosecutors prefer to start with a strong first witness who can put the killer in the same vicinity as the victim at about the same time of the murder peterson chose otherwise gore said he may have seen dennis at the coachlight at some undetermined point in the past or perhaps he hadnt seen him there at all the states strategy became apparent with the first witness gore talked more about ron williamson than about dennis fritz and peterson asked more questions about ron the guiltbyassociation scheme was put into play before greg saunders got the chance to impeach gore on his lengthy criminal record peterson decided to discredit his own witness he asked gore about his criminal career there were many convictions for crimes such as kidnapping aggravated assault and shooting a police officer not only did the states prime witness fail to implicate dennis he was revealed to be a hardened felon serving a fortyyear sentence off to a shaky start peterson continued with another witness who knew nothing tommy glover described to the jury how he saw debbie carter talking to glen gore before she went home from the coachlight after a quick appearance on the witness stand glover was dismissed without mentioning the name of dennis fritz gina vietta told her story about the strange phone calls from debbie in the early hours of december she also testified that she had seen fritz at the coachlight on several occasions but not the night of the murder next charlie carter told the heartbreaking story of finding his dead daughter then detective dennis smith was called to the stand smith was led through the lengthy process of describing the murder scene and placing into evidence numerous photographs he talked about the investigation he led the collection of saliva and hair samples and so on nancy shews first question about possible suspects was not surprisingly not about dennis fritz did you interview a man then named ronald keith williamson sometime during your investigation she asked yes we did smith without interruption or objection then rambled on about the police investigation into ron williamson and explained how and why he became a suspect finally nancy shew remembered who was on trial and asked about a saliva sample from dennis fritz smith described how he collected the saliva and gave it to the osbi lab in oklahoma city shew finished the direct exam at that point and yielded the witness for cross when she sat down the state had provided no clue as to why and how dennis fritz became a suspect he had no history with the victim no one placed him remotely near her at the time of her murder though smith did testify that fritz lived close to debbies apartment there was no mention of motive fritz was finally linked to the murder through the testimony of gary rogers the next witness who said through our investigation of ron williamson that is when the defendant dennis fritz name came into play as an associate of ron williamson rogers explained to the jury how he and dennis smith shrewdly concluded that such a crime had required two killers the crime seemed too violent for just one man plus the killers had left behind a clue when they wrote in catsup dont look fore us or ealse the word us implied more than one killer and smith and rogers were quick to pick up on this through good police work they were able to learn that williamson and fritz had actually been friends this in their theory linked the two killers greg saunders had instructed dennis to ignore the jury but he found it impossible to do so those twelve people held his fate maybe his life in their hands and he couldnt help but glance over occasionally cecil smith sat in the front row and whenever dennis looked at the jury smith was always glaring back what is his problem dennis thought he soon found out during a recess greg saunders was entering the courthouse when an old lawyer one of ada s veterans asked him whos the smart sonofabitch that left cecil smith on the jury greg said well i guess that would be me whos cecil smith used to be the chief of police here in ada thats all saunders was stunned he marched into judge joness office and demanded a mistrial on the grounds that the juror had not been forthcoming during the selection process and that the juror was obviously biased toward the police and prosecution the motion was overruled dr fred jordan testified about his autopsy and the jury heard the gruesome details photos of the body were introduced and passed through the jury box provoking the shock and outrage inherent in any murder trial several of the jurors glared in disgust at fritz with the solid unimpeachable testimony of dr jordan still hanging in the air the prosecution decided to slip in a few of its offthewall witnesses a man named gary allen was sworn in and took the stand allens involvement was quite tenuous he told the jury that he lived near dennis fritz and that one night in early december at about am he heard two men outside his apartment making noise he wasnt sure of the exact date but for some reason was certain that it was before december the two men neither of whom he saw clearly enough to identify were in the yard laughing cursing and squirting each other with a garden hose the temperature was cold and the men had their shirts off he had known dennis fritz for some time and thought he recognized his voice but he wasnt sure he listened to the noise for about ten minutes then went back to bed when allen was excused as a witness there were a few puzzled looks in the courtroom what exactly was the purpose of his testimony things would get even more confusing with the next witness tony vick vick lived in the small apartment under gary allen and he knew dennis fritz he also knew ron williamson he testified that hed seen ron on the porch at denniss place and that he knew for a fact that the two had taken a trip together to texas in the summer of what more could the jury ask for the damning evidence continued to pile up with donna walker a convenience store clerk who identified dennis in court and said that she had once known him pretty well way back in dennis was a frequent customer at her store a regular coffee drinker who liked to chat her up early in the mornings ron was a customer too and she knew for a fact that he and dennis were pals then suddenly after the murder the two stopped drinking coffee at her store they vanished as far as she was concerned then after staying away for a few weeks they reappeared as if nothing had happened but they had changed how their character their dress they always dressed nice and were cleanshaven before and they just went completely down filthy clothing unshaven hair was a mess their character had changed they seemed kind of nervous and paranoid i guess when pressed by greg saunders walker couldnt explain why she waited five years before sharing this crucial evidence with the police she did admit that the cops approached her the previous august after dennis and ron were arrested the parade continued with letha caldwell a divorcee who had attended junior high school with ron at byng she told the jury that dennis fritz and ron williamson were frequent visitors to her home late at night at irregular hours and that they were always drinking at some point she became frightened of them and asked them to stay away when they refused she bought a gun and showed it to them at which time they decided she was serious her testimony had nothing to do with the murder of debbie carter and in many courtrooms would have been objected to as totally irrelevant to the issues the objection finally came when osbi agent rusty featherstone testified peterson in a clumsy attempt to prove that ron and dennis were carousing in norman four months before the murder put featherstone on the stand featherstone had given dennis two polygraph exams in but for many excellent reasons the results were inadmissible during the interviews dennis had recounted a night in norman that involved bars and drinking when peterson attempted to elicit this story from featherstone greg saunders objected loudly judge jones sustained it on the grounds of being irrelevant during the skirmish peterson at a bench conference said he featherstone places both ron williamson and dennis fritz as associating with each other in august of tell me the relevance of that statement judge jones demanded peterson could not and featherstone quickly left the courtroom it was another appearance by another witness who knew nothing about the murder of debbie carter the next witness was just as unproductive though his testimony was somewhat interesting william martin was the principal of the junior high in noble where dennis taught in he testified that on the morning of december a wednesday dennis called in sick and a substitute teacher taught his classes according to the attendance records martin brought to court dennis missed a total of seven days during the nine month school year after twelve witnesses the state had not laid a glove on dennis fritz the prosecution had proven beyond any doubt whatsoever that he drank alcohol ran with unsavory people ron williamson shared an apartment with his mother and daughter in the same neighborhood as debbie carters apartment and missed school the day after the murder petersons style was methodical he believed it was necessary to slowly build a case block by block witness by witness nothing fancy or slick gradually pile on the evidence and remove all doubt from the minds of the jurors but fritz was quite a challenge because there was no hard evidence snitches were needed the first one to testify was james harjo brought in like gore from prison dull and dimwitted harjo had not only burglarized the same house twice but used the identical means of entrysame bedroom same window when he was caught he was interrogated by the police using a pen and sheet of paper articles foreign to harjo the cops had walked the boy through his story with diagrams and solved the crime evidently this had impressed harjo greatly when he was in jail with dennis he at the urging of the police decided to crack the carter murder by doodling on a sheet of paper he explained this shrewd strategy to the jury in the crowded bullpen of the jail he had quizzed dennis about the murder at some point when his xs and os reached their climax he said to dennis well it looks like youre guilty dennis overcome by the weight of harjos deft logic withered under the burden and tearfully said we didnt mean to hurt her when harjo first spun this yarn during the preliminary hearing dennis erupted and yelled you are lying you are lying but with a jury watching closely he had to suffer through it again without showing any emotion while it was difficult he was encouraged to see several of the jurors suppressing a chuckle at harjos silly story on crossexamination greg saunders established that dennis and harjo were housed in one of the jails two bullpenssmall open areas accessible to four cells with two bunks each each bullpen was designed for eight men but was often more crowded than that even in the bullpen the men were practically breathing on each other surprisingly in the pontotoc county jail no one else heard denniss dramatic confession harjo testified that he enjoyed telling lies to ron about dennis and vice versa greg saunders asked him why were you lying on dennis and ron williamson why were you going back and forth and telling them lies about each other just to watch and see what they say theyll cut each others throats if you watch them and you were lying to ron about dennis or lying to dennis about ron is that right kind of to get them at each others throats yeah just see whatsee what theyd say harjo later admitted he did not understand the meaning of the word perjury the next informant was mike tenney the jailertrainee whod been used by the police to gather some dirt on dennis with little experience or training in law enforcement tenney began his career at the jail and his first assignment had been dennis fritz eager to impress those who might hire him permanently he spent a lot of time outside denniss cell chatting about everything but especially about the carter murder he had plenty of advice in his learned opinion denniss situation looked grave so the best thing to do would be to cut a deal negotiate a plea bargain save his own skin and testify against ron williamson peterson would be fair dennis had played along careful to say nothing because anything might be repeated in court being a rookie tenney had not testified much and had not fully rehearsed his lines he began by trying to recall a story about dennis and ron hopping bars in oklahoma city a story not even remotely connected to the carter murder saunders objected judge jones sustained then tenney stepped into hot water when he testified that he and dennis discussed the issue of a plea bargain twice he mentioned a plea bargain a highly prejudicial issue because it strongly implied that dennis had contemplated pleading guilty greg saunders objected loudly and moved for a mistrial judge jones overruled tenney finally managed to testify without the lawyers jumping to their feet he explained to the jury that he had spoken often with dennis and after every conversation he had hustled back to the front desk at the jail and written down everything that was said according to his handler gary rogers this was the way things were done good police work and during one of their little chats dennis allegedly said lets say it might have happened this way maybe ron went to the door and broke into carters apartment and then lets say he went ahead and got a little ron got a little bit carried away and was going to teach her a lesson she died lets say it happened this way but i didnt see ron kill her so how can i tell the da something i really didnt see after tenney the trial was recessed for the day and dennis was taken back to the jail he carefully removed his new suit and put it on a hanger a guard took it up front he stretched out on his bunk closed his eyes and wondered how the nightmare would end he knew the witnesses were lying but did the jury the next morning bill peterson called to the stand cindy mclntosh who admitted being in jail on badcheck charges when she met both dennis fritz and ron williamson she testified that she overheard the two talking with ron asking dennis about the crime scene photos of debbie carter was she on the bed or on the floor ron asked dennis on the floor dennis said mclntosh admitted that she was not convicted on the check charges i paid off the checks and they let me out she said with the snitches out of the way peterson returned to more credible proof slightly more credible he called to the stand four consecutive witnesses who worked for the state crime lab their impact on the jury was profound as it always is they were educated trained certified experienced and they worked for the state of oklahoma they were experts and they were there to testify against the defendant to help prove his guilt the first was the fingerprint expert jerry peters he explained to the jury that he examined twentyone prints lifted from debbies apartment and car nineteen of which were debbies one matched detective dennis smith one matched mike carpenter and not a single fingerprint belonged to either dennis fritz or ron williamson odd that the fingerprint expert would testify that none of the fingerprints were left behind by the accused larry mullins described how he reprinted debbies palms the previous may when her body was exhumed he gave the new prints to jerry peters who suddenly saw things he hadnt seen four and a half years earlier the prosecutions theory the same one to be used against ron williamson was that during the prolonged and violent assault debbie was wounded her blood somehow ended up on her left palm and this palm touched a tiny portion of sheetrock just above the floor of her bedroom since the palm print did not belong to ron or dennis and it certainly could not belong to the real killer it had to be debbies mary long was a criminalist who worked primarily with body fluids she explained to the jury that about percent of all people do not show their blood type in body fluids such as saliva semen and sweat this segment is known in the trade as nonsecretors based on her examination of the blood and saliva samples from ron and dennis she was certain that they were nonsecretors the person who left the semen at the crime scene was probably a nonsecretor too though long was not certain because the evidence was insufficient thus percent of the population was eliminated from suspicion or around percent give or take a few points nonetheless fritz and williamson now bore the ominous tag of nonsecretors longs math was blown away on crossexamination when greg saunders forced her to admit that most of the blood and saliva samples she analyzed in the carter case came from nonsecretors of the twenty samples she examined twelve were from nonsecretors including fritz and williamson sixty percent of those in her pool of suspects were nonsecretors as opposed to the national average of only percent it didnt matter her testimony excluded many and helped raise the suspicion hanging over the head of dennis fritz the states last witness was by far its most effective peterson saved his knockout punch for the last round and when melvin hett finished testifying the jury was convinced hett was the osbi hair man a veteran testifier whod helped send many people to prison forensic examination of human hair got off to a rocky start as far back as in a wisconsin case that year an expert for the state compared a known hair sample with one found at the crime scene and testified that the two came from the same source the source was convicted but on appeal the wisconsin supreme court reversed and said strongly such evidence is of the most dangerous character thousands of innocent defendants could have been spared if that decision had been heeded instead police investigators crime labs and prosecutors plowed ahead with the analysis of hair which was often the only real clue left at a crime scene hair analysis became so common and so controversial that it was studied many times throughout the twentieth century many of the studies indicated a high rate of error and in response to the controversy the law enforcement assistance administration sponsored a crime lab proficiency program in two hundred and forty of the best crime labs from throughout the country participated in the program which compared their analytical findings on different types of evidence including hair their evaluation of hair was dreadful a majority of the labs were incorrect four out of five times other studies fueled the debate over hair testimony in one the accuracy increased when the examiner compared a crime scene hair with those of five different men with no indication as to who was the cops favored suspect the chance of unintentional bias was removed during the same study though the accuracy fell dramatically when the examiner was told who was the real suspect a preconceived conclusion can exist and slant the findings toward that suspect hair experts tread on thin legal ice and their opinions are weighted heavily with caveats such as the known hair and the questioned hair are microscopically consistent and could have come from the same source there is an excellent chance that they could not have come from the same source but such testimony was rarely volunteered at least on direct examination the hundreds of hairs collected at the crime scene by dennis smith took a delayed and tortuous route to the courtroom at least three different osbi analysts handled themalong with dozens of known hairs collected during the rounduptheusualsuspects sweep made by detectives smith and rogers shortly after the murder first mary long collected and organized all the hairs at the crime lab but soon packed them up and handed them to susan land by the time susan land received the hairs in march dennis smith and gary rogers were convinced the killers were fritz and williamson to the dismay of the investigators however her report concluded that the hairs were microscopically consistent only with those of debbie carter for a brief period fritz and williamson were off the hook though they had no earthly means of knowing it and years later their attorneys would not be informed of susan lands findings the state needed a second opinion in september citing the stress and strain of lands workload her boss ordered her to transfer the case to melvin hett such a transfer was highly unusual and made more so by the fact that land and hett worked in different crime labs in different regions of the state land worked in the central crime lab in oklahoma city hett worked in a branch in the town of enid his region covered eighteen counties none of which happened to be pontotoc hett proved to be rather methodical it took him twentyseven months to analyze the hair a lengthy period made even more remarkable by the fact that he was looking only at the samples from fritz williamson and debbie carter the other twentyone were not as important and could wait since the police knew who killed debbie carter they helpfully informed melvin hett when he received the samples from susan land the word suspect was written by the names of fritz and williamson glen gore had yet to provide samples to the ada police on december three years after the murder melvin hett finished his first report finding that seventeen of the questioned hairs were microscopically consistent with known samples of fritz and williamson after spending more than two years and over two hundred hours analyzing the first samples hett picked up steam considerably and knocked out the other twentyone in less than a month on january he finished his second report finding that all the othersamples taken from the young men of ada were consistent with nothing found in the carter apartment still glen gore had not been asked to provide samples it was tedious work and not without its uncertainties hett flipflopped several times as he labored with his microscope once he was certain a hair belonged to debbie carter but later changed his mind and decided it came from fritz such is the nature of hair analysis hett flatly contradicted some of susan lands findings and even managed to impugn his own work he initially found that a total of thirteen pubic hairs came from fritz and only two from williamson later though he changed his numberstwelve for fritz and two for williamson then eleven for fritz plus two scalp hairs for some reason gores hair finally entered the picture in july someone down at the ada police department woke up and realized gore had been neglected dennis smith collected scalp and pubic hair from gore and from the confessed killer ricky joe simmons and mailed them to melvin hett who evidently was quite busy because nothing happened for a year in july gore was asked again to provide samples why he asked because the police couldnt find his earlier samples months passed with no report from hett in the spring of the trials were approaching and there was still no report from hett on the gore and simmons samples on april after the fritz trial was under way melvin hett finally issued his third and last report the gore hairs were not consistent with the questioned hairs it took hett almost two years to reach this conclusion and his timing was beyond suspicious it was another clear indication that the prosecution so firmly believed in the guilt of fritz and williamson that it found it unnecessary to wait until all the hair analysis was completed in spite of its perils and uncertainties melvin hett was a staunch believer in hair analysis he and peterson became friendly and before the fritz trial hett passed along scientific articles touting the reliability of evidence that was famously unreliable he did not however provide the prosecutor with any of the numerous articles condemning hair analysis and testimony two months before the fritz trial hett drove to chicago and delivered his findings to a private lab called mccrone there one richard bisbing an acquaintance of hetts reviewed his work bisbing had been hired by wanda fritz to review the hair evidence and testify at trial to pay him wanda was forced to sell denniss car bisbing proved to be far more efficient with his time but the results were just as conflicting in less than six hours bisbing refuted almost all of hetts findings looking at only the eleven pubic hairs that hett was certain were microscopically consistent with fritz bisbing found that only three were accurate only three could have come from dennis fritz hett was wrong about the other eight undaunted by such a low estimation of his work by another expert hett drove back to oklahoma ready to testify without changing his opinion he took the stand on friday afternoon april and immediately launched into a windy lecture loaded with scientific terms and words designed more to impress the jurors than to inform them dennis with a college degree and experience teaching science could not follow hett and he was certain the jurors couldnt either he glanced at them several times they were hopelessly lost but they were obviously impressed with this expert he knew so much hett tossed out words like morphology cortex scale protrusion shallow gapping cortical fusi and ovoid bodies as if everyone in the courtroom knew exactly what he meant he seldom slowed long enough to explain himself hett was the star expert with an aura of reliability that was bolstered by his experience vocabulary confidence and strong conclusions that some of the known hairs of dennis fritz were consistent with some of those found at the crime scene six times during his direct testimony he said that denniss hair and the suspicious hairs were microscopically consistent and could have come from the same source not once did he share with the jury the truth that the hairs could have just as easily not come from the same source throughout his testimony bill peterson continually referred to the defendant ron williamson and the defendant dennis fritz at the time ron was locked away in solitary confinement strumming his guitar completely unaware that he was being tried in absentia and that things were not going too well hett wrapped up his testimony by summarizing for the jury his findings eleven pubic hairs and two scalp hairs could have come from dennis it was the same eleven pubic hairs hed driven to the mccrone laboratories in chicago and shown to richard bisbing for a second opinion the crossexamination by greg saunders yielded little hett was forced to admit that hair analysis is too speculative to be used for positive identifications like most experts he was able to talk his way out of tough questions by using his endless supply of vague scientific terms when he was excused the state rested the first witness called by the defense was dennis fritz he testified about his past his friendship with ron and so on he admitted that he had been convicted of cultivating marijuana in and had lied about this on his application to teach school at noble seven years later his reason for doing so was simple he needed a job he denied repeatedly that he had ever met debbie carter and certainly knew nothing about her murder he was then handed over to bill peterson for crossexamination theres an old adage in bad trial lawyering that when you dont have the facts do a lot of yelling peterson stomped to the podium glared at the murderer with the suspicious hair and began yelling within seconds judge jones called him to the bench for a little chastising you may not like this defendant the judge whispered sternly but youre not to be angry in this courtroom im not angry peterson angrily shot back yes you are this is the first time youve raised your voice to this bench all right peterson was incensed that fritz had lied on a job application thus dennis simply could not be believed and peterson dramatically produced another lie a form dennis had filled out when he hocked a pistol at a pawnshop in durant oklahoma again dennis had tried to hide his felony for cultivating pot two clear incidences of outright deception neither of course had anything to do with the carter murder peterson harangued him for as much mileage as he could possibly beat out of his selfconfessed lying it was ironic and would have been comical had things not been so tense that peterson worked himself into such an indignant lather over a witness who couldnt tell the truth this from a prosecutor whose case was built on the testimony of convicts and snitches when peterson finally decided to move on he had no place to go he hopscotched from the allegations of one prosecution witness to another but dennis did a credible job of holding his ground after a contentious onehour cross peterson sat down the only other witness called by greg saunders was richard bisbing who explained to the jury that he disagreed with most of the conclusions reached by melvin hett it was late on friday afternoon and judge jones adjourned court for the weekend dennis made the short walk back to the jail changed clothes and tried to relax in his stuffy rat hole of a cell he was convinced the state had failed to prove him guilty but he was far from confident he had seen the nasty looks from the jurors when they were shown the gruesome crime scene photos he had watched them as they listened to melvin hett and believed his conclusions for dennis it was a very long weekend closing arguments began monday morning nancy shew went first for the state and plodded through a recitation of each of the prosecutions witnesses and what had been said greg saunders countered with an argument that not much at all had been proven by the state that its burden of proving dennis guilty beyond a reasonable doubt had clearly not been met that this was nothing ronnie as a police eagle

shortly before his death ing more than a case of guilt by association and that the jury should find his client not guilty bill peterson had the last shot for almost an hour he rambled on and on regurgitating the high points from each of his witnesses trying desperately to convince the jurors that his crooks and snitches were worth believing the jury retired to deliberate at noon and six hours later came back to announce it was split eleven to one judge jones sent them back with the promise of dinner around pm they returned with a verdict of guilty dennis listened to the verdict in a frozen silence stunned because he was innocent shocked because hed been convicted with such paltry proof he wanted to lash out at the jurors the judge the cops the system but the trial was not over yet he was not totally surprised he had watched the jurors and seen their distrust they represented the town of ada and the town needed a conviction if the cops and peterson were so convinced dennis was the killer then he must be he closed his eyes and thought of his daughter elizabeth now fourteen and certainly old enough to understand guilt and innocence now that hed been convicted how would he ever convince her he was innocent as the crowd filed out of the courthouse peggy stillwell fainted on the courthouse lawn she was exhausted and overcome by emotion and grief she was rushed to the nearest hospital but was soon released with the issue of guilt now settled the trial moved quickly into the penalty phase in theory the jury would determine the sentence based on aggravating circumstances presented by the state and designed to get the death penalty and mitigating circumstances presented by the defendant that would hopefully save his life the fritz penalty phase was very brief peterson called to the stand rusty featherstone who finally got to tell the jury that dennis had admitted to him that he and ron had been barhopping in norman some four months before the murder that was the extent of his testimony the two murder suspects had actually driven seventy miles to norman and spent a long night in the clubs and lounges the next and last witness expanded on this profound story her name was lavita brewer and while having a drink in the bar at a holiday inn in norman she bumped into fritz and williamson after several drinks the three left together brewer got in the backseat dennis was behind the wheel ron was next to him and away they went it was raining dennis was driving fast running red lights and such and at some point early in the adventure brewer became hysterical though the two never touched or threatened her she decided that she really wanted to get out but dennis wouldnt stop this went on for fifteen or twenty minutes then the car slowed enough for her to open the door and jump she ran to a pay phone and called the police no one was injured no charges were filed no one was ever convicted but to bill peterson the incident was clear proof that dennis fritz was an ongoing threat to society and should be put to death to protect other young ladies lavita brewer was the best and only witness he could produce during his impassioned plea for death to the jury peterson looked at dennis pointed his finger and said dennis fritz you deserve to die for what you and ron williamson did to debra sue carter to which dennis interrupted and said to the jury i did not kill debbie carter two hours later the jury returned with a sentence of life in prison when the verdict was read dennis stood faced the jury and said ladies and gentlemen of the jury i would just like to say excuse me said judge jones dennis you cant do that greg saunders said but dennis was not to be denied he continued my lord jesus in heaven knows i didnt do this i just want you to know that i forgive you ill be praying for you back in his cell in the muggy darkness of his little corner of hell he found no relief whatsoever in the fact that he had avoided a death sentence he was thirtyeight years old an innocent man without a violent tendency in his being and the prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison was utterly overwhelming chapter annette hudson had closely followed the fritz trial by reading the daily reports in the ada evening news on tuesday april the frontpage headline read fritz found guilty in carter murder as usual the story mentioned her brother ron williamson who is also charged with first degree murder in carters murder is scheduled to be tried here on april in fact all six articles covering the fritz trial mentioned rons involvement and upcoming trial how do they expect to find an impartial jury annette asked herself repeatedly if one codefendant is found guilty how could the other one get a fair trial in the same town she bought ron a new gray suit an extra pair of navy slacks two white shirts two ties and new shoes on april the day before his trial began ron was taken to court for a chat with judge jones the judge was worried that the defendant might be disruptive a valid concern given his history as ron stood before the bench the judge said i want to see where we stand on your attendance tomorrow and make sure that when youre here that there wont be any disturbances do you understand my concern ron as long as they dont start telling me that ive killed somebody judge jones well you understand that theyre going to do that ron well i understand that but its not right judge jones knew that ron had been a great athlete so he used the analogy of a sports contest its kind of like a sporting event as far as the adversary process each side has an opportunity to be on offense and they have the opportunity to be on defense but you cant take issue with the fact that each side gets these opportunities thats just part of the process ron yeah but im the football being kicked for the prosecution the fritz trial was a nice warmup for the main event virtually the same witnesses would be used and in much the same order but in the next trial the state had two additional advantages first the defendant was mentally incompetent and prone to knock over tables and blurt out obscenities behavior that most people including jurors frowned on he could be eerily frightening he scared people second his lawyer was blind and alone since the courtappointed cocounsel baber had withdrawn from the case april there had been no replacement barney was quick on his feet and a great crossexaminer but not effective arguing over fingerprints photographs and hair analysis for the defense the trial couldnt start soon enough barney was sick of ron williamson and frustrated with the sheer number of hours the case was draining away from his other paying clients and he was afraid of ron physically afraid he arranged to have his son not a lawyer sit closely behind ron at the defense table barney planned to sit as far away as possible which wasnt far at all and if ron made a sudden aggressive move on barney then his son was to jump ron from the rear and take him down such was the level of trust between lawyer and client but few people in the packed courtroom on april realized that the son was protecting the father from the client most of those present were potential jurors strangers to such settings and uncertain as to who was who there were also reporters curious lawyers and the usual assortment of gossips that trials in small towns attract especially murder trials annette hudson and renee simmons sat in the front row as close to ronnie as possible several of annettes close friends had volunteered to sit with her throughout the trial and offer support she declined her brother was sick and unpredictable and she didnt want her friends to see him in cuffs and shackles nor did she want them subjected to explicit and gruesome testimony she and renee had suffered through the preliminary hearing and gotten a strong taste of what was coming at trial there were no friends there for ron across the aisle the carter family held down the front row the same place theyd been during the fritz trial the opposing sides tried not to make eye contact it was a thursday almost a full year after the exhumation of the victims body and the arrests of ron and dennis rons last significant treatment had been at central state some thirteen months earlier at barneys request hed been seen once by norma walker in ada a brief visit that began and ended like most of his visits to the local clinic for a year his medications when he received any at all had been erratically dispensed by the jailers the time spent in his solitary hole in the jail had done nothing to improve his mental health yet his mental health concerned no one but his family neither the prosecution the defense nor the court itself had raised the issue it was time for a trial the excitement of opening day quickly wore off as the tedium of jury selection hit hard hours passed as the lawyers questioned the pool and judge jones methodically dismissed one after the other ron for his part behaved himself he looked nicea haircut a shave new clothes he took pages of notes all under the eyes of barneys son who though as bored as the others managed to keep an eye on the client ron had no idea why he was being watched so closely late in the afternoon the final twelve were chosenseven men five women all white judge jones gave them their instructions and sent them home they would not be sequestered annette and renee were hopeful one juror was the soninlaw of a neighbor who lived across the street from annette another was related to a pentecostal preacher who surely knew of juanita williamson and her devotion to her church another was a distant cousin of a williamson relative by marriage most of the jurors looked familiar annette and renee had seen them at one time or another around ada it was indeed a small town the jurors were back by nine the following morning nancy shew gave the opening statement for the state almost a carbon copy of the one she had used for fritz barney deferred his initial remarks until after the states caseinchief was finished the first witness called by the prosecution was again glen gore but things did not go as planned after stating his name gore went silent and refused to testify he invited judge jones to hold him in contempt what did it matter he was serving forty years anyway his reasons were not clear but perhaps had something to do with the fact that he was doing time at the state prison where snitches were held in low regard by their peers as opposed to the pontotoc county jail where snitching was rampant after a few moments of confusion it was decided by judge jones that gores testimony from the preliminary hearing the previous july would be read to the jury this was done and though the impact was somewhat lessened the jury still heard gores fictitious account of seeing ron at the coachlight the night of the murder barney was robbed of the opportunity to grill gore on his numerous felonies and their violent nature nor did the defense get the chance to question the witness on his whereabouts and movements on the night of the murder with gore out of the way the states case quickly got back on track tommy glover gina vietta and charlie carter gave the same testimony for the third time gary allen told the same strange story of hearing two men squirt themselves with a water hose at am early in december but emphatically could not identify ron williamson the other man might have been fritz but maybe not the truth was that gary allen couldnt identify anyone and had no idea when the incident occurred he was a drug addict well known to the police he knew dennis smith because they had attended classes at the local college smith approached him shortly after the murder and asked if hed seen or heard anything suspicious in the early hours of december allen said he had seen two men squirting themselves with a water hose at the house next door but could not remember the date dennis smith and gary rogers jumped to the conclusion that it was fritz and williamson washing off the blood of debbie carter they pressed allen for details even showed him a photo of the murder scene they suggested that the two men were fritz and williamson but allen could not and would not identify the two shortly before the trial gary rogers stopped by allens apartment and again suggested details wasnt it really fritz and williamson and didnt he see them outside early in the morning sometime around december no allen could not be certain rogers brushed his coat away from his hip so allen could see his service revolver he said that allen might get lead poisoning if his memory didnt improve it did but just barely enough to testify dennis smith then walked the jury through the crime scene the photographing fingerprinting evidence gathering photos were passed to the jurors with the same predictable reactions when they saw the victim using a firetruck ladder the police photographer had shot some aerials of debbies apartment peterson used one of them and asked smith to tell the jury where the williamson house was located only a few blocks away barney said let me see those photos and they were handed over as was the unwritten rule in ada barney took the photos and stepped outside with his assistant linda she described each one to him in detail the direct examination was matteroffact but barney had some fireworks on cross hed always thought it was odd that the two alleged killers could pull off such a heinous rape and murder without leaving a single fingerprint he asked smith to explain the best surfaces for an investigator to dust for prints smooth hard surfacesglass mirrors hard plastic painted wood and so on then he walked smith through the small apartment and forced him to admit that he had neglected many obvious locationskitchen appliances the glass in the bedroom window that was left open bathroom fixtures door facings mirrors the list grew and grew and the impression was clear that smith had done a poor job of checking for prints with the witness on his heels barney hammered away when he became too aggressive either bill peterson or nancy shew would object to his tactics and their objections usually brought an acerbic retort from barney gary rogers took the stand next and continued a detailed summary of the investigation but his most important contribution to the states case was recounting for the jury the dream confession ron made the day after he was arrested it sounded just fine on direct exam but barney had a few problems with it he was quite curious as to why the statement was not recorded rogers admitted that the police owned and often used a video camera and when pressed by barney he admitted that sometimes it wasnt used when the investigators werent sure what the witness might say why run the risk of recording something harmful to the prosecution but helpful to the defendant rogers admitted that the police department owned a tape recorder and that he knew how to operate it it wasnt used in the interview with ron because that would not have been within their normal procedures barney didnt buy that either rogers also admitted that the police department had a ready supply of pencils and paper but stumbled badly when he tried to explain why he and rusty featherstone did not allow ron to write his own statement they refused to let him see it either after they were through with it and barney piled on the suspicion as he drilled rogers about his unusual procedures rogers made a huge mistake he mentioned rons interrogation on video in which ron had steadfastly denied any involvement barney was incredulous why had he not been told of this tape pretrial discovery required the prosecution to hand over all exculpatory evidence barney had timely filed the proper motions months earlier the prior september the court had ordered the prosecution to provide defense counsel with all statements made by ron relative to the murder investigation how could the police and prosecutor sit on the tape for four and a half years and hide it from the defense barney had very few witnesses at his disposal since the case against ron was basically an admission case one in which the state was using a variety of witnesses albeit a rather sketchy collection to testify that ron at various times and in various ways admitted to the murder the only real way to fight such testimony was to deny it and the only person who could deny making the admissions was ron himself barney planned to put ron on the stand in his own defense but he was terrified of the prospect the tape would have been a powerful tool to show the jury four and a half years earlier long before the prosecution had put together its roster of shady witnesses and long before ron had such a lengthy criminal record to answer to he had sat before a camera and repeatedly denied any involvement in a famous decision brady v maryland the us supreme court held that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution investigators have all the resources frequently they uncover witnesses or other evidence favorable to a suspect or defendant for decades they could simply ignore this exculpatory evidence and proceed with a prosecution brady leveled the field and instantly became ingrained in criminal procedure a brady request is one of many routine motions a criminal defense lawyer files early in the case a brady motion a brady hearing brady material i nailed him on brady the case worked its way into the vernacular of criminal law practice now barney stood before judge jones with rogers still in the witness chair and peterson studying his shoes with a clear brady violation he moved for a mistrial and was overruled judge jones promised to hold a hearing on the matterafter the trial was over it was late on friday and everyone was tired judge jones recessed until monday morning ron was handcuffed surrounded by deputies and hustled out of the courtroom he had behaved himself so far and it had not gone unnoticed the front page of sundays ada evening news ran the headline williamson controlled during trials first day the first witness monday was dr fred jordan who for the third time in the same seat testified in detail about the autopsy and cause of death it was also the third time that peggy stillwell had suffered through it and the ordeal was certainly not getting any easier fortunately she could not see the photos they were passing around to the jurors she could see their reactions and that was enough dr jordan was followed by tony vick fritzs neighbor donna walker the convenience store clerk and letha caldwell the latenight acquaintanceall three as useless as theyd been in the fritz trial the fireworks started when terri holland was called next during the preliminary hearing shed been able to spin her yarns with no fear of getting caught now though with ron glaring at her and knowing the truth things would be different the tales started immediately holland was describing statements ron allegedly made in jail about debbie carterand it was obvious ron was about to explode he shook his head clenched his jaws stared at holland as if hed like to kill her finally she said he said if shed went ahead and went with him hed never had to kill her ron said oh loudly nancy shew asked did you ever hear a phone conversation that he made that related to debbie carter in any way holland i was working in the laundry i was a trustee ron was on the phone to his mom and he told his motherhe was trying to get her to bring him cigarettes or something im not sure what but theyhe was hollering at her and he told her that if she didnt that hed have to kill her like he did debbie carter to which ron yelled she is lying nancy shew continued ms holland did you ever hear him describe or talk about any of the details of debbie carters death holland he was tellingi guess in the bullpen the guys back therethat hehe said he shoved a coke bottle up her ass and her panties down her throat ron jumped up pointed at her and yelled you are lying i aint never said nothing like that in my life i did not kill this girl and i call you a liar barney be still ron ron i dont even know what yourei mean youre going to pay for that there was a pause as everyone caught their breath and barney slowly rose to his feet he knew exactly what was comingrepair work the prosecutions star witness had botched a couple of crucial factsthe panties and the coke bottlea common problem with fabricated testimony with the courtroom tense a lying witness exposed and barney already waiting to pounce nancy shew tried to fix the damage shew ms holland let me ask you about the details you were just relating as far as your memory goes are you sure about the objects that he stated he used you said coke bottle barney if the court please if the court pleasei heard what she said and i dont want this district attorney changing her testimony any either and i object to that holland he said coke bottle or catsup bottle or bottle barney see what i mean if the court please holland its been four years ron yeah and youre a barney hush shew ms holland can youi know you overheard different things barney if the court please shew can you think of barney im going to object to this leading and suggestive questioning that the district attorney is doing the court state a question without posturing anything in front of it shew did he ever tell whyyou said that he said that he killed holland he wanted to sleep with debbie carter ron youre a liar barney shut up ron standing shes a liar i aint going to sit for it i didnt kill debbie carter and you are lying barney ronnie come on sit down peterson judge can we have a recess please barneyi object to counsels sidebar comments your honor barney these arent sidebar comments if the court please the court wait a minute barney im talking to this defendant the court wait a minute ask your next question mr williamson i must admonish you that you are not allowed to speak from the chair you are now in shew ms holland can you recall if he ever said why he did what he did holland because she wouldnt sleep with him ron youre lying damn it tell the truth i never killed nobody in my life barney judge id like to ask if we could have a recess for a few minutes here the court all right remember your instructions the jury may step down ron could i speak to her please let me talk to her what is she talking about a short break cooled things down with the jury absent judge jones had a nice chat with ron who assured his honor that he could behave himself when the jury returned the judge explained that the case was to be decided on the evidence only and nothing else not comments from the attorneys and certainly not comments and actions by the defendant but rons chilling threat of youre going to pay for that was clearly heard by the jurors they too were afraid of him during the melee nancy shew was unable to completely resuscitate her witness with leading and suggestive questions she was able to transform the coke bottle to a catsup bottle but the little detail of the panties in the mouth went uncorrected the bloody washcloth was never mentioned by terri holland the next hotcheck artist called by the state to help find the truth was cindy mclntosh but the poor girl was so confused she couldnt remember which story she was expected to tell she drew a blank and was finally dismissed without completing her duties mike tenney and john christian told of their latenight chats with ron in his cell and some of the strange things he said neither bothered to mention that ron repeatedly denied any involvement in the murder and would often scream for hours that he was innocent after a quick lunch peterson lined up the osbi agents in the same order as in the fritz trial jerry peters went first and told his story of reprinting debbies hands after the exhumation because he was uncertain about a tiny portion of her left palm barney tried to pin him down on exactly how and why this became an issue four and a half years after the autopsy but peters proved elusive did he worry about his initial findings for such a long period of time or did bill peterson call at random one day early in and make some suggestions peters was vague larry mullins offered the same opinion as petersthe bloody print on the sheetrock belonged to debbie carter not some mysterious killer mary long testified that ron williamson was a nonsecretor thus placed squarely in the minority of about percent of the population debbies rapist was probably in this group with some effort barney pinned her down on the exact number of people she had tested and arrived at a total of twenty including the victim and of that number twelve were nonsecretors or percent of her pool he then had some fun with the math susan land testified briefly she had begun the hair analysis in the carter case but then transferred it to melvin hett when pressed by barney as to why she said at that particular time i was working on numerous homicides and all the stress and strain i just didnt feel that i could be objective and i didnt want to make a mistake on something melvin hett was then sworn in and was soon delivering the same scholarly lecture hed given a few days earlier in the fritz trial he described the laborious process of microscopically comparing known hair with questioned hair he did a fine job of giving the impression that hair analysis was thoroughly reliable it had to be it was used all the time in criminal trials hett told the jury hed worked on thousands of hair cases he produced some stock diagrams of different types of hair and explained that hair has between twentyfive and thirty distinguishable characteristics when he finally got around to ron williamson he testified that two pubic hairs found on the bed were microscopically consistent and could have come from the same source ron williamson and two scalp hairs found on the bloody washcloth were microscopically consistent and could have come from the same sourceron williamson the four hairs could just as easily not have come from ron but hett didnt mention this with a slip of the tongue hett stepped out of bounds as he was testifying about the two scalp hairs he said these were the only scalp hairs that matched or were consistent with ron williamson the word match is offlimits in hair analysis because it is extremely misleading laypeople on the jury may struggle with the concept of hairs being microscopically consistent but they have no trouble understanding a match its quicker cleaner easier to grasp like a fingerprint a match eliminates all doubt after hett used the word match for the second time barney objected judge jones overruled him saying he could deal with it on crossexamination hetts most egregious act though was the manner in which he testified instead of educating the jurors hett chose instead to simply bless them with his opinions to help the jury evaluate the evidence most hair analysts bring into court enlarged photos of the hair in dispute a photo of a known hair is mounted next to a questioned hair and the expert goes into great detail explaining similarities and dissimilarities as hett said there are about twentyfive different characteristics in hair and a good examiner will show the jury exactly what he or she is talking about hett did nothing of the sort after working on the carter murder for nearly five years hundreds of hours three different reports he did not show the jury one single enlarged photo of his work not a single hair taken from ron williamson was compared with a single hair taken from debbies apartment hett was in effect telling the jury to simply trust him dont ask for proof just believe his opinions the clear implication of hetts testimony was that four of the hairs found in the carter apartment came from ron williamson indeed this was the sole purpose of putting hett on the witness stand his presence and testimony highlighted the unfairness of expecting an indigent defendant to get a fair trial without giving him access to forensic experts barney had requested such assistance months earlier and judge jones had declined judge jones should have known better three years earlier a major case from oklahoma landed at the us supreme court and its outcome rattled the criminal courts of the country in ake v oklahoma the court said when a state brings its judicial power to bear on an indigent defendant in a criminal proceeding it must take steps to assure that the defendant has a fair opportunity to present his defense justice cannot be equal where simply as a result of his poverty a defendant is denied the opportunity to participate meaningfully in a judicial proceeding in which his liberty is at stake the ake decision required that the basic tools of an adequate defense be provided by the state to an indigent defendant it was ignored by judge jones in both the fritz and the williamson trials forensic evidence was a crucial part of the prosecution jerry peters larry mullins mary long susan land and melvin hett were all experts ron was left with only barney a competent courtroom advocate but sadly one unable to see the evidence the state rested after melvin hett at the beginning of the trial barney waived his opening statement reserving it for the start of his defense it was a risky maneuver most defense lawyers cant wait to address the jurors early on to begin sowing doubt about the states evidence the opening statement and the closing argument are the only stages in a trial when a lawyer can directly address the jury and they are opportunities too ripe to pass up barney after the state rested surprised everyone by again waiving his right to an opening statement no reason was given none was required but it was a very unusual tactic barney called to the stand seven straight jailers all denied they had ever heard ron williamson in any way implicate himself in the carter murder wayne joplin was the pontotoc county court clerk barney called him as a witness to review the records of terri holland she had been arrested in new mexico in october and hauled back to ada and placed in jail where she promptly helped solve two sensational murder cases though she waited two years to inform the police about rons dramatic confession to her she pleaded guilty to the badcheck charges received a fiveyear sentence with three suspended and was ordered to pay court costs of restitution of for attorneys fees at the rate of per month a month to the department of corrections and a month to the crime victims compensation fund she made one payment of in may then all was apparently forgiven barney was down to his last witness the defendant himself allowing ron to testify was risky he was volatileearlier in the day he had lashed out at terri hollandand the jury was already afraid of him he had a criminal record which peterson would hammer him with attacking his credibility no one was certain how much if any of his meds he was receiving he was angry and unpredictable and worst of all he had not been prepped by his lawyer barney asked for a conference at the bench and said to judge jones now then the fun starts id like to have a recess to do whatever i can as far as having any kind of calming influence on him he seemswell he hasnt been jumping up and down im ready to have a recess anyway youre down to one possible witness judge jones asked im down to one yeah and i think youre using the right term too judge when they adjourned for the noon recess ron was led downstairs on his way to the jail he saw the victims father and yelled charlie carter i did not kill your daughter the deputies hustled him away even faster at pm he was sworn in after a few preliminary questions he denied having any conversation with terri holland and denied ever meeting debbie carter when did he first learn of carters death barney asked on december the th my sister annette hudson called over to the house and mother answered the telephone and i heard mother say well i know ronnie didnt do it because he was at home and i asked mother what that was about she said that annette had called and said that there had been a girl killed in our neighborhood the lack of preparation became more apparent a few minutes later when barney asked the witness about first meeting gary rogers ron said and it was just shortly after that that i went down to the station and gave a lie detector test barney almost choked ronnie dontyoure not supposed to talk about that any mention of a polygraph in front of the jury was prohibited had the state done so a mistrial would have been in order no one had bothered to inform ron seconds later he stepped out of bounds again when he described an incident with dennis fritz i was with dennis fritz and we were going down the road and i told him that dennis smith had called me back and told me the results of the polygraph test had been inconclusive barney plowed ahead and changed the subject they talked briefly about rons conviction on the forged instrument then a few questions about where he was on the night of the murder barney finished with a feeble did you kill debbie carter no sir i did not i believe thats all in his haste to get his client on and off the stand with as little damage as possible barney neglected to rebut most of the allegations from the states witnesses ron could have explained his dream confession to rogers and featherstone the night after his arrest he could have explained his jailhouse conversations with john christian and mike tenney he could have diagrammed the jail and explained to the jury that it was impossible for terri holland to hear what she heard without others doing so he could have flatly denied the statements of glen gore gary allen tony vick donna walker and letha caldwell like all prosecutors peterson was itching for a shot at the defendant on crossexamination what he didnt expect was for the defendant to be thoroughly unintimidated he began by making much of rons friendship with dennis fritz now a convicted murderer isnt it a fact mr williamson that you and dennis fritz are about the only friends each of you got isnt that right well lets put it like this ron answered coolly you framed him and now youre trying to frame me the words echoed around the courtroom as peterson caught his breath changing the subject he asked if ron remembered meeting debbie carter something he continually denied the question was asked again and ron blurted peterson im going to make this clear to you one more time judge jones intervened and instructed the witness to answer the question again ron denied ever meeting debbie carter peterson stomped and strutted around throwing a few jabs and hitting air he got into trouble again when he returned to his fiction do you know where you were after ten oclock on december the th ron at home peterson doing what ron after ten oclock five years ago i could have been watching television or asleep peterson isnt it a fact you went out that door went down that alley ron huhuh bud no way peterson went down that alley ron no way man peterson you and dennis fritz ron youreno way no way peterson walked up to that apartment ron no way peterson do you know where dennis fritz was that night ron i know he wasnt at debbie carters thats the way ill put it peterson how do you know he wasnt at debbie carters ron because you framed him peterson how do you know he wasnt at debbie carters ron id bet my life on it lets put it like that peterson tell us how you know ron i just dontdont ask me any more questions ill get down and you can put it to the jury but im telling you you framed him and now youre trying to frame me barney ronnie ron my mother knew i was at home you come harassing me for five years now you can do whatever you want to do to me i dont care peterson tendered the witness and sat down during his closing argument barney did much to malign the police and their workthe prolonged investigation the loss of gores hair samples their seeming blindness to gore as a suspect dennis smiths slipshod fingerprinting at the crime scene the numerous requests for samples from ron the questionable tactics used in taking his dream confession the failure to provide the defense with rons earlier statement the evershifting opinions from the osbi gang the list of errors was long and rich and barney referred to the police more than once as the keystone kops as all good lawyers do he argued that there was plenty of reasonable doubt and appealed to the jurors to use their common sense peterson argued that there was no doubt whatsoever the cops all fine professionals of course did an exemplary job with their investigation and peterson and his team had provided the jury with clear proof of guilt picking up on something hed heard from melvin hett he played things a bit loose with his terminology talking about the hair analysis he said so over a long period of time mr hett is examining hairs and eliminating examining and eliminating along with his other cases then in theres a match but barney was ready he immediately objected saying if the court please there hasnt been a match since statehood we object to him using that term the objection was sustained peterson plodded on summarizing what each of his witnesses said when he brought up terri holland ron became tense peterson terri holland is telling you what she recalls after two years and her testimony was that she heard this defendant tell his mother that if she didnt bring him something ron jumped to his feet and said hold it peterson he ought to kill her just like he killed debbie carter ron shut your mouth man i never said that barney sit down be still now the court mr williamson ron i did not say that to my mother barney ronnie the court listen to your attorney ron sat down and seethed peterson labored on spinning the testimony of the states witnesses in a light so favorable barney was forced to object repeatedly and ask judge jones to remind the prosecutor to stay within the facts the jury retired at am on wednesday annette and renee remained in the courtroom for a while then left for lunch it was difficult to eat after hearing every word of testimony they were even further convinced their brother was innocent but it was petersons courtroom most of the rulings had gone his way hed patched together the same witnesses with just as little evidence and got a guilty verdict against fritz they despised the man he was loud and arrogant and ran over people they detested him for what he was doing to their brother the hours passed at word arrived that the jury had a verdict and the courtroom filled up quickly judge jones took his place and lectured the spectators against outbursts annette and renee held hands and prayed across the aisle the carter family held hands too and prayed their ordeal was almost over at the jury foreman handed a verdict to the clerk who glanced at it and passed it on to judge jones he announced the verdictguilty on all counts the carters silently pumped their hands in the air in a show of victory annette and renee wept quietly as did peggy stillwell ron hung his head shaken but not altogether surprised after eleven months in the pontotoc county jail he had become part of a rotten system he knew dennis fritz was an innocent man yet hed been convicted by the same cops and same prosecutor in the same courtroom judge jones was anxious to finish the trial without a pause he ordered the state to begin the penalty phase nancy shew addressed the jury and explained that since the murder was especially heinous atrocious and cruel and since it was committed for the purpose of preventing arrest and since there was a strong likelihood that ron would kill again and was thus a continuing threat to society he should be put to death to prove this the state called four witnesses four women ron had encountered before none of whom had bothered to press criminal charges against him the first was beverly setliff who testified that on june seven years earlier she had seen ron williamson outside her house late at night as she was preparing for bed he yelled hey and i know youre in there and im going to get you she had never seen him before she locked the doors and he disappeared she did not call the police didnt even think about it really and didnt consider filing a complaint until the next day when she saw a cop at a convenience store and told him about the incident if a formal report was prepared she never saw it three weeks later she saw ron again and a friend told her his name six years passed when ron was arrested she called the police and told the story of the prowler the next witness was lavita brewer the same woman who testified against dennis fritz she told her story againmeeting ron and dennis in a bar in norman getting in the car with them becoming frightened jumping out calling the police according to her version ron never touched her or threatened her in any manner she became hysterical in the backseat of denniss car because he would not stop and let her out and the worst thing ron did during the episode was to tell her to shut up she eventually jumped out of the car fled called the police but did not press charges letha caldwell testified again she had known ron williamson since their junior high days at byng and had always been friendly with him during the early s he and dennis fritz began hanging around her house late at night always drinking one day she was working in her flower beds and ron appeared they had small talk and she kept working which irritated him at one point he grabbed her wrist she broke free walked into the house then realized that her children were inside he followed her but didnt touch her again and soon left she did not report the incident to the police the final witness was by far the most damaging a divorced woman named andrea hardcastle told a harrowing tale of an ordeal that lasted over four hours in ron and a friend were at her house trying to coax her into going out with them they were headed for the coachlight andrea was keeping three children of her own and two others so she could not go out the men left but ron soon returned to retrieve a pack of cigarettes he entered the house uninvited and quickly made a pass at andrea it was after ten at night the children were asleep and she was frightened she had no interest in sex he exploded striking her repeatedly about the face and head and demanding that she perform oral sex she refused and in doing so realized that the more she talked the less he hit her so they talked he talked about his baseball career his failed marriage his guitar playing god and religion his mother he had gone to high school with her exhusband who was a parttime bouncer at the coachlight at times he was quiet peaceful even tearful at other times he was erratic loud and angry andrea worried about the children all five of them as he talked she kept thinking of some way out of the ordeal he erupted into violent fits hitting her again and trying to pull off her clothes he was too drunk to maintain an erection at one point ron allegedly said that he figured he would have to kill her andrea was praying fervently she decided to play along she invited him back the next afternoon when the kids would be gone and they could have all the sex they wanted this proposal appealed to him greatly so he left she called her exhusband and her father and together they patrolled the streets looking for ron they were heavily armed and not shy about roadside justice andreas face was a messcuts bruises swollen eyes ron wore a ring engraved with the head of a horse and this caused numerous small puncture wounds around her eyes the police were called the next day but she adamantly refused to press charges ron lived close by and she was terrified of him barney was unprepared for her testimony and muddled through a halfhearted crossexamination the courtroom was silent when she stepped down from the witness stand the jurors glared at the defendant it was hanging time inexplicably barney called no witnesses to mitigate the damage and try to save rons life annette and renee were sitting in the courtroom ready to testify not one word had been uttered throughout the trial about rons mental incompetence no records had been introduced the final words the jurors heard from the witness stand were those of andrea hardcastle bill peterson begged for the death penalty in his closing argument and he had some fresh evidence a new fact or two that had not been proven during the trial there had been no mention of rons horse head ring until andrea hardcastles testimony peterson jumped to a few conclusions expanded the evidence and decided that ron had used the same ring when he beat debbie carter thus her facial injuries most surely were similar to what andrea hardcastles must have been back in january it was just a wild idea there was certainly no proof but then no proof was needed peterson dramatically told the jury he left his signature with andrea hardcastle and he underlined it with debbie carter he ended his remarks by saying when you come back in here ladies and gentlemen im going to ask you to say ron williamson you deserve to die for what you did to debra sue carter with perfect timing ron blurted i did not kill debbie carter the jury retired but made quick work of the penalty deliberations in less than two hours they were back with a sentence of death in a bizarre case ofjudicial secondguessing judge jones called a hearing the following day to ponder the states brady violation though barney was exhausted and fed up with the case he was still indignant that the cops and peterson had deliberately withheld the videotape of rons polygraph interrogation but why bother at this point the trial was over the video was of no benefit after the fact to no ones surprise judge jones ruled that the suppression of the tape by the authorities was not a brady violation after all the tape wasnt really hidden it was handed over after the trial sort of a delayed submission ron williamson was on his way to f cellhouse the notorious death row at the oklahoma state prison in mcalester chapter oklahoma is very serious about its death penalty when the us supreme court approved the resumption of executions in the oklahoma state legislature rushed into a special session for the sole purpose of enacting death penalty statutes the following year the lawmakers debated the innovative idea of death by lethal injection as opposed to going back to old sparky the states dependable electric chair the rationale was that chemicals were more merciful thus less likely to attract constitutional attacks of cruel and inhuman punishment thus more likely to speed along executions in the excitement of the moment with the press watching closely and the voters egging them on the legislators debated the various ways in which to take human life some hardliners wanted hangings and firing squads and such but in the end lethal injection was approved overwhelmingly and oklahoma became the first state to adopt it but not the first state to use it much to the frustration of lawmakers and police and prosecutors and a wide majority of the public oklahoma quickly fell behind the other active death penalty states thirteen long years passed without an execution finally in the waiting ended and the death chamber was used once again once the dam broke the flood came since oklahoma has executed more convicts on a per capita basis than any other state no place not even texas comes close executions in oklahoma take place at mcalester a maximum security prison a hundred and twenty miles southeast of oklahoma city death row is there in an infamous section called the h unit practice makes perfect and executions at mcalester are carried out with precision for the inmate whose time has come the last day is spent receiving visitorsfamily members friends usually his lawyer of course the visits are painful made even more so by the fact that there can be no physical contact they chat and cry through a thick wall of glass while talking on a phone no farewell hugs or kisses from the family just a gutwrenching i love you through a black receiver often the inmate and his visitor will symbolically kiss each other by pressing their lips against the glass they also imitate touching with their hands there is no law that prevents physical contact before an execution each state has its own rules and oklahoma prefers to keep the rituals as harsh as possible if the warden is in a good mood he allows the inmate to make some phone calls when the visiting is over its time for the last meal but there is a limit on the menu and the warden can veto anything on it cheeseburgers fried chicken catfish and ice cream are the most popular items requested about an hour before his death the inmate is prepped he changes clothes and puts on a light blue outfit much like surgical scrubs he is secured to a gurney with wide velcro straps and as he begins his final ride there is a pep rally of sorts thrown by his comrades they shake and kick their cell doors they rattle the metal bars they yell and whoop and the racket continues until just after the scheduled moment of execution then it stops suddenly as the inmate is being prepared the death chamber is waiting and very well organized witnesses somberly file into the two viewing rooms one for the family of the victim one for the family of the killer the room for the victims has twentyfour folding chairs but some are reserved for the press usually four or five seats a couple for the lawyers and a few for the warden and his staff the local sheriff and prosecutor seldom miss the event behind this room and behind panels of oneway glass is the witness room for the family of the killer it has twelve folding chairs but often a few are empty some inmates do not want their families to watch some inmates have no families and some victims have no families occasionally their witness room is halfempty too the two rooms are separated and the two groups are carefully kept away from each other as the witnesses take their places they stare at nothingminiblinds block out the view of the death chamber the gurney enters and is wheeled into place technicians are waiting with intravenous tubes one for each arm when everything is properly inserted and adjusted the miniblinds are raised and the witnesses can see the inmate oneway glass prevents him from seeing the victims family but he can certainly see his own and often acknowledges them a microphone protrudes from the wall two feet above his head a doctor attaches a heartmonitoring device a deputy warden stands at a small white podium in a corner and records everything in a notebook next to him on the wall is a phone just in case there is latebreaking news on the legal front or a change of heart in the governors office in years past a chaplain stood in another corner and read scripture throughout the execution but he retired the warden steps forward and asks the condemned if he or she has any last words they often do not but occasionally one will ask for forgiveness or proclaim his innocence or pray or launch into some bitter denunciation one sang a hymn one shook hands with the warden and thanked him and his staff and the entire prison for taking such good care of him during his prolonged visit there is a twominute time limit on the final words but it is never invoked the condemned are always relaxed and lowkey they have accepted their fate and had many years to prepare for this moment many welcome it they prefer death to the horror of living another twenty or thirty years on h unit in a small room behind the gurney three executioners are hiding they are not to be seen their identities are unknown around the prison they are not state employees but freelancers of some variety who were secretly hired by an old warden many years ago their arrivals and departures to and from mcalester are mysterious only the warden knows who they are where they come from and where they get their chemicals he pays each of them in cash for an execution the tubes from the inmates arms run up and through two twoinch holes in the wall and into the small room where the executioners do their work when the formalities are tidied up and the warden is certain there will be no lastminute phone calls he nods and the injections start first a saline solution is pumped in to open the veins the first drug is sodium thiopental and it quickly knocks out the inmate another flushing of saline solution then the second drug vecuronium bromide stops the breathing another quick flush and the third drug potassium chloride stops the heart the doctor appears does a quick check pronounces death the miniblinds close fast and the witnesses many of them quite emotional leave quickly and quietly the gurney is rolled out the body is taken to an ambulance the family must make arrangements to retrieve it or it goes to a prison cemetery outside the prison gates two groups hold two very different vigils the homicide survivors sit in front of their rvs and wait for the welcome news that the execution is complete nearby is their display a large threepanel memorial to the victims of the killers color photos of children and smiling students poems to the dead enlarged headlines announcing some horrific double murder lots and lots of photos of those butchered by the inhabitants of death row the memorial is called remember the victims not far away a catholic priest leads the other group in a circle of prayer and hymn singing some opponents of the death penalty attend every execution praying not only for those condemned but also for their victims the two groups know and respect each other but they strongly disagree when word comes from inside that the execution is over more prayers are offered then the candles are extinguished and the hymnbooks are put away hugs are exchanged farewells given see you at the next execution when ron williamson arrived at mcalester on april the h unit was being discussed but not yet being built prison officials wanted a brandnew death row to house their growing inventory of capital inmates but the legislature wouldnt spend the money ron was taken instead to f cellhouse home to eightyone other condemned men f cellhouse or the row as it was commonly called comprised the bottom two floors of a wing of the old prison house or big house a mammoth fourstory building constructed in and finally abandoned fifty years later decades of overcrowding violence lawsuits and riots led to its inevitable closing in the vast empty and decaying big house only f cellhouse was used and its sole purpose was to house condemned men in a lockdown environment ron was processed at f cellhouse he was given two pairs of khakis two blue shortsleeve shirts two white tshirts two pairs of white socks and two pairs of white boxer shorts all the clothing had been well used it was clean but with permanent stains especially the boxers the shoes were black leather work shoes also used he was also given a pillow blanket toilet paper toothbrush and toothpaste during his very brief orientation it was explained that he could purchase other toiletries along with food and soft drinks and a few other items at the prison commissary better known as the canteen a place he was not allowed to visit any money he received from the outside world would go into his account from which he could purchase his canteen a mans canteen was his private little stockpile of goodies something he protected fiercely in his cell when he had changed into his prison clothes and completed the processing he was led to the wing or run where he would spend the next several years waiting for the state to execute him his hands and ankles were cuffed as he clutched his pillow blanket extra clothes and other items the guards opened the huge barred door and the parade began above his head painted in large black letters was his address death row the run was a hundred feet long and only twelve feet wide with cells packed together on both sides the ceiling was eight feet high walking very slowly ron and his two guards proceeded down the run it was a ritual a brief welcoming ceremony his neighbors knew he was coming and the catcalling began new man on the run new meat hey baby arms hung through the bars of the cell doors almost within reaching distance white arms black arms brown ones lots of tattoos on the arms act tough ron told himself dont show fear they kicked the doors yelled called him names threw out sexual threats always act tough hed seen prisons before and hed just survived eleven months in the pontotoc county jail nothing could be worse he thought they stopped at cell and the noise went away welcome to the row a guard unlocked the door and ron entered his new home theres an old saying in oklahoma that refers to someone incarcerated at mcalester hes doing time at big mac ron stretched out on his narrow bunk closed his eyes and couldnt believe that he was locked away at big mac the cell was furnished with a set of metalframed bunk beds a metal desk with a metal stool that was mounted into the concrete a stainlesssteel toiletsink combo a mirror a set of metal bookcases and one lightbulb it was sixteen feet long seven feet wide eight feet high the floor was covered with black and white linoleum tiles the brick walls were white and had been painted so many times they were smooth thank god there was a window he thought and though it provided no view it did let in light there were no windows in the ada jail he walked to his door which was nothing but a set of bars with an opening known as the bean hole for food trays and small packages he looked into the run and could see three menthe one directly across from him in cell and the ones on each side of him ron did not speak nor did they most new inmates usually said little during the first days the shock of arriving at a place where they were to live for a few years before being killed was overwhelming fear was everywhere fear of the future fear of never again seeing what had been lost fear of not surviving fear of getting knifed or raped by one of the coldblooded killers you could hear breathing just a few feet away he made his bed and arranged his things he appreciated the privacymost death row inmates were singlecelled but had the option of a cell mate there was a constant racket in the runchatter among the inmates guards laughing a loud television a radio someone yelling to a friend far down the hall ron stayed away from his door as far from the noise as possible he slept read books and smoked everybody smoked on the row and the smell of old and new tobacco hung over the run like a thick pungent fog there was some ventilation but it was too old to work the windows of course could not be opened even though they were covered with thick bars the drudgery hit hard there was no daily schedule no activities to look forward to one brief hour outside sometimes the tedium was numbing for men locked up twentythree hours a day and with very little to do the undisputed highlight was eating three times a day food trays were wheeled along the run and slid through the bean holes all meals were taken in the cell alone breakfast was at seven and it was usually scrambled eggs and grits some bacon on most days and two or three pieces of toast the coffee was cold and weak but treasured nonetheless lunch was sandwiches and beans dinner was the worst mealsome vile mystery meat with halfcooked vegetables the portions were ridiculously small and the food was always cold it was cooked in another building and pushed over on carts at a very slow pace who cared they were dead men anyway the food was dreadful but mealtime was important annette and renee sent money and ron bought food cigarettes toiletries and soft drinks from the canteen he filled out an order form that listed the few items available then handed it to the most important man on the row the run man was a prisoner who had found favor with the guards and was allowed to spend most of his time out of his cell running errands for the other inmates he passed along gossip and notes picked up and delivered laundry and canteen goods gave advice occasionally sold drugs the exercise yard was sacred grounda fenced area the size of two basketball courts next to f cellhouse for an hour a day five days a week each inmate was allowed into the yard to get some sun visit with fellow prisoners and play basketball or cards or dominoes the groups were small usually five or six at a time and tightly controlled by the inmates themselves friends and only friends went into the yard together a new inmate had to be invited before he could feel safe there were fights and beatings and the guards watched the yard closely for the first month ron preferred to go out by himself the row was full of killers and he had no business being there the only other contact point for prisoners was in the shower they were allowed three per week fifteen minutes max and only two men at a time if an inmate didnt want or didnt trust a shower partner then he was allowed to bathe alone ron showered by himself there was plenty of hot and cold water but it didnt mix it was either scalding or freezing two other casualties of the pontotoc county judicial system were on the row when ron arrived though he didnt know it at first tommy ward and karl fontenot had been waiting there for almost three years as their appeals were grinding through the courts the run man handed ron a note or a kite an unauthorized message that the guards generally ignored it was from tommy ward saying hello and wishing him well ron sent one back and asked for some cigarettes though he felt sorry for tommy and karl he was relieved to know that not everyone on the row was a butcher he had always believed they were innocent and had thought about them often during his ordeal tommy had spent time with ron in the jail in ada and knew he was emotionally unstable the guards and other inmates there had taunted both of them years earlier in the middle of the night a voice called out from a dark end of the hall tommy this is denice haraway please tell them where my body is he heard the police whispering and other inmates suppressing laughter tommy ignored the head games and they finally left him alone ron could not ron why did you kill debbie carter a haunting voice would echo through the ada jail ron would bolt from his bed and begin screaming on death row tommy battled with his sanity every day the horror of the place was bad enough for real murderers but for an innocent man it was literally maddening he feared for rons wellbeing from the moment he arrived one of the guards on the row knew the details of the carter murder not long after ron arrived tommy heard a guard call out ron this is debbie carter why did you kill me ron who was quiet at first began yelling and protesting his innocence the guards enjoyed his reaction and the taunting began the other inmates were also amused and often joined the fun a few days after ron arrived tommy was suddenly pulled from his cell and draped with chains and cuffs by several gruff and heavy guards this was something serious though he had no idea where he was headed they never tell you they marched him away a skinny little boy surrounded by enough security to protect the president where are we going he asked but the answer was much too important to reveal he shuffled down the run out of f cellhouse through the domelike rotunda of the big house empty except for the pigeons and into a conference room in the administration building the warden was waiting and he had bad news they kept him shackled and placed in the hot seat at the end of a long conference table that was jampacked with assistants and clerks and secretaries and anyone else who wanted to participate in the macabre announcement the guards stood stonefaced and sentrylike behind him ready just in case he tried to bolt somewhere when given the news everyone around the table was holding a pen and ready to record what was about to happen the warden spoke gravely the bad news was that he had not received a stay of execution so tommys time had come yes it did seem rather earlyhis appeals were not yet three years old but sometimes these things happen the warden was very sorry but just doing his job the big day was two weeks away tommy breathed hard and tried to absorb this he had lawyers working on his appeals which as hed been told many times would take years to complete there was a good chance of a new trial back in ada it was oklahoma had not pulled off an execution in more than twenty years perhaps they were a bit rusty and didnt know what they were doing the warden continued they would begin making preparations immediately one important item was what to do with the body the body thought tommy my body the clerks and assistants and secretaries all frowned at their notepads and scribbled the same words why are all these people in here tommy asked himself just send me to my mother i guess tommy said or tried to say his knees were weak when he stood the guards seized him again and marched him back to f cellhouse he crawled into his bed and cried not for himself but for his family and especially for his mother two days later he was informed that there had been a mistake some paperwork had been mishandled somewhere along the way a stay was in place and mrs ward would not be collecting her sons body anytime soon such false starts were not unusual several weeks after her brother left ada annette received a letter from the warden she assumed it was correspondence of a routine matter perhaps she was right given the triggerhappy mood at mcalester dear ms hudson it is

sincerely james l saffle warden the letter was dated june less than two months after ronnie arrived at mcalester annette knew that appeals were automatic in capital murder cases perhaps someone should inform the authorities in charge of the executions as unsettling as the letter was she was able to set it aside her brother was innocent and would someday be proven so in a new trial she adamantly believed this and would never waiver she read her bible prayed continually and met often with her pastor still she had to ask herself what kind of people were running the prison over at mcalester after a week or so on the row ron walked to his door one day and said hello to the man in cell directly across the hall twelve feet way greg wilhoit said hello and they exchanged a few words neither was anxious for a long conversation the next day ron said hello again and they chatted briefly the next day greg mentioned that he was from tulsa ron once lived there with a guy named stan wilkins is he an ironworker greg asked yes he was and greg knew him the coincidence was amusing and broke the ice they talked about old friends and places in tulsa greg was also thirtyfour years old also loved baseball also had two sisters who were supporting him and he was also innocent it was the beginning of a deep friendship that helped them both survive their ordeal greg invited ron to attend chapel a weekly service held off the row and attended by many capital defendants cuffed and shackled the inmates were herded into a small room where they were led in worship by a saintly chaplain named charles story ron and greg seldom missed the services and always sat together greg wilhoit had been at mcalester for nine months he was an ironworker a tough union man with a record of marijuana possessions but nothing violent in greg and his wife kathy separated they had two infant daughters and a lot of problems greg helped kathy move into an apartment and stopped by almost every night to see his girls they were hopeful the marriage could be patched up but both needed some time alone they remained sexually active and faithful neither slept around on june three weeks after the separation a neighbor in kathys apartment building became alarmed at the nonstop crying of the two daughters the neighbor knocked on the door and when there was no answer she called the police inside on the floor downstairs they found kathys body upstairs the two toddlers were in their cribs hungry and frightened kathy had been raped and strangled the time of death was between am and am when the police interviewed greg he said he was at home asleep by himself and thus had no alibi witness he adamantly denied any involvement in his wifes murder and resented the questioning from the police the investigation produced a fingerprint on a phone that had been ripped from the wall and was on the floor near kathy the fingerprint matched neither greg nor his wife the police found pubic hair and most important what appeared to be a bite mark on kathys breast a crime lab expert confirmed that the killer had bitten the breast hard during the attack being the estranged spouse greg was soon the leading suspect though the fingerprint did not match melvin hett with the state crime lab concluded that the pubic hair was not microscopically consistent with gregs sample the police asked greg to submit an impression of his teeth to compare with the bite mark greg did not appreciate being a suspect he was completely innocent and didnt trust the police with the help of his parents he paid and retained a lawyer the police did not appreciate greg hiring a lawyer they obtained a court order requiring him to submit an impression of his teeth he did and heard nothing for five months he was raising his two daughters working fulltime as an ironworker and hoping the police were history when they arrived one day in january with an arrest warrant for firstdegree murder punishable by death his first lawyer though well paid and with a good reputation was far too interested in negotiating a plea bargain greg fired him a month before trial then made the enormous mistake of hiring george briggs a washedup old lawyer at the end of a long colorful career his fee was a bargain and a red flag briggs was from the old school of country lawyers you get your witnesses ill get mine and well show up at the courthouse and have a good fight no pretrial discovery when in doubt just trust your instincts in court and fly by the seat of your pants briggs was also an alcoholic who was addicted to painkillers that he began taking a few years earlier after a motorcycle accident left him partially brain damaged on a good day he reeked of booze but could still go through the motions on a bad day hed been known to snore in the courtroom and urinate on himself and vomit in the judges chambers he was often seen staggering along the hallways of the courthouse greg and his parents became alarmed when briggs drained a few bottles of beer during a lunch his drinking and drug addiction were well known to the trial judge and to the oklahoma state bar association but virtually nothing was done to either stop briggs or help him or protect his clients gregs family located a highly regarded bite expert in kansas but briggs was too busy or too hungover to chat with the man briggs interviewed no witnesses and as far as greg could tell did little preparation the trial was a nightmare the state called two bite experts one of whom had finished dental school less than a year earlier briggs had nothing to rebut their testimony the jury deliberated for two hours and found greg guilty briggs called no mitigating witnesses and the jury deliberated for one hour and set the punishment at death thirty days later greg was taken back to court to receive his sentence of death in cell greg hung newspapers across the bars of his door so no one could see him he convinced himself that he was not on death row but rather in his own little cocoon somewhere else biding his time reading voraciously and watching his small television he spoke to no one but the run man who during his very first chat asked greg if he wanted to buy some marijuana yes he did at first greg did not realize that a few lucky condemned men actually left the row alive occasionally the appeals worked good lawyers got involved judges woke up and miracles happened but no one had informed him of this he was sure he would be put to death and frankly he wanted to get it over with for six months he left his cell only to shower quickly and alone gradually though he made an acquaintance or two and was invited into the yard for an hour of exercise and socializing once he began talking he became instantly disliked greg was a rarity on the row a man who strongly supported the death penalty you do the ultimate crime you pay the ultimate price he argued loudly such opinions were unheard of he also developed the irritating habit of watching david letterman at full volume sleep is cherished on the row and many of the men spend half of each day in another world when youre sleeping youre cheating the system sleep is your time not the states condemned killers do not hesitate to threaten to kill again and greg soon heard the rumor that he was a marked man every death row has at least one boss and several who want to be there are factions vying for control they prey on the weak often demanding payment for the right to live on the row when word filtered to greg that he needed to pay rent he laughed and sent a message back that he would never pay a dime to anyone for living in such a rat hole the row was ruled by soledad the nickname of a killer whod once spent time in the famous prison in california soledad didnt appreciate gregs prodeathpenalty stance and he really didnt like david letterman and since any boss worthy of respect had to be ready to kill greg became the target everyone has enemies on the row the feuds are nasty and arise quickly over anything a pack of cigarettes can provoke an attack in the yard or the shower two packs can get you killed greg needed a friend to watch his back annettes first visit to mcalester was sad and frightening not that she was expecting anything else she preferred not to go but ronnie had no one but his sisters the guards patted her down and checked her purse moving through the layers of the big house was like sinking into the dark belly of a beast doors clanged keys rattled guards glared as if she had no business there she was numb sleepwalking with a hard knot in her stomach and a racing pulse they were from a nice family in a nice house on a shady street church on sundays a thousand baseball games when ronnie was a boy how had it all come to this this will become a habit she admitted to herself she would hear the same sounds and see the same guards many times in the future she asked if she could bring stuff cookies clothes cash no came the quick answer only small change so she handed the guard a handful of quarters and hoped he passed them on to ronnie the visitation room was long and narrow and split down the center with thick sheets of plexiglas that were divided by partitions to allow some measure of privacy all conversations were by phone through a window no touching whatsoever ronnie eventually showed up no one was in a hurry at the prison he looked healthy maybe even a bit chubby but then his weight had always gone up and down dramatically he thanked her for coming said he was surviving okay but needed money the food was awful and he wanted to buy something to eat at the canteen he also was desperate for a guitar and some books and magazines and a small television which could be purchased through the canteen get me out of here annette he pleaded over and over i didnt kill debbie carter and you know it she had never wavered in her belief that he was innocent though some family members now had doubts she and her husband marlon were both working and raising a family and trying to save a little money was tight what was she supposed to do the statefunded indigent lawyers were getting themselves organized for his appeals sell your house and hire a big lawyer he said sell everything do anything just get me out the conversation was tense and there were tears another inmate arrived for a visit in the booth next to ronnie annette could barely see him through the glass but she was intrigued by who he was and whom he had killed roger dale stafford ronnie told her the famous steakhouse murderer he had nine death sentences the current record on the row he executed six people including five teenagers in the rear of a steak house in oklahoma city in a bungled robbery then murdered a family of three theyre all killers ronnie kept saying and all they talk about is killing its everywhere on the row get me out did he feel safe she asked hell no not living with a bunch of killers he had always believed in the death penalty but now he was a diehard supporter of it he kept such opinions quiet though in his new neighborhood there were no time limits on the visits they eventually said goodbye with sincere promises to write and call annette was emotionally drained when she left mcalester the calls started immediately on the row they put a phone on a cart and rolled it to the cells a guard punched the numbers then handed the receiver through the cell door since all calls were collect the guardsreally didnt care how often they were made out of boredom and desperation ron was soon yelling for the cart more than anyone else he usually began by demanding money or so he could eat and buy cigarettes annette and renee each tried to send a month but they had their own expenses and little extra money they never sent enough and ronnie reminded them of this over and over he was often angry claiming that they didnt love him or they would get him out he was innocent everybody knew it and there was no one on the outside to free him but his sisters the calls were rarely pleasant though they tried not to fight with him ron usually managed at some point to remind his sisters how much he loved them annettes husband sent subscriptions to national geographic and the ada evening news ronnie wanted to monitor things back home not long after his arrival at mcalester he heard for the first time about the bizarre confession of ricky joe simmons barney knew about the taped confession but chose not to use it at trial and didnt tell his client an investigator with the indigent defense system took the video of the confession to mcalester and showed it to ron he went ballistic someone else admitted killing debbie carter and the jury never knew about it surely this news would soon break in ada and he wanted to read about it in the local paper ricky joe simmons became another obsession perhaps the principal one and ron would fixate on him for many years ron tried to call everybody he wanted the world to know about ricky joe simmons his confession was rons ticket out and he wanted someone to step forward and bring the boy to trial he called barney other lawyers county officials even old friends but most refused to accept the collect charges rules were changed and phone privileges were restricted after a couple of death row inmates were caught making calls to the families of their victims just for the sport of it on the average two calls per week were allowed and every phone number had to be preapproved once a week the run man pushed a cart of wellused paperback library books through f cellhouse greg wilhoit read everything that was availablebiographies mysteries westerns stephen king was a favorite but he really loved the books of john steinbeck he encouraged ron to read as an escape and they were soon debating the merits of the grapes of wrath and east ofeden unusual conversations on the row they stood for hours leaning through the bars of their doors talking and talking books baseball women their trials both were surprised to learn that most death row inmates do not maintain their innocence instead they tend to embellish their crimes when talking among themselves death was a constant topicmurders murder trials murders yet to be committed when ron continued to claim he was innocent greg began to believe him every inmate has his trial transcript close by and greg read ronsall two thousand pages he was shocked by the trial in ada ron read gregs transcript and was equally shocked by his trial in osage county they believed each other and ignored the skepticism from their neighbors in his early weeks on the row the friendship was therapeutic for ron someone finally believed him someone he could talk to for hours someone who would listen with an intelligent and sympathetic ear away from the cavelike cell in ada and able to unload on a friend his behavior was stable he didnt rant and pace and scream his innocence the mood swings were not as dramatic he slept a lot read for hours chainsmoked and talked to greg they went to the exercise yard together each watching the others back annette sent more money and ron purchased a small television from the canteen she knew how important a guitar was to ronnie and she relentlessly went about trying to get one the canteen didnt stock them after phone calls and letters she convinced the officials to allow a local music store in mcalester to sell one and send it over trouble started when it arrived anxious to impress the others with his talent ron played it loudly and sang at full volume the complaints came with a fury but ron didnt care he loved his guitar and he loved to sing especially hank williams your cheatin heart echoed up and down the run the others shouted obscenities he shouted them right back then soledad got fed up with rons music and threatened to kill him who cares ron said ive already got my death sentence no effort was made to aircondition f cellhouse and when summer arrived it baked like a sauna the inmates stripped to their boxers and huddled in front of the small fans sold at the canteen it was not unusual to wake up before dawn with the sheets soaked with sweat a few spent the days completely nude for some reason the prison conducted tours of death row the tourists were usually high school students whose parents and advisers were hoping to scare them away from crime when the weather was hot the guards ordered the inmates to get dressed a tour was coming through some complied others did not an indian nicknamed buck naked preferred the native look and was perpetually nude he had the rare ability to pass gas on demand and when the tour groups drew near his favorite trick was to press his rear cheeks against the bars of his door and discharge a thunderous blast of flatulence this shocked the young students and disrupted their tours the guards told him to stop he refused his colleagues egged him on but only during tours the guards finally hauled him away when visitors arrived several others tried imitations but lacked the talent ron just played and sang for the tourists on july ron awoke in a foul mood and never recovered it was independence day a time for celebrations and parades and such and he was locked away in a hellhole for a crime he did not commit where was his independence he began yelling and cursing and proclaiming his innocence and when this prompted catcalls up and down the run he went crazy he began throwing everything he could findbooks magazines toiletries his small radio his bible clothes the guards watched and told him to setde down he cursed them and got louder pencils papers food from the canteen then he grabbed his television and slammed it into the brick wall shattering it finally he took his cherished guitar and slammed it repeatedly into the bars of his cell door most death row inmates took a daily dose of a benign antidepressant called sinequan it was supposed to calm nerves and help with sleep the guards finally convinced ron to take something stronger and he became drowsy and quiet later in the day he began cleaning up his cell then he called annette and in tears told her about the episode she visited him later and things were not pleasant he shouted into the phone accused her of not trying to free him and again demanded that she sell everything and hire a bigtime lawyer who could fix this injustice she asked him to settle down stop yelling and when he didnt she threatened to leave over time she and renee replaced the television radio and guitar in september a lawyer from norman by the name of mark barrett drove to mcalester to meet his new client mark was one of four lawyers who handled the appeals for indigent defendants in capital cases the williamson case had been assigned to him barney ward was out of the picture appeals are automatic in capital cases the necessary notices had been filed the slow process was under way mark explained this to ron williamson and listened to his lengthy proclamations of innocence he was not surprised to hear such talk and he had not yet studied the transcript of the trial to assist his new lawyer ron handed over a list of all the witnesses who had lied at his trial then in minute detail described to mark barrett the nature and extent of their lies mark found ron to be intelligent rational clearly aware of his predicament and surroundings he was articulate and spoke at length and in great detail about the lies the police and prosecution had used against him he was a little panicky but that was to be expected mark had no idea of rons medical history marks father was a minister in the disciples of christ denomination and this bit of background prompted ron into a long discussion about religion he wanted mark to know that he was a devout christian had been raised in the church by godfearing parents and read his bible often he quoted many verses of scripture and mark was impressed one in particular was troubling him and he asked mark for his interpretation they discussed it thoroughly it was important for ron to understand the verse and he was clearly frustrated by his inability to grasp its meaning attorney visits had no time limits and the clients were anxious to stay out of their cells they talked for over an hour mark barretts first impression was that ron was a fundamentalist an easy talker perhaps a bit too slick as always he was skeptical of his clients claims of innocence though his mind was far from closed he was also handling the appeals for greg wilhoit and he was thoroughly convinced greg did not kill his wife mark knew there were innocent men on death row and the more he learned about rons case the more he believed him chapter though dennis fritz didnt realize it twelve months in the dungeon of the county jail had helped prepare him for the severe conditions of prison life he arrived at the conner correctional center in june in the rear of a van loaded with other new inmates still dazed and in denial and terrified it was important to look and act confident and he worked hard at it conner had the reputation as the dump site of medium security prisons it was a tough place tougher than most and dennis asked himself over and over how and why he had been randomly assigned to the place he was herded through the admissions procedures and given the standard lectures about rules and regulations then assigned to a twoman cell with bunk beds and a window through which he could see the outdoors like ron he was thankful for the window hed gone for weeks in ada without seeing sunshine his roommate was a mexican who spoke little english and that was fine with dennis he spoke no spanish and wasnt in the mood to learn the first overwhelming challenge was how to find brief moments of privacy with another human always within arms reach dennis vowed to spend every possible moment working to free himself from his sentence it would have been easy to give up the system was so heavily weighted against the inmates but he was determined to prevail conner was overcrowded and known for its violence there were gangs killings beatings rapes drugs everywhere and guards on the take he quickly found the safer areas and avoided men he thought were trouble he treated fear as an asset after a few months most prisoners unwittingly fell into the routine of the prison and became institutionalized they lowered their guard took chances took safety for granted it was a good way to get hurt and dennis vowed that he would never forget to be afraid the prisoners were awake by am and all cell doors were opened they ate in a large cafeteria and could sit anywhere they wished the whites took one side the blacks the other and the indians and hispanics were caught in the middle but leaned toward the darker section the food for breakfast was not badeggs grits bacon conversation was livelythe men were relieved to have contact with others most wanted to work anything to stay out of the unit where the cells were because dennis had once taught he was recruited to teach other inmates in the general equivalency diploma program after breakfast he went to the classroom and taught until noon his salary was a month his mother and aunt began sending a month money they barely scraped together but made a priority he spent it in the canteen on tobacco canned tuna crackers and cookies virtually every inmate smoked and the great currency was cigarettes a pack of marlboros was like a pocketful of cash dennis soon found the law library and was pleased to learn that he could study there every day from pm to pm without interruption he had never picked up a law book but he was determined to master the research a couple of the law clerks other inmates who fancied themselves jailhouse lawyers and were quite knowledgeable befriended him and taught him how to move through the thick treatises and digests as always they charged for their advice the fees were paid in cigarettes he began his legal education by reading hundreds of oklahoma cases looking for similarities and potential mistakes made during his trial his appeals would soon start and he wanted to know as much as his lawyer he discovered the federal digests and took notes on thousands of cases from throughout the country lockdown was from pm to pm heads were counted reports made dinner was over at and from then until the next lockdown at the inmates were free to roam around the unit exercise play cards or dominoes or basketball many chose to just hang out to sit in groups and talk and smoke and kill time dennis went back to the law library his daughter elizabeth was fifteen and they maintained a lively correspondence she was being raised by her maternal grandmother in a stable home with plenty of attention she believed her father to be innocent but dennis always suspected she had some doubt they swapped letters and talked on the phone at least once a week dennis would not allow her to visit him though he did not want his daughter near the prison she would not see him dressed like a convict and living behind razor wire wanda fritz his mother traveled to conner soon after dennis arrived visitation was on sunday from am to pm in a room with rows of folding tables and chairs it was a zoo twenty or so inmates were admitted at once and their families were waitingwives children mothers and fathers emotions were high the children were often rowdy and loud the men were not handcuffed and contact was allowed contact was exactly what the men wanted though excessive kissing and groping were prohibited the trick was to get a fellow inmate to jigger or sidetrack a guard for a few seconds while rabid sex was accomplished it was not unusual to see a couple slide between two soft drink machines and somehow copulate wives sitting placidly at a table often disappeared quickly ducking under the table for a quick round of oral sex fortunately dennis was able to hold his mothers attention in the midst of such frenzied activity but the visit was the most stressful time of the week he discouraged her from returning ron soon began pacing and yelling in his cell if you werent crazy when you got to the row it didnt take long to lose your mind after you arrived he stood at his door and screamed i am innocent i am innocent for hours until he became hoarse with practice though his voice strengthened and he could shout for longer periods of time i did not kill debbie carter i did not kill debbie carter he memorized the entire transcript of the ricky joe simmons confession every word and delivered it at full volume for the benefit of his guards and neighbors he could also go for hours reciting his trial transcript pages and pages of the testimony that had sent him to death row the other inmates wanted to choke him but at the same time they marveled at his memory but they were not impressed at two in the morning renee received a strange letter from another inmate it read in part dear renee praise the lord this is jay neill i am writing this on behalf and at the request of your brother ron ron lives caddycorner to my cell at times ron goes through very difficult stages on a daily basis i am under the impression that he is on some form of medication to attempt to stabilize and modify his behavior at best though the limitation of the types of medication they will distribute here only works in a marginal capacity at best rons biggest defeat is his low selfesteem and i believe the people here at osp tell him he is below par in an iq scale his worst times come between am and am at times spaced periodically he screams different things at the top of his lungs this has disturbed many convicts in the vicinity at first they tried to reason with him then to tolerate but even that has worn thin with many around him due to the sleepless nights for sure i am a christian and i pray daily for ron i talk to him and listen to him he loves both you and annette very much i am his friend i have acted in the capacity of a buffer between ron and the people his yelling bothers by getting up and talking to him until he is calm god bless you and your family sincerely jay neill neills friendship with anyone on the row was always doubtful and his conversion to christianity was often the topic of conversation his friends were skeptical before prison he and his boyfriend longed to move to san francisco to enjoy a more open lifestyle since they had no money they decided to rob a bank an undertaking with which they had no experience they picked one in the town of geronimo and after they entered it loudly and announced their intentions things fell apart in the chaos of the robbery neill and his partner fatally stabbed three bank tellers shot one customer to death and wounded three others in the midst of the bloodbath neill ran out of bullets something he realized as he put his revolver to the head of a small child and pulled the trigger nothing happenedthe child was unharmed at least physically the two killers escaped with about in cash and were soon in san francisco where they went on a shopping spreefulllength mink coats lovely scarves and such they threw money around in gay bars and had a decadent time for slightly more than twentyfour hours then they were hauled back to oklahoma where neill was eventually executed on the row neill liked to quote scripture and deliver minisermons but few listened on death row medical attention was not a priority every inmate said that the first thing you lose is your health then your sanity ron was seen by a prison doctor who had the benefit of his previous prison records and mental health history it was noted that he had a long history of drug and alcohol abuse certainly not a surprise on f cellhouse he suffered from depression and had been bipolar for at least ten years there was some schizophrenia and personality disorder he was prescribed mellaril again and it settled him down most of the other inmates thought ron was simply playing the nut role pretending to be crazy in hopes of somehow walking away from the row two doors down from greg wilhoit lived an old inmate named sonny hays no one was certain how long sonny had been waiting but he had arrived there before anyone else he was pushing seventy in terrible health and refused to see or speak to anyone he covered his cell door with newspapers and blankets kept his lights off ate only enough to stay alive never showered shaved or cut his hair never had visitors and refused to meet with his lawyers he neither sent nor received mail made no phone calls bought nothing from the canteen ignored his laundry and had no television or radio he never left his dark little dungeon and days could pass with no sound from within sonny was completely insane and since a mentally incompetent person cannot be executed he was simply rotting away and dying on his own terms now there was a new crazy man on the row though ron had a hard time convincing others he was just playing the nut role one episode though got their attention ron managed to clog his toilet and flood his cell with two inches of water he stripped naked and began doing belly flops into the pool from his top bunk yelling incoherently as he did so the guards finally managed to secure and sedate him although there was no airconditioning on f cellhouse there was a heating system and winter brought the reasonable expectation of having warm air pumped through the ancient vents it didnt happen the cells were frigid ice often formed on the inside of the windows during the night and the heavily bundled inmates stayed in bed as long as possible the only way to sleep was to layer on all available clothingboth sets of socks boxers tshirts khakis work shirts and anything else a prisoner might be able to afford from the canteen extra blankets were luxuries and were not furnished by the state the food which was cold in the summertime was barely edible in winter the convictions of tommy ward and karl fontenot were reversed by the oklahoma court of criminal appeals because their confessions were used against each other at trial and since neither testified each was denied the right to confront the other had separate trials been given the constitutional problems would have been avoided had the confessions been suppressed of course there would have been no convictions they were taken off the row and sent back to ada tommy was retried in the town of shawnee in pottawatomie county with bill peterson and chris ross prosecuting once again and with the judge permitting the jury to see the taped confession tommy was again found guilty and rewarded with another death sentence during his retrial his mother was driven to the courthouse each day by annette hudson karl was retried in the town of holdenville in hughes county he too was found guilty and given a death sentence ron was ecstatic at their reversals then dismayed at their subsequent convictions his own direct appeal was slowly inching through the system his case had been reassigned within the appellate public defenders office due to the increasing number of capital cases more lawyers were hired mark barrett was overworked and needed to unload a case or two he was also anxiously awaiting a ruling from the court of criminal appeals in greg wilhoits case that court was notoriously tough on defendants but mark was convinced greg would get a new trial rons new lawyer was bill luker and his brief argued vigorously that ron had not received a fair trial he attacked the representation of barney ward and claimed ron had received ineffective assistance of counsel usually the first argument in a capital case chief among barneys sins was his failure to raise the issue of rons mental incompetence none of his medical records were in evidence luker researched barneys mistakes and the list became long he assailed the methods and tactics of the police and the prosecutor and his brief grew lengthy he also challenged the rulings of judge jones allowing rons dream confession to be heard by the jury ignoring the numerous brady violations by the prosecution and in general failing to protect rons right to a fair trial the vast majority of bill lukers clients were clearly guilty his job was to make sure they received a fair hearing on appeal rons case was different though the more he researched and the more questions he asked the more luker became convinced that it was an appeal he could win ron was a very cooperative client with strong views that he was ready to share with his lawyer he called frequently and wrote rambling letters his comments and observations were generally helpful at times his recall of the details of his medical history was astounding he dwelled on the confession of ricky joe simmons and considered its exclusion from his trial a major travesty he wrote luker dear bill you know i think ricky simmons killed debbie he must have or he wouldnt have confessed to it now bill ive been going through physical hell i think its only fair for simmons to pay for what he did and for me to go free they dont want to release his confession to you because they know youd put it in my brief and immediately win me a new trial so for god sakes tell them son of a bitches you want his confession your friend ron with plenty of free time ron developed an active correspondence especially with his sisters they knew how important the letters were and they found time to write back money was usually an issue he was unable to eat the prison food and preferred to buy whatever he could from the canteen he wrote to renee and said in part renee i know annette sends me a little money but my misery is increasing ive got karl fontenot here and he doesnt have anyone sending him anything could you please send me a little extra even if its love ronnie just before his first christmas on the row he wrote renee and said in part renee hey thanks for sending the money itll go for specific needs mainly guitar strings and coffee i got christmas cards this year including yours christmas can give some good feelings renee the really came at a good time i had just borrowed some money to buy some guitar strings from a friend of mine and i was going to pay him back out of the a month annette sends that would have cut me a little short i know may sound like a lot but ive been giving sharing with a guy here whose mother cant afford to send anything she did send him but thats the first money hes received since sept when i moved near him i give him coffee cigarettes etc poor fellow todays friday so you all will be opening gifts tomorrow i hope everybody gets what they need kids sure grow up fast im gonna start crying if i dont get myself together tell everybody i love them ronnie it was difficult to think of ronnie having good feelings during the holidays the tedium of death row was horrible enough but to be cut off from his family brought a level of pain and desperation he could not handle early in the spring of he began slipping badly the pressure the drudgery the sheer frustration of being sent to hell for a crime he did not commit consumed him and he fell apart he began cutting his wrists and attempting suicide he was very depressed and wanted to die the wounds were superficial but left scars there were several episodes of this and he was watched closely by the guards when the wrist cutting didnt work he managed to start a fire with his mattress and let it drip over his extremities the burns were treated and eventually healed more than once he was put on a suicide watch on july he wrote to renee dear renee im going through so much suffering ive burned some tissue and got several second and third degree burns the pressure here is immense never getting to go anywhere when the suffering is intolerable renee ive had headaches ive banged into the concrete ive gotten down on the floor and banged my head against the concrete ive hit myself in the face til i was so sore the next day from the punches everybody here is stuck here like sardines i know for a fact this is the most suffering ive ever had to endure the magic to the problem and its solution is money im talking about never having anything to eat thats worth a shit this food is like living on krations on some damn godforbidden island people here are poor but ive been so hungry that ive had to ask for a morsel to stop the craving ive lost weight theres so much suffering here please help me ron in one prolonged depressive bout ron stopped communication with everyone and withdrew completely until the guards found him curled into a fetal position on his bed he would respond to nothing then on september ron cut his wrists again he was taking his medications sporadically was talking nonstop about suicide and was finally deemed to be a threat to himself he was moved out of f cellhouse and transferred to eastern state hospital in vinita upon his admission his chief complaint was i have suffered unjustified abuse at eastern state he was first seen by a staff physician a dr lizarraga who saw a thirtysix yearold with a history of drugs and alcohol unkempt unshaven with long graying hair and a mustache in shabby prison dress with burn marks on his legs and scars on his arms scars he made sure the doctor noticed he freely admitted many of his misdeeds but adamantly denied killing debbie carter the injustice from which he was suffering had caused him to lose hope and want to die for the next three months ron was a patient at eastern state his medication was stabilized he was seen by various doctorsaneurologist a psychologist several psychiatrists it was noted more than once that he was unstable emotionally had a low tolerance for frustration was selfcentered with low selfesteem was detached at times and had a tendency to explode quickly the mood swings were wild and remarkable he was demanding and over time became aggressive with the staff and other patients this aggression could not be tolerated and ron was discharged and sent back to death row dr lizarraga prescribed lithium carbonate navane and cogentin a drug used primarily to treat symptoms of parkinsons disease but sometimes used to reduce shakiness and restlessness caused by tranquilizers back at big mac a prison guard by the name of savage was brutally attacked by mikell patrick smith a death row inmate generally regarded as the most dangerous killer in the prison smith rigged a knife or a shank to the end of a broom handle and thrust it through the bean hole as the guard was serving him lunch the shank went into his chest and heart but officer savage miraculously survived two years earlier smith had stabbed a fellow inmate the attack occurred not on death row but on d cellhouse where smith was being held for disciplinary reasons nonetheless the prison officials decided that a new stateoftheart death row facility was required the attack was well publicized and prompted funding for the new unit plans were drawn up for h unit which from the outset was designed to maximize security and control while providing inmates and staff with a safe modern environment in which to live and work it would have two hundred cells on two floors running along four quads from the beginning the design of h unit was driven by the prison staff in the tense atmosphere following the attack on officer savage the staff was given enormous input into the creation of a noncontact facility early in the design phase thirtyfive prison employees met with the tulsa architects hired by the department of corrections though no death row inmate had ever escaped from mcalester the designers of h unit adopted the dramatic plan of putting the entire unit underground after two years on death row rons mental health was seriously deteriorating his noiseyelling screaming cursing at all hours of the day and nightgrew worse his behavior grew even more desperate his temper would explode over nothing and he would launch into a fit of cursing and throwing things in another fit he would spit for hours into the hall he once spat on a guard but when he began throwing his feces through the bars it was time to take him away hes slingin shit again a guard yelled and everybody ducked for cover when things were clear they rushed him and hauled him away back to vinita for another round of evaluation he spent a month at eastern state in july and august he was again seen by dr lizarraga who diagnosed the same problems as before after three weeks ron began demanding to be returned to death row he was concerned about his appeal and felt that he could work on it better at mcalester where at least they had a law library his medications had been adjusted he seemed to be stabilized and so he was sent back chapter after thirteen years of frustration oklahoma finally managed to untangle the appeals process and schedule an execution the unlucky inmate was charles troy coleman a white man whod killed three people and had been on death row for eleven years he was the leader of a small faction that was usually stirring up trouble on the row and many of his neighbors were not upset by the prospect of chuck finally getting the needle most of the men though knew that when the killings finally started there would be no turning back the coleman execution was a media event and the press converged outside big mac there were candlelight vigils and interviews with victims protesters ministers anyone who happened to walk by as the hours passed the excitement increased greg wilhoit and coleman had become friends though they argued bitterly over the death penalty ron was still in favor of it though he swayed back and forth he was not fond of coleman who not surprisingly had become frustrated with rons noisy presence the row was quiet and heavily secured the night coleman was executed the circus was outside the prison where the press counted down the minutes as if a new year were approaching greg was in his cell watching it all on television just after midnight the news arrived charles troy coleman was dead several inmates clapped and cheered most sat quietly in their cells some were in prayer gregs reaction was completely unexpected he was suddenly overcome with emotion and bitter at those who cheered the news his friend was gone the world was not now a safer place not a single future murderer would be deterred he knew killers and what prompted them to act if the victims family was pleased then they were far from closure greg had been raised in a methodist church and now studied the bible every day didnt jesus teach forgiveness if killing was wrong then why was the state allowed to kill by whose authority was the execution carried out hed been hit with these arguments before many times but now they resonated from a different source the death of charles coleman was a dramatic revelation for greg at that moment he flipped degrees never to return to his eyeforaneye beliefs later he offered these thoughts to ron who confessed that he shared many of them the next day though ron was an ardent supporter of the death penalty who wanted ricky joe simmons dragged in off the streets of ada and shot on the spot the prosecution of ron williamson was vindicated on may when the oklahoma court of criminal appeals unanimously affirmed his conviction and death sentence the court in an opinion written by judge gary lumpkin found several mistakes with the trial but the overwhelming evidence against the defendant far outweighed any of the trifling errors committed by barney the cops peterson and judge jones the court spent little time discussing exactly what evidence had been so overwhelming bill luker called ron with the bad news and he took it well enough ron had studied the briefs talked to bill many times and been cautioned against optimism on the same date dennis fritz received the same news from the same court again the justices found several mistakes in his trial but were evidently swayed by the overwhelming evidence against dennis he had not been impressed with the brief filed by his appellate lawyer and he was not surprised when his conviction was upheld after three years in the prison library dennis believed that he knew the statutes and cases better than his attorney he was disappointed but did not give up like ron he had other arguments to make in other courts quitting was not an option but unlike ron dennis was now on his own since he was not on death row there were no indigent lawyers available for him but the court of criminal appeals was not always a rubber stamp for the prosecution much to mark barretts delight he received the news on april that a new trial had been ordered for greg wilhoit the court found it impossible to ignore the miserable job done by george briggs in defending greg and ruled that he did not receive adequate representation when youre on trial for your life hire either the best lawyer in town or the worst greg had unwittingly hired the worst and now he had a new trial when an inmate was to be removed from his cell and taken off the row for any reason there was never an explanation guards simply showed up with orders to get dressed quickly greg knew hed won his appeal though and when the guards arrived at his cell door the big day had come pack your stuff one of them said and it was time to leave in a couple of minutes he stuffed his entire collection of assets into one cardboard box then walked away with his escorts ron had been moved to the other end of the run and there was no chance of a farewell as greg left mcalester his thoughts were of the friend he was leaving behind when he arrived at the jail in osage county a bail hearing was quickly arranged by mark barrett with a capital murder charge still pending and a trial date yet to be set greg was not exactly a free man instead of the usual exorbitant bond that was impossible to make the judge set bail at a sum gregs parents and sisters quickly covered after five years in jail four on death row greg was free never to return to a prison cell construction of h unit had begun in virtually everything was made of concretefloors walls ceilings bunks bookshelves to eliminate the chance of shanks being produced no metal was included in the plans there were plenty of bars and some glass but not in the cells everything there was concrete when the structure was complete it was covered with dirt energy efficiency was the official reason natural light and ventilation were extinguished when h unit opened in november the prison celebrated its new stateoftheart death house by throwing a party big shots were invited ribbons were cut the prison band was forced to play a few tunes tours were giventhe future inhabitants were still over in the big house a quarter of a mile away guests were given the opportunity to pay to sleep one night on a brandnew concrete bunk in the cell of their choice after the party and to work out the kinks some medium security prisoners were moved in first and watched closely to see what mischief they could create when h unit proved sturdy functional and escapeproof it was time to send in the bad boys from f cellhouse the complaining and bitching started immediately there were no windows no chance of outside light no hope of fresh air doublecelling was implemented and the cells were too small for two men the concrete bunks were too hard and only thirtysix inches apart a stainlesssteel toiletsink was wedged between them so that a bowel movement was a shared event the layout of the pods was such that most of the daily chatterthe lifeblood for the prisonerswas cut off as a noncontact facility h unit was designed not only to keep the guards away from inmates but to isolate the prisoners themselves the food was worse than on f cellhouse the yard the most cherished area at the old place was nothing but a concrete box much smaller than a tennis court its walls were eighteen feet tall and the entire area was covered with a thick grate that blocked out whatever light could penetrate the sun dome it was impossible to see green grass the new concrete had not been sealed or painted concrete dust was everywhere it piled up in the corners of the cells it clung to the walls settled on the floors hung in the air and of course was inhaled by the inmates attorneys visiting their clients often left coughing and rasping because of the dust the stateoftheart ventilation system was closed meaning there was no outside circulation at all this was tolerable until the power went out which happened often while the bugs were being worked out of the system leslie delk an indigent defense lawyer assigned to ron williamson discussed the problems in a letter to a colleague who had sued the prison the food situation is horrible and almost every client i have has lost weight one client has lost pounds in months i have communicated this with the prison but of course they tell me he is fine etc one thing discovered on a recent trip to the infirmary was that the food is brought over from the old prison where it is prepared behind the walls when it arrives at hunit there are inmatesshock incarceration guys i thinkthat serve it up these guys are told that they can have whatever is left so the portions the death row inmates are now receiving are about half of what the rest of the prison receives it is my understanding that there is little or no doc supervision of the food as it is put on the trays for the death row guys all my clients have complained that the food is always cold now and that it is so poorly prepared that the men are sick from it and the quantities are so low that most people are forced to purchase food from the canteen so they can get enough to eat this is of course the prison store that charges whatever they want for the foods they offer usually much higher than we could purchase from a grocery store also many of my clients have no family to help support them so they go without h unit was a shock to the inmates after hearing rumors for two years about a new modern million facility they were stunned when they moved into an underground prison with less space and more restrictions than f cellhouse ron hated h unit his roommate was rick rojem a resident of the row since and a calming influence rick was a buddhist who spent hours in meditation and also enjoyed playing the guitar privacy was impossible in their cramped cell they rigged a blanket from the ceiling and between the beds in a lame effort to withdraw into their own worlds rojem was worried about ron he had lost interest in reading his mind and conversation could not stay on one subject he was medicated at times but far from getting proper treatment he would sleep for hours then pace around the tiny cell for an entire night mumbling incoherently or chanting about one of his delusions then he would stand at the door and scream in agony since they were together twentythree hours a day rick was watching his cell mate go insane and he couldnt help him ron lost ninety pounds after moving into h unit his hair turned gray and he looked like a ghost annette was waiting one day in the visitors room when she saw the guards lead a wiry old man with long stringy gray hair and a beard into the room who is that she thought her brother she said when i saw them bring this man with long hair and just a skinny horrible emaciatedlooking man that they brought to visit me that i would not have recognized if i met him on the street i came home and i wrote the warden asking him to have ron checked for aids because he looked so gauntish and knowing the stories you hear about prisons i asked them to check him for aids the warden wrote back and assured her ronnie did not have aids she fired off another letter and complained about the food the high prices in the canteen and the fact that the profits from the canteen went into a fund to help buy exercise equipment for the guards in a psychiatrist named ken foster was hired by the prison and soon met ron williamson he found him to be disheveled disoriented out of touch with reality thin gray frail emaciated in poor physical condition it was obvious to dr foster as it should have been to the prison officials that something was wrong rons mental condition was even worse than his physical his outbursts and explosions were far beyond normal prison clamor and it was no secret among the guards and staff that he had lost contact with reality dr foster witnessed several bouts of the maniacal screaming and noted three general themes that ron was innocent that ricky joe simmons had confessed to the murder and should be prosecuted and that ron was in great physical pain usually in his chest and he was afraid he was about to die though his symptoms were obvious and extreme the records reviewed by dr foster indicated that ron had been receiving no mental health treatment for a long time the denial of medication for a person as sick as ron normally results in the onset of psychotic symptoms dr foster wrote the psychotic reaction and the accompanying deterioration are worsened when a person is under the multiple stresses which accompany being in a death row environment and having the knowledge that you are scheduled to die the gaf scale as set forth in authoritative mental health manuals considers imprisonment a catastrophic stressor it was impossible to speculate how much worse the catastrophe might be for an innocent person dr foster decided ron needed better medications in a better environment ron would always be mentally ill but improvements were possible even for a death row inmate however dr foster soon learned that helping sick and condemned prisoners was a very low priority he spoke to james saffle a regional director with the department of corrections and to dan reynolds the warden at mcalester both were familiar with ron williamson and his problems and both had more important things to worry about ken foster though proved to be a rather stubborn independent sort who disliked bureaucratic decisions and actually wanted to help his patients he kept reporting to saffle and reynolds and made sure they knew the details of rons serious mental and physical problems he insisted on meeting with reynolds at least once a week to review the status of his patients ron was always mentioned and he spoke daily to a deputy warden gave the routine updates and made sure the summaries were passed on to the warden repeatedly dr foster explained to those who ran the prison that ron was not getting the medicines he needed and that he was deteriorating mentally and physically because of inadequate treatment he was especially incensed that ron would not be transferred to the special care unit or scu a building within view of h unit inmates who exhibited serious mental problems were routinely moved into the scu the only facility at mcalester designed for such treatment however the doc had a longstanding policy that denied death row inmates access to the scu the official reason was vague but many capital defense lawyers suspected the policy was in place to help speed along executions if a severely disturbed death row inmate was properly evaluated he might be found to be incompetent thus thwarting a trip to the chamber the policy had been challenged many times but remained intractable ken foster challenged it again he explained repeatedly to saffle and reynolds that he could not adequately treat ron williamson without placing him at the scu where he could monitor his condition and regulate his medication often his explanations were pointed heated and intense but dan reynolds proved stubbornly resistant to the idea of moving ron and saw no need to improve his treatment dont bother with death row inmates reynolds said theyre going to die anyway dr fosters appeals on behalf of ron became so bothersome that warden reynolds locked him out of the prison when the lockout ended dr foster resumed his efforts to move ron to the scu it took four years after his direct appeal was over rons case entered postconviction relief the next stage in which he was allowed to present evidence that was not offered at trial as was the practice at that time bill luker transferred the file to leslie delk with the appellate public defenders office her first priority was obtaining better medical treatment for her client she saw ron once on f cellhouse and realized he was a very sick man after he was transferred to h unit she became alarmed at his eroding condition though delk was not a psychiatrist or psychologist she had received extensive training in the detection and nature of mental illness part of her job as a capital defense attorney was to observe such problems and try to get adequate treatment she relied on the opinions of mental health experts but it was difficult with ron because a proper examination was impossible as part of the noncontact policy at h unit no one could sit in the same room with the prisoner not even his lawyer a psychiatrist trying to examine ron had to do so through a sheet of glass while talking to him on the phone delk arranged for a dr pat fleming to do a psychological evaluation of ron as required in postconviction proceedings dr fleming made three attempts but was unable to complete her assessment her patient was agitated delusional noncooperative and hallucinating the staff informed dr fleming that such behavior was not at all unusual it was obvious that he was a very disturbed man who was in no condition to assist his attorney or function in any meaningful way she was severely restricted in her attempt to evaluate ron because she was not allowed a confidential visit in which she could sit in the same room to question observe and administer tests dr fleming met with the staff physician on h unit and detailed her concerns later she was assured that ron had been seen by mental health professionals from within the prison but she saw no improvement she strongly recommended a commitment to eastern state hospital for an extended period to stabilize ron and properly evaluate him her recommendation was denied leslie delk hammered away at the prison officials she met with the correctional staff the medical staff and the various wardens to lodge her complaints and demand better treatment promises were made then ignored benign efforts were made slight changes in rons medicationsbut he received no significant treatment she documented her frustrations with a series of letters to the prison officials she visited ron as often as possible and when she was certain his condition could not worsen it did leslie worried that he might die at any time while the medical staff struggled to treat ron the correctional staff was having great fun at his expense for amusement some of the prison guards enjoyed playing with the new intercom on h unit each cell had a twoway speaker to the control room yet another smart toy to keep the guards as far away from the inmates as possible but it wasnt far enough ron this is god a haunting voice called into rons cell deep in the night why did you kill debbie carter a pause then the guards would snicker as they heard ron screaming through his door i didnt kill anybody i am innocent his deep raspy voice rattled through the southwest quad and disrupted the quiet the seizure would last an hour or so upsetting the other inmates but greatly humoring the guards when things were quiet the voice returned ron this is debbie carter why did you kill me his tormented screams would go on and on ron this is charlie carter why did you kill my daughter the other inmates begged the guards to stop it but they were having too much fun rick rojem believed that two of the more sadistic guards in particular lived for the fun of mistreating ron the abuse went on for months just ignore them rick pleaded with his cell mate if you ignore them theyll quit ron couldnt grasp this idea he was determined to convince everyone around him that he was innocent and bawling it at the top of his lungs seemed the appropriate way often when he couldnt scream any longer when he was physically spent or too hoarse to continue he would stand with his face close to the speaker and whisper incoherently for hours leslie delk finally heard of the fun and games and fired off a letter on october to the manager of h unit it read in part also i had mentioned to you that i had been hearing from different folks that ron was being harassed through the intercom by certain guards who apparently find it humorous to taunt the crazies and get them to react i am continuing to hear about this problem and most recently heard that officer martin walked up to the door of rons cell and started harassing him and taunting him i believe that the content of these usually revolve around ricky joe simmons and debra sue carter from what i understand officer reading stepped in to get officer martin to quit his behavior but had to repeatedly tell him to quit harassing ron before martin actually stopped i have heard officer martins name from several different sources now as being one of the people who routinely harass ron and so i would like to know if you could investigate this matter and take appropriate action maybe it would be beneficial for you to have some training sessions for your guards who have to deal with those inmates who are mentally ill not all of the guards were cruel a female guard stopped by rons cell late one night for a chat he looked awful and said he was starving said he hadnt eaten for days she believed him she left and returned a few minutes later with a jar of peanut butter and a loaf of stale bread in a letter to renee ron said he enjoyed the feast immensely and there wasnt a crumb left over kim marks was an investigator with the oklahoma indigent defense system who ultimately spent more time on h unit with ron than anyone else when she was first assigned his case she reviewed the trial transcripts reports and exhibits she was a former newspaper reporter and her curiosity drove her to at least question rons guilt she made a list of potential suspects twelve in all and most with criminal backgrounds glen gore was number one for all the obvious reasons he was with debbie the night she was murdered they had known each other for years thus he could gain access to her apartment without force he had a wretched history of violence against women he had pointed the finger at ron why had the cops shown so little interest in gore the deeper kim probed into the police reports and the trial itself the more she became convinced that rons protests were well grounded she visited him many times on h unit and like leslie delk watched him completely unravel she approached each visit with a mix of curiosity and apprehension never had she seen an inmate age as rapidly as ron his dark brown hair was grayer with each visit and he was not yet forty he was gaunt and ghostlike due in no small part to the lack of sunshine his clothes were dirty and fit badly his eyes were hollow and deeply troubled a major part of her job was to determine if the client had mental problems then attempt to find not only adequate treatment but also expert witnesses it was obvious to her and obvious to any layperson that he was mentally ill and suffering greatly from his condition early on she was stiffarmed by the doc policy of keeping death row inmates out of the special care unit like dr foster kim would fight that battle for years she located and reviewed the videotape of rons second polygraph though at that time hed already been diagnosed as depressed and bipolar and perhaps schizophrenic he was coherent under control and able to present himself as a normal person but nine years later there was nothing normal about him he was delusional out of touch with reality and consumed with obsessionsricky joe simmons religion the liars at his trial lack of money debbie carter the law his music the massive lawsuit he would one day file against the state his baseball career the abuses and injustices to which he was being subjected she talked to the staff and heard their reports of his ability to scream for an entire day then she got a good dose of it because of the peculiarities of the layout of h unit the womens restroom had a vent that carried sounds from the southwest quad where ron was housed on a trip to the restroom she was stunned to hear him bellowing like a madman it rattled her and working with leslie she pushed even harder to force the prison to provide better treatment they tried to get an exception to move him to the scu they tried to have him evaluated at eastern state their efforts were futile in june leslie delk as part of the postconviction process filed an application for a hearing to determine mental competency in the district court of pontotoc county bill peterson filed an objection and the court denied the request this denial was immediately appealed to the court of criminal appeals where it was upheld in july she filed an extensive application for postconviction relief her claims were based primarily on the voluminous records of rons mental health and she argued that his lack of competency should have been addressed at trial two months later postconviction relief was denied and leslie appealed again to the oklahoma court of criminal appeals not surprisingly she lost again the next step was a routine and hopeless appeal to the us supreme court a year later it issued a perfunctory denial other routine filings were made more routine denials were entered and when all state remedies were exhausted on august the execution of ron williamson was set by the court of criminal appeals for september he had been on death row for six years and four months after two years of freedom greg wilhoit was dragged back into a courtroom to once again face charges of murdering his wife after he left mcalester he settled in tulsa and tried to reestablish something close to a normal life it was not easy he carried emotional and psychological scars from his ordeal his daughters now eight and nine years old were being raised by some friends from church two schoolteachers and their lives were quite stable his parents and sisters were supportive as always his case had gathered some attention his trial lawyer george briggs had mercifully passed away but not before having his license to practice revoked by the state several prominent criminal lawyers contacted greg and wanted to represent him lawyers are attracted to cameras like ants to a picnic and greg was amused to see so much interest in his case but it was an easy choice his pal mark barrett had won his release and greg was confident he would now win his freedom during his first trial the most damaging evidence was the testimony of the states two bitemark experts both told the jury that the wound on kathy wilhoits breast had been left there by her estranged husband the wilhoit family found a leading bitemark expert dr thomas krauss of kansas dr krauss was stunned at the discrepancies between gregs dental impression and the actual wound the two were drastically different mark barrett then sent the bite mark to eleven nationally renowned experts many of whom usually testified on behalf of the prosecution they included the fbis top bitemark consultant and the expert who testified against ted bundy the verdict was unanimousall twelve bitemark experts concluded that greg wilhoit had to be excluded the comparisons were not even close at an evidentiary hearing an expert for the defense identified twenty major discrepancies between gregs teeth and the bite mark and testified that each one conclusively excluded greg but the prosecutor pushed on and insisted on a trial which quickly became a farce mark barrett successfully excluded the states bitemark experts then destroyed the credibility of the dna man called by the state after the prosecution rested mark barrett made a forceful motion to dismiss the evidence presented by the state and direct a verdict in favor of greg wilhoit then the judge called for a recess and they went to lunch when they returned and when the jury was back and the courtroom was settled the judge in a rare move announced that the motion would be granted the case was dismissed mr wilhoit he said you are now a free man after a long night of celebrating with his family and friends greg wilhoit raced to the airport the next morning and flew to california never to return to oklahoma unless it was to visit his family or fight the death penalty eight years after kathys murder he was finally a free man by chasing the wrong suspect the police and prosecutors had allowed the real killers trail to grow cold he has yet to be found the new death chamber on h unit was working just fine on march robyn leroy parks male black age fortythree was executed for the murder of a gas station attendant he had been on the row for thirteen years three days later olan randle robison male white age fortysix was executed for murdering a couple after he broke into their rural home in ron williamson was to be the third man strapped to a gurney on h unit and offered the opportunity to say a few final words on august ron was greeted at his cell door by a menacing squad of frowning guards who wanted to take him somewhere he was cuffed at the ankles and wrists and a belly chain linked all the hardware together this was something serious as usual he was gaunt dirty unshaven and unstable and the guards gave him as much room as possible officer martin was one of the five ron was led out of h unit into a van and driven the short distance to the administrative offices at the front of the prison surrounded by his entourage he was taken to the wardens office to a room with a long conference table where many people were waiting to witness something dramatic still shackled and guarded closely by his sentries he was seated at one end of the table the warden was at the other and he began the meeting by introducing ron to the numerous staff members seated around the table all looking rather glum a real pleasure to meet you all ron was then handed a notification which the warden began reading you have been sentenced to die for the crime of murder at am on tuesday september the purpose of this meeting is to inform you of the rules and procedures to be followed for the next thirty days and to discuss certain privileges you may be afforded ron became upset and said that he hadnt killed anyone maybe hed done some bad things in his life but murder wasnt one of them the warden kept reading and ron again insisted that he did not kill debbie carter the warden and the unit manager chatted with him for a few minutes and calmed him down they were not there to judge him they said but they were just following the rules and procedures but ron had a video of ricky simmons confessing to the crime and he wanted to show it to the warden again he denied killing debbie and he rambled on about somehow getting on television in ada to profess his innocence he mentioned his sister going to college in ada the warden continued reading on the morning prior to the date of execution you will be placed in a special cell where you will remain until the time of execution while in this cell and until the time of execution you will be under constant surveillance by correctional officers ron interrupted again yelling that he did not kill debbie carter the warden plowed on reading pages of rules regarding visitors personal belongings and funeral arrangements ron tuned him out and became subdued what should we do with your body the warden asked ron was emotional and confused and unprepared for such a question finally he managed to suggest that they just ship him to annette when he had no questions and claimed he understood it all he was marched back to his cell the countdown began he forgot to call annette two days later she was riffling through her mail when she came across an envelope from the department of corrections in mcalester inside was a letter from a deputy warden ms hudson it is with empathy that i must inform you that your brother ronald keith williamson is scheduled to be executed at the oklahoma state penitentiary at am on tuesday september visiting during the day prior to the execution date will be limited to clergymen attorney of record and two other persons who have been approved by the warden as difficult as it may be funeral arrangements must be considered and these arrangements are the responsibility of the family if this responsibility is not assumed by the family the state will attend to the funeral please inform me of your decision sincerely ken klingler annette called renee with the horrible news both were distraught and worked hard to convince each other that it couldnt be true other conversations followed and they decided that they would not bring his body back to ada it would not be put on display at criswells funeral home for the town to gawk at instead they would have a private service and burial in mcalester by invitation only only a few close friends and a few family members would attend they were informed by the prison that they would be allowed to witness the execution renee said she couldnt do it annette was determined to be there at the end the news swept through ada peggy stillwell was watching the local tv station when she heard the rather surprising report that an execution date had been set for ron williamson though this was good news she was angry because no one had informed her she had been promised that she would be allowed to witness the execution and she certainly wanted to perhaps someone would call in a few days annette kept to herself and tried to deny it was happening her visits to the prison had become less frequent and shorter in duration ronnie was out of his mind and would either yell at her or pretend she wasnt there several times she had left after seeing him for less than five minutes chapter once the oklahoma courts were finished with rons case and the date of execution was set his attorneys hustled to federal court and began the next stage of appeals the proceedings are known as habeas corpuslatin for you should have the body a writ for habeas corpus required that an inmate be brought before the court to determine the legality of his detention his case was assigned to janet chesley a lawyer with the indigent defense system in norman janet had extensive experience with habeas work and was accustomed to the frenetic pace of filing lastminute motions and appeals while watching the clock race toward an execution she met with ron explained the process and assured him he would get a stay in her work such conversations were not unusual and her clients though understandably jittery always came to trust her the execution date was serious but no one was put to death until the habeas appeals had been exhausted but ron was different the formal pronouncement of a date with death had pushed him even deeper into insanity he was counting the days unable to believe janets promises the clock had not stopped the death chamber was waiting a week went by then two ron spent much time in prayer and bible study he also slept a lot and stopped screaming his drugs were being liberally dispensed the row was quiet and waiting the other inmates missed nothing and wondered if the state would really execute someone as insane as ron williamson three weeks went by the us district court for the eastern district of oklahoma is in muskogee in there were two judges neither of whom was particularly fond of habeas corpus appeals or jailhouse lawsuits they came in by the truckload every prisoner had issues and complaints most claimed innocence and abuse the death row boys had real lawyers some from big firms working pro bono and the briefs were thick and creative and had to be reckoned with the general population prisoners were usually represented by themselves with no shortage of advice from the writ writers who held sway in the law libraries and sold their opinions for cigarettes if the inmates werent filing habeas appeals they were filing lawsuits over bad food cold showers mean guards tight handcuffs lack of sunlight the list was long most prisoner suits lacked merit and were dismissed outright then sent to the tenth circuit court of appeals in denver home base for the sprawling federal district that included oklahoma the habeas corpus appeal filed by janet chesley was randomly assigned to judge frank seay a jimmy carter appointee who took the bench in judge seay was from seminole and prior to his federal appointment he had served for eleven years as the trial judge in the twentysecond district which included pontotoc county he was familiar with the courthouse there and the town and its lawyers in may judge seay had driven to the village of asher and delivered a high school commencement speech one of the seventeen graduates was ron williamson after fifteen years on the bench judge seay had little patience with the habeas corpus appeals that landed in his office the williamson petition arrived there in september just a few days before the execution he suspectedin fact he knewthat the death penalty lawyers often waited until the last possible moment to file their petitions so that he and other federal judges would be forced to grant stays while the paperwork got sorted out he often wondered what the poor convict was going through sweating the hours on death row while his lawyers engaged in a bit of brinksmanship with a federal judge but it was good lawyering and though judge seay understood it he still didnt like the process hed granted a few stays but never a new trial in a habeas corpus matter as always the williamson petition was first read by jim payne a us magistrate in the federal court office payne was known to have conservative leanings and a similar dislike for habeas work but he was also highly regarded because of his innate fairness it had been his duty for many years to plow through each habeas corpus filing and search for valid claims which though rare did exist often enough to keep the reading interesting to jim payne the job was crucial if he missed something buried in the voluminous briefs and transcripts then an innocent man might be executed janet chesleys petition was so well written that it captured his attention in the first paragraph and by the time he finished it he had some doubts about the fairness of rons trial her arguments centered on the issues of inadequate defense counsel mental competency and the unreliability of hair evidence jim payne read the petition at home at night and when he returned to the office the following morning he met with judge seay and recommended a stay judge seay had great respect for his magistrate and after a long discussion about the williamson petition he agreed to stop the execution after watching the clock and praying fervently for twentythree days ron was informed that his execution had been delayed indefinitely his brush with death had taken him to within five days of getting the needle jim payne passed the habeas petition on to his law clerk gail seward who read it and agreed that an indepth review was called for he then gave it to the office rookie a law clerk by the name of vicky hildebrand who because of her complete lack of seniority had been assigned the unofficial title of death penalty clerk vicky had been a social worker before law school and she had quickly and quietly assumed the role as the token bleeding heart in judge seays moderatetoconservative office williamson was her first habeas case involving the death penalty and as she read his petition she was captivated by the opening paragraph this case is a bizarre one about a dream that turned into a nightmare for ronald keith williamson his arrest came nearly years after the crimeafter mr williamsons alibi witness was deadand was based almost entirely on the confession related as a dream of a seriously mentally ill man ron williamson vicky read on and was soon struck by the paucity of credible evidence offered at his trial and by the haphazard strategies of his defense when she finished it she had strong doubts about rons guilt and she immediately asked herself if she had the nerves for such a job would every habeas petition be so persuasive was she going to believe every death row inmate she confided in jim payne who devised a plan they would draft gail seward more of a centrist and get her opinion vicky spent an entire friday copying the lengthy trial transcript three copies one for each member of the conspiracy each spent the entire weekend reading every word of rons trial and when they huddled early on monday morning the verdict was unanimous from the right left and center all agreed that justice had not been served not only were they certain the trial had been unconstitutional they also believed ron might very well be innocent they were intrigued by the reference to the dreams ofada janet chesleys petition made much of the dream confession ron had allegedly made he had been reading the book shortly after his arrest and had it in his cell when he gave his own jailhouse dream to john christian published seven years earlier the book was out of print but vicky found copies in used bookstores and libraries the three read it quickly and their suspicions of the authorities in ada were greatly magnified since judge seay was known to be rather abrupt when dealing with habeas matters it was decided that jim payne would approach him and break the ice on the williamson case judge seay listened carefully then got an earful from vicky and gail the three felt strongly that a new trial was in order and after hearing them out the judge agreed to study the petition he knew bill peterson and barney ward and most of the gang down in ada he considered barney an old pal but had never cared for peterson frankly he was not surprised at the sloppy trial and flimsy evidence strange things happened in ada and judge seay had heard for years that the cops had a bad reputation he was particularly bothered by the lack of control judge ronald jones had exerted over the proceedings bad police work and slanted prosecutions were not unusual but the trial judge was supposed to guarantee fairness nor was he surprised that the court of criminal appeals had seen nothing wrong with the trial when he became convinced that justice had not been served he and his staff launched into a thorough review of the case dennis fritz had lost contact with ron he had written one letter to his old friend but it went unanswered kim marks and leslie delk drove to conner to interview dennis in connection with their investigation they brought the ricky joe simmons video and played the confession dennis like ron was angry that someone else had confessed to the murder they were convicted of committing yet this information had not been available at his trial he developed a correspondence with kim marks and she kept him posted on the developments in rons case as a fixture in the law library dennis heard all the legal gossip and knew the latest rulings from around the country he and his fellow jailhouse lawyers missed nothing in the field of criminal procedure dna testing was first mentioned in the early s and he read everything he could find on the subject in a segment of donahue was devoted to four men who had been exonerated by dna testing the show found a wide audience especially in the prisons and served as a catalyst for the innocence movement across the country one group that had already gained attention was the innocence project founded in by two new york lawyers peter neufeld and barry scheck they set up shop in the benjamin n cardozo school of law as a nonprofit legal clinic where students handled the case work while staff attorneys supervised neufeld had a long history of legal activism in brooklyn scheck was an expert on forensic dna and became famous as one of the attorneys for oj simpson dennis watched the simpson trial closely and when it was over he considered the possibility of contacting barry scheck after receiving numerous complaints about h unit in amnesty international conducted a thorough evaluation of the place it found many violations of international standards including treaties adopted by the united states and minimum rules set forth by the united nations the violations included cells that were too small inadequately furnished unlit unventilated windowless and without access to natural light not surprisingly the exercise yards were found to be unduly restrictive and much too small many inmates skipped their one hour a day so they could have the privacy of the cell without their roommate other than a high school diploma course there were no educational programs nor were the inmates allowed to work religious services were restricted isolation of individual prisoners was too severe the food service needed a thorough review in conclusion amnesty international found that conditions on h unit amounted to cruel inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of international standards the conditions when applied over a period of time can have a detrimental effect on the physical and mental health of prisoners the report was issued but was not binding on the prison it did add fuel to some of the prisoner lawsuits that had been filed after a threeyear hiatus the death chamber machinery cranked up again on march thomas grasso male white age thirtytwo was executed after only two years on the row though it had been difficult grasso was able to stop his appeals and get things over with next came roger dale stafford the infamous steakhouse murderer who had one of the more notable executions mass murders in big cities draw more press and stafford went out in a blaze of glory hed spent fifteen years on death row and his case was used by police and prosecutors and especially politicians as a prime example of the flaws in the appeals process on august a bizarre execution took place robert brecheen a fortyyearold white male barely made it to the death chamber the day before he swallowed a handful of painkillers that he had somehow smuggled in and stockpiled his suicide was to be his final effort at telling the state to go to hell but the state prevailed brecheen was found unconscious by the guards and rushed to the hospital where his stomach was pumped and he was stabilized enough to get hauled back to h unit for a proper killing judge seay directed his staff through a tedious evaluation of every aspect of the williamson case they pored over the transcripts which included the preliminary hearing and every other court appearance they cataloged rons lengthy medical records they studied the police files and reports from the osbi experts the workload was divided among vicky hildebrand jim payne and gail seward it became a group project with no shortage of ideas and eagerness the trial was rotten a clear miscarriage of justice had occurred and they wanted to correct it judge seay had never trusted hair evidence he had once presided over a federal death penalty case in which the star witness was to be the fbis top hair expert his qualifications were beyond reproach and hed testified many times but judge seay was not impressed the expert didnt testify and was sent away vicky hildebrand volunteered for the research on hair evidence for months she read dozens of cases and studies and became convinced that it was all junk science it was so wildly unreliable that it should never be used in any trial a conclusion judge seay had long since reached gail seward concentrated on barney ward and the mistakes he made at trial jim payne tackled the brady issues for months the team worked on little else putting williamson aside only to tend to pressing matters there was no deadline on their work but judge seay was a taskmaster who didnt tolerate an idle docket they worked nights and weekends they read and edited each others work as they peeled away more layers they found more mistakes and as the trial errors piled up their enthusiasm increased jim payne had daily briefings with judge seay who as expected offered no shortage of comments he read the teams initial drafts did his editing sent them back for more work as it became obvious that a new trial would be ordered the case began to bother judge seay barney was an old friend an old warrior past his prime who would be deeply hurt by the criticism how would ada react to the news that their former judge had taken sides with the notorious killer ron williamson the team knew that their work would be scrutinized at the next level at the tenth circuit court of appeals in denver what if they got reversed were they convinced enough in their cause could they argue so persuasively that the tenth circuit would be convinced for almost a year the team labored under the guidance of judge seay finally on september one year after the execution had been stayed he issued a writ of habeas corpus and granted a new trial the opinion accompanying the order was exhaustive one hundred pages long and a masterpiece ofjudicial analysis and reasoning in clear yet scholarly language judge seay threw the book at barney ward bill peterson the ada police department and the osbi and though he held his fire on the unfortunate officiating by judge jones he left little guesswork as to how he felt about it ron deserved a new trial for many reasons chief among them ineffective assistance of counsel barneys mistakes were numerous and harmful they included the failure to raise the issue of his clients mental competency failure to thoroughly investigate and present evidence against glen gore failure to flesh out the fact that terri holland had also testified against karl fontenot and tommy ward failure to inform the jury that ricky joe simmons had confessed to the murder and had even done so on a videotape that barney actually possessed failure to attack rons confessions and suppress them before trial and failure to call mitigating witnesses during the penalty phase bill peterson and the cops were faulted for hiding the video of rons second polygraph using confessions obtained by questionable means including rons dream confession calling to the stand and putting under oath jailhouse snitches presenting a case with almost no physical evidence and sitting on exculpatory evidence judge seay analyzed the history of hair evidence and ruled rather dramatically that it was too unreliable and should be banned from all courts he criticized the osbi experts for their mishandling of the samples in the fritz and williamson investigation bill peterson judge jones and judge john david miller were faulted for not stopping the proceedings and inquiring into rons mental health judge jones was wrong for holding a brady hearing on exculpatory materials after the trial was over his denial of barneys request for a forensic expert to rebut the testimony from the osbi gang was reversible error in itself with the precision of a surgeon judge seay cut through every aspect of the trial and laid bare the mockery of rons conviction unlike the oklahoma court of criminal appeals a tribunal that had examined the case twice judge seay saw a bad conviction and questioned everything at the end of his opinion he added something unusualan epilogue he wrote while considering my decision in this case i told a friend a layman i believed the facts and the law dictated that i must grant a new trial to a man who had been convicted and sentenced to death my friend asked is he a murderer i replied simply we wont know until he receives a fair trial god help us if ever in this great country we turn our heads while people who have not had fair trials are executed that almost happened in this case as a courtesy judge seay sent a copy of his opinion to barney ward with a note saying he was sorry but he had no choice barney would never speak to him again though vicky hildebrand gail seward and jim payne felt strongly about their work they were still somewhat apprehensive when it was made public giving a new trial to a death row inmate was not popular in oklahoma rons case had consumed their lives for a year and though they were sure of themselves they did not want judge seay and his office criticized prosecutors vow to fight order for new trial read the headline in the ada evening news on september on one side of it was a high school photo of ron williamson on the other was one of bill peterson the report began an angry bill peterson said that he would be more than happy to make an appearance before the united states supreme court if necessary in order to overturn a recent federal judges ruling which has ordered a new trial for convicted pontotoc county murderer ronald keith williamson fortunately at least for peterson he would not get the chance to go to washington and argue the case he went on to say that he had been assured by the states attorney general that he himself would personally handle the immediate appeal to the tenth circuit in denver he was quoted as saying im flabbergasted bumfuzzled angry confused and a lot of other things to have had this case go through so many appeals and so much scrutiny without ever having anyone question the conviction and then for this opinion to come down it simply doesnt make any sense he neglected to say and the reporter neglected to point out that all death penalty convictions go the habeas corpus route and end up in federal court where sooner or later an opinion of some sort is delivered but peterson was on a roll he continued this case has been considered by the us supreme court on two occasions and on both occasions the court reaffirmed the convictions and denied the requests for rehearings not exactly the us supreme court never considered the merits of rons case in fact by denying certiorari the court refused to hear the case and sent it back to oklahoma this was standard practice peterson saved his tallest tale for the end judge seay had cited in a footnote to his opinion robert mayers book the dreams ofada and made a reference to the number of convictions based on dream confessions coming out of the same courtroom peterson was upset that the book had been mentioned in a court ruling and said evidently with a straight face it is simply not true that any of these three menwilliamson fontenot or wardwere convicted based on dream confessions the state of oklahoma appealed judge seays ruling to the tenth circuit court of appeals in denver though ron was pleased with the turn of events and the prospect of a new trial he was still in prison surviving day by day as the process dragged on he was not however fighting alone kim marks his investigator janet chesley his lawyer and dr foster were relentless in their efforts to obtain proper treatment for almost four years the prison had refused to admit ron to its special care unit where better medications and better conditions were available the scu was within view of h unit an easy walk but officially offlimits to death row inmates kim marks reported this description of her client i was so frightened not of him but for him i insisted that we try and get somebody higher up in the penal system to get some help because his hair had grown out to his shoulders he had yellow streaks in them where hed been pulling because you could see the nicotine stains completely down his fingers and on his hands not just on the tips his teeth were literally rotting out of his mouth i think he had been twisting them his skin was gray because he had obviously not bathed in weeks he was skin and bones his shirt looked like it hadnt been washed much less hung up or ironed in months and he was pacing he could barely talk and every time he did talk spit would fly from his mouth he was not making any sense whatsoever and i was really afraid we were going to lose him that he would die in prison from physical health problems related to his mental health problems janet chesley kim marks and ken foster badgered the various wardens who came and went at mcalester as well as deputy wardens and assistants susan otto the director of the federal public defenders office and janets supervisor managed to pull some strings at the department of corrections finally in february james saffle then a higher ranking official with doc agreed to meet with kim and janet as the meeting began saffle announced that he had authorized ron ward the current warden at mcalester to make an exception for ron williamson and to transfer him immediately to the scu ron wards memo to the director of the scu admitted that the unit was officially offlimits for death row inmates it read in part i am authorizing an exception to the standard operating procedures for the special care unit of the oklahoma penitentiary which states any osp inmate except those on death row are eligible for special care unit services what was behind this change of heart two weeks earlier a prison psychologist sent a confidential memo to a deputy warden concerning ron williamson among other comments the psychologist gave some valid reasons for moving ron to the scu in our team discussion we agreed that mr williamson was psychotic and would likely benefit from major adjustment to his medication we also noted that he has steadfastly refused even to consider or discuss any such adjustment as you know the special care unit has the latitude to force medicate when need be the h unit staff was tired of ron and needed a break the memo went on there is little doubt that mr williamsons condition is deteriorating week by week i have noticed it and hunit staff have brought it up regularly earlier today mike mullens made emphatic mention of this deterioration and of the adverse effect the inmates psychotic outbursts were having on our southwest quad but the best reason to move ron was to speed up his execution the memo concluded in my opinion as things stand now with mr williamson his psychosis has reached a level that would probably render him less than competent to be executed a period at our scu could well restore him to an appropriate level of competence ron was walked over to the scu admitted and given a nicer cell with a window dr foster changed his medications and monitored their intake though ron was far from healthy he was quiet and not in constant pain he was also extremely fragile his mania barely under control progress was made then suddenly on april after three months in the scu ron was abruptly pulled out and taken back to h unit for two weeks there was no medical authorization for the transfer dr foster was unaware of it no reason was given when he was returned to the scu he had regressed considerably dr foster sent a memo to the warden and described the damage the sudden transfer had inflicted on the patient coincidentally rons sudden transfer on april just happened to occur the day before another execution on april benjamin brewer was put to death for stabbing a twentyyear old coed in tulsa in brewer had been on death row for over seventeen years even though he was at the scu ron was still a death row inmate he couldnt be allowed to miss the drama of another killing at h unit janet chesley suspected the sudden transfer had something to do with the legal maneuverings the state of oklahoma had appealed judge seays ruling to the tenth circuit in denver and oral arguments were scheduled to prevent her from arguing that her client was so mentally incompetent that he had been moved to the special care unit ron was moved back to h unit she erupted when she first heard of the transfer she berated the prison officials and the attorneys for the state who were handling the appeals finally she promised not to mention during her oral argument that ron was in the scu he was moved back but the damage was painfully clear dennis fritz heard the good news that ron had prevailed at the federal level and would get another trial dennis had not been so lucky since he was not under a death sentence he had no lawyer and was forced to file his own habeas corpus petition he had lost at the district court level in and was appealing to the federal tenth circuit rons retrial was bittersweet for dennis he was dejected because he was convicted by the same witnesses and the same set of facts yet his habeas appeal had been turned down at the same time he was very pleased that ronnie would get another day in court in march he finally wrote the innocence project and requested their help a student volunteer wrote back and sent a questionnaire in june the student requested denniss lab workthe analysis of his hair blood and saliva dennis had it neatly filed away in his cell and he quickly sent it to new york in august he sent his appellate briefs and in november he sent his entire trial transcript later that month he received the wonderful news that the innocence project had officially taken his case letters went back and forth weeks and months passed the tenth circuit denied his appeal and when the supreme court refused to hear his case in may dennis went through his own bout of depression his appeals were over all those wise judges sitting in their black robes and plowing through their thick law books had seen nothing wrong with his trial not a single one detected the obviousan innocent man was wrongly convicted the future of life in prison that he had so strongly refused to believe was now a possibility in may he sent four letters to the innocence project in in the small town of okarche just north of oklahoma city two men steven hatch and glen ake broke into the home of the reverend richard douglass in the ensuing ordeal douglass and his wife were shot and killed their two young children were also shot and left for dead somehow they survived the killing was done by glen ake who was convicted and sentenced to death then given a new trial because the judge had denied him access to a mental health expert his appeal ake v oklahoma was a landmark decision at his second trial he received a life sentence which he is still serving steven hatchs participation in the killings was greatly in doubt and hotly disputed but he nonetheless received the death penalty on august hatch was strapped to the gurney and rolled into the death chamber on h unit present in the witness room were the two douglass children adults by then glen ake the unquestioned gunman got life steven hatch who killed no one was executed in a twentyyearold american indian named scott dawn carpenter robbed a store in lake eufaula and murdered the owner after only two years on death row he was able to stop his appeals and get the needle on april the tenth circuit court of appeals in denver affirmed judge seay the court took exception to his ban on hair evidence but agreed that ron williamson had been wrongly convicted with a new trial in order rons case was moved to the capital trial division of the indigent defense system where the new director mark barrett supervised a team of eight lawyers because of the complexity of the case and because of his experience with ron he assigned the case to himself the initial truckload of materials he received filled sixteen boxes in may mark and janet chesley drove to mcalester to see the client janets role was to reintroduce mark to ron they had last seen each other in shortly after ron arrived in f cellhouse and mark was assigned his first appeal though he knew janet and kim marks and most of the indigent appellate lawyers and though hed heard many rumors and tales of ron and his adventures on death row mark was still startled at his condition in ron was thirtyfive years old weighed pounds and had an athletic build confident walk dark hair and a baby face nine years later he was fortythree and could easily have passed for sixtyfive after a year in the scu he was still gaunt pale disheveled ghostlike and obviously very sick but he was able to remain engaged through a long conversation about his case he rambled at times and drifted off into monologues that made no sense whatsoever but for the most part he knew what was going on and where his case was headed mark explained that dna testing would compare rons blood hair and saliva samples with the hair and semen found at the crime scene and that the conclusion would be certain guaranteed foolproof dna doesnt lie ron showed no hesitation in fact he was eager to have the testing done i am innocent he said over and over and i have nothing to hide mark barrett and bill peterson agreed that ron should be evaluated to determine his mental competency they also agreed on dna testing peterson pushed hard for dna because he was convinced it would finally nail ron the testing would have to wait however because mark barretts austere budget wouldnt allow it the cost was initially expected to be about money that would not be available for a few months it would eventually cost much more than the first estimate instead mark went to work on the competency hearing he and his rather lean staff compiled rons medical records they located a psychologist who reviewed the records interviewed ron and was willing to travel to ada to testify after two trips to the oklahoma court of criminal appeals a oneyear layover in judge seays office a twoyear stop at the tenth circuit in denver two useless but required visits to the us supreme court in washington and a truckload of routine filings back and forth among all these various courts the matter of the state of oklahoma versus ronald keith williamson had now returned home it was back in ada ten years after four cops surrounded him shirtless and shaggy and tinkering with a lawn mower with only three wheels and arrested him for murder chapter tom landrith was a thirdgeneration native of pontotoc county he attended ada high school and played on two state championship football teams college and law school were at the university of oklahoma and when he passed the bar he settled into his hometown and joined a small firm in he ran for district court judge and easily defeated g c mayhue who had defeated ronald jones in judge landrith was well acquainted with ron williamson and the carter murder and when the tenth circuit affirmed judge seay he knew the case was headed back to ada to his courtroom typical of a small town he had represented ron on a drunkdriving charge in the early s they briefly played on the same softball team landrith played high school football with johnny carter debbies uncle and landrith and bill peterson were old friends during rons murder trial in landrith had slipped into the courtroom several times out of curiosity of course he knew barney well it was ada and everybody knew everybody landrith was a popular judge folksy and funny but strict in his courtroom though he had never been fully convinced ron was guilty he was not convinced he was innocent either like most folks in ada he had always felt the guy had a loose screw or two but he was anxious to see ron and to make sure his retrial was conducted fairly the murder was fifteen years old and still unsolved judge landrith had great sympathy for the carters and their ordeal it was time to settle the matter on sunday july ron williamson left mcalester never to return he was driven by two pontotoc county deputies to eastern state hospital in vinita the sheriff jeff glase told a newspaper reporter that the prisoner behaved himself they didnt report any trouble out of him whatsoever glase said but when youre in shackles leg irons and a straight jacket theres not really much you can do to cause a lot of trouble it was rons fourth admission to eastern state he was placed in the pretrial program to be evaluated and treated so that he could one day stand trial judge landrith set a trial date for july but then postponed it pending an evaluation of ron by the doctors at eastern state though bill peterson did not object to the evaluation he left little doubt as to his opinion of rons competency in a letter to mark barrett he said my personal opinion is that he was competent under oklahoma law and that his disruptions in court were merely a show of anger at the time he was tried and convicted and he functioned reasonably well in jail bill peterson liked the idea of dna testing he had never wavered in his belief that williamson was the killer and now it could be proven with real science he and mark barrett swapped letters and quibbled over the detailswhich lab who pays for what when to start the testing but both agreed that the testing would take place ron was stabilized and doing better anyplace even a mental hospital was an improvement over mcalester eastern state had several units and he was placed in a heavily secured one complete with bars on the windows and plenty of razor wire to look at the rooms were small old and not very nice and the secured unit was overflowing with patients ron was lucky to have a room others slept in beds in the hallways he was immediately examined by dr curtis grundy and found to be incompetent ron appreciated the nature of the charges against him but was unable to assist his attorneys dr grundy wrote to judge landrith and said that with proper treatment ron might become competent enough to stand trial two months later dr grundy evaluated him again in a detailed fourpage report sent to judge landrith dr grundy determined that ron was able to appreciate the nature of the charges against him was able to consult with his lawyer and rationally assist in the preparation of his defense and was mentally ill and required further treatment he should continue to receive psychiatric treatment throughout his trial participation for the purpose of maintaining his competence to stand trial additionally dr grundy determined that ron was harmless saying mr williamson does not appear to pose an immediate significant threat to himself or others should he be released without further inpatient treatment he currently denies experiencing suicidal and homicidal ideation or intent he has not displayed aggressive behavior towards himself or others during this hospitalization the current assessment of his dangerousness is based upon his placement in a structured secure setting and may not be applicable to unstructured environments judge landrith set the competency hearing for december and ron was moved back to ada he checked into the pontotoc county jail said hello to his old pal john christian and was placed in his old cell annette was soon there to see him with food and she found him upbeat hopeful and very happy to be home he was excited about a new trial and the prospect of proving his innocence he rambled on incessantly about ricky joe simmons with annette constantly asking him to change the subject he could not the day before the hearing he spent four hours with dr sally church a psychologist hired by mark barrett to testify about his competency dr church had already met with him twice and reviewed the extensive records of his medical history she had little doubt that he was incompetent to stand trial ron though was determined to prove he was ready for a trial for nine years he had dreamed of the chance to again confront bill peterson and dennis smith and gary rogers and all the liars and snitches hed killed no one and he was desperate to finally prove it he liked mark barrett but he was angry that his own lawyer was trying to prove he was crazy ron just wanted a trial judge landrith scheduled the hearing in a smaller courtroom down the hall from the main one where ron had been convicted on the morning of the tenth every seat was taken annette was there as were several reporters janet chesley and kim marks were waiting to testify barney ward was absent the last time ron made the short walk from the jail to the courthouse in handcuffs he had been sentenced to die he was thirtyfive then still a young man with dark hair and a stocky build and nice suit nine years later he made the walk again a whitehaired ghostlike old man in prison garb and unsteady on his feet when he walked into the courtroom tom landrith was shocked at his appearance ron was very happy to see tommy up there on the bench in a black robe when ron nodded and smiled the judge noticed that most of his teeth were gone his hair was streaked yellow from the nicotine on his hands appearing for the state to contest rons claims of incompetence was bill peterson who was irritated by the very notion and disdainful of the proceedings mark barrett was assisted by sara bonnell a lawyer from purcell who would hold the second seat in rons retrial sara was an experienced criminal lawyer and mark relied heavily on her they wasted no time in proving their case ron was the first witness and within seconds had everybody thoroughly confused mark asked him his name then they had the following exchange mark mr williamson theres a person other than yourself who you believe committed this crime ron yes there is his name is ricky joe simmons of west rd street at the time of september th confession to the ada police department thats the address he listed he was living at i received verification there were some simmons living at that address along with ricky joe simmons there was a cody and a debbie simmons living there mark and you tried to get the word out about ricky simmons ron i have told a lot of people about mr simmons ive wrote to joe gifford i wrote to tom and jerry criswell at the funeral home and knowing that if they bought a monument here in ada they would have bought it from joe gifford because hes the only monument works and forgetmenotflorist handled the floral arrangements i wrote to them i wrote to some people at the solo company where his former his former employer i wrote to the glass plant his former employer and to the decedents former employer mark lets back up a minute why was it important for you to write the monument company ron because i know joe gifford when i was growing up i mowed his yard as a kid with burt rose my nextdoor neighbor and knowing that if mr carter and ms stillwell bought a monument here in ada oklahoma they bought it from joe gifford because he is the only monument works here i grew up by gifford monument works mark why would you write to forgetmenot florist ron because knowing if they bought flowers here in ada ms stillwell is from stonewall oklahoma knowing that if they bought flowers here in ada they possibly could have bought from forgetmenot florist mark how about the funeral home ron the funeral home is criswell funeral home is the funeral home i read from bill lukers brief stating that they are the people responsible for handling the funeral and burial arrangements for the decedent mark and it was important for you to let them know ricky ron yes he was an extremely dangerous man and i asked for some support in getting him arrested mark thats because of handling funeral arrangements for ms carter ron that is correct mark did you also write to the manager of the florida marlins ron i wrote to the third base coach of the oakland athletics who later became yes the manager of the florida marlins mark and did you ask him to keep some sort of information he gave you under his hat ron no i told him the whole story about the del monte catsup bottle that simmons said that dennis smith holding up a del monte catsup bottle in his right hand on the witness stand and ricky joe simmons saying he raped the decedent with a catsup bottle i wrote to rene and told him that thats the most shocking piece of evidence ive ever seen in the fortyfouryears ive been alive mark but you know that the florida marlins manager told some other people about it is that right ron probably so because rene lachemann is a good friend of mine mark so is there something youve heard that makes you believe this ron oh yes because i used to listen to monday night football and i listened to the world series and ive been listening to some reports on television and through the media that that del monte catsup bottle has become infamous mark okay you hear them talking ron oh yes definitely so mark on monday night ron definitely so mark and during the world series ron its a cheering pep squad sick ordeal i have to go through but its nonetheless necessary for me to get simmons confessed that he did in fact rape rape by instrumentation and rape by forcible sodomy and murder debra sue carter at her home at east th street december the th mark do you also hear debra carters name mentioned during ron yes i do mark is this during monday night football also ron i hear debra sue carters name continually mark you dont have a tv in your cell do you ron i hear other peoples television i have heard them at vinita i had a television on death row i definitely hear that i am associated with this horrible crime and i am doing my very dead level best to clear my name of this stinking mess mark paused so everyone could catch a breath spectators exchanged looks others were frowning trying not to make eye contact with anyone judge landrith was writing something on his legal pad the lawyers were scribbling too though putting sensible words together was not easy at the moment from a lawyers perspective it was extremely difficult to examine an incompetent witness because no one including the witness knew what answers were likely to spew forth mark decided to just let him talk in attendance for the carter family was christy shepherd debbies niece who had grown up not far from the williamsons she was a licensed health counselor whod spent years working with severely mentally ill adults after a few minutes of listening to ron she was convinced later that day she told her mother and peggy stillwell that ron williamson was a very sick man also watching but for different reasons was dr curtis grundy bill petersons chief witness the questioning continued though questions were unnecessary ron either ignored them or gave a quick answer before returning to ricky joe simmons and rambling on until the next question cut him off after ten minutes on the stand mark barrett had heard enough annette followed her brother and testified about his unstable thoughts and his obsession with ricky joe simmons janet chesley testified in detail about her representation of ron and her efforts to get him moved into the special care unit at mcalester she too described his nonstop ramblings about ricky joe simmons and said that he was unable to assist with his defense because he talked of nothing else ron was improving in her opinion and she was hopeful he would one day be able to get his new trial but that day was still far away kim marks covered much of the same territory she had not seen ron in several months and was pleased with his improved appearance in vivid detail she described ron on h unit and said she often thought he might die he was progressing mentally but was still unable to focus on anything but ricky joe simmons he was not ready for a trial dr sally church was the final witness for ron in the long and colorful history of ron williamsons court proceedings she was incredibly the first expert to testify about his mental health he was bipolar and schizophrenic two of the most difficult disorders to treat because the patient does not always understand what the medications do ron often stopped taking his pills and that was common with the two disorders dr church described the effects treatments and potential causes of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia during her examination of ron the day before at the county jail he asked her if she heard a television in the distance she wasnt sure ron certainly did and on the television show they were talking about debbie carter and the catsup bottle it happened like this he had written to rene lachemann a former player and coach with oakland and told him about ricky simmons and debbie carter and the catsup bottle ron believed that rene lachemann for some reason had mentioned this to a couple of sports announcers who began talking about it on the air the story spreadmonday night football the world series and so onuntil now it was all over the tube cant you hear them in there ron yelled at dr church theyre yelling catsup catsup catsup she concluded her testimony with the opinion that ron was unable to assist his attorney and prepare for trial during the recess for lunch dr grundy asked mark barrett if he could meet with ron alone mark trusted dr grundy and had no objection the psychiatrist and the patientinmate met in the witness room at the jail when court convened after lunch bill peterson stood and sheepishly announced yeah judge i visited with our witness grundy over the recess and i think the state of oklahoma would be willing to stipulate that competency is obtainable but at this particular point in time mr williamson is not competent after watching ron in court and chatting with him for fifteen minutes during lunch dr grundy did an aboutface and changed his opinion ron was simply not ready for a trial judge landrith ruled ron to be incompetent and wanted him back in thirty days for another look as the hearing was winding down ron said could i ask a question judge landrith yes sir ron tommy ive known you and i knew your dad paul and im telling you in honest truth i dont know how this duke graham and this jim smith business you know how it correlates to ricky joe simmons i dont know that and if thats about my competency let me get down here within thirty days and lets get simmons arrested put him on the witness stand show this videotape and try to get a confession from him as to what he actually did judge landrith i understand what youre saying if tommy did in fact understand he was the only one in the courtroom who did so against his wishes ron was returned to eastern state for more observation and treatment he preferred to remain in ada to speed things along toward his trial and he was irritated with his lawyers for wanting him at vinita mark barrett was desperate to get him out of the pontotoc county jail before more snitches appeared on the scene then a dentist at eastern state examined a sore in the roof of his mouth did a biopsy and discovered cancer the growth was encapsulated and easily removed the surgery was successful and the doctor told ron that had it gone untreated say at the county jail or at mcalester the cancer would have spread to his brain ron called mark and thanked him for the stay at eastern state you saved my life ron said and they were friends again in the state of oklahoma drew a blood sample from every prison inmate began analyzing them and entered the results into its new dna data bank the evidence from the carter investigation was still locked away at the osbi lab in oklahoma city the blood fingerprints semen and hair samples from the crime scene along with the numerous prints and blood hair and saliva samples taken from the witnesses and suspects were all in storage the fact that the state had possession of everything did not comfort dennis fritz he didnt trust bill peterson and the ada police and he certainly didnt trust their cohorts at the oklahoma state bureau of investigation hell gary rogers was an osbi agent fritz waited throughout he corresponded with the innocence project tried to be patient and waited ten years in prison had taught him patience and perseverance and he had experienced the cruelty of false hope a letter from ron helped it was a rambling sevenpage hello on eastern state letterhead and dennis chuckled as he read it his old friend had not lost his wit or his fight ricky joe simmons was still loose and damn it ron intended to nail him to keep his own sanity dennis stayed in the law library poring over cases he made a hopeful discoveryhis habeas corpus appeal had been filed in the us district court for the western district of oklahoma pontotoc county was in the eastern district he compared notes with the other law clerks and the combined wisdom was that the western district did not have jurisdiction over him he rewrote his petition and brief and refiled in the proper court it was a long shot but it energized him and gave him another fight in january he talked by phone to barry scheck scheck was at war on many fronts the innocence project was swamped with wrongful conviction cases dennis expressed his concern with the state having control of all the evidence and barry explained that that was usually the case relax he said nothing will happen to the samples he knew how to protect the evidence from tampering schecks fascination with denniss case was simple the police had failed to investigate the last man seen with the victim it was an enormous red flag and it was all scheck needed to take the case on january and at a company called laboratory corporation of america labcorp near raleigh north carolina the semen samples from the crime scene the torn panties the bedsheets and the vaginal swabswere tested against the dna profiles of ron williamson and dennis fritz a dna expert from california brian wraxall had been hired by the attorneys for ron and dennis to monitor the testing two days later judge landrith delivered the news that mark barrett and many others had been dreaming of the results of the dna tests had been analyzed and confirmed at labcorp and the semen from the crime scene excluded ron williamson and dennis fritz as always annette was in close contact with mark barrett and knew the testing was under way somewhere she was at home when the phone rang it was mark and his first words were annette ron is innocent her knees buckled and she almost fainted are you sure mark ron is innocent he said again we just got the lab results she couldnt talk for crying and promised to call him back later she sat down and for a long time she wept and she prayed she thanked god over and over for his goodness her christian faith had sustained her through the nightmare of rons ordeal and now the lord had answered her prayers she hummed a few hymns cried some more then began calling family and friends renees reaction was almost identical they made the fourhour drive to vinita the next day waiting there were mark barrett and sara bonnella little celebration was in order as ron was brought into the visitors room dr curtis grundy happened by and was invited to hear the good news ron was his patient and they had developed a close relationship after eighteen months at vinita ron was stable making slow progress and putting on weight we have some great news mark said addressing his client the lab results are back the dna proves you and dennis are innocent ron was instantly overcome with emotion and reached for his sisters they hugged and wept and then instinctively broke into ill fly away a popular gospel hymn they had learned as children mark barrett immediately filed a motion to dismiss the charges and turn ron loose and judge landrith was anxious to address the issue bill peterson objected and wanted further testing on the hair a hearing was scheduled for february bill peterson opposed the motion but he could not do so quietly before the hearing he was quoted in the ada evening news as saying dna testing of the hair samples which was not available in will prove they were responsible for carters murder the statement rattled mark barrett and barry scheck if peterson was cocky enough to make such public claims at such a late hour was it possible that he knew something they didnt did he have access to the hair taken from the crime scene could the samples be switched there were no empty seats in the main courtroom on february ann kelley a reporter for the ada evening news was fascinated by the case and was covering it thoroughly her frontpage reports were being widely read and when judge landrith settled behind his bench the room was crowded with policemen courthouse employees family members and local lawyers barney was there seeing nothing but hearing more than anyone he was thickskinned and had learned to live with judge seays opinion from he would never agree with it but he couldnt change it barney had always believed that his client had been framed by the police and peterson and it was wonderful watching their flimsy case unravel in the spotlight the lawyers argued for fortyfive minutes then judge landrith wisely decided to complete the testing of the hair before making a final decision do it fast he told the lawyers to his credit bill peterson promised on the record and in open court to agree to a dismissal if williamson and fritz were excluded by dna testing of the crime scene hair on february mark barrett and sara bonnell drove to the lexington correctional center to see glen gore in what was supposedly a routine interview though rons retrial had not been scheduled they were preparing for it anyway gore surprised them by saying he had been expecting a visit he was reading the newspapers keeping up with events he had read about judge seays opinion back in and knew that another trial was somewhere in the future they chatted for a while about that possibility and the conversation shifted to bill peterson a man gore despised because he put him in prison for forty years barrett asked gore why he testified against williamson and fritz it was all peterson he said peterson threatened him said hed go after him if he didnt help nail williamson and fritz would you be willing to take a polygraph on this mark asked gore said he had no problem with a polygraph and added that he had offered to take one for the police but it never happened the lawyers asked gore if he would give them a saliva sample for dna and he said it wasnt necessary the state already had his dna all prisoners were required to submit samples as they talked about dna mark barrett told gore that fritz and williamson had been tested gore already knew this could your dna be on her barrett asked probably gore said because he had danced with her five times that night dancing wouldnt do it mark said and went on to explain the basics of leaving a dna trail blood saliva hair sweat semen they have dna from the semen mark said gores expression changed dramatically and he was obviously bothered by this information he called time and left to go find his legal adviser he returned with reuben a jailhouse lawyer while he was away sara bonnell asked a guard for a q tip glen would you give a saliva sample sara asked holding the qtip gore grabbed the qtip snapped it in two cleaned both ears then dropped the two halves into his shirt pocket did you have sex with her mark asked gore wouldnt respond are you saying you never had sex with her mark asked again im not saying that if you did that semen is going to match up to your dna i didnt do it gore said i cant help you he and reuben stood and the interview was over as they were leaving mark barrett asked gore if they could meet again sure said gore but it might be better if they met at his job site job site mark thought he was serving a fortyyear prison sentence gore explained that during the day he worked in purcell sara bonnells hometown in the public works department catch him over there and they could have a longer talk mark and sara agreed though both were taken aback by gores outside employment that afternoon mark called mary long who was then in charge of the dnatesting section of the osbi and suggested that they find gores dna in the prison data bank and compare it with the semen samples from the crime scene she agreed to do so dennis fritz was locked in his cell for the pm count he heard the familiar voice of a prisoner counselor in the hall beyond his metal door the voice yelled hey fritz youre a free man then something about dna dennis couldnt get out of his cell and the counselor disappeared his cell mate heard it too and they spent the rest of the night talking about what it meant it was too late to call new york dennis suffered through the night slept little and tried unsuccessfully to throttle his excitement when he reached the innocence project early the next morning the news was confirmed dna testing had excluded dennis and ron from the semen found at the crime scene dennis was euphoric almost twelve years after he was arrested the truth was finally known the proof was ironclad and irrefutable he would be vindicated and exonerated and set free he called his mother and she was overcome with emotion he called his daughter elizabeth now twentyfive years old and they celebrated they had not seen each other in twelve years and they talked about how sweet the reunion would be to safeguard the crime scene hair and also the samples given by fritz and williamson mark barrett arranged for an expert to examine the hair and to microscopically photograph it with an infrared camera less than three weeks after the hearing on the motion to dismiss labcorp completed the firststage testing and sent back an inconclusive report mark barrett and sara bonnell drove to ada for a meeting in the chambers of the judge tom landrith was anxious to get the answers that only dna could provide because of the complexities of dna testing various labs were being used to test different hairs and because of the distrust between the prosecution and the defense different labs were necessary a total of five labs were eventually involved in the case the lawyers discussed this with judge landrith and again he pressed them to do it as fast as possible after the hearing mark and sara walked downstairs in the courthouse to bill petersons office in correspondence and in hearings he was growing increasingly hostile perhaps they could thaw things a bit with a friendly visit instead they heard a tirade peterson was still convinced ron williamson had raped and murdered debbie carter and his evidence had not changed forget the dna forget the experts from the osbi williamson was a bad guy whod raped women in tulsa and hung out in bars and roamed the streets with his guitar and lived close to debbie carter peterson vehemently believed that gary allen fritzs neighbor had actually seen ron williamson and dennis fritz in the yard the night of the murder washing off blood with a water hose while laughing and cursing they had to be guilty peterson ranted on and on working harder to reassure himself than to convince mark and sara they were dumbfounded the man was thoroughly incapable of admitting a mistake or grasping the reality of the situation the month of march seemed like a year for dennis fritz the euphoria vanished and he struggled to get through each day he was obsessed with the possibility of hair samples being switched by peterson or someone at the osbi with the semen issue put to rest the state would be desperate to salvage its case with the only evidence it had left if he and ron were cleared by dna testing of the hair then they would walk and the bogus prosecution would be exposed reputations were on the line everything was out of his control and dennis was overcome with stress he feared a heart attack and visited the prison clinic complaining of heart palpitations the pills they gave him did little to help the days dragged on then april arrived the excitement faded for ron too the extreme euphoria crashed into another round of severe depression and anxiety and he became suicidal he called mark barrett often and his lawyer kept reassuring him mark accepted every call and when he wasnt in the office he made sure someone there talked to the client ron like dennis was terrified of the authorities cooking the test results both were in prison because of the states experts people who still had access to the evidence it wasnt difficult to imagine a scenario in which the hair could be compromised in an effort to protect people and cover up an injustice ron had made no secret of his desire to sue everybody in sight once he was set free people in higher places had to be nervous ron called as often as he was permitted usually once a day he was paranoid and offered all sorts of nightmarish plots at one point mark barrett did something he had never done before and would probably never do again he guaranteed ron that he would get him out of prison if the dna fell through then they would go to trial and mark guaranteed an acquittal comforting words from an experienced lawyer and ron was calm for a few days hair samples dont match was the headline of the sunday edition of the ada paper on april ann kelley reported that labcorp had tested fourteen of seventeen hairs taken from the crime scene and they were in no way consistent with fritz or williamsons dna makeup bill peterson said at this point we dont know who the hairs belong to we havent tested them against anybody but fritz and williamson there was no question in my mind when we started the whole dna process that these two men were guilty i wanted it physical evidence sent off for the purpose of getting these two guys when we got the results on the semen samples i was so surprised my jaw dropped to the floor the final report was due from the lab the following wednesday april judge landrith scheduled a hearing for april and there was speculation that the two men might be set free fritz and williamson would both be in court on the fifteenth and barry scheck was coming to town schecks fame was growing enormously as the innocence project pulled off one dna exoneration after another and when word circulated that he would be in ada for yet another one the media circus began state and national news companies called mark barrett judge landrith bill peterson the innocence project the carter family all the major players excitement built quickly would ron williamson and dennis fritz really walk free on thursday dennis fritz had not heard the results of the hair tests on tuesday april he was in his cell when a guard appeared from nowhere and barked pack your shit youre leaving dennis knew he was going back to ada hopefully for his release he packed quickly said goodbye to a couple of friends and hurried away there to drive him back to ada was none other than john christian a familiar face from the pontotoc county jail twelve years in jail and prison had taught dennis to treasure his privacy and his freedom and to appreciate the little things like open spaces and forests and flowers spring was everywhere and as he headed back to ada he smiled through the window at the farms and rolling hills and countryside his thoughts were random he did not know of the latest test results nor was he certain why he was headed back to ada there was a chance he would be released and there was also the chance that a lastminute hitch would derail things twelve years earlier hed almost been released during his preliminary hearing when judge miller realized the state had so little proof then the cops and peterson produced james harjo and dennis went to trial then to prison he thought of elizabeth and how wonderful it would be to see and hold her he couldnt wait to get out of oklahoma then he was scared again he was so close to freedom yet he was still wearing handcuffs and headed for a jail ann kelley and a photographer were waiting for him he smiled as he entered the jail and was eager to talk to the reporter this case should never have been prosecuted he said for the newspaper the evidence they had against me was insufficient and if the police had done an adequate investigation of all the suspects this may never have happened he explained the problems with the indigent defense system when you dont have any money to defend yourself youre at the mercy of the judicial system once in the system its almost impossible to get out even if you are innocent he spent a quiet night in his old haunt dreaming of freedom the quietness of the jail was disrupted the next day april when ron williamson arrived from vinita wearing prison stripes and grinning at the cameras the word was out that they would be released the following day and the story had caught the attention of the national press ron and dennis had not seen each other in eleven years each had written to the other only once but when they were reunited they hugged and laughed and tried to grasp the reality of where they were and what was happening the lawyers arrived and they talked to them for an hour nbcs dateline was there with a camera recording everything jim dwyer with the new york daily news had arrived with barry scheck they were packed in the small interview room on the east side of the jail facing the courthouse at one point ron stretched out on the floor looked through the glass door and rested his head in his hand finally someone asked hey ron what are you doing waiting on peterson he said the courthouse lawn was crawling with reporters and cameras one happened to catch bill peterson who agreed to an interview when ron saw the prosecutor in front of the courthouse he yelled at the door you fat rascal we beat you peterson denniss mother and daughter surprised him at the jail though he and elizabeth had maintained an active correspondence and she had sent him many photos he was unprepared for what he saw she was a beautiful elegant very mature young lady of twentyfive and he wept uncontrollably as he hugged her there were many tears at the jail that afternoon ron and dennis were placed in separate cells lest they start killing again sheriff glase explained im going to keep them apart i just dont feel right putting two convicted murderers in the same cell together and until the judge says so thats what they are their cells were side by side and so they talked denniss cell mate had a small television and from news reports he heard firsthand that they would be released the following day dennis relayed all this to ron to no ones surprise terri holland was back in jail another layover in her astonishing career as a petty criminal she and ron exchanged words but nothing particularly unpleasant as the night wore one ron lapsed into his old habits he began yelling about his freedom and injustices shouting obscenities at the female inmates and talking loudly to god chapter the exonerations of ron williamson and dennis fritz brought national attention to ada by daybreak on april the courthouse was surrounded by news vans satellite trucks photographers cameramen and reporters the townsfolk drifted over curious at the commotion and anxious to see more so much jockeying had gone on for seats in the courtroom that judge landrith was forced to improvise a lottery system for the reporters and a oneline live feed out of his office window for the news trucks a collection of cameras was waiting outside the jail and when the two defendants emerged they were surrounded ron was wearing a coat and tie dress shirt and slacks that annette had hurriedly bought for him and he had new shoes that were too small and killing his feet denniss mother had brought him a suit but he preferred the street clothes hed been allowed to wear during his last years in prison they quickly made their final walk in handcuffs smiling and bantering with the reporters annette and renee arrived early and took their usual seats front row behind the defense table they held hands and prayed cried and managed a laugh or two it was too early to celebrate they were joined by their children other relatives and some friends wanda and elizabeth fritz sat nearby also holding hands and whispering excitedly the courtroom filled up the carter family sat across the aisle once more dragged into court to suffer through another hearing as the state floundered in its efforts to solve their crime and find justice seventeen years after debbies murder and her first two accused and convicted killers were about to walk the seats were soon filled and the crowd began stacking up along the walls judge landrith had agreed to allow cameras and he herded the photographers and reporters into the jury box where folding chairs were brought in and wedged against each other cops and deputies were everywhere security was tight there had been anonymous phone calls and threats against ron and dennis the courtroom was packed and tension was high lots of cops were present though dennis smith and gary rogers were somewhere else the lawyers arrivedmark sara and barry scheck for the defendants bill peterson nancy shew and chris ross for the state there were smiles and handshakes the state was joining in the motion to dismiss to set the boys free this was a joint effort to right a wrong a rare example of the community coming together at a crucial hour to properly address an injustice one big happy family everyone should be congratulated and take pride in the system that was working so beautifully ron and dennis were brought in and their handcuffs were removed for the last time they sat behind their lawyers a few feet away from their families ron stared straight ahead and saw little dennis though looked at the crowd and saw glum hard faces most of those present did not seem too happy with the prospect of their release judge landrith assumed the bench welcomed everyone and quickly got down to business he asked peterson to call his first witness mary long now the head of the dna unit at the osbi took the stand and began with an overview of the testing process she talked about the different labs that had been used to analyze the hair and semen from the crime scene and the samples from the suspects ron and dennis began to sweat they had thought the hearing would take only a few minutes time enough for judge landrith to dismiss the charges and send them home as the minutes crept by they began to worry ron began to fidget and grumble whats going on sara bonnell scribbled notes to assure him things were fine dennis was a nervous wreck where was the testimony leading could there be another surprise every trip to that courtroom had been a nightmare sitting in it now evoked harrowing memories of lying witnesses and stonefaced jurors and peterson demanding the death penalty dennis made the mistake of again glancing around the courtroom and again did not see many supporters mary long turned to the important material seventeen hairs taken from the crime scene were testedthirteen pubic four scalp ten of the hairs were found on the bed or in the bedding two came from the torn panties three from the washcloth in the victims mouth and two from under her body only four of the seventeen could be matched with a dna profile two belonged to debbie and none came from ron or dennis zero long then testified that the semen samples taken from the bedding the torn panties and the victim had been tested earlier and of course ron and dennis had been excluded she was then excused from the witness stand in melvin hett testified that of the seventeen hairs thirteen were microscopically consistent with the hair of dennis and four with rons samples there was even a match also in his third and final report filed after denniss trial had started hett excluded glen gore from any of the hair his expert testimony was the only direct credible proof the state offered against both ron and dennis and had much to do with their convictions dna testing revealed that one scalp hair found under the body and one pubic hair found in the bedding had been left behind by glen gore also the semen recovered by a vaginal swab during the autopsy was tested its source was glen gore judge landrith knew this but had kept it confidential until the hearing with his approval bill peterson announced the gore findings to a shocked courtroom peterson said your honor this is a very trying time for the criminal justice system this murder happened in it was tried in at that particular time we had evidence that was presented to a jury that convicted dennis fritz and ron williamson by evidence that was in my opinion at that particular time overwhelming without refreshing memories as to what exactly the overwhelming proof had been eleven years earlier he rambled on about how dna now contradicted much of what he had once believed based on the evidence he had left he could not prosecute the two defendants he asked that the motion to dismiss be granted then sat down at no time did peterson offer any conciliatory comments or words of regret or admissions of errors made or even an apology at the least ron and dennis were expecting an apology twelve years of their lives had been stolen by malfeasance human error and arrogance the injustice they had endured could easily have been avoided and the state owed them something as simple as an apology it would never happen and it became an open sore that never healed judge landrith made a few comments about the injustice of it all then asked ron and dennis to stand he announced that all charges were thereby dismissed they were free men free to go there was applause and cheering from a few of the spectators most though were not in the mood to celebrate annette and renee hugged their children and relatives and had another good cry ron bolted from the defense table past the jury box out a side door down the stairs to the front steps of the courthouse where he paused and filled his lungs with cool air then he lit a cigarette the first of a million in the free world and waved it jubilantly at a camera the photo was printed in dozens of newspapers a few minutes later he was back he and dennis their families and lawyers huddled in the courtroom and posed for photos and answered questions from a horde of reporters mark barrett had called greg wilhoit and asked him to fly back to oklahoma for the big day when ron saw greg they embraced like the brothers they were how do you feel mr williamson a reporter asked about what ron shot back then said i feel like my feet are killing me these shoes are too small the questions went on for an hour even though a press conference was planned for later peggy stillwell was helped from the courtroom by her daughters and sisters she was overwhelmed and in shock the family had not been warned of the news of glen gore they were back at the murder scene now waiting for another trial no closer to justice and they were confused most of the family still believed fritz and williamson were guilty but how did gore figure in ron and dennis finally began their exit every step of it duly preserved and recorded the mob crept down the stairs and out the front door they paused for a second free men now and soaked in the sun and chilly air they were liberated free exonerated yet no one had offered an apology an explanation or even a dime in compensationnot a shred of aid of any type it was time for lunch rons favorite place was bobs barbecue north of town annette called ahead and reserved several tables several would be needed because the entourage was growing by the minute though he had only a few teeth left and though it would otherwise have been difficult to eat with so many cameras in his face ron devoured a plateful of pork ribs and wanted more never one to savor his food he did manage to savor the moment he was polite to everyone thanked all the strangers who stopped by to encourage him hugged those who wanted a hug chatted with every reporter who wanted a story he and dennis couldnt stop smiling even with mouths full of barbecue the day before jim dwyer a reporter for the new york daily news and alexandra pelosi of nbcs dateline drove to purcell to find glen gore and ask him some questions gore knew things were heating up over in ada and that he was rapidly becoming the prime suspect but remarkably the prison staff did not gore heard that some outoftowners were looking for him and assumed they were lawyers or law enforcement types people hed rather avoid around noon he walked away from his job cleaning ditches in purcell and escaped he found some woods and walked several miles then stumbled upon a highway and hitchhiked in the general direction of ada when ron and dennis heard of gores escape they howled with laughter he must be guilty after a long lunch the fritzwilliamson group drove to the lodge in wintersmith park in ada for a press conference joined by their lawyers ron and dennis sat behind a long table and faced the cameras scheck talked about the innocence project and its work to free those wrongly convicted mark barrett was asked how the injustice occurred in the first place and he gave a long history of the misguided prosecutionthe fiveyear delay the lazy and suspicious police work the snitches the junk science most of the questions were directed at the two brandnew exonerees dennis said he planned to leave oklahoma go back to kansas city and spend as much time as possible with elizabeth and in due course he would figure out the rest of his life ron had no immediate plans except to get out of ada their panel was joined by greg wilhoit and tim durham another oklahoma exoneree from tulsa tim spent four years in prison for a rape he did not commit before the innocence project secured his release with dna testing at the federal courthouse in muskogee jim payne vicky hildebrand and gail seward quietly suppressed their deep satisfaction there was no celebrationtheir work on the williamson matter was now four years removed and they were kneedeep in other casesbut they nonetheless paused to savor the moment long before dna erased the mysteries they had found the truth the old way with brains and sweat and in doing so had saved the life of an innocent man judge seay wasnt smug either the vindication was sweet but he was much too busy with other matters he had simply done his job that was all though every other judge along the way had failed ron williamson frank seay understood the system and knew its flaws the truth was often hard to find but he was willing to search for it and he knew where to look mark barrett had asked annette to find a place for the press conference and perhaps a little reception something nice in the way of a homecoming for ron and dennis she knew just the placethe fellowship hall of her church the same church in which ronnie grew up the same church where she had played both the piano and the organ for the past forty years the day before she had called her pastor to ask permission and arrange the details he hesitated stuttered a bit then finally said he needed to poll the elders annette smelled trouble and headed for the church when she arrived the pastor said that he had called the elders and it was their opinion and his as well that the church should be offlimits for such an event annette was stunned and asked why there could be violence he explained there were already reports of threats against ron and dennis and things might get out of control the town was buzzing about the release with most folks unhappy with it there were some tough guys on the carter side and well it just wouldnt work but this church has been praying for ronnie for twelve years she reminded him yes indeed and we will continue to do so he said but there are a lot of people who still think hes guilty its too controversial the church could be tainted the answer is no annette became emotional and ran from his office he tried to console her but she would have none of it she left and called renee within minutes gary simmons was driving to ada some three hours from their home near dallas gary drove straight to the church and confronted the pastor who held his ground they argued for a long time but resolved nothing the church was standing firm it was simply too risky ron will be here sunday morning gary said will you recognize him no the pastor said the celebration resumed at annettes house where dinner was served and friends filtered in and out after the dishes were done everyone gathered in the sunroom where an oldfashioned gospel singalong erupted barry scheck a jewish guy from new york heard music hed never heard before and gamely tried to sing along mark barrett was there it was a proud and remarkable moment for him and he didnt want to leave sara bonnell janet chesley and kim marks all sang along greg wilhoit and his sister nancy were there the fritz familydennis elizabeth and wandasat close together and joined in the fun that night everyone stayed around for the celebration party at annettes house renee said there was lots of food singing laughter annette was playing the piano ronnie playing the guitar and the rest of us joining and singing a variety of songs everyone was singing clapping having such a good time then at ten oclock there was silence as the news came on the television we were all sitting in the sunroom walltowall people waiting to hear the news we had longed to hear for so many years announcing to the town that my little brother ronald keith williamson was not only free but innocent although it was such a joyous occasion and we were all so relieved we could see the sickness in ronnies eyes from the many years of being tormented and abused they celebrated again at the tv news report when it was over mark barrett and barry scheck and some of the crowd said their good nights tomorrow would be a very long day later in the evening the phone rang and annette answered it an anonymous caller said the ku klux klan was in the area and looking for ronnie one of the great rumors of the day was that someone on the carter side had bought a contract for a hit on ron and dennis and that the kkk was now in the business of hired killings there were remnants of klan activity in southeastern oklahoma but it had been decades since the group had been suspected of murder they normally didnt target white people but in the heat of the moment the klan was considered the nearest organized gang that might be able to pull off such a hit the call was chilling nonetheless and annette whispered the message to renee and gary they decided to take the threat seriously but try to keep it from ronnie the happiest night of our lives soon became the most terrifying night of our lives renee said we decided to call the ada police they informed us they would be sending no one and there was nothing they could do unless something happened how could we be so naive to think they would protect us in a panic we all ran through the house closing blinds locking windows and doors it was obvious no one was going to sleep because everyones nerves were on edge our soninlaw was worried about his wife and new baby being in such danger we gathered around and prayed and asked the lord to calm our nerves and for the angels to surround our house and protect us we all made it through the night unharmed the lord once again honored our prayers looking back on the night its almost humorous to think our first thought was to call the ada police ann kelley of the ada evening news had a full day covering the events that night she received a call from chris ross assistant district attorney ross was upset and complained that the prosecutors and police were being vilified no one was telling their side of the story early the next morning at the beginning of their first full day of freedom ron and dennis along with their lawyers mark barrett and barry scheck drove to the local holiday inn where an nbc camera crew was setting up they appeared live on the today show with matt lauer doing the interview the story was gaining momentum and most of the reporters were still in ada looking for anyone remotely connected to the case or the people involved in it the gore escape was a wonderful subplot the groupexonerees families lawyersdrove to norman and stopped at the offices of the oklahoma indigent defense system for another party ron said a few words and thanked those who had worked so hard to protect him and eventually free him afterward they hurried to oklahoma city to film a segment of inside edition and then one for a show called burden of proof lawyers scheck and barrett were trying to arrange a meeting with the governor and top legislators to lobby for legislation that would facilitate dna testing and provide compensation for those wrongfully convicted the group went to the state capitol to shake hands and twist arms and hold another press conference the timing was perfect they had the national media following them the governor was working hard and too busy so he sent forth a top aide a creative type who seized upon the idea of having ron and dennis meet with the members of the oklahoma court of criminal appeals it was unclear what this meeting was expected to produce but resentment was certainly a possibility it was friday afternoon though and the judges were likewise hard at work only one ventured out of her chambers to say hello and she was harmless she had not been on the court when it reviewed and affirmed the convictions of fritz and williamson barry scheck left town and headed back to new york mark stayed in norman his home and sara drove to purcell there was a lull in the frenzy and everybody needed a break dennis and his mother stayed in oklahoma city at elizabeth s home riding back to ada with annette behind the wheel ron sat in the front seat for a change no handcuffs no prison stripes no armed deputy watching him he soaked in the countryside the farms and scattered oil rigs and gentle rolling hills of southeast oklahoma he couldnt wait to leave it was almost like we had to reacquaint ourselves with him since hed been out of our lives for so long renee said the next day after he was released we had such a good day with him i told him to bear with us that we had a lot of questions and were very curious about what his life had been like on death row he was very sweet about it and graciously answered our questions for a few hours one of the questions i asked him was what are all those scars on your arms he said i would be so depressed that i would sit and cut myself we asked him what his cell was like was the food edible etcetera but after many questions he looked at all of us and said id rather not talk about it anymore lets talk about something else and we honored his wishes he would sit outside on the patio at annettes house and sing and play his guitar sometimes we could hear him from inside and it was all i could do to hold back the tears listening to him and thinking about what he had been through he would go to the refrigerator and just stand there with the door open looking at what he might want to eat he was amazed at all the food in the house and especially knowing he could eat any and all he wanted he stood at the kitchen window in awe and commented about all the nice cars we were driving some he had never heard of he commented one day while riding in the car how different it was to see people walking and running and going about their busy everyday lives ron was excited about returning to church annette had not told him about the incident with the pastor nor would she ever mark barrett and sara bonnell were invited ron wanted them there with him the entire williamson entourage arrived for the sunday worship hour in a rush and stormed down to the very front row annette was behind the organ as always and when she began the first rather rowdy hymn ron jumped to his feet clapping and singing and smiling truly filled with the spirit during the announcements the pastor made no mention of rons return but during the morning prayer he did manage to say that god loved everyone even ronnie annette and renee boiled with anger a pentecostal worship service is not for the timid and as the music cranked up and the choir began rocking and the congregation got loud a handful of church members made their way over to ron for a hello a hug a welcome back damned few the rest of the good christian folks glared at the murderer in their midst annette left the church that sunday never to return the sunday edition of the ada newspaper ran a frontpage story with the headline prosecutor defends his work on high profile case there was a lawyerly photo of bill peterson behind a podium in court in action for obvious reasons he was not doing too well in the aftermath of the exonerations and felt compelled to share his resentment with the people of ada he was not getting his fair share of the credit for protecting ron and dennis and the lengthy story by ann kelley was nothing but an embarrassing tantrum by a badly beaten prosecutor who should have avoided reporters it began pontotoc county district attorney bill peterson claims dennis fritz and ron williamsons defense attorneys are wrongly taking credit for the dna tests that freed their clients from prison as ann kelley fed him all the rope he needed to hang himself peterson recalled in detail the history of the dna testing in the carter case at every possible opportunity he took cheap shots at mark barrett and barry scheck while never missing a chance to pat himself on the back dna testing was his idea he managed to avoid the obvious not once did he admit that he wanted dna testing so he could nail ron and dennis in their coffins he was so convinced of their guilt that he happily went along with the testing now that the test results had gone the other way he was demanding credit for being such a fair guy the bratlike fingerpointing went on for paragraphs he dropped vague sinister hints about other suspects and gathering more evidence the story read he peterson said if new evidence is found linking fritz and williamson to carters murder double jeopardy would not apply and they could be tried again peterson said the investigation into carters murder has been reopened for some time and glen gore is not the only suspect the story ended with two appalling quotations from peterson the first was i did the right thing in when i tried them by recommending their convictions be dismissed i did what was legally morally and ethically the right thing to do with the evidence i now have against them left unsaid of course was the fact that his highly ethical and utterly moral consent to the dismissal came almost five years after ron was almost executed and four years after peterson publicly rebuked judge seay for ordering a new trial by seizing the high ethical ground at the eleventh hour peterson lamely helped to ensure that ron and dennis spent only twelve years in prison as innocent men the most reprehensible part of the story was the next quotation it was also highlighted and placed in the center of the front page peterson said innocent has never crossed my lips in regards to williamson and fritz this doesnt prove their innocence it just means i cant prosecute them with the evidence i now have ron and dennis were emotional and shaky enough after only four days of freedom and the story terrified them why would peterson want to try them again he had convicted them once and they had no doubt he could do it again new evidence old evidence zero evidence it didnt matter theyd just suffered twelve years behind bars for killing no one but in pontotoc county evidence was not a factor the story infuriated mark barrett and barry scheck and both drafted lengthy rebuttals to fire off to the paper but they wisely waited and after a few days realized few people were listening to peterson on sunday afternoon ron and dennis and their supporters drove to norman at the request of mark barrett with fortuitous timing amnesty international was throwing its annual outdoor rock concert to raise money there was a nice crowd gathered at an outdoor amphitheater the weather was warm and sunny between songs mark barrett spoke then introduced ron dennis greg and tim durham each took a few minutes and shared his experiences though they were nervous and not accustomed to public speaking they found the courage and spoke from their hearts the audience adored them four men four average white guys from good families all chewed up and abused by the system and locked away for a combined total of thirtythree years their message was clear until the system is fixed it could happen to anyone after speaking they lounged around the amphitheater listening to the music eating ice cream basking in the sun and the freedom bruce leba showed up from nowhere and bearhugged his old buddy bruce had not attended ronnies trial nor had he written him in prison he felt guilty for this neglect and he apologized sincerely to his best friend from high school ron was quick to forgive him he was willing to forgive everyone the intoxicating smell of freedom smothered old grudges and fantasies of retribution though he had dreamed of a massive lawsuit for twelve years it was all history now he did not want to relive the nightmares the media could not get enough of their stories ron especially took the spotlight because he was a white man from a white town whod been knocked around by white cops and charged by a white prosecutor and convicted by a white jury he became a large and willing subject for reporters and journalists such abuse might be common for the poor and the minorities but not for smalltown heroes the promising baseball career the ugly slide into insanity on death row the near brush with execution the bumbling cops who couldnt see the obvious killerthe story was rich and layered interview requests poured into mark barretts office from around the world after six days in the bush glen gore turned himself in he contacted an ada lawyer who called the prison and made the arrangements as he was making preparations to surrender he was very specific in his desire to avoid being handled by the authorities in ada he shouldnt have worried the gang that couldnt shoot straight wasnt clamoring to get gore back in ada for another trial time was needed to heal badly wounded egos peterson and the police were posturing behind their official stance that the investigation had been reopened that they were plowing ahead with new enthusiasm to find the killer or perhaps killers gore was but one player in this effort the prosecutor and the police could never admit they were wrong so they clung to the hopeless belief that maybe they were right maybe another drug addict would stumble into the police station and confess or implicate ron and dennis maybe a fine new snitch would appear maybe the cops could pinch another dream confession from a witness or suspect it was ada good solid police work might turn up all sorts of new leads ron and dennis had not been excluded chapter the daily rituals of yankee stadium vary slightly when the team is out of town without the urgency of crowds and cameras and without the expectation of another pristine playing surface the old house creaks slowly to life so that by late morning the groundskeepers in their khaki shorts and ash tshirts are tending the field at a languid pace grantley the chief grass cutter tinkers with a spiderlike toro mower while tommy the clay specialist packs and levels the dirt behind home plate dan pushes a smaller mower across the thick bluegrass along the firstbase line sprinklers erupt at orchestrated intervals around the outfield warning track a tour guide huddles with a group behind the thirdbase dugout and points to something in the distance beyond the scoreboard the fiftyseven thousand seats are empty sounds echo softly around the placethe muffled engine of a small mower the laughter of a groundskeeper the distant hissing of a spray washer cleaning seats in the upper deck the train rumbling by just beyond the rightfield wall the pecking of a hammer near the press box for those who maintain the house that ruth built the off days are cherished wedged between the nostalgia of yankee greatness and the promise of more to come some twentyfive years after he was expected to arrive ron williamson stepped up from the bench in the yankee dugout and onto the brown crushedshell warning track that borders the field he paused to take in the enormity of the stadium to soak in the atmosphere of baseballs holiest shrine it was a brilliantly blue clear spring day the air was light the sun was high the grass so flat and green it could have been a fine carpet the sun warmed his pale skin the smell of freshly cut grass reminded him of other fields other games old dreams he was wearing a yankee cap a souvenir from the front office and because he was a celebrity at the moment in new york for a segment on good morning america with diane sawyer he was wearing his only sport coat the navy blazer annette had hurriedly purchased two weeks earlier and his only tie and pair of slacks the shoes had changed though hed lost interest in clothes though hed once worked in a haberdashery and offered ready opinions about what others wore he didnt care now twelve years of prison garb does that to you under the cap was a bowlcut mess of bright gray hair thick and disheveled ron was now fortysix but looked much older he adjusted the cap then stepped onto the grass he was six feet tall and though his body showed the damage of twenty years of abuse and neglect there were still hints of the great athlete he strolled across foul territory stepped over the dirt base path and headed for the mound where he stood for a moment and gazed up at the endless rows of bright blue seats he gently put his foot on the rubber then shook his head don larsen had pitched the perfect game from this exact spot whitey ford one of his idols had owned this mound he looked over his left shoulder out to right field where the wall seemed too close where roger maris had placed so many fly balls just far enough to clear the fence and far away in deep center beyond the wall he could see the monuments of the greatest yankees mickey was out there mark barrett stood at home plate also wearing a yankee cap and wondered what his client was thinking release a man from prison where hed spent twelve years for nothing with no apologies because no one has the guts to admit wrongdoing no farewells just get the hell out of here and please go as quietly as possible no compensation counseling letter from the governor or any other official no citation for public service two weeks later hes in the midst of a media storm and everybody wants a piece of him remarkably ron was holding no grudges he and dennis were too busy soaking up the richness of their emancipation the grudges would come later long after the media went away barry scheck was near the dugout watching ron and chatting with the others a diehard yankee fan he had made the phone calls that set up the special visit to the stadium he was their host in new york for a few days photos were taken a camera crew filmed ron on the mound then the little tour continued along the firstbase line drifting slowly as their guide rambled on about this yankee and that one ron knew many of the stats and stories no baseball had ever been hit completely out of yankee stadium the guide was saying but mantle got close he bounced one off the facade in right center right up there he said as he pointed to the spot about feet from home plate but the one in washington was further ron said it was feet pitcher was chuck stobbs the guide was impressed a few steps behind ron was annette following along as always sweating the details making the tough decisions cleaning up she was not a baseball fan and at that moment her primary concern was keeping her brother sober he was sore at her because she had not allowed him to get drunk the night before their group included dennis greg wilhoit and tim durham all four exonerees had appeared on good morning america abc was covering the expenses for the trip jim dwyer was there from the new york daily news they stopped in center field on the warning track on the other side was monument park with large busts of ruth and gehrig mantle and dimaggio and dozens of smaller plaques of other great yankees before renovation this little corner of nearsacred ground had actually been in fair territory the guide was saying a gate opened and they walked through the fence onto a brick patio and for a moment it was easy to forget they were in a baseball stadium ron stepped close to the bust of mantle and read his short biography he could still quote the career stats he had memorized as a kid rons last year as a yankee had been at fort lauderdale class a about as far away from monument park as a serious ballplayer could get annette had some old photos of him in a yankee uniform a real one in fact it had once been worn by a real yankee in this very ballpark the big club simply handed them down and as the old uniforms made their sad little trek down the minorleague ladder they collected the battle scars of life in the outposts every pair of pants had been stitched in the knees and rear end every elastic waistband had been downsized enlarged smudged with markers on the inside so the trainers could keep them straight every jersey was stained with grass and sweat fort lauderdale yankees ron made fourteen appearances pitched thirtythree innings won two lost four and got knocked around enough so that the yankees had no trouble cutting him when the season was mercifully over the tour moved on ron paused for a second to sneer at the plaque of reggie jackson the guide was talking about the shifting dimensions of the stadium how it was bigger when ruth played smaller for maris and mantle the film crew tagged along recording scenes that would never survive editing it was amusing annette thought all this attention as a kid and a teenager ronnie had craved the spotlight demanded it and now forty years later cameras were recording every move enjoy the moment she kept telling herself a month earlier hed been locked up in a mental hospital and they were not sure he would ever get out they slowly made their way back to the yankee dugout and killed some time there as ron absorbed the magic of the place for a few final minutes he said to mark barrett i just got a taste of how much fun they were having up here mark nodded but could think of nothing to say all i ever wanted to do was play baseball ron said its the only fun ive ever had he paused and looked around then said you know this all sort of washes over you after a while what i really want is a cold beer the drinking began in new york from yankee stadium the victory lap stretched to disney world where a german television company paid for three nights of fun for the entire entourage all ron and dennis had to do was tell their story and the germans with typical european fascination with the death penalty recorded every detail rons favorite part of disney world was epcot at the german village where he found bavarian beer and knocked back one stein after another they flew to los angeles for a live appearance on the leeza show shortly before airtime ron sneaked away and drained a pint of vodka without most of his teeth his words were not crisp to begin with and no one noticed his slightly thick tongue as the days passed the story lost some of its urgency and the groupron annette mark dennis elizabeth and sara bonnell headed home the last place ron wanted to be was ada he stayed with annette and began the difficult process of trying to adjust the reporters eventually went away under annettes constant supervision he was diligent with his medications and stable he slept a lot played his guitar and dreamed of becoming famous as a singer she did not tolerate alcohol in her home and he seldom left it the fear of being arrested and sent back to prison consumed him and forced him to instinctively glance over his shoulder and jump at any loud noise ron knew the police had not forgotten about him they still believed he was somehow involved in the murder so did most folks in ada he wanted to get out but had no money he was unable to hold a job and never talked about employment he hadnt had a drivers license in almost twenty years and wasnt particularly interested in studying a drivers manual and taking tests annette was arguing with the social security administration in an effort to collect the back payments for his disability the checks stopped when he went to prison she finally prevailed and the lump sum award was his monthly benefits of were reinstated payable until his disability was removed an unlikely event overnight he felt like a millionaire and wanted to live on his own he was also desperate to leave ada and oklahoma too annettes only child michael was living in springfield missouri and they hatched the plan to move ron there they spent on a new furnished twobedroom mobile home and moved him in though it was a proud moment annette was worried about ron living by himself when she finally left him he was sitting in his new recliner watching his new television a very happy man when she returned three weeks later to check on him he was still sitting in his recliner with a disheartening collection of empty beer cans piled around it when he wasnt sleeping drinking talking on the phone or playing his guitar he was loitering at a nearby walmart his source for beer and cigarettes but something happened an incident and he was asked to spend his time elsewhere in those heady days of being on his own he became fixated on repaying all those whod loaned him money over the years saving money seemed like a ridiculous idea and he began giving it away he was moved by appeals on televisionstarving children evangelists about to lose their entire ministries and so on he sent money his telephone bills were enormous he called annette and renee mark barrett sara bonnell greg wilhoit the indigent defense system lawyers judge landrith bruce leba even some prison officials he was usually upbeat happy to be free but by the end of every conversation he was ranting about ricky joe simmons he was not impressed by the dna trail left by glen gore ron wanted simmons arrested immediately for the rape rape by instrumentation and rape by forcible sodomy and murder of debra sue carter at her home at east th street december the th every conversation included at least two recitations of this detailed demand oddly enough ron also called peggy stillwell and the two developed a cordial relationship by phone he assured her he had never met debbie and peggy believed him eighteen years after losing her daughter she was still unable to say goodbye she confessed to ron that for years shed had a nagging suspicion that the murder was not really solved as a general rule he avoided bars and loose women though one episode burned him walking down the street tending to his own business a car with two ladies stopped and he got in they went out for a round of barhopping the night grew long and they retired to his trailer where one of his companions found his stash of cash under his bed when he later discovered the theft of he swore off women altogether michael hudson was his only friend in springfield and he encouraged his nephew to buy a guitar and taught him a few chords michael checked on him regularly and reported to his mother the drinking was getting worse the booze and his medications did not mix well and he became extremely paranoid the sight of a police car provoked serious attacks of anxiety he refused to even jaywalk thinking the cops were always watching peterson and the ada police were up to something he taped newspapers over the windows padlocked his doors then taped them too from the inside he slept with a butchers knife mark barrett visited him twice and slept over he was alarmed at rons condition his paranoia and drinking and he was particularly worried about the knife ron was lonely and terrified dennis fritz wasnt jaywalking either he returned to kansas city and moved in with his mother in the little house on lister avenue when he had last seen it the house had been surrounded by a dejected swat team months after their release glen gore had not been charged the investigation was plodding along in some direction and as dennis understood things he and ron were still suspects dennis flinched at the sight ofa police car he watched his back whenever he left the house he jumped when the phone rang he drove to springfield to visit ronnie and was startled by the extent of his drinking they tried to laugh and reminisce for a couple of days but ronnie was drinking too much he wasnt a mean drunk or an emotional one just a loud and unpleasant one he would sleep until noon wake up pop a top have a beer for breakfast and lunch and start playing his guitar they were driving around one afternoon drinking beer and enjoying their freedom ron was playing his guitar dennis was driving very carefully he did not know springfield and the last thing he wanted was trouble with the cops ron decided they should stop at a certain nightclub where he would somehow talk his way into a gig that night dennis thought this was a bad idea especially since ron was not familiar with the club and didnt know the owner or bouncers a heated argument ensued and they made their way back to the trailer ron dreamed of being onstage he wanted to perform for thousands and sell albums and become famous dennis was reluctant to tell him that with his scratchy voice and damaged vocal chords and marginal talent with the guitar it was nothing more than a dream he did however press ron to cut back on the booze he suggested that ron mix in a nonalcoholic beer every now and then with his daily onslaught of budweiser and lay off the hard stuff he was getting fat and dennis urged him to exercise and stop smoking ron listened but kept drinking real beer after three days dennis left for kansas city he returned a few weeks later with mark barrett who was passing through they drove ron to a coffeehouse where he took to the tiny stage with his guitar and sang bob dylan songs for tips though the crowd was small and more interested in eating than listening ron was performing and quite happy to stay busy and earn something dennis found a parttime job grilling hamburgers for minimum wage since hed kept his nose in law books for the past twelve years he found the habit hard to break barry scheck encouraged him to consider law school and even promised to help with the tuition the university of missourikansas city was nearby with a law school and flexible classes dennis began studying for the admissions test but was soon overwhelmed he was suffering from posttraumatic stress of some variety and at times the pressure was debilitating the horror of prison was always therenightmares and flashbacks and fears of being arrested again the murder investigation was ongoing and with the ada cops running loose there was always the chance of the midnight knock on the door or maybe even another assault from a swat team dennis eventually sought professional help and slowly he began putting his life together barry scheck was talking about a lawsuit a massive claim against those whod created and carried out the injustice anddennis focused on the idea there was a new fight on the horizon and he geared up for it rons life was headed in the opposite direction he was acting strange and the neighbors noticed then he began carrying the butchers knife through the mobile home park claiming that peterson and the ada cops were after him he was protecting himself and not going back to prison annette received an eviction notice when ronnie refused to answer her calls she obtained a court order to have him picked up for a mental evaluation he was in his trailer doors and windows taped and covered drinking a beer and watching television when he suddenly heard words squawk from a bullhorn come out with your hands up he peeked outside saw the cops and thought his life was over again he was going back to death row the police were as afraid of him as he was of them but both sides eventually found common ground ron was taken not to death row but instead to a mental hospital for evaluation the trailer less than a year old but quite a mess was sold when he was released from the hospital annette searched for a place to put him the only bed she could find was in a nursing home outside of springfield she drove to the hospital packed him up and moved him into the dallas county care center the daily structure and regular care were at first welcome his pills were taken on time and alcohol was forbidden ron felt better but soon grew weary of being surrounded by old and frail seniors in wheelchairs he began complaining and was soon unbearable so annette found another room in marshfield missouri it too was filled with sad old folks ron was only fortyseven what the hell was he doing in a nursing home he asked this question over and over and annette finally decided to bring him back to oklahoma he would not return to ada not that anyone wanted him to in oklahoma city annette found a bed at the harbor house an old motel that had been converted into a home for men who were transitioning from one phase of life to something that was hopefully better no alcohol was allowed and ron had been sober for months mark barrett visited him several times at harbor house and knew ron couldnt stay there very long no one could most of the other men were zombielike and scarred worse than ron months passed and glen gore was not charged with murder the new investigation was proving to be as fruitful as the old one eighteen years earlier the ada police the prosecutors and the osbi had infallible dna proof that the source of the crime scene semen and hair was glen gore but they just couldnt solve the murder more proof was needed ron and dennis had not been ruled out as suspects and though they were free men and thrilled to be so there was always a dark cloud hanging over them they talked weekly and sometimes daily to each other and to their lawyers after a year of living in fear they decided to fight back had bill peterson the ada police and the state of oklahoma apologized for the injustice and closed the books on ron williamson and dennis fritz the authorities would have taken the honorable course and ended a sad story instead they got themselves sued in april coplaintiffs dennis fritz and ron williamson filed suit against half the state of oklahoma the defendants were the city of ada pontotoc county bill peterson dennis smith john christian mike tenney glen gore terri holland james harjo the state of oklahoma the osbi osbi employees gary rogers rusty featherstone melvin hett jerry peters and larry mullins and the department of corrections officials gary maynard dan reynolds james saffle and larry fields the lawsuit was filed in federal court as a civil rights case alleging violations under the fourth fifth sixth eighth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution it was randomly assigned to none other than judge frank seay who would later recuse himself the lawsuit claimed that defendants failed to provide the plaintiffs with a fair trial by fabricating evidence and withholding exculpatory evidence conspired to falsely arrest and maliciously prosecute the plaintiffs engaged in deceitful conduct intentionally inflicted emotional distress acted negligently in prosecuting the plaintiffs and initiated and maintained a malicious prosecution the claim against the prison system alleged that ron was mistreated while on death row and that his mental illness was ignored by officials who were repeatedly put on notice the lawsuit demanded million in damages bill peterson was quoted in the ada newspaper as saying in my opinion its a frivolous lawsuit to attract attention im not worried about it he also reaffirmed that the investigation into the homicide continues the lawsuit was filed by barry schecks firm and a kansas city lawyer named cheryl pilate mark barrett would join the team later when he left the indigent defense system and entered private practice civil suits for wrongful convictions are extremely difficult to win and most exonerees are shut out from the courthouse being wrongfully convicted does not automatically give one the right to sue a potential plaintiff must claim and prove that his civil rights were violated that his constitutional protections were breached and that this resulted in a wrongful conviction then the difficult part virtually everyone involved in the legal process that led to the bad conviction is cloaked with immunity a judge is immune from a wrongful conviction lawsuit regardless of how poorly he handled the trial a prosecutor is immune as long as he does his jobthat is as long as he prosecutes if however he gets too involved in the investigation then he might become liable and a policeman is immune unless it can be shown that his actions were so wrong that any reasonable law enforcement officer would have known that he was violating the constitution such lawsuits are ruinously expensive to maintain with the plaintiffs attorneys forced to front tens even hundreds of thousands of dollars in litigation costs and they are almost too risky to file because recovery is such a long shot most wrongfully convicted people like greg wilhoit never receive a dime rons next stop in july was the transition house in norman a wellestablished facility that offered men a structured environment counseling and training its goal was to rehabilitate its patients to the point of allowing them to live on their own with supervision from counselors the ultimate goal was assimilation back into the community as productive and stable citizens phase one was a twelvemonth program in which the men lived in dorms with roommates and plenty of rules one of the first training exercises was to teach them how to use transit buses and move around the city cooking cleaning and personal hygiene were also taught and emphasized ron could scramble eggs and make a peanut butter sandwich he preferred to stay near his room and ventured outside only to smoke after four months he had not figured out the bus system rons childhood sweetheart was a girl named debbie keith her father was a minister who wanted his daughter to marry a minister and ron didnt come close her brother mickey keith followed his father and was the pastor at the evangelistic temple annettes new church in ada at rons request and annettes urging reverend keith drove to norman to the transition house ron was serious about rejoining the church and cleaning up his life at his core was a deep belief in god and jesus christ he would never forget the scriptures hed memorized as a child nor the gospel hymns he loved despite his mistakes and shortcomings he was desperate to return to his roots he carried a nagging sense of guilt for the way hed lived but he believed in jesuss promise of divine eternal and complete forgiveness reverend keith talked and prayed with ron and discussed some paperwork he explained that if ron really wanted to join the church he needed to fill out an application in which he stated that he was a bornagain christian that he would support the church with his tithes and with his presence when able and that he would never bring reproach upon the church ron was quick to fill out and sign the form it was taken to the church board discussed and approved he was quite content for a few months he was clean and sober determined to kick the habit with gods help he joined alcoholics anonymous and seldom missed a meeting his medications were balanced and his family and friends enjoyed his company he was funny and loud always ready with a quick retort or a humorous story to startle strangers he enjoyed beginning a new tale with back when i was on death row his family stayed as close as possible and were often amazed at his ability to recall minute details of events that happened when he was literally out of his mind the transition house was near downtown norman an easy walk to mark barretts office and ron dropped in often the lawyer and the client drank coffee talked about music and discussed the lawsuit rons primary interest in the litigation not surprisingly was when it might be settled and how much money he might get mark invited ron to attend his church a disciples of christ congregation in norman ron joined a sunday school class with marks wife and became fascinated with the open and liberal discussions about the bible and christianity anything could be questioned unlike in the pentecostal churches where the word was exact and infallible and contrary views were frowned upon ron spent most of his time on his music practicing a bob dylan song or one from eric clapton until he could closely imitate it and he got hired he landed some gigs in coffee shops and cafes around norman and oklahoma city playing for tips and taking requests from the slim crowds he was fearless his vocal range was limited but he didnt care ron would try any song the oklahoma coalition to abolish the death penalty invited him to sing and speak at a fundraiser held at the firehouse a popular hangout near the ou campus in front of two hundred people a much larger crowd than what he normally saw he was overwhelmed and stood too far from the microphone he was barely heard but appreciated nonetheless during the evening he met dr susan sharp a criminology professor at ou and an active death penalty abolitionist she invited him to visit her class and he readily accepted the two became friends though ron soon considered dr sharp his girlfriend she worked to keep things on a friendly professional level she saw a deeply scarred and wounded man and she was determined to help him romance was not an option and he was not aggressive he progressed through phase one at transition house then graduated to the second phasehis own apartment annette and renee prayed fervently that he would be able to live by himself they tried not to think about a future of nursing homes halfway houses and mental hospitals if he could survive in phase two then the next step might be to find a job he held things together for a month or so then he slowly fell apart away from structure and supervision he began to neglect his medication he really wanted a cold beer his hangout became a campus bar called the deli the kind of place that attracted hard drinkers and kids from the counterculture ron became a regular and as always he was not a pleasant drunk on october ron gave his deposition in his lawsuit the room at the stenographers office in oklahoma city was packed with lawyers all waiting to quiz the man whod become a celebrity in the area after a few preliminary questions the first defense lawyer asked ron are you on any type of medication yes i am and is that medication that a physician has prescribed or directed you to take a psychiatrist yes do you have either a list or do you have information as to what medication you are taking today i know what im taking and what is that im taking depakote milligrams four times a day zyprexa in the evening once a day and wellbutrin one time a day what do you understand the medication is for well depakote is for mood swings and wellbutrin is for depression and zyprexa is for voices and hallucinations okay one of the things that were certainly interested in today is the effect that the medication may have on your ability to remember does it well i dont know you havent asked anything for me to remember yet the deposition proceeded for several hours and left him exhausted bill peterson as a defendant filed a motion for summary judgment a routine legal maneuver designed to get himself removed from the lawsuit the plaintiffs claimed that petersons immunity was dissolved when he stepped outside his role of prosecutor and began running the criminal investigation into the murder of debbie carter they alleged two clear examples of evidence fabrication by peterson the first came from glen gores affidavit prepared to be used in the civil suit in which gore stated that bill peterson actually came to his cell in the pontotoc county jail and threatened him if he didnt testify against ron williamson peterson according to the affidavit said that gore had better hope that his fingerprints did not show up in debbie carters apartment and that he just might be coming after gore the second instance of creating evidence again alleged by the plaintiffs involved the reprinting of debbie carters palm peterson admitted that he met with jerry peters larry mullins and the ada investigators in january to discuss the palm print peterson expressed the opinion that he was at the end of my rope with regard to the investigation peterson suggested that a better print could be obtained some four and a half years after the burial and asked mullins and peters to take a second look the body was then exhumed the palm reprinted and the experts suddenly had new opinions lawyers for ron and dennis hired their own fingerprint expert a mr bill bailey who determined that mullins and peters arrived at their new conclusions by analyzing different areas of the palm print bailey concluded his own analysis by stating that the source of the print on the wall was not debbie carter after all the federal judge denied petersons motion for summary judgment saying a legitimate question of fact exists as to whether peterson peters and mullins as well as others engaged in a systematic pattern of fabrication in order to obtain the conviction of williamson and fritz the judge went on to say in this case the circumstantial evidence indicates a concerted pattern by the various investigators and peterson to deprive plaintiffs of one or more of their constitutional rights the repeated omission of exculpatory evidence by investigators while including inculpatory evidence inclusion of debatably fabricated evidence failure to follow obvious and apparent leads which implicated other individuals and the use of questionable forensic conclusions suggests that the involved defendants were acting deliberately toward the specific end result prosecution of williamson and fritz without regard to the warning signs along the way that their end result was unjust and not supported by the facts of their investigation the ruling which came on february was a major blow to the defense and changed the momentum of the lawsuit for years renee had tried to convince annette that she should leave ada the people would always be suspicious of ron and whisper about his sister their church had rejected him the pending lawsuit against the town and the county would create more resentment annette resisted because ada was her home her brother was innocent she had learned to ignore the whispers and stares and she could continue to hold her ground but the lawsuit worried her after almost two years of intense pretrial discovery mark barrett and barry scheck felt the tide was turning in their favor settlement negotiations were on and off but there was a general feeling among the lawyers on both sides that the case would not go to trial perhaps it was time for a change in april after sixty years annette left ada she moved to tulsa where she had relatives and soon thereafter her brother arrived to live with her she was eager to get him out of norman ron was drinking again and when drunk he could not keep his mouth shut he bragged about his lawsuit his many lawyers the millions he would collect from those whod unjustly sent him to death row and so on he was hanging around the deli and other bars and attracting attention from the sorts of people who would quickly become his best friends when the cash arrived he moved in with annette and soon learned that her new home in tulsa had the same rules as her old one in ada specifically no drinking he sobered up joined her church and became close to her pastor there was a mens biblestudy group called light for the lost that raised money for mission trips to poor countries their favorite fundraiser was a monthly steakandpotato dinner and ron joined the crew in the kitchen his assignment was wrapping baking potatoes in foil a job he enjoyed in the fall of the frivolous lawsuit was settled for several million dollars with careers and egos to protect the numerous defendants insisted on a confidential settlement agreement whereby they and their insurers handed over large sums of money without admitting they had done anything wrong the secret deal was buried in a locked file and protected with a federal court order its details were soon thrashed about in the coffee shops of ada where the city council was forced to disclose the fact that it had forked over from a rainyday reserve for its portion of the total settlement as the gossip roared around town the amounts varied from cafe to cafe but it was widely believed to be in the million range the ada evening news using unnamed sources actually printed this amount because ron and dennis had not been cleared as suspects many of the good folks of ada still believed they were involved in the killing that they were now profiting so handsomely from their crime caused even more resentment mark barrett and barry scheck insisted that their clients take an initial lump sum then a monthly annuity to protect their settlement dennis bought a new home in a suburb of kansas city he took care of his mother and elizabeth and buried the rest of it in the bank ron was not quite so prudent he convinced annette to help him buy a condo near her home and their church they spent on a nice twobedroom unit and ron once again struck out on his own he was stable for a few weeks if for some reason annette couldnt drive him ron happily walked to church but tulsa was familiar turf and before long he was back in the strip clubs and bars where he bought drinks for everyone and tipped the girls thousands of dollars the money along with his big mouth attracted all sorts of friends both new and old many of whom took advantage of him he was generous to a fault and thoroughly clueless about managing his new fortune fifty thousand dollars evaporated before annette could rein him in near his condo was a neighborhood bar called the bounty a quiet little pub where guy wilhoit gregs father was a regular they met became drinking buddies and enjoyed hours of lively conversation about greg and the old ghosts from death row guy told the bartenders and the owner of the bounty that ron was a special friend of his and gregs and that if he ever ran into trouble as was his custom to call him guy not the cops they promised to protect ron but ron couldnt stay away from the strip clubs his favorite was lady godivas and there he became infatuated with a certain dancer only to learn that she was already spoken for didnt matter when he found out she had a family and was homeless he invited them to his place and offered the spare bedroom upstairs the stripper her two kids and their alleged father all moved into mr williamsons nice new condo but there were no groceries ron called annette with a long list of necessities and she reluctantly went to the store and bought them when she made the delivery ron was nowhere to be found upstairs the stripper and her family were locked in the bedroom hiding from rons sister and wouldnt come out annette delivered the ultimatum loudly through the door and threatened criminal action if they didnt leave immediately they fled and ron missed them greatly the adventures continued until annette as legal guardian finally intervened with a court order they fought again over the money but ron knew what was best the condo was sold and ron went to another nursing home he was not abandoned by his true friends dennis fritz knew ron was struggling to find a stable routine he suggested that ron come to kansas city and live with him he would monitor rons medication and diet make him exercise and force him to cut back on the drinking and smoking dennis had discovered health foods vitamins supplements herbal teas and such and was anxious to try some products on his friend they talked about the move for weeks but annette eventually vetoed it greg wilhoit now a fullfledged californian and raging death penalty abolitionist begged ronnie to move to sacramento where the living was easy and laidback and the past was truly forgotten ron loved the idea but it was more fun to talk about than to actually pursue bruce leba found ron and offered him a room something hed done many times in the past annette approved and ron moved in with bruce who at the time was driving a truck ron rode shotgun and thoroughly enjoyed the freedom of the open highways annette predicted that the arrangement would last no more than three months which was rons average every routine and every place soon bored him and three months later he and bruce argued over something neither could remember ron moved back to tulsa stayed with annette for a few weeks then rented a small hotel suite for three months in two years after the release of dennis and ron and almost nineteen years after the murder the ada police concluded the investigation then two more years passed before glen gore was moved from the prison at lexington and put on trial for a host of reasons bill peterson did not prosecute the case standing before a jury and pointing to the defendant and saying something like glen gore you deserve to die for what you did to debbie carter would have been a hard sell since hed pointed at two other men and made the same accusation peterson begged off on conflictofinterest grounds but sent his assistant chris ross to sit at the states table and take notes a special prosecutor was sent in from oklahoma city richard wintory who armed with the dna results got an easy conviction after hearing the details of gores long and violent criminal record the jury had no trouble recommending the death penalty dennis refused to follow the trial but ron couldnt ignore it he called judge landrith every day and said tommy you gotta get ricky joe simmons tommy forget gore ricky joe simmons is the real killer one nursing home led to another once he grew bored with a new place or wore out his welcome the phone calls would start and annette would scramble to find another facility willing to care for him then she would pack him up and make the move some of the homes reeked of disinfectant and looming death while others were warm and welcoming he was in a pleasant one in the town of howe when dr susan sharp paid him a visit ron had been sober for weeks and felt great they drove to a lakeside park near the town and went for a walk the day was cloudless the air cool and crisp he was like a little boy dr sharp said happy to be outside in the sun on a beautiful day when he was sober and medicated he was a delight to be with that night they had a date dinner in a nearby restaurant ron was quite proud of himself because he was treating a nice lady to a steak dinner chapter the severe stomach pains began in the early fall of ron felt bloated and was uncomfortable sitting or lying down walking helped some but the pain was increasing he was always tired and couldnt sleep he roamed the halls of his latest nursing home at all hours of the night trying to find relief from the pressure building around his stomach annette was two hours away and hadnt seen him in a month though she had heard his complaints by phone when she picked him up for a visit to the dentist she was shocked at the size of his stomach he looked ten months pregnant she said they vetoed the dentist and went straight to a hospital emergency room in seminole from there they were sent to a hospital in tulsa where the following day ron was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver inoperable untreatable no chance of a transplant it was another death sentence and a painful one at that an optimistic forecast gave him six months he had lived fiftyone years and at least fourteen of those had been behind bars with no opportunity to drink since his release five years earlier he had certainly hit the bottle but there had also been long periods of complete sobriety as he fought alcoholism cirrhosis seemed a little premature annette asked the tough questions and the answers were not easy in addition to all the booze there was a history of illicit drug use though very little since his release a likely contributing cause was the history of medications for at least half of his life ron had consumed at various times and in varying amounts potent doses of very strong psychotropic drugs perhaps he had a weak liver to begin with it didnt matter now once again annette called renee with news that was hard to believe the doctors drained off several gallons of fluid and the hospital asked annette to find another place for him she was turned down by seven facilities before finding a room at the broken arrow nursing home there the nurses and staff welcomed ronnie like an old member of the family it was soon apparent to annette and renee that six months was an unrealistic prediction ron faded quickly with the exception of his grossly swollen midsection the rest of his body withered and shrank he had no appetite and finally stopped smoking and drinking as his liver rapidly shut down the pain became excruciating he was never comfortable and spent hours walking slowly around his room and up and down the hallways of the nursing home the family circled the wagons and spent as much time with him as possible annette was nearby but renee and gary and their children were living near dallas they made the fivehour drive as often as possible mark barrett visited his client several times he was a busy lawyer but ron had always taken priority they talked about death and life after it about god and the promise of salvation through christ ron was facing death with almost perfect contentment it was something he looked forward to and had for many years he had no fear of dying he was not bitter he regretted many of the things hed done the mistakes hed made the pain hed caused but he had sincerely asked god for forgiveness and it had been granted he carried no grudges though bill peterson and ricky joe simmons were strung along almost until the end he eventually forgave them too the next visit mark brought up the subject of music and ron rambled for hours about his new career and how much fun he would have when he got out of the nursing home the illness wasnt mentioned nor was the part about dying annette delivered his guitar but he found it difficult to play instead he asked her to sing their favorite hymns rons last performance was at the nursing home during a karaoke session he somehow found the energy to sing the nurses and many of the other patients by then knew his story and cheered him on afterward with the recorded music playing in the background he danced with both of his sisters unlike most dying patients with time to think and plan ron did not clamor for a minister to hold his hand and hear his final confessions and prayers he knew the scriptures as well as any preacher his foundation in the gospel was solid perhaps hed strayed more than most but he was sorry for that and it was forgotten he was ready there had been a few bright moments in his five years of freedom but it had generally been unpleasant he had moved seventeen times and had proven on several occasions that he could not live alone what future did he have he was a burden on annette and renee he had been someones burden for most of his life and he was tired since death row he had told annette many times that he wished hed never been born and that he wanted desperately to just go ahead and die he was ashamed of the misery he had caused especially to their parents and he wanted to go see them to say he was sorry to be with them forever soon after his release she found him standing in her kitchen one day trancelike staring through a window he grabbed her hand and said pray with me annette pray that the lord will just take me home right now it was a prayer she couldnt complete when greg wilhoit arrived for the thanksgiving holidays he spent ten straight days with ronnie though ron was rapidly slipping away and heavily sedated with morphine they talked for hours about life on the row horrible as always but now the source of some belated humor by november oklahoma was executing condemned men at a record pace and many of their old neighbors had finally been laid to rest ron knew a few would be in heaven when he got there most would not he told greg that he had seen the best of life and the worst there was nothing else he cared to see and he was ready to go he was completely at peace with the lord greg said he had no fear of death he just wanted to get it over with when greg said goodbye ron was barely conscious the morphine was being used generously and death was only days away rons quick demise caught many of his friends off guard dennis fritz passed through tulsa but couldnt find the nursing home he planned to return soon for a visit but didnt make it in time bruce leba was working out of state and had temporarily lost contact almost at the last moment barry scheck paid a visit by phone dan clark an investigator who had worked on the civil case rigged up a speakerphone and barrys voice filled the room it was a oneway conversation ron was heavily medicated and almost dead barry promised to be there soon to catch up on the gossip and so on he got a smile from ron and a laugh from the others when he said and ronnie if you dont make it i promise you well eventually get ricky joe simmons when the visiting was over the family was called in three years earlier taryn simon a noted photographer traveled the country profiling exonerees for a book she planned to publish she took pictures of ron and dennis and included a short summary of their case each was asked to write or say a few words to accompany his photograph ron said i hope i go to neither heaven nor hell i wish that at the time of my death that i could go to sleep and never wake up and never have a bad dream eternal rest like youve seen on some tombstones thats what i hope for because i dont want to go through the judgment i dont want anybody judging me again i asked myself what was the reason for my birth when i was on death row if i was going to have to go through all that what was even the reason for my birth i almost cursed my mother and dadit was so bad for putting me on this earth if i had it all to do over again i wouldnt be born from the innocents umbrage faced with death though ron retreated slightly he very much wanted to spend eternity in heaven on december annette and renee and their families gathered around his bed for the last time and said goodbye three days later a crowd assembled at the hayhurst funeral home in broken arrow for the memorial service rons pastor the reverend ted heaston officiated the celebration of his life charles story rons chaplain from prison spoke and recalled some warm anecdotes of their time together at mcalester mark barrett delivered a moving eulogy about their special friendship cheryl pilate read a letter sent in by barry scheck who was occupied with not one but two exonerations elsewhere the casket was open the pale grayhaired old man was resting peacefully his baseball jacket glove and bat were arranged on the casket and beside it was his guitar the music included two gospel classics ill fly away and he set me free hymns ron learned as a child and sang his entire life at revivals and church camps at his mothers funeral with chains around his ankles at death row during his darkest days at annettes the night he was set free toetapping music the songs loosened up the crowd and made everyone smile the service was sad obviously but there was a strong sense of relief a tragic life was over and the one whod lived it had now gone on to better things this was what ronnie had prayed for he was finally free later that afternoon his mourners reassembled in ada for the burial a heartwarming number of the familys friends from the town gathered to honor his passing out of respect to the carter family annette chose a different cemetery from the one where debbie was buried it was a cold and windy day december exactly twentytwo years since debbie was last seen alive the coffin was hauled into place by the pallbearers a group that included bruce leba and dennis fritz after a few final words from a local minister a prayer and some more tears the last farewell was given permanently etched on his tombstone are the words ronald keith williamson born february died december authors note strong survivor wrongly convicted in exonerated april two days after ron williamson was buried i was flipping through the new york times when i saw his obituary the headlineronald williamson freed from death row dies at was compelling enough but the lengthy obituary written by jim dwyer had the clear makings of a much longer story there was a striking photo of ron standing in the courtroom the day he was exonerated looking a bit perplexed and relieved and perhaps even a little smug somehow i had missed the story of his release in and i had never heard of ron williamson or dennis fritz i read it a second time not in my most creative moment could i conjure up a story as rich and as layered as rons and as i would soon learn the obituary barely scratched the surface within a few hours i had talked to his sisters annette and renee and suddenly i had a book on my hands writing nonfiction has seldom crossed my mindive had far too much fun with the novelsand i had no idea what i was getting into the story and the research and writing of it consumed the next eighteen months it took me to ada many times to the courthouse and jail and coffee shops around town to both the old death row and the new one at mcalester to asher where i sat in the bleachers for two hours and talked baseball with murl bowen to the offices of the innocence project in new york to a cafe in seminole where i had lunch with judge frank seay to yankee stadium to the prison in lexington where i spent time with tommy ward and to norman my base where i hung out with mark barrett and talked about the story for hours i met dennis fritz in kansas city annette and renee in tulsa and when i could convince greg wilhoit to come home from california we toured big mac where he saw his old cell for the first time since he left it fifteen years earlier with every visit and every conversation the story took a different twist i couldve written five thousand pages the journey also exposed me to the world of wrongful convictions something that i even as a former lawyer had never spent much time thinking about this is not a problem peculiar to oklahoma far from it wrongful convictions occur every month in every state in this country and the reasons are all varied and all the samebad police work junk science faulty eyewitness identifications bad defense lawyers lazy prosecutors arrogant prosecutors in the cities the workloads of criminologists are staggering and often give rise to less than professional procedures and conduct and in the small towns the police are often untrained and unchecked murders and rapes are still shocking events and people want justice and quickly they citizens and jurors trust their authorities to behave properly when they dont the result is ron williamson and dennis fritz and tommy ward and karl fontenot both are now serving life terms tommy might one day be eligible for parole but through a procedural quirk karl will never be they cannot be saved by dna because there is no biological evidence the killer or killers of denice haraway will never be found not by the police anyway for more on their story go to wwwwardandfontenotcom while researching this book i came across two other matters both relevant to ada in a man named calvin lee scott was put on trial for rape in the pontotoc county courthouse the victim was a young widow who was attacked in her bed as she slept and because the rapist kept a pillow over her face she could not identify him a hair expert from the osbi testified that two crime scene pubic hairs were microscopically consistent with samples taken from calvin lee scott who vehemently denied any guilt the jury felt otherwise and he was sentenced to twentyfive years in prison he served twenty and was released he was out ofjail when dna testing exonerated him in the case was investigated by dennis smith bill peterson was the district attorney also in ada s former assistant chief of police dennis corvin pleaded guilty to federal charges of manufacturing and distributing methamphetamine and was sent away for six years corvin as you might recall was the ada policeman mentioned by glen gore in his affidavit signed some twenty years after their alleged drugdealing ventures ada is a nice town and the obvious question is when will the good guys clean house perhaps when they get tired of paying for bad prosecutions twice in the past two years the city of ada has raised property taxes to replenish the reserve funds used to settle the lawsuits filed by ron and dennis in a cruel insult these taxes are paid by all property owners including many members of debbie carters family it is impossible to calculate the total amount of money wasted oklahoma spends about a year to house an inmate ignoring the extra cost of death row and treatment in state mental hospitals rons tab was at least same for dennis add the amounts they received in the civil suit and the math becomes easy its safe to say that several million dollars were wasted because of their cases these sums do not begin to contemplate the thousands of hours spent by the appellate lawyers who worked so diligently to free the men nor do they include the time wasted by the states lawyers trying to execute them every dollar spent prosecuting and defending them was mailed in by the taxpayers but there were some savings barney ward was paid a whopping to defend ron and as you remember judge jones denied barneys request for money to hire a forensic expert to evaluate the states evidence greg saunders received the same fee he too was denied access to an expert the taxpayers had to be protected the financial waste was frustrating enough but the human toll was far more damaging obviously rons mental problems were greatly exacerbated by the wrongful conviction and once freed he never recovered most exonerees do not dennis fritz is a lucky one he had the courage and the intelligence and eventually the money to put his life back together he lives a quiet normal and prosperous life in kansas city and last year became a grandfather of the other characters bill peterson is still the district attorney in ada two of his assistants are nancy shew and chris ross one of his investigators is gary rogers dennis smith retired from the ada police department in and died suddenly on june barney ward died in the summer of as i was writing the book and i never had the chance to interview him judge ron jones was voted out of office in and left the ada area glen gore is still housed on h unit at mcalester in july his conviction was overturned by the oklahoma court of criminal appeals and a new trial was ordered the court decided that gore did not receive a fair trial because judge landrith did not allow his defense lawyer to put on proof that two other men had already been convicted of the murder on june gore was again found guilty the jury deadlocked on the issue of death and judge landrith as required by law sentenced gore to life without parole i owe much to many people who helped with this book annette and renee and their families gave me complete access to every aspect of rons life mark barrett spent countless hours driving me around oklahoma telling me stories that i at first found hard to believe and locating witnesses pulling out old files and leaning on his network of contacts his assistant melissa harris copied a million documents and kept everything in meticulous order dennis fritz revisited his painful history with remarkable enthusiasm and answered all my questions greg wilhoit did the same brenda tollett with the ada evening news dug through the archives and magically produced copies of the papers extensive history of the two murders ann kelley weaver now with the oklahoman was quick to recall many of the stories surrounding the exoneration at first judge frank seay was reluctant to talk about one of his cases he still holds to the oldfashioned notion that judges should be heard and not seen but he eventually came around in one of our phone conversations i suggested that he was a hero a description he quickly objected to i was overruled from twelve hundred miles away vicky hildebrand still works for him and vividly remembers her first reading of rons petition for habeas corpus relief jim payne is now a federal judge himself and though cooperative showed little interest in taking credit for saving rons life but he is a hero his careful reading of janet chesleys brief at home after hours prompted concern enough to approach judge seay and recommend an eleventhhour stay of execution though he entered the story in a late chapter judge tom landrith had the unique pleasure of presiding over the exoneration hearing in april visiting his office in the ada courthouse was always a treat the stories many of them probably true flowed forth with great ease barry scheck and the warriors at the innocence project were gracious and open as of this writing they have freed prisoners by dna testing and they have inspired at least thirty other innocence projects around the country for a closer look go to wwwinnocenceprojectorg tommy ward spent three years and nine months on death row on the old f cellhouse before being permanently exiled to the prison in lexington we swapped many letters some of his stories were about ron and he allowed me to use them in these pages regarding his nightmare i relied heavily on the dreams of ada by robert mayer its a fascinating book a wonderful reminder of how good truecrime writing can be mr mayer was thoroughly cooperative during my research thanks to the lawyers and staff at the oklahoma indigent defense systemjanet chesley bill luker and kim marks and to bruce leba murl bowen christy shepherd leslie delk dr keith hume nancy vollertsen dr susan sharp michael salem gail seward lee mann david morris and bert colley john sherman a third year law student at the university of virginia spent a year and a half buried in the boxes of research we collected and somehow kept it all straight i had the benefit of volumes of sworn testimony from most of those involved in this story some interviews were not needed some were not granted only the names of the alleged rape victims have been changed john grisham july
