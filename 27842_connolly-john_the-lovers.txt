john connolly the lovers the eighth book in the charlie parker series for jennie prologue the truth is often a terrible weapon of aggression it is possible to lie and even to murder for the truth alfred adler problems of neurosis i tell myself that this is not an investigation it is for others to be investigated but not for my family and not for me i will delve into the lives of strangers and i will expose their secrets and their lies sometimes for money and sometimes because that is the only way to lay old ghosts to rest but i do not want to pick and scratch in such a way at what i have always believed of my mother and father they are gone let them sleep but there are too many questions left unanswered too many inconsistencies in the narrative constructed of their lives a tale told by them and continued by others i can no longer allow them to remain unexamined my father william parker known to his friends as will died when i was almost sixteen years old he was a cop in the ninth on the lower east side of new york loved by his wife and faithful to her with a son whom he adored and by whom he was adored in return he chose to remain in uniform and not to seek promotion because he was content to serve on the streets as an ordinary patrolman he had no secrets at least none so terrible that he or those close to him might have been damaged beyond repair had they been revealed he lived an ordinary smalltown existence or as ordinary as he could lead when the cycles of his days were determined by duty rosters by killings by theft and drug abuse and by the predations of the strong and ruthless upon the weak and defenseless his flaws were minor his sins venial every one of these statements is a lie except that he loved his son although his son sometimes forgot to love him back after all i was a teenager when he died and what boy at that age is not already knocking heads with his father attempting to establish his primacy over the old man in the house who no longer understands the nature of the everchanging world around him so did i love him of course but by the end i was refusing to admit it to him or to myself here then is the truth my father did not die of natural causes he took his own life his lack of advancement was not a matter of choice but of punishment his wife did not love him or if she did she did not love him as she once had for he had betrayed her and she could not bring herself to forgive that betrayal he did not lead an ordinary existence and people died to keep his secrets he had grave weaknesses and his sins were mortal one night my father killed two unarmed teenagers on a patch of waste ground not far from where we lived in pearl river they were not much older than i was he shot the boy first and then the girl he used his offduty revolver a colt with a twoinch barrel because he was not in uniform at the time the boy was hit in the face the girl in the chest when he was sure that they were dead my father as though in a trance drove back to the city and showered and changed in the locker room of the ninth watt the nihere they came for him less than twentyfour hours later he shot himself for my entire adult life i have wondered why he acted as he did but it seemed to me that there were no answers to be found to that question or perhaps that was the lie i was happier to tell myself until now it is time to call this what it is this is an investigation into the circumstances of my fathers death i i hate and i love perhaps you ask why i do so i do not know but i feel it happen and i am tormented catullus carmina chapter one the faraday boy had been missing for three days on the first day nothing was done after all he was twentyone and young men of that age no longer had to abide by curfews and parental rules still his behavior was out of character for him bobby faraday was trustworthy he was a graduate student although he had taken a year off before deciding on the direction of his graduate studies in engineering with talk of going abroad for a couple of months or working for his uncle in san diego instead he had stayed in his hometown saving money by living with his parents and banking as much of what he earned as he could which was a little less than the previous year as he could now drink with impunity and was maybe indulging that newfound liberty with more enthusiasm than might have been considered entirely wise hed had a couple of killer hangovers over new years that was for sure and his old man had advised him to ease up before his liver started crying out for mercy but bobby was young he was immortal and he was in love or had been until recently perhaps it would be truer to say that bobby faraday was still in love but the object of his affection had moved on leaving bobby mired in his own emotions the girl was why he had opted to remain in town instead of seeing a little more of the world a decision that had been met with mixed feelings by his parents gratitude on the part of his mother disappointment on that of his father there had been some arguments about it at the start but now as with two reluctant armies on the verge of an unwanted battle a truce of kinds had been declared between father and son although each side continued to watch the other warily to see which one might blink first meanwhile bobby drank and his father fumed but remained silent in the hope that the ending of the relationship might lead his son to broaden his horizons until grad school in the fall despite his occasional overindulgences bobby was never late for work at the auto shop and gas station and usually left a little later than he had to because there was always something to be done some task that he did not wish to abandon uncompleted even if it could be finished quickly and easily in the morning it was one of the reasons his father whatever their disagreements didnt worry too much about his son rsqd nðuos future prospects bobby was too conscientious to leave the beaten track for long he liked order and always had hed never been one of those messy teenagers either in appearance or in approach it just wasnt in his nature but he hadnt come home the night before and he hadnt called to tell his parents where he might be and that in itself was unusual then he didnt make it to work the following morning which was so out of character that ron nevill who owned the gas station called the faraday house to check on the boy and make sure that he wasnt ailing his mother expressed surprise that her son wasnt already at work shed simply assumed that hed come home late and left early she checked his bedroom which lay just off the basement den his bed had not been slept in and there was no indication that hed spent the night on the couch instead when there was no word by pm she called her husband at work together they checked with bobbys friends casual acquaintances and his exgirlfriend emily kindler that last call had been delicate as she and bobby had broken up only a couple of weeks before his father suspected that this was the reason his son was drinking more than he should have but he wouldnt have been the first man who tried to drown loves sorrows in a batch of alcohol the trouble was that frustrated love was buoyant in booze the more you tried to force it to the bottom the more it insisted on bobbing right back up to the top nobody had heard from bobby or had seen him since the previous day when pm came and went they called the police the chief was skeptical he was new in town but familiar with the ways of young people nevertheless he accepted that this was not typical behavior for bobby faraday and that twentyfour hours had now gone by since he left the gas station for bobby had not hit any of the local bars after work and ron nevill seemed to be the last person to have seen him the chief put together a description of the boy at the faraday house borrowed a photograph that had been taken the previous summer and informed local law enforcement and the state police of a possible missing person none of the other agencies responded with any great urgency for they were almost as cynical about the behavior of young males as the chief was and in the case of one going missing they tended to wait for seventytwo hours before assuming that there might be more to the disappearance than a simple case of booze hormones or domestic difficulties on the second day his parents and their friends began an informal canvass of the town and its environs with no result when it began to grow dark his mother and father returned home but they did not sleep that night just as they had not slept the night before his mother lay in bed her face turned toward the window straining to hear the sound of approaching footsteps the familiar tread of her only son returning to her at last she stirred only slightly when she heard her husband rise and put on his robe what is it she asked nothing he said im going to make some tea sit up for a while he paused you want some but she knew that he was asking only out of politeness that he would prefer it if she stayed where she was he did not want them to sit at the kitchen table in silence together but apart the fears of one feeding those of the other he wanted to be alone so she let him go and when the bedroom door closed behind him she began toron qhe began cry on the third day the formal search began the golden host moved as one countless shapes bending obediently in unison at the gentle touch of the latewinter breeze like a congregation at church bowing in accordance with the progress of the service awaiting the moment of consecration that is to come they whispered to themselves a soft low susurrus that might have been the crashing of distant waves were such an alien noise not unknown in this landlocked place the paleness of them was dappled in spots by small flowers of red and orange and blue a scattering of petals upon an ocean of seed and stem the host had been spared the reaping and had grown tall too tall even as the crop decayed a seasons grain had gone to waste for the old man upon whose land the host was gathered had died the previous summer and his relatives were fighting over the sale of the property and how the proceeds would be divided while they fought the host had stretched skyward a sea of dull gold in the depths of winter speaking in hushed tones of what lay rush hemmed and undiscovered nearby and yet the host it seemed was at peace suddenly the breeze dropped for an instant and the host stood erect as though troubled by the change sensing that all was not as it had been and then the wind rose again more tempestuous now transforming into smaller dispersed gusts that divided the host with ripples and eddies their caresses less delicate than what had gone before unity was replaced by confusion scattered fragments were caught in the sunlight before they fell to the ground the whispering grew louder drowning the calling of a solitary bird with rumors of approach a black shape appeared upon the horizon like a great insect hovering over the stalks it grew in stature becoming the head shoulders and body of a man passing between the rows of wheat while ahead of him a smaller form cleaved invisibly through the stalks sniffing and yelping as it went the first intruders upon the hosts territory since the old man had died a second figure came into view heavier than the first this one seemed to be struggling with the terrain and with the unaccustomed exercise that his participation in the search had forced upon him in the distance but farther to the east the two men could see other searchers somehow they had drifted away from the main pack although that itself had diminished as the day wore on already the light was fading soon it would be time to call a halt and there would be fewer of them to search in the days that followed they had begun that morning immediately after sunday services the searchers had congregated at the catholic church st judes since that had the largest yard and curiously the smallest congregation a contradiction that peyton carmichael the man with the dog had never quite understood perhaps he figured they were expecting a mass conversion at some point in the future which made him wonder if catholics were just more optimistic than other folks the chief of police and his men had divided the township into grids and the townspeople themselves into groups and had assigned each group an area to search sandwiches potato chips and sodas in brown bags had been provided by the various churches although most people had brought food and water of their own just in case in a break with sunday tradition none had dressed up in the usual finery instead they woe s qad theyre loose shirts and old pants and battered boots or comfortable sneakers some carried sticks others garden rakes to search in the undergrowth there was an air of subdued expectation a kind of excitement despite the task before them they shared rides and drove out to their assigned areas as each area was searched and nothing found another was suggested either by the cops who were coordinating the efforts on the ground or by contacting the base of operations that had been set up in the hall behind the church it had been unseasonably warm when they began a curious false thaw that would soon end and the difficulty of coping with soft ground and melting snow had sapped the strength of many before they took a break for lunch at about one or one thirty some of the older people had returned home at that stage content to have made some effort for the faradays but the rest continued with the search after all the next day was monday there would be work to do obligations to be met this day was the only one that they could spare to look for the boy and the best would have to be made of it but as the light had grown dim so too the day had grown colder and peyton was grateful that he had not left his timberland jacket in the car but had chosen to tie it around his waist until it was needed he whistled at his dog a threeyearold spaniel named molly and waited once again for his companion to catch up artie hoyt of all the people with whom he had to end up relations between the two men had been cool for the last year or more ever since artie had caught peyton eyeing his daughters ass at church it didnt matter to artie that he hadnt seen exactly what he thought hed seen yes peyton had been looking at his daughters ass but not out of any feelings of lust or attraction not that he was above such base impulses at times the pastors sermons were so dull that the only thing keeping peyton awake was the sight of young lithe female forms draped in their sunday best peyton was long past the age when he might have been troubled by the potential implications for his immortal soul of such carnal thoughts in church he figured that god had better things to worry about than whether peyton carmichael sixtyfour widower was paying more attention to objects of female beauty than he was to the old blowhard at the pulpit a man who in peytons opinion possessed less christian charity than the average alligator as peytons doctor liked to tell him live a life of wine women and song all in moderation but always of the proper vintage peytons wife had died three years earlier taken by breast cancer and although there were plenty of women in town of the correct vintage who might have been prepared to offer peyton some comfort on a winters evening he just wasnt interested he had loved his wife occasionally he was still lonely although less often than before but those feelings of loneliness were specific not general he missed his wife not female company and he viewed the occasional pleasure that he took in the sight of a young goodlooking woman merely as a sign that he was not entirely dead below the waist god having taken his wife from him could allow him that small indulgence if god was going to make a big deal of it then well peyton would have a few words for him too when eventually they met the problem with artie hoyts daughter was that although she was young she was by no means good looking neither was she lithe in fact she was the opposite of lithe and come to think of it the opposite of light too shed never been what you might call svelte but then she had left town and gone to live in baltimore and by the time she came back shed piled on the pounds now when she walked into church peyton was sure that he felt the floor led q the flotremble slightly beneath her feet if she were any bigger shed have to enter sideways that or theyd be forced to widen the aisles and so the first sunday after shed returned to the parental home she had entered the chapel with her mom and dad and peyton had found himself staring in appalled fascination at her ass jiggling under a redandwhite floral dress like an earthquake in a rose garden his jaw might even have been hanging open when he turned to find artie hoyt glaring at him and after that well things had never been quite the same between them they hadnt been close before the incident but at least theyd been civil when their paths had crossed now they rarely exchanged even a nod of greeting and they hadnt spoken to each other until fate and the missing faraday boy had forced them together theyd been part of a group of eight that had started out in the morning quickly falling to six after old blackwell and his wife seemed set to pass out and had reluctantly turned back for home then five four three until now it was just artie and him peyton didnt understand at first why artie didnt just give up and go home himself even the modest pace that peyton and molly were setting seemed too much for him and they had been forced to stop repeatedly to allow artie to catch his breath and gulp water from the bottle that he was carrying in his rucksack it had taken peyton a while to figure out that artie wasnt going to give him the satisfaction of knowing that hed kept searching while artie had faded even if the other man were to die in the attempt with that in mind peyton had taken a malicious pleasure in forcing the pace for a time until he acknowledged that his needless cruelty was rendering null and void his earlier efforts at worship and penitence the occasional glance at young women notwithstanding they were nearing the boundary fence between this property and the next a field of fallow overgrown land with a small pond at its center sheltered by trees and rushes peyton had only a little water left and molly was thirsty he figured he could water her at the pond then call it a day he couldnt see artie objecting just as long as it was peyton who suggested quitting and not him lets head into the field there and check it out said peyton i need to get water for the dog anyway after that we can cut back onto the road and take an easy walk back to the cars okay with you artie nodded he walked to the fence rested his hands upon it and tried to hoist himself up and over he got one foot off the ground but the other wouldnt join it he simply didnt have the strength to continue peyton thought he looked like he wanted to lie down and die but he didnt there was something admirable about his refusal to give up even if it had less to do with any concerns about bobby faraday than his anger at peyton carmichael eventually though he was forced to admit defeat and landed back down on the same side on which hed started goddammit he said hold up said peyton ill boost you over i can do it said artie just give me a minute to catch my breath come on neither of us is as young as he was ill help you over and then you can give me a hand up from the other side no sense in both of us killing ourselves just to prove a point artie considered the proposal and nodded his agreement peyton tied mollys leash to the fence in case she caught a scent and decided to make a break for freedom then leaned down and cupped his hands so that artie could put one booted foot into his grip when the boot was in place and arties hold on the fence seemed secure peyton pushed up either he was stronger than he thought which was possible or artie was lighter than he looked which seemed unlikely but either way peyton ended up almost catapulting artie over the fence only the judicious hooking of his left leg and right arm on the slats saved artie from an awkward landing on the other side the hell was that asked artie once he had climbed down and had both feet on firm ground once again sorry said peyton he was trying not to laugh and only partially succeeding yeah well i dont know what youre eating but i could sure do with some of it peyton began climbing the fence he was in good condition for a man of his age a fact that gave him no little pleasure artie reached a hand up to steady him and although peyton didnt need it he took it anyway funny said peyton as he stepped down from the fence but i dont eat so much anymore i used to have a hell of an appetite but now some breakfast and a snack in the evening does me just fine i even had to make an extra hole in my belt to stop my damn pants from falling down there was an unreadable expression on artie hoyts face as he glanced down at his own belly and reddened slightly peyton winced i didnt mean anything by that artie he said quietly when rina was alive i weighed thirty pounds more than i do now she fed me up like she was going to slaughter me for christmas without her he trailed off and looked away dont talk to me about it said artie after a moment had passed he appeared anxious to keep the conversation going now that the long silence between them had at last been broken my wife doesnt believe its food unless its deep fried or comes in a bun i think shed deepfry candy if she could they do that in some places peyton said you dont say artie looked mildly disgusted jesus dont tell her that chocolates the closest that she gets to health food as it is they began walking toward the pond peyton let molly off the leash he knew that she had sensed the presence of water and he didnt want to torment her by forcing her to walk at their pace the dog raced ahead a streak of brown and white and soon was lost from sight in the tall grass nice dog said artie thank you said peyton shes a good girl shes like a child to me i guess yeah said artie he knew that peyton and his wife had not been blessed with children look artie said peyton theres something ive been meaning to say for a while he paused as he tried to find the right words then took a deep breath and plowed right in in church that time after lydia had come home iwell i wanted to apologize for staring at her you know her ass finished artie yeah that im sorry is all i wanted to say it wasnt right especially in church wasnt christian it wasnt what you might think though suddenly peyton realized that he had wandered onto marshy ground conversationally speaking he now faced the possibility of being forced to explain both what he believed artie might have thought peyton was thinking and what in fact he peyton had been thinking which was that artie hoyts daughter looked like the hindenburg just before it crashed shes a big girl said artie sadly saving peyton from further embarrassment its not her fault her marriage broke up and the doctors gave her pills for depression and she suddenly started to put on all this weight doesnt help that she eats enough for two but thats part of it you know the eating she gets sad she eats more she gets sadder she eats even more its a vicious cycle i dont blame you for staring at her hell she wasnt my daughter id stare at her that way too in fact sometimes it shames me to say i do stare at her that way anyway im sorry said peyton it wasntkind apology accepted said artie buy me a drink next time were in deans he put his hand out and the two men shook peyton patted artie on the back he felt his eyes water slightly and blamed it on his exertions how about i buy you a beer when were done here i could do with something to toast the end of a long day agreed lets water your dog and get the he stopped they were within sight of the sheltered pond it had been a popular trysting spot once upon a time when both artie and peyton were much younger men until the land changed hands and the new owner the godfearing man whose estate was now being fought over by his godless relatives had let it be known that he didnt want any adolescent voyages of sexual discovery being embarked upon in the vicinity of his pond a large beech tree overhung the water its branches almost touching the surface molly was standing a small distance from it she had not drunk the water she had in fact stopped several feet from the bank now she was waiting one paw raised her tail wagging uncertainly through the rushes something blue was visible to the approaching men bobby faraday was kneeling by the waters edge his upper body at a slight angle as though he were trying to glimpse his reflection in the pool there was a rope around his neck attached to the trunk of the tree he was swollen with gas his face a reddishpurple his features almost unrecognizable ah hell said peyton he wavered slightly and artie reached up and put his arm around his companions shoulder as the sun set behind them and the wind blew and the host bowed low in mour hi qlow in mning chapter two i took the train to pearl river from penn station i hadnt driven down to new york from maine and i hadnt bothered to rent a car while i was in the city there was no need whatever i needed to do here i could do more easily without an automobile as the little singlecar train pulled into the station still barely altered from its origins as a branch of the erie railroad i saw that any other changes to the heart of the town were also purely cosmetic i climbed down and walked slowly across memorial park where a sign close to the unmanned town of orangetown police booth announced that pearl river was still the town of friendly people the park had been created by julius e braunsdorf the father of pearl river who had also laid out the town itself after purchasing the land as well as building the railroad station manufacturing the aetna sewing machine and the america liberty printing press developing an incandescent lightbulb and inventing the electric arc light that illuminated not just this park but the capitol area in washington dc braunsdorf was one of those guys who made most people look kind of sluggish by comparison along with dan fortmann of the chicago bears he was pearl river s proudest boast the stars and stripes still flew over the memorial at the center of the park commemorating the young men of the town who had died in combat curiously these included james b moore and siegfried w butz who had died not in combat but in the course of a bank raid in when henry j fernekes a notorious bandit of the time tried to hold up the first national bank of pearl river while masquerading as an electrician still at least they were remembered murdered bank clerks dont often qualify for a mention on public memorials anymore pearl river hadnt shaken off any of its irish roots since id left the muddy brook café at north main on the far side of the park still offered a celtic breakfast and nearby were gallaghers irish butcher the irish cottage gift store and healyosullivan travel across east central avenue next door to handelers hardware store was the hapenny irish shop which sold irish tea candy potato chips and replica gaelic football jerseys and around the corner from the old pearl street hotel was g f noonans irish bar as my father often remarked they should just have painted the whole town green and been done with it the pearl river movie theater was now closed though and there were chichi stores selling crafts and expensive gifts alongside the more functional auto shops and furniture stores it seems to me now that i spent all of my childhood in pearl river but that was not the case we moved there when i was nearly eight once my father had begun to tire of the long commute into the city from farther upstate where he and my mother lived cheaply thanks to a house left to my father when his own mother died it was particularly hard for him when he worked his week of to tours which were in reality to tours he would rise at five in the morning sometimes even earlier to make his trek in to the ninth a violent precinct that occupied less than one square mile on the lower east side but accounted for up to seventyfive homicides every year on those weeks my mother and i barely saw him not that the other tours on each sixweek cycle were much better he was required to do one week of to one week of to anotheren k of week of to two weeks of to on those weeks i saw him only at weekends for he was sleeping when i left for school in the morning and gone to work by the time i returned and one mandatory midnight to tour which screwed up his body clock so badly he would sometimes be almost delirious with tiredness by the end of it the ninth worked what was called a ninesquad chart nine squads of nine men each with a sergeant a system that dated back to the fifties and was eventually eliminated in the eighties taking with it much of the camaraderie that it engendered my fathers sergeant in the first squad was a man named larry costello and it was he who suggested that my father should consider moving down to pearl river it was where all the irish cops lived a town that claimed the second largest st patricks day parade in the state after manhattan it was comparatively wealthy too with an average income that was almost twice the national average and an air of comfortable prosperity so it had enough offduty cops to form a police state it had money and it had its own identity defined by common bonds of nationality even though my father was not himself irish he was catholic knew many of the men who lived in pearl river and was comfortable with them my mother raised no objections to the move if it gave her more time with her husband and relieved him of some of the stress and strain that was by then so clearly etched on his face she would have moved to a hole in the ground covered by a sheet of tarp and made the best of it so we went south and because all that subsequently went wrong in our lives was for me tied in with pearl river the town came to dominate the memories of my childhood we bought a house on franklin avenue close to the corner of john street where the united methodist church still stands it was a fixerupper in the peculiar language of realtors the old lady who had lived in it for most of her life had recently died and there was nothing to suggest that she had done much with the house other than occasionally move a broom across the floors since but it was a bigger house than we could otherwise have afforded and something about the lack of fences the open yards between properties on the street appealed to my father it gave him a sense of space of community the notion of good fences making good neighbors was not one that held much currency in pearl river instead there were those in the town who found the concept of a fence mildly troubling a sign of disengagement perhaps of otherness my mother immersed herself in the life of the town if there was a committee she joined it for a woman who in most of my early memories of her seemed so selfcontained so distant from her peers it was an astonishing transformation my father probably wondered if she was having an affair but it was nothing more than the reaction of someone who found herself in a better place than she had previously been with a husband who was more contented than hed been before although she still fretted when he left the house each day and responded with barely concealed relief when he returned home unharmed after each tour my mother now as i trawled through the details of our life in that place my relationship with her began to seem less and less normal if that word can ever truly be used about the interactions of families if she had sometimes appeared disconnected from her peers so too was she often at one remove from my father and from me it wasnt that she withheld affection or did not cherish me she delighted in my triumphs and consoled me in my defeats she listened and counseled and loved but it seemed to me that for much of my childhood she acted in response to my promptings ifh tomptings i came to her she would do all of those things yet she did not initiate them it was as though i were an experiment of sorts a creature in a cage something to be monitored and watched to be fed and watered and given the affection and stimulation to ensure my survival yet no more than that or perhaps that was just a game memory was playing on me as i churned up the mud in the reservoir of the past and when the dirt had settled picked my way across the bottom to see what had been exposed after the killings and what followed she fled north to maine taking me with her back to the place in which she had grown up until she died when i was still in college she refused to discuss in any detail the events that had led up to my fathers death she retreated into herself and there found only the cancer that would take her life slowly colonizing the cells of her body like bad memories canceling out the good i now wonder how long it had been waiting for her if grave emotional injury might somehow have triggered a physical response so that she was betrayed on two fronts by her husband and by her own body if that was so then the cancer began its work in the months before i was born in my way i was the stimulus as much as my fathers actions for one was a consequence of the other the house had not changed much although crumbling paintwork upper windows streaked with grime and broken shingles like dark chipped teeth spoke of a degree of neglect the color was slightly different a paler gray than it had been when i lived there but the yard was still unfenced like those of the rest of its neighbors the porch had been screened since last i had seen it and a rocking chair and a rattan couch both bare of cushions faced the street the window and door frames were now painted black instead of white and there was only lawn where once there had been carefully tended flower beds the grass thin and straggling where it was visible through banked and frozen snow yet this was still recognizably the place in which i had grown up a drape moved in what used to be the living room and i saw an old man staring curiously at me i dipped my chin in acknowledgment of his presence and he receded into the shadows above the front door was a double window one pane broken and patched with cardboard where a boy would sit and gaze out at the small town that was his world something of myself had been left in that room after my father died a degree of innocence perhaps or the last remnant of childhood it had been taken from me in the sound of a gunshot forcing me to shed it like a reptile skin or the pupal shell of an insect i could almost see him this little ghost a figure with dark hair and narrow eyes too introspective for his age too solitary he had friends but he had never overcome the feeling that he was imposing upon them when he called to their houses and that they did him a favor by playing games with him or inviting him inside to watch tv it was easier when they went out as a gang playing softball in the park in summer or soccer if danny yates who was the only person he knew who was enthusiastic about the cosmos and had shoot magazine sent over to him by an uncle stationed with the air force in england was back from summer camp or had yet to leave danny was older than the rest of them by a couple of years and they deferred to him in most things i wondered where most of those former friends were now none of them black for pearl river was a lilywhite town and we only encountered black kids at varsity games i had lost touch with them after we left for maine but some were probably still living here after all pearl river clannish fiercely protective of its ownwas the kind of in the kind place that became home to generations bobby gretton had lived two doors down on the other side of the street his parents drove only chevys and kept each car for a maximum of two years before trading it in for a newer model i looked to my left and saw a brown chevy uplander in the drive of what had always been the gretton house there was a fading bumper sticker on the rear of the car supporting obama for president in and beside it a yellow ribbon the car had veterans plates that was mr gretton for sure the light changed at my old bedroom window a cloud scudding overhead giving the impression of movement within and i felt again the presence of the boy i once was there he sat waiting for the first sight of his returning father or perhaps a glimpse of carrie gottlieb who lived across the street carrie was three years older than he and generally considered to be the most beautiful girl in pearl river although there were those who whispered that she knew it too and that that knowledge made her less attractive and personable than other more modestly endowed and selfeffacing young women such mutterings did not concern the boy it did not concern many of the boys in town it was carrie gottliebs very separateness the sense that she walked through life on pedestals erected solely for her own purposes that made her so desirable had she been more downtoearth and less selfassured their interest in her would have been considerably diminished carrie went off to the city to become a model her mother would tell anyone who stood still for long enough about how carrie was destined to adorn fashion spreads and television screens but in the months and years that followed no such images of carrie appeared and in time her mother stopped speaking of her daughter in that way when asked by others usually with a glint in their eye sensing blood in the water how carrie was getting along she would reply fine just fine her smile slightly strained as she moved the conversation on to safer ground or if the questioner persisted simply moved herself along instead in time i heard that carrie came back to pearl river and got a job as the hostess in a restaurant eventually becoming the manager after she and the owner got married she was still beautiful but the city had taken its toll on her and her smile was less certain than it once had been nevertheless she had returned to pearl river and she bore the loss of her dreams with a certain grace and people admired her for it and maybe liked her a little more than before because of it she was one of them and she was home and when she visited her parents on franklin avenue the ghost of a boy saw her and smiled my father was not a big man compared to some of his fellow officers barely making the nypds height requirement and slighter in build than they were to my boyhood self though he seemed like an imposing figure especially when he wore his uniform with the fourinch smith wesson hanging on his belt and his buttons gleaming against the deep dark blue of his clothing what are you gonna be when you grow up he would ask me and i would always reply a cop and what kind of cop will you be a new york cop n y p d and what kind of new york cop will you be a good one the best and my father would ruffle my hair the flip side of the light cuff he would dispense whenever i did something that displeased him never a slap never a punch it wply punch ias enough to cuff the back of my head with his hard callused palm a signal that a line had been overstepped further punishments would sometimes follow grounding the withholding of my allowance for a week or two but the cuff was the danger sign it was the final warning and it was the only kind of physical violence however mild that i associated with my father until the day the two teenagers died some of my friends tired of living in a town defined by cops were wary of my father frankie murrow in particular used to curl in upon himself like a startled snail whenever my father was around frankies father was a security guard at a mall so maybe it was something about uniforms and the men who wore them frankies father was a jerk and perhaps frankie just assumed that other men who wore uniforms and protected things were likely to be jerks too frankies father had asked him if he was a fag when at the age of seven frankie had gone to take his fathers hand as they prepared to cross the road mr murrow was a royal sonofabitch as my father had once put it mr murrow hated blacks and jews and hispanics and he had a string of derogatory terms on the tip of his tongue for every one of them he hated most white people too though so it wasnt as if he was a racist he was just good at hating at the age of fourteen frankie murrow was put in reform school for arson hed burned his own house down while his old man was at work hed timed it pretty well so that mr murrow was turning onto his street just as the fire engines were arriving behind him frankie was sitting on the wall of the house opposite watching the flames rise and laughing and crying at the same time my father was not a heavy drinker he didnt need alcohol to help him relax he was the calmest man i had ever known which made the relationship between him and his partner and closest friend jimmy gallagher so difficult for the boy to understand jimmy who always walked near the head of the towns st patricks day parade who bled irish green and cop blue was all smiles and almostplayful punches he was taller than my father by three or four inches and broader too if they stood side by side on those occasions when jimmy came to the house my father would look a little embarrassed as though he felt himself to be somehow wanting when compared to his friend jimmy would kiss and hug my mother as soon as he arrived the only man apart from her husband who was permitted such intimacies and then he would turn to me there he is he would say theres the man jimmy wasnt married he said that he had never met the right woman but hed enjoyed meeting a lot of the wrong ones it was an old joke and he used it often but my mother and father would always laugh even though they knew it was a lie women didnt interest jimmy gallagher although it would be many years before i understood that i often wondered how difficult it must have been for jimmy keeping up a front for all those years flirting with women in order to fit in jimmy gallagher who could make the most incredible pizzas from scratch who could cook a banquet to please a king or so i had once heard my father tell my mother but who when he hosted a poker game at his house or had his buddies around to watch a ball game because jimmy being single could always afford the best and most modern tvs would feed them nachos and beer potato chips and storebought tv dinners or if the weather was good cook steaks and burgers on the barbecue and i sensed even then that while my father might have spoken too dve spoken my mother of jimmys secret culinary skills he did not make such references carelessly among his brother cops jimmy would take my hand and shake it just a little too hard testing his strength i had learned not to wince when this occurred for then jimmy would say ah he has a way to go yet and shake his head in mock disappointment but if my face remained still and i returned the grip as best i could jimmy would smile and slip me a dollar with the admonition dont spend it all on booze now i didnt spend it all on booze in fact until i turned fifteen i didnt spend any of it on booze i spent it on candy and comic books or saved it for our summer vacation in maine when we would stay with my grandfather in scarborough and i would be taken to old orchard beach and allowed to run riot on the rides as i grew older though booze became a more attractive option carrie gottliebs brother phil who worked for the railroad and was believed to be of slightly subnormal intelligence was known to be willing to buy beer for underage kids in return for one bottle out of every six one evening two of my friends and i pooled our cash for a couple of sixpacks of pbr that phil picked up for us and we drank most of them in the woods one night i had liked the taste less than the frisson of pleasure i experienced from breaking both the law and a rule of the house for my father had made it clear to me that there was to be no drinking until he said it was okay like young men the world over i took this and other rules to refer only to things about which my father knew since if he didnt know about them then they couldnt possibly be of any consequence to him unfortunately i had brought home one of the bottles and stashed it in the back of my closet for future use which was where it was found by my mother id taken a cuff on the head for that and was grounded and required to take an involuntary vow of poverty for at least a month that afternoon which was a sunday jimmy gallagher had come by the house it was jimmys birthday and he and my father were going to hit the town as they always did when one of them celebrated another year of not being shot stabbed beaten to a pulp or run over he had smiled mockingly at me a dollar bill held between the index and middle fingers of his right hand all those years he said and you never listened and i had answered sullenly i did listen i didnt spend it all on booze even my father had been forced to laugh but jimmy still didnt give me the dollar and after that he never gave me money again he never got the chance six months later my father was dead and jimmy gallagher stopped coming around with dollar bills in his hand they had questioned my father after the killing for he admitted his involvement as soon as they confronted him they treated him sympathetically trying to understand what had taken place so that they could begin to limit the damage he had ended up at the orangetown pd since the local cops were the primaries iad had been involved as had an investigator from the rockland county das office a retired nypd cop himself who knew how these things were done and who would smooth the feathers of the local boys prior to taking over the investigation my father had called my mother shortly after they came for him ana m for himd told her of what he had done later a courtesy call was paid to the house by a pair of local cops one of them was jimmy gallaghers nephew who worked out of orangetown earlier that evening when he was not yet on duty he had come to our house in his casual clothes and had sat in our kitchen he had a gun on his belt he and my mother had pretended that it was merely a casual visit but he had stayed too long for that and i had seen the tension on my mothers face as she served him coffee and cake that he barely touched now as he stood again in our house this time in uniform i understood that his earlier presence had been connected to the shootings but i did not yet know how jimmys nephew confirmed for her all that had occurred or appeared to have occurred on the patch of waste ground just a short distance from the house without ever referring to the fact that it was his second visit to the house that evening she had wanted to join her husband to offer him support but he told her that there would be no point the questioning would go on for some time and then he would probably be suspended on full pay pending an investigation he would be home soon he promised her sit tight keep an eye on the boy tell him nothing for now its up to you but you understand it might be better to wait until we all know more i heard her crying after my fathers call and i went to her i stood before my mother dressed in my pajamas and said whats wrong mom whats the matter she had looked at me and for a moment i felt sure that she had failed to recognize me she was upset and in shock what my father had done had frozen her responses so that i seemed to her a stranger only that could explain the coldness of her stare the distance it placed between us as though the air had frozen solid cutting us off from each other i had seen that expression on her face before but only at the worst of times when i had done something so terrible that she was unable to bring herself to speak the theft of money from her kitchen fund or in an abortive attempt to create a bobsled for my gi joe the destruction of a plate bequeathed to her by her grandmother there was i thought blame in her eyes mom i said again uncertain now frightened is it dad is he okay and she found it in herself to nod her upper teeth clamped down hard on her lower lip so hard that when she spoke i saw blood against the white hes okay there was a shooting was he hurt no but some peoplesome people died theyre talking to your father about it did dad shoot them but she would not say anything more go back to bed she said please i did as i was told but i could not sleep my father the man who could barely bring himself to cuff the back of my head had drawn his gun and killed someone i was sure of it i wondered if my father would get into trouble because of it eventually they released him two iad goons escorted him home then sat outside reading the newspapers i watched them all from my wwhell from mindow my father looked old and crumpled as he walked up the garden path his face was unshaven he glanced up at the window and saw me there he raised his hand in greeting and tried to smile i waved back but i did not smile before leaving my room my father was holding my mother tightly as she wept against him and i heard him say he told us they might come i waited halfway down the stairs holding my breath but how could that be my mother asked how could it be the same people i dont know but it was i saw them i heard what they said my mother began to cry again but the tone had changed it was now a high keening the sound of someone breaking apart it was as though a dam had burst inside her and all that she had kept hidden away was now pouring through the breach sweeping away the life she once had in a great torrent of grief and violence later i would wonder if had she managed to hold herself together she might have been able to prevent what happened next but she was so caught up in her own sorrow that she failed to see that in killing those two young people her husband had destroyed something crucial to his own existence in the process he had murdered a pair of unarmed teenagers and despite what he had said to her he was not sure why that or he was unable to live with the possibility that what he had told her was true he was tired wearier than he had ever been he wanted to sleep he wanted to sleep and never wake up they became aware of my presence and my father removed his right arm from around my mother and welcomed me into their embrace we remained that way for a minute until my father patted us both on the back come on he said we cant stay like this all day are you hungry my mother asked wiping her eyes on her apron there was no emotion to her voice now as though having given vent to her pain she had nothing else left to give sure eggs would be good bacon and eggs you want some bacon and eggs charlie i nodded although i was not hungry i wanted to be near my father you should take a shower change your clothes my mother said ill do that i just need to do something else first you worry about those eggs toast toast would be good wheat if you have it my mother began bustling around the kitchen when her back was to us my father held my shoulder tightly and said itll all be fine understand you help your mother now make sure shes okay he left us the back door opened then closed again my mother paused and listened like a dog sensing some disturbance then returned to heating the oil in the pan she had just broken the first egg when we heard the shot chapter three the movement of the clouds against the sun caused the light to change rapidly disconcertingly brightness briefly fading to a wintry dusk in the blink of an eye a taste of the greater darkness that would soon encroach the front door opened and the old man appeared on his doorstep he was wearing a hooded jacket but he still had his slippers on his feet he trotted to the end of the path and stopped at the edge of his property his toes lined up with the lawn as though the sidewalk were a body of water and he was fearful of falling from the bank can i help you with something son he called son i crossed the street he tensed slightly wondering now if it had been such a good idea to confront a stranger after all he glanced down at his slippers probably thinking that he should have taken the time to put on his boots he would have felt less vulnerable in boots up close i could see that he was seventy or more he was a small fragilelooking man and i imagined he had always been that way he did not carry himself like one who had once been significantly bigger and fitter yet he had enough inner strength and confidence to face down an unknown man who was staking out his home there were men younger than he was who would simply have called the police his eyes were brown and rheumy but the skin on his face was relatively unwrinkled for someone of his age it was especially taut around his eye sockets and cheekbones giving the impression that his skin had begun to shrink not loosen against his skull i once lived here in this house i said some of the wariness left him you one of the harrington boys he asked squinting as he tried to identify me there were marks on either side of his nose from the spectacles he usually wore perhaps he had decided to leave them inside in order to make himself appear less frail than he was no im not i didnt even know who the harringtons were the people who bought the house after we left were named bildner they were a young couple with a baby daughter but then over a quarter of a century had passed since i had last seen the house i had no idea how many times it might have changed hands over the years huh whats your name son and each time he said that word i heard the echo of my fathers voice parker i said charlie parker parker he repeated chewing on the word as though it were a piece of meat of whose taste he remained uncertain he blinked rapidly three times and his mouth tightened in a kind of wince yes i know who you are now my names asa asa durand he held out his hand and i shook it how long have you lived here i asked twelve years give or take the harringtons were here before us but they sold it and moved to dakota dont know if it was north or south dont suppose it matters much seeing as how it was dakota you been to dakota which one either he smiled mischievously and i saw clearly the young man now trapped in an old mans body why would i want to go to dakota he asked you want to come inside i heard myself say the words before i even realized i had made the decision yes i said if its not an imposition not at all my wife will be home soon she plays bridge on sunday afternoons and i cook dinner youre welcome to stay if youre hungry its pot roast always pot roast on sundays its the only thing i can cook no thank you its good of you to offer though i walked alongside him up the garden path his left leg dragged slightly what do you get in return for cooking dinner or am i allowed to ask an easier life said durand to sleep in my bed without fear of suffocation the smile came again soft and warm and she likes my pot roast and i like it that she does we reached the front door durand went ahead and held it open i paused on the step for a moment then followed him inside and he closed the door behind me the hallway was brighter than i remembered it had been painted yellow with white trim when i was a boy the hallway had been red to the right was a formal dining room with a mahogany table and chairs not dissimilar to the set we had once owned to the left was the living room there was a flatscreen highdefinition tv where our old zenith used to stand in the days when vcrs were still a novelty and the networks had instituted a family hour to protect the young from sex and violence when was that i couldnt recall there was no longer a wall between the kitchen and the living room it had been removed to create a single openplan space so that the little kitchen of my youth with its fourseat table was now entirely gone i could not picture my mother in the new space different asked durand yes this is all different the other people did that not the harringtons the bildners they the ones you sold to thats right it was vacant for a time too couple of years he looked away troubled by the direction the conversation was taking would you like a drink theres beer if you want i dont drink it so much now goes through me like water down a pipe hardly in one end before its out the other then i have to nap its a little early for me ill take a cup of coffee though if i dont have to drink it alone coffee we can do at least i dont have to nap after it he switched on an ancient stained coffeemaker then rounded up some cups and spoons would you mind if i looked in my old bedroom i asked its the small one in the front with the broken pane durand winced again and looked a little embarrassed damned pane kids broke it playing baseball i just didnt get around to fixing it and then well we dont use that room for much other than storage its full of boxes it doesnt matter id still like to see it he nodded and we went upstairs i stood at the threshold of my old bedroom but i did not enter as durand had said it was a mass of boxes files books and old electrical equipment that was now gathering dust im a packrat said durand apologetically all that stuff still works i keep hoping someone will come along who might need it and take it off my hands as i stood there the boxes disappeared vanishing along with the junk and the books and the files there was only a room carpeted in gray white walls covered with pictures and posters a closet with a mirror on the front in which i could see myself reflected a man in his forties with graying hair and dark eyes shelves lined with books carefully ordered according to author a nightstand with a digital alarm clock the height of technology showing a time of pm and the sound of the gunshot carrying from the garage at the back of the house through the window i saw men running are you okay mr parker durand touched my arm gently i tried to speak but i could not why dont we go downstairs ill make you that cup of coffee and the figure in the mirror became the ghost of the boy i once was and i held his gaze until he slowly faded away and was gone we sat in the kitchen asa durand and i through the window i could see a copse of silver birch where the garage used to be durand followed my gaze i heard about what happened he said a terrible thing the room was filled with the aroma of durands pot roast it smelled good yes it was they knocked it down the garage who did the harringtons the neighbors mr and mrs rosettithey were probably after your time by a couple of yearstold me about it why did they knock it down but even as i asked the question i already knew the answer the only surprise was that it had stayed intact for as long as it had i guess there are those who feel that when something bad happens in a place the echo of it remains said durand i dont know if thats true im not sensitive to such things myself my wife believes in angelshe pointed at a wispily clothed winged figure hanging from a hook on the kitchen doorexcept all her angels look like tinkerbell to mkerbell te i dont think she can tell the difference between angels and fairies anyway the harrington kids didnt like going into the garage the youngest one the little girl she said it smelled bad the mother she told mrs rosetti that sometimes it smelled he paused and winced for a third time it seemed to be an involuntary response when anything discomfited him its okay i said go on please she told her that it smelled like a gun had gone off in there we were both silent for a time why are you here mr parker im not sure i think i have some questions i need answered you know you get the urge at a certain point in your life to go digging around in the past said durand i sat my mother down before she died and made her go through our whole family history everything that she could remember i wanted to have that knowledge i guess to understand what i was part of before anyone who could clear that stuff up for me was gone forever and thats a good thing to know where you came from you pass it on to your children and it makes everyone feel less adrift in life less alone but some things theyre better left in the past oh i know that psychiatrists and therapists and lord knows who else will tell you different but theyre wrong not every wound needs to be poked and opened and not every wrong needs to be reexamined or dragged kicking and screaming into the light better just to let the wound heal even if it doesnt heal quite right or to leave the wrongs in the dark and remind yourself not to go stepping into the shadows if you can avoid it well thats the thing of it i said sometimes you cant avoid those shadows durand pulled at his lip no i guess not so is this the beginning or the end the beginning you got a long road ahead of you then i think so i heard the front door open a small slightly overweight woman with permed silver hair stepped into the hallway its me she said she didnt look toward the kitchen instead she first removed her coat gloves and scarf and checked her hair and face in the mirror on the coatrack smells fine she said she turned to the kitchen and saw me goodness we got company elizabeth said durand and i stood as his wife entered the room this is mr parker said durand he used to live here when he was a boy pleased to meet you mrs durand i said well youre she paused as she made the connection and i watched the emotions play upon her face eventually her features settled into what iu c into wha suspected was their default mode kindness tinged with just the hint of sadness that comes with a lifetime of experience and the knowledge that it was all coming to an end youre welcome she settled upon sit sit youll stay for dinner no i cant i have to get going ive taken up too much of your husbands time as it is despite her inherent decency and good nature i could see that she was relieved if youre sure i am thank you i stayed on my feet to put on my coat and durand showed me to the door i ought to tell you he said that when i first saw you i thought you were someone else and i dont mean one of the harrington boys just for a second mind who did you think i was there was a man came here couple of months back it was evening darker than it is now he did what you did stared at the house for a time even went as far as to come onto the lawn so he could take a look at the back of the house out where the garage used to be i didnt like it i ventured out to ask him what he thought he was doing havent seen him since you think he was casing the house for a robbery at first except that when i challenged him thats not what he said not that a burglar would tell you he was casing a place not unless he was dumb as dirt what did he say hunting thats what he said just that one word hunting now what do you think that means i dont know mr durand i said and his eyes narrowed as he wondered if he was being lied to then he asked me if i knew what had happened here and i said i didnt know what he was talking about and he said that he thought i did i didnt care for his tone and told him to be on his way do you remember what he looked like not so well he was wearing a wool hat pulled down over his hair and he had a scarf around his neck and chin it was a cold night but not that cold younger than you late twenties maybe older a little taller too im nearsighted and i didnt have my spectacles keep leaving them places i should buy a chain he realized that he was drifting from the subject at hand and returned to it apart from that i dont recall much about him except what i was glad to see him leave thats all he made me uneasy and not just because he was on my lawn snooping around on my property there was a thing about him durand shook his head i cant explain it right i could say to you that he wasnt from around here and that would be as close as i could get he wasnt from anywhere like here anywhere at all he looked out over the town taking in the carsuo in the c moving on the streets the lights of the bars and stores near the train station the dim shapes of people heading home to their families it was normality and the man who had stood on his lawn did not belong in it night had now come the streetlights caught the patches of frozen snow making them shine in the gloom durand shivered you be careful mr parker he said we shook hands he stayed on the step until i reached the sidewalk then he waved once and closed the door i looked up at the window with the broken pane but there was nobody there that room was empty whatever remained there had no form the ghost of the boy was inside me where he had always been chapter four i met angel and louis for dinner that night at the wildwood bbq on park avenue south not far from union square it was tough to make the call between wildwood and blue smoke up on twentyseventh but novelty won out novelty and for louis the prospect of beans that had pieces of steak added to them when it came to rib joints louis liked extra meat with everything probably including the jello if he was going to die of a coronary he was going to do it in style these two men both of whom had killed yet only one of whom louis could truly be called a natural killer were now my closest friends i hadnt seen them since late the previous year when they had managed to get themselves into some trouble in upstate new york and id followed their tracks to see if i could help it hadnt ended well and wed kept some distance from one another since then not due to any ill will but because louis was concerned about the possible fallout from what had occurred and didnt want to see me contaminated by association now though he appeared content or as content as louis ever seemed to be figuring that the worst was over in truth it was hard to tell after all it wasnt that when louis laughed the world laughed with him instead when louis laughed the world tended to look around to see who had fallen over and impaled himself on a spike it was always an entertaining spectacle seeing angel and louis eat ribs in part because some kind of role reversal seemed to occur louistall black and dressed like a showroom dummy that has suddenly decided to take flight and seek better accommodations elsewhereate ribs in the manner of a man who fears that his plate could be whisked away at any second and he should therefore consume as much as possible as quickly as possible angel on the other hand who was small and white or as he liked to put it whiteish and who not only always looked like hed slept in his clothes but looked like other people might have slept in them too nibbled his food in an almost delicate manner the way a small bird might if it could hold a short rib in its claws they were drinking ale i was sipping a glass of red wine red wine said angel in a rib joint you know were gay and even we dont drink wine in a rib joint then i guess if i were gay id just be a more sophisticated homosexual than you in fact regardless of my sexuality im still more sophisticated than you you not eating asked lis bird e souis pointing with the end of a mostly demolished rib at the small pile of bare bones on my plate im not so hungry i said anyway after watching you two im considering vegetarianism or just never eating again at least not in public and certainly not with you what the hell is wrong with us angel sounded spectacularly aggrieved you eat like an old lady he eats like they just thawed him out next to a mammoth you want us to use a knife and fork do you know how to use a knife and fork dont tempt me miss manners the knives are sharp here louis finished his final rib wiped his face with his napkin and sat back with a sigh if his heart could have sighed with relief it would have echoed him glad i wore my buffet pants tonight he said me too i said youd worn your regular pants one of your buttons would have taken someones eye out by now he arched an eyebrow at me and waited sorry i said you continue to be boyishly slim angel signaled the server for another beer before speaking you want to tell us about it he said but they knew most of it already i had lost my maine private investigators license and my lawyer aimee price was still fighting to have it restored to me hampered at every turn by the objections of the state police and it appeared a detective named hansen in particular from what aimee could establish the order to revoke my license had come from high up and hansen was just the messenger a court challenge was still an option but aimee wasnt sure that it would be useful the state police were the final arbiters when it came to licensing and any court in maine would probably be guided by their decision my firearms permit had also been revoked although the precise nature of the revocation was still unclear to me and to my lawyer i had initially been ordered to hand over every gun in my possession pending what was vaguely termed an inquiry and was told that it would be only a temporary matter i had surrendered my licensed firearms and hidden the unlicensed ones after an anonymous tip that the cops were coming with a warrant which had subsequently been returned to me when it became apparent that the surrender notice was of dubious legality and possibly in breach of the second amendment less open to argument was the decision to rescind my permit to carry a concealed weapon in the state of maine on the grounds that my previous actions had revealed me as an unsafe person aimee was working on that one too but so far a brick wall would have been more yielding than the state police i was being punished but just how long that punishment would continue remained to be seen now i was working as bar manager at the great lost bear in portland which wasnt bad work and usually only took up four days each week but it wasnt what i was good at it didnt seem as though there was a great deal of sympa byeal of sythy for my plight in the local law enforcement community i couldnt recall how id made so many enemies until aimee took the trouble to explain exactly how id managed it and then it had all become a little clearer to me strangely i didnt care about what had occurred as much as hansen and his superiors might have thought it had dented my pride and my lawyer was fighting in my name partly on principle and mostly because i didnt want hansen and those above him to think that i would just roll over and die on their sayso but in a sense i was almost satisfied that i couldnt practice as a pi it left me free relieving me of the obligation to help others if i were to take on a case however informally it would probably land me in jail the state polices actions had given me permission to be selfish and to pursue my own aims it had taken me some months to decide that that was what i was going to do despite what the old man durand might have thought earlier that day i hadnt chosen lightly to delve into my past and to question the circumstances of my fathers death a man a foul man who used the name kushiel but was better known as the collector had whispered to me that my family had secrets that my blood group could not have been the result of my assumed parentage for a time i tried to hide from myself what he had said i did not want to believe it i think that i took the job in the bar in part as a form of escape i replaced my obligations to clients with my obligations to dave evans one of the owners of the bear and the man who had offered me the job but as time passed and winter came again i made a decision because the collector had not been lying not entirely the blood groups did not match when the new year dawned i started asking questions i began trying to contact those who had known my father and especially the cops who had worked alongside him some were dead others had fallen off the radar after retirement as sometimes happens with those who have served their time and desire only to collect their pensions and walk away from it all but i knew the names of the two men to whom my father had been particularly close beat cops who had graduated from the academy alongside him eddie grace who was a couple of years older than my father and jimmy gallagher my fathers old partner and closest friend my mother had sometimes referred semifondly to my father and jimmy as the birthday boys a reference to their twice yearly nights on the town those were the only times when my father would stay out all night eventually reappearing shortly before noon the following day when he would return quietly almost apologetically slightly the worse for wear but never sick or stumbling and sleep until the evening my mother never commented on it it was an indulgence that she permitted him and he was a man of few indulgences or so it seemed to me and then there was jimmy gallagher himself i hadnt seen him since shortly after the funeral when he had come to the house to ask how my mother and i were doing and she had told him that she intended to leave pearl river and return to maine my mother had sent me to bed but what teenager would not have listened at the top of the stairs seeking some of the information that he was certain was being withheld from him and i heard my mother say how much did you know jimmy about what about all of it the girl the people who came how much did you know i knew about the girl the others i could almost see him shrugging will said they were the same people jimmy did not answer for a time then thats not possible you know that its not i killed one of them and the other died months before the dead dont return not like that he whispered it to me jimmy the tears were being held back but only barely it was one of the last things he said to me he said it was them he was frightened elaine frightened for you and the boy but he killed them jimmy he killed them and they werent even armed i dont know why i know why he wanted to stop them he knew that they would come back in the end they wouldnt need guns theyd use their bare hands if they had to maybe what maybe theyd even have preferred it that way she concluded now she began to cry i heard jimmy stand and i knew that he was putting his arms around her consoling her well never know for sure this i do know he loved you he loved you both and he was sorry for all that he did to hurt you i think he spent those years trying to make it up to you but he never could it wasnt your fault he couldnt forgive himself thats all he just couldnt do it my mothers sobbing increased in intensity and i turned away and went as quietly as i could to my room where i watched the moon from my window and stared out at franklin avenue and the paths that my father would never walk again the server came to take away our plates he seemed impressed with angel and louiss demolition of their food and commensurately disappointed in me we ordered coffee and watched the place begin to empty is there anything we can do asked angel no i think this one is mine he must have spotted something playing on my mind its movements replicated on my face what arent you telling us the old man durand he said that a young manlate twenties according to him maybe a little olderhad come to his place a couple of months ago he was snooping around durand called him on it and the guy said he was hunting in pearl river said angel what was he hunting leprechauns louis spoke might be nothing to do with you might not i agreed but he asked if durand knew what had happened there thrill seeker murder tourist youve had them before durand said that the guy made him uneasy thats all he couldnt put his finger on why not much you can do then unless he shows up again yeah a late twentysomething guy in new york who makes people uneasy shouldnt be hard to spot hell that description even covers half of the mets starting lineup we paid the tab then headed out into the night you call us anytime said angel were around they hailed a cab and i watched them head uptown when they were gone from sight i went back into the restaurant and sat at the bar sipping another glass of wine i thought about the hunter and wondered if it was me he was hunting and part of me willed him to come chapter five the great lost bear was a portland institution it occupied a space on forrest avenue away from the main tourist drag of the old port that had once housed a bar called bottoms up semibig bands used to play there groups that were either on their way up or on their way down or had just reached a plateau where all that mattered was a paying gig in front of a decentsize crowd preferably one that wasnt about to start hurling bottles when they departed from the hits to play a new song the stage lighting was still in place in the restaurant area which always gave the impression that either the diners were only a prelude to the main act or they were the main act half of the building also used to be a bakery and at pm as the bar was serving last rounds the place would fill with the smell of baking bread driving the customers into paroxysms of the munchies just after the kitchens had closed when the bar changed hands in it became known as the grizzly bear until a pizza chain on the west coast objected and the name was changed to the great lost bear which was more evocative anyway the bears main claim to fame apart from its general conviviality and the fact that it served food until late was its beer selection fiftysix draft beers at any one time sometimes even sixty despite its location in a quiet part of the city not far from the university of southern maine s campus it had built up a considerable reputation over the years and now the summer which used to be slow was its busiest time as well as locals the bear attracted the beer aficionados most of whom were men and men of a certain age they didnt cause trouble they didnt overindulge and mostly they were content to talk about hops and casks and obscure microbreweries of which even some of the bartenders had never heard in fact the more obscure they were the better for there was a kind of competitiveness among a certain group of drinkers at the bear occasionally the sight of a woman might distract them from the task at hand for a time but there would be other women there wouldnt always be a guy sitting next to them who had tried every microbrew in portland oregon but knew squat about portland maine i had been working as the bar manager in the bear for a little over four months i wasnt hurting for money not yet but it made sense to find some kind of work while aimee price fought my case i had a daughter to support even if her mother wasnt pressing me for payments i sometimes wondered if rachel might have preferred it if i wasnt part of sams life at all although she had never uttered anything that might have led me to that conclusion i was allowed to visit sam over in vermont any time that i chose as long as i gave rachel some notice even then i had sometimes felt the urge to see sam and truth be told rachel for there was unfinished business between us and had traveled to burlington on a whim apart from the occasional disapproving look from rachels father for she and sam lived in the adjoining cottage on her parents property such unscheduled visits had so far caused no friction between us rachel and i had slept together a couple of times since the separation but neither of us had raised the possibility of a reconciliation i didnt think that one was possible not now but it didnt prevent me from loving her still it was a situation that couldnt last we were drifting further and further apart it was over but neither of us had spoken the words yet it was a little after four on thursday afternoon and the bear was quiet for now well relatively quiet three men were seated at the bar two were regulars classic maine winter types in worn boots sox caps and enough layers of clothing to ward off the effects of a second ice age until someone got around to opening a bar in a cave and began brewing beer again their names were scotty and phil usually there was a third guy with them called dan or variously dan the man danny boy or when he wasnt within earshot dan the dummy but on this particular occasion dan was absent and taking his place was a man who was not considered a regular but looked like he was about to become one now that i was working there this was not necessarily a good thing i liked jackie garner he was loyal and brave and he kept his mouth shut about the things that he had done in my name but something rattled in his head when he walked and i wasnt certain that he was entirely sane he was the only person i knew who had volunteered to attend military school instead of a regular high school since he liked the idea of being taught how to shoot stab and blow things up he was also curiously the only person i knew who had been quietly expelled from military school for his excessively enthusiastic attitude toward shooting stabbing and most particularly blowing things up an enthusiasm that made him as potentially lethal to his comrades as to his enemies eventually the army found a place for him in its ranks but it had never quite managed to control him and it was hard not to feel that the us military had raised a discreet cheer when jackie was eventually invalided out worse where jackie went the fulci brothers tony and paulie frequently went too and the fulcis blockhouses in human form made jackie look like mother teresa so far they hadnt graced the bear with their presence but it was only a matter of time i still hadnt worked out how to tell dave that hed have to get a couple of chairs reinforced for them i figured that when he heard the fulcis might be about to become regulars hed just fire me that or load up with guns and prepare for a siege dan not around i asked scotty nah hes back in the hospit lin the hotal he thinks he might be schizophrenic it figured he was certainly something ending in ic schizophrenic would do to be getting along with until they found out for sure what it was he still dating that girl asked phil well one of him is said scotty and laughed phil frowned he wasnt as smart as scotty he had never voted because he claimed the machines were too complicated one of his brothers who was even less intellectually endowed than phil had ended up in jail after writing to dateline nbcs to catch a predator asking them to fix him up with a date you know the one not so smart continued phil as though scotty hadnt spoken he thought for a moment lia thats it dumb as a box of doughnuts that old proverb about people in glass houses had clearly never made an impact on phil he was the kind of guy who would throw a stone in a glass house and then be surprised when it didnt bounce understatement said scotty girl gave herself a jailhouse tattoo couldnt even spell her own name right three fucking letters how hard could it be now she has lai tattooed on her arm goes around telling people shes half hawaiian wasnt she in a cult yeah couldnt spell that right either or else her hand slipped now she has to keep her left arm covered up especially in church yeah well its not like dan the man is anybodys idea of a catch said jackie he lives with his mother and sleeps in a nascar bed jackie i pointed out you live with your mother yeah but i dont sleep in no nascar bed i left them to it wondering if those three should be the first guys i banned from the bar and went to help gary maser stock the domestic bottles id hired gary shortly after i became bar manager and he was working out well when wed finished and id poured us both a cup of coffee jackie phil and scotty were still around unfortunately jackie was reading aloud from the newspaper its that guy again the one from ogunquit who got abducted by aliens he explained says he cant turn on his tv no more says the channels keep changing without him touching the clicker and it makes his head buzz jackie considered this for a time how come its always guys from ogunquit that these things happen to he asked or fort kent said scotty ayuh fort kent said phil all three nodded in solemn understanding it was a widely held belief down east that once you got a certain distance north in maine people became very strange indeed given that fort kent was about as far north as a person could go without taking out canadian citizenship it followed that its denizens had strangeness all wrapped up i mean jackie continued what do the aliens think theyre going to learn from snd learn froticking a probe up the ass of some fella from ogunquit apart from the obvious said phil like not to do it again said scotty youd think theyd abduct nuclear scientists or generals said jackie instead all they seem to do is take crackers and rubes foot soldiers said phil first wave said scotty theyre the ones the aliens will have to yknow subdue but why the probing asked jackie whats with that could be someone was yanking their chain said phil some venusian yah you stick a probe up their asses and they light up they play a tune said scotty i just dont understand it jackie concluded at the end of the bar there was a man scribbling in a notebook his face looked familiar and i thought he might have been in the previous week although he wasnt a regular he was in his early fifties and wore a brown tweed jacket and an opencollared white shirt his hair was short and either he was aging well or he was spending a lot on grecian when id served him earlier id caught a hint of expensive aftershave now he had a finger width of beer at the bottom of his glass i wandered over to him get you another as he saw me approach he closed the notebook and glanced at his watch just the check thanks he said i nodded and slipped him the tab nice place he said yeah it is you been working here long nope wouldnt even be working today if one of the regular bartenders wasnt sick so what you the manager just the bar manager huh he chewed his bottom lip and seemed to consider me for a moment or two well ill be on my way next time sure i said i watched him leave jackie caught the look on my face something he asked probably nothing but i didnt have time to think about the stranger for the rest of the evening thursday was always microbrew night at the bear with beer specials and that night we were hosting a small brewery named andrews brewing company a fatherandson operation out of lincolnville minutes later we were swamped and it was all that i could do to keep us out of the weeds for the evening two large birthday groups one almost entirely male the other exclusively female hit the restaurant simultaneously and over the course of the night began to meld into one indistinguishable whonksuishable le of boozefueled carnality meanwhile there was rarely more than one seat free at the bar and everyone seemed to want to eat as well as drink shorthanded as we were it meant that gary and i were working flat out for six hours solid i didnt even remember seeing jackie leave i must have been changing a keg when he wandered into the night this is still february right asked gary as he made a batch of margaritas for sarah one of the regular waitresses who always kept her head covered with a scarf which made her easy to spot on nights like this one i think so then where the hell did all these people come from its february at about ten thirty things quieted down some and there was time to restock and deal with our casualties one of the line chefs had sliced himself badly across the palm of the hand with a paring knife and the wound needed stitches now that the bear was a little calmer he was free to drive himself to the emergency room apart from that there were the usual minor burns and heated tempers in the kitchen id give the line chefs this much they were always entertaining the ones who worked at the bear were better than most i knew people in the business who spent a significant portion of their time bailing their chefs out from jail finding places for them to sleep when their old ladies threw their asses out on the street and occasionally beating them into submission just to keep them under control a group of portland cops had taken up position near the door gary had been looking after them for most of the evening the bear was a popular hangout for local law enforcement there was parking the beer was good it served food until closing and it was far enough away from the old port and portland pd headquarters to make them feel that they were off the radar perhaps its bunkerlike aspect appealed to them as well the bear didnt have many windowsand most of those were bricked upand if all of the lights were switched off it was pitchblack inside now as i watched the crowd of cops parted slightly and a familiar figure made his way to the bar i had assumed that they were all portland cops but i was wrong one of them at least was a statie hansen the detective out of the barracks in gray who more than anyone else i believed was relishing my current situation he was fit looking his eyes more green than blue with very black hair and a permanent dark shadow on his face from years of shaving with an electric razor as usual he was better dressed than the average cop he wore a wellcut dark blue suit and a blue paisley tie a gold tiepin twinkled as it caught the lights above the bar he took a seat away from the main group and placed his nearempty glass on the bar then put his hands together and waited for me to come to him i let a couple of seconds go by then resigned myself to having to deal with him what can i get you detective i said he didnt reply his jaw moved as his bottom teeth worried against his incisors i wondered how much hed had to drink and decided that it probably wasnt much he didnt seem like a man who liked to cut loose i heard you were working here he said took you awhile to drop by this isnt a social call i guessed that i dont think sociability is in your makeup he looked away shaking his head slightly a reasonable man faced with an unreasonable one what are you doing here he asked gesturing with disdain at the bar the clientele maybe even the world itself making a living you and your buddies dug up my chosen career path i picked another temporarily temporarily you think so i hear your lawyer is making a lot of calls on your behalf good luck to her better rack up the tips she doesnt work cheap well heres your chance to contribute to the cause you want a refill on that or should i just leave you to fill it yourself with piss and vinegar hansen leaned forward his eyes i now saw were slightly glazed either hed had more than i thought or he just couldnt hold his booze this is a cop place dont you have any dignity you let good police see you like this working behind a bar what are you trying to do rub it in their faces it was a question that id asked myself even dave had said when he offered me the job that he would understand if i didnt want to take it because of the cops who drank there i told him i didnt much care what anyone thought but maybe hansen was hitting closer to the mark than i wanted to give him credit for there was an element of cussedness about my decision to work at the bear i wasnt going to slink away after what had happened true some of the cops who came to the bar seemed embarrassed at first by my presence there and a couple were openly contemptuous of me but they were guys whod never much cared for me anyway most of the rest were just fine and some had let me know how sorry they were for what had been done it didnt matter much either way i was content to let things rest for now it gave me time to do what i wanted to do you know detective if i didnt know better id think that you had a hardon for me maybe i could introduce you to some people might help relieve some of that tension or you could take out an ad in the phoenix lot of guys out there aching for a man with a uniform in his closet hansen expelled a single humorless laugh like a poison dart being blown from a pipe youd better hold on to that dry wit he said a man who goes home smelling of stale beer to an empty house needs something to laugh about its not empty i said i have a dog i picked up his glass i figured he was drinking andrews brown so i poured him a refill and placed it before him on the house i said we like to keep good customers happy you drink it he replied were done here he took his wallet from his pocket and put down a twenty keep the change wont buy you much but itll buy you even less in new york you want to tell me what you were doing down there he had taken me by surprise but i shouldnt have been shocked id been stopped five times by state troopers on the highway in recent months it was someones way of letting me know that i hadnt been forgotten now a cop at the portland jetport had probably recognized me when i was either traveling to or from new york and had made a call id need to be more careful in the future i was visiting friends thats good a man needs friends but i find that youre working a case and ill break you he turned away said his goodbyes to his buddies and left the bar gary sidled over to me as the door closed behind hansen everything okay everythings fine i handed him the twenty i think he was one of yours gary looked at the untouched beer he didnt finish his beer he didnt come here to drink then why did he come here it was a good question for the company i guess chapter six i took walter my labrador retriever for a walk when i eventually got home shortly after eleven the novelty of snow had eventually worn off for him as it did for most creatures man or beast who spent longer than a week in maine in winter so that now he contented himself with a few desultory sniffs before doing what he had to do and indicating his preference for returning to his warm basket by turning around and heading straight back to the house he had matured a lot in the last year perhaps it was because the house was quieter than it was before and he had accommodated himself somewhat to the fact that rachel and sam were no longer part of its and his routines i liked having him in the house for a whole lot of reasons security company and maybe because he was a link to the family life that was no longer mine two families lost now rachel and sam to vermont and susan and jennifer to a man who had torn them apart and who had died in turn by my hand but i also felt guilty about the amount of time i was leaving walter alone or with my neighbors the johnsons they were happy to look after him when i wasnt around but bob wasnt so good on his feet anymore and it was asking a lot of him to exercise a frisky dog regularly i locked the doors patted walter a final time then went to bed and tried to sleep but when it came it brought with it strange dreams dreams of susan and jennifer so vivid that i woke in the darkness convinced that i had heard someone speak it had been many months since i had dreamed of them in such a way what do i call them even now after all these years how do i say it my murdered wife my late daughter they died but i held something of them inside me for too long and that in turn manifested itself as phantasms echoes of the next life in this one and i could not bring myse hooing itlf to call these remnants by the names of those whom i had loved we haunt ourselves i sometimes think or rather we choose to be haunted if there is a hole in our lives then something will fill it we invite it inside and it accepts willingly but i had made my peace with them i thought susan my wife jennifer my daughter beloved of me and i beloved of them susan once said to me that if anything happened to jennifer if she were to die before her time before her mother then i should not tell susan what had occurred i should not try to explain to her that her child was gone i must not do that to her if jennifer were to die i was to kill susan there should be no words no warning she should not have time to look at me and understand why i was to take her life for she did not believe that she could live with the loss of her child it would be too much to bear and she would not be able to withstand such pain it would not kill her not at first but it would draw the life from her just the same and all that would be left would be a hollow shell a woman resonant with grief and she would hate me she would hate me for putting her through such sorrow for not loving her enough to spare her i would be a coward in her eyes promise me she said as i held her in my arms promise me that you wont let that happen i dont ever want to hear those words i dont want to have to hurt that much i couldnt bear it do you hear me this isnt a joke a whatif i want you to promise me promise me that i will never have to endure that pain and i promised i knew that i could not have done what she asked and perhaps she knew that too but i made the promise just the same that is what we do for the ones we love we lie to protect them not all truths are welcome but what she did not explain what she did not consider was what would happen if they were both wrenched from me should i take my own life should i follow them into that dark place tracing their steps through the underworld until i found them at last a sacrifice to no purpose other than the denial of loss or should i continue and if i should then how what form should my life take should i die alone worshipping at the shrine of their memory waiting for life to do what i could not do for myself or would i try to find a way to live with their loss to survive without betraying their memory what acts do those who are left behind have to perform to honor the memory of the departed and how far can they go before they betray that memory i lived that is what i did they were taken but i stayed i found the one who had killed them and i killed him in turn but it gave me no satisfaction it did not assuage the burning grief it did not make their loss any easier to endure and it almost cost me my soul if indeed i have a soul the collector that repository of old secrets once told me that i did not and sometimes i am inclined to believe him i still feel their loss every day it never goes away it defines me i am the shadow cast by all that once was chapter seven daniel faraday sat in the basement room andth d felt his grief slowly give way to anger his son had been dead for four days and his body still lay in the morgue they had been assured that he would be released for burial the next day the chief had promised them as much during his visit earlier that afternoon in the days since the discovery of bobbys remains daniel and his wife had become ghosts in their own home creatures defined only by loss and absence and grief their only son was gone and daniel knew that his passing signaled also the death of their marriage in all but name bobby had kept his parents together but his father had not realized the extent of their debt to him until he had left for college and then returned so much of their conversation had revolved around the activities of their beloved son their hopes for him their fears their occasional disappointments although the latter now seemed so trivial that daniel silently berated himself for ever having raised them with the boy he regretted every harsh word every argument every hour of sullen silence that had passed in the aftermath of conflict even as he did so he recalled the circumstances of each disagreement and knew that every word spoken in anger had also been spoken out of love this had been his sons space there was a tv and a stereo and a dock for his ipod although bobby was one of the only kids in town who still preferred to listen to music on vinyl when he was at home he had inherited his fathers old record collection most of it classic stuff from the sixties and seventies adding to it from the racks of usedrecord stores and the occasional yard sale there was still an lp sitting on the turntable an original copy of after the gold rush by neil young its surface a network of tiny scratches yet clearly as far as bobby had been concerned still listenable the pops and hisses a part of the records history its warmth and humanity enhanced by the flaws it had accumulated over the years most of the basement floor was covered by a huge rug that always smelled faintly of spilled beer and old potato chips there were bookshelves and a gunmetal gray filing cabinet whose drawers had been used mainly for storing old photographs college notes and textbooks and unbeknownst to the boys mother some mild pornography there was a battered red couch with a stained blue pillow at one end facing the tv the pillow still bore the imprint of his sons head and the couch had retained the shape of his body so that in the dim light cast by the basements sole lamp it seemed that the ghost of his son had somehow returned to this place occupying his old familiar position a thing invisible yet with weight and substance daniel wanted so much to curl up there to mold his body into the ridges and hollows of the couch to become one with his lost son yet he did not to do so would be to disturb the impression that remained and with it to banish something of the boys essence he would not lie there nobody would lie there it would remain as a memorial to all that had been taken from him from them at first there had been only shock bobby could not be gone he could not be dead death was for the old and the sick death was for the children of other men his son was mortal but not yet shadowed by mortality his passing should have been a distant thing and his father and mother should have predeceased him he should have mourned them it was not right not natural that they should now be forced to cry over his remains to watch as his coffin was lowered into the ground he remembered again the sight of his sons body on the gurney in the morgue draped with a sheet swollen with the gases of decay a deep red line circling his throat where the rope had cut into him suicide that had been the initial verdict bobby had asphyxiated himself by tying a rope to a tree dropping the noose at the other end around his neck and leaning forward with the full weight of his body at some point he had realized the awfulness of what was about to happen and had struggled to release himself scratching and tearing at his flesh even ripping loose one of his fingernails but by then the rope had cinched itself tight the knot designed so that if his courage failed him the instrument of his selfdestruction would not the chief had asked them in those first hours if they knew why bobby might have wanted to kill himself was he unhappy were there unusual stresses and tensions in his life did he owe money to anyone the autopsy showed that he had been drinking heavily before he died and his motorcycle was found in a ditch at the edge of the field it was a wonder the coroner said that the boy had managed to ride the bike so far considering the amount of alcohol he had consumed and all daniel faraday could think of was the girl emily the one for whom his son had not been good enough but then the chief had returned to them that afternoon and everything had changed it was a question of angles and force he had told them although he and the state police detectives had already voiced their suspicions among themselves given the nature of the wounds that the rope had left on his skin there had been two injuries to his sons neck but the first had been obscured by the second and it had taken the arrival of the states chief medical examiner to confirm the suspicions of her deputy two injuries the first inflicted by asphyxiation from behind possibly while the boy was lying flat on the ground judging by some bruises to his back where his attacker had perhaps knelt upon him the initial injury was not fatal but had resulted only in a loss of consciousness death had occurred from the second injury the noose had been kept around the boys neck as he was lifted to his knees the other end of the rope secured around the trunk of the tree his killer or killers had then put further pressure on his back forcing him forward so that he slowly strangled the chief had said that it must have taken considerable strength and effort to kill big strong bobby faraday in that way the rope was being tested for traces of dna as was the lower part of the tree but they had waited for him to continue the person or persons responsible for bobbys death had been careful he told them bobbys hair and clothing had been soaked with pond water and mud along with his fingernails and the skin of his hands the intention had clearly been to corrupt any trace evidence and it had been successful the authorities werent going to give up on finding bobbys killer he reassured them but their task had been made a great deal more difficult he had asked them to keep this information to themselves for the time being and they had agreed to do so after the chief left daniel held his wife as she wept in his arms he was not sure why she was crying and he was only surprised that she had any tears left to shed perhaps she was weeping at the horror of it or because this was a new grief caused by the knowledge that her son had not taken his own life but that his life had instead been taken from him by others she did not say and he did not ask her but when he felt the first of his own tears slide down his cheek he understood that his were not tears of loss or of horror or even of anger he was relieved in that moment he realized that he had felt a kind ofas ñlt a kind hatred for his son for killing himself he had been raging at him for the selfishness of the act for the stupidity of it for not turning to those who loved him in his moment of direst need he had hated his son for rendering his father powerless and for leaving his parents to bear the weight of his awful grief in his stead for the time that he had believed his son had died at his own hand daniel had contemplated the horror of the act during the long still days and nights the hours creeping by with relentless sloth grief it seemed was a kind of matter it could not be created or destroyed but merely altered in form in dying the sadness that might have driven bobby to such an act had not dissipated but had merely transferred itself to those left behind there had been no note no explanation as though any explanation could have sufficed instead there had only been unanswered questions and the gnawing sense that they had failed their son in some way and daniels first instinct had been to blame the girl his son had not been the same since she had broken off their relationship despite his size and his apparent ease with the world there was a sensitivity to him a softness he had dated before and there had been breakups and teenage traumas but he had fallen heavily for the slim young woman with the dark hair and pale green eyes she was a few years older than bobby and she had something special that was undeniable there had been rivals for her affections but she had chosen him his son knew that the power had been hers and he had always struggled slightly with the imbalance that it created in the relationship daniel believed as most fathers did that his son was the finest young man in town maybe even the finest young man he had ever known he deserved the very best in life the most rewarding of jobs the most beautiful of women the most loving of children that bobby did not share this view was both one of his best and worst qualities admirable in its natural humility yet frustrating in the way in which it stifled his ambition and caused him to doubt himself daniel believed that the girl was clever enough to play on that disparity but then that was true of all her sex for daniel faraday had always been suspicious of women he admired them and was deeply attracted to them in truth more than his wife knew or pretended not to know because he had acted on that attraction with others more than once during their marriage but he had never come close to understanding them and by engaging in casual conquests and then casting them aside he was able to balance this lack of comprehension with a degree of contempt although he would never have been able to acknowledge his actions to himself in quite those terms he had watched as the girl manipulated his son twisting and turning him as though he were caught on a silken thread that could be used to draw him closer or keep him dangling at a distance as she chose bobby knew what was being done and yet he was so smitten that he could not bring himself to break the bond his father and mother had discussed it more than once over a bottle of wine but had differed in their interpretations of the relationship while daniels wife had acknowledged that the girl was clever still she felt that there was nothing unusual in her behavior she was merely doing what all young girls did or what those who understood the nature of the balance of power between the sexes generally did the boy wanted her but as soon as she gave herself to bobby unconditionally she would cede control of the relationship to him better to force him to prove his loyalty to her before she surrendered herself fully daniel had to concede that his wife had a point but he disliked seeing his son being played for a fool bobby was comparatively naive and inexperienced even though he was almost twentytwom tñt twenty he had not yet had his heart truly broken then the girl had ended the relationship after bobby came back from college for the holidays and that experience had been forced upon him there had been no warning and no explanation was given beyond the fact that she believed bobby was not the man for her his son had taken it badly to the extent that it had caused him actual physical pain he said an ache deep in his belly that would not subside the breakup had also plunged him into depression a depression exacerbated by the fact that this was a small town there were only so many places one could go to drink to eat to see a movie to pass the time the girl worked behind the bar at deans place and deans was where the young people of the townand many of the older ones toohad for generations gone to congregate if bobby wanted to socialize then deans could be avoided for only so long daniel knew that following the breakup there had been encounters at deans between the two young people even then the girl had enjoyed the upper hand his son had been drinking while she had not after one particularly loud exchange old dean himself who ruled his bar like a benevolent dictator had been forced to warn bobby against bothering the staff as a result bobby had stayed away from deans for a week returning home from work each evening and heading straight for his basement hideaway barely pausing to greet his parents and only emerging to raid the refrigerator or to share an awkward meal at the kitchen table sometimes he even slept on the couch instead of in the adjoining bedroom not even bothering to undress only after some of his friends came by and cajoled him out did the clouds above his head seem to break for a time and then only for as long as he avoided seeing the girl when his body was discovered daniels first thought was that he had killed himself out of some misplaced devotion to emily after all there seemed to be nothing else troubling him in life he was saving for college and seemed to have every intention of returning to further study hinting that perhaps emily might come with him and get a job in the city he was popular with his friends both there and at home and his natural disposition had always tended toward the optimistic or had until the dissolution of his relationship emily should have stayed with his son thought daniel he was a fine boy she should not have hurt him she should not have broken his heart when she had arrived at the death site just as the body was being carried across the fields to the waiting ambulance daniel had been unable to speak to her she had approached him her eyes glistening her arms raised to hold him and to be held in turn but he had turned away from her one hand outstretched behind him the palm raised in a gesture that was plain not only to her but to all who had witnessed it and in that way he had made it clear where he felt the blame for his sons death lay and so bobbys mother had wept tears of grief and pain at the news that her sons life had been taken from him by others of incomprehension at the manner of her sons death while his father had felt some of the weight lifted from his shoulders and he marveled at his own selfishness now in the basement the anger came back and his hands formed themselves into fists as he raged at the faceless thing that had killed his son somewhere above him the doorbell rang but he barely heard it over the roaring in his head then his name was called and he allowed the tension to ease from his body he released a ragged breath my boy he said softly my poor boy emily kindler was sitting at the kitchen table behind her his wife was making tea mr faraday said emily he found that he was now able to smile at her it was a small thing but there was genuine warmth in it there was no longer any hint of blame attaching to her for what had occurred and now she seemed more like a link to his son fuel for the fire of his memory emily he said how are you doing okay i guess she could not look at his face he knew that his rejection of her at the place of his sons death had wounded her deeply and if he had absolved her of all blame then she had yet to do the same for him they had never discussed what had happened that day so it was true to say that he had not made any recompense for it his wife came over and touched the girls hair gently with the palm of her hand smoothing down some loose strands daniel thought that they looked a little like each other both were pale and without makeup and there were dark circles of grief beneath their eyes ive come to tell you that im leaving after the funeral he was surprised he struggled to find something to say listen honey he said i owe you an apology he reached for her hand and she allowed him to take it that day the day they found bobby i wasnt myself i was just so hurt so shocked that i couldnti couldnt words failed him he did not want to lie to her and he did not want to tell her the truth i know why you couldnt look at me she said you thought it was my fault maybe you still do he felt his chin begin to tremble and his eyes grew hot he did not want to cry in front of her he shook his head im sorry he said i apologize for ever thinking that of you now she gripped his hand tentatively as his wife placed three cups on the table and poured tea from an old china pot thank you chief dashut came by earlier he continued he said that bobby didnt take his own life he was murdered he asked us to keep it quiet for now weve told nobody else but you you should know the girl made a small mewling sound the little blood she had left seemed to drain from her face what the injuries theyre not consistent with suicide he was crying now bobby was killed someone choked him until he was unconscious then tied him up and forced him forward until he died who would do that who would do such a thing to my boy he tried to hold on to her but her hand slipped from his she stood up teetering on her low heels no she said she turned suddenly her right hand trailing it caught the nearest cup and sent it falling to the floor where it shattered on the tiles i have to go she said lrsqñshe saiddquoi cant stay here and there was something in her voice that caused daniels tears to cease and his eyes grew sharp what do you mean i just cant stay i have to leave there was knowledge in her eyes daniel saw it what do you know he said what do you know about my boys death he reached out to her but she pulled away from him he heard his wife say something but it meant nothing to him all of his attention was focused on the girl her eyes were huge they were staring not at him but at the window behind him where her face was reflected in the glass she looked confused as though the image that she saw there was not the one she had expected to see tell me he said please she did not speak for a time then softly i caused this what how im bad luck i bring it with me it follows me now she looked at him for the first time and he shivered he thought that he had never before seen such desolation in the eyes of another human being not even in his wifes eyes when hed told her that their son was dead not even in his own as he looked in the mirror and saw the father of a dead child what follows you the first of the tears began to fall from her eyes she continued speaking but he felt as though their presence in the room was immaterial to her she was talking to another or perhaps only to herself theres something haunting me she said someone haunting me following in my footsteps it wont give me peace it wont leave me alone it hurts the people i care about i bring it down on them i dont want to but i do slowly he approached her emmy he said using his sons pet name for her youre not making any sense who is this person i dont know she said her head low i dont know he wanted to hold her he wanted to shake her to pummel the information from her he did not know if she was talking about a real person or some imagined shadow a ghost conjured up to explain her own torment he wanted her to clarify it for him an unknown entity had killed his son now here was his exgirlfriend talking about someone following her it needed to be explained she seemed to sense what he was thinking for as he moved to take hold of her she slipped away dont touch me she said and the ferocity with which she spoke caused him to yield to her emily you need to explain yourself you have to tell the police what youve told us she almost laughed tell them what that im haunted she was in the hallway now backing toward the door im sorry for what happened to bobbyrhañned to bo but i wont stay here its found me its time to move on her hand found the door handle and twisted it outside daniel felt snow coming this strange spell of warmth was coming to an end soon they would be lost in drifts and his sons grave would gape darkly amid the whiteness like a wound as they lowered him into the ground he began running as emily turned to leave but she was too fast for him his fingers touched the material of her shirt and then he stumbled on the porch step and dropped heavily to his knees by the time he got to his feet she was already running down the street he tried to follow but his legs hurt and he had been shocked by the fall he leaned against the front gate his face contorted in pain and frustration as his wife held his shoulders and asked him questions that he could not answer daniel called the police as soon as he was inside the house the dispatcher took his name and number and promised to pass his message on to the chief he told her that it was urgent and demanded that she give him dashuts cell phone number but she informed him that the chief was out of town and had given orders that for this night at least he was not to be disturbed eventually she promised to call the chief as soon as daniel was off the line with no other option daniel thanked her and hung up the chief did not call back that night even though the dispatcher had informed him of daniel faradays call he was having a good time with his family at his brothers fortieth birthday and he believed that he had earned it he had not told daniel faraday and his wife of all that he had learned that morning one of his men had called dashuts attention to the base of the tree to which bobby faraday had been tied initials had been carved into its bark by the kids who had gone there to make out over the years transforming it into a monument to love and lust both passing and undying but something else had been hacked into the bark and recently too judging by the color of the exposed flesh beneath a symbol of some kind but unlike anything that dashut had seen before he made sure that a photograph was taken of it and he intended to seek advice about it the next day the symbol might mean nothing of course or be entirely unconnected to the faraday killing but its presence at the murder scene troubled him even at the party as he tried to put it from his mind it came back to him and with a damp finger he found himself tracing it upon a table as if by doing so it might reveal its meaning by the time the party was over it was after am daniel faraday the chief decided would have to wait until the morning daniel faraday and his wife died that night the rings on their gas stove had been turned to high the windows and the front and back doors all fit perfectly in their frames for daniel worked as a supervisor for one of the local utility companies and knew the cost of heat leakage in winter so no gas escaped from the house it seemed that his wife must have had second thoughts at some point that or there was the dreadful possibility that it was not a pact but a murdersuicide on the part of her husband for her body was found lying on the bedroom floor on the kitchen table was a photograph of the faradays with their son along with a bunch of winter flowers it was assumed that they had killed the emily finished packing her bags after leaving the faradays she had been preparing to leave town ever since bobby had gone missing sensing somehow although she did not speak the words aloud that bobby would not be returning that something terrible had befallen him the discovery of his body and the nature of his death only confirmed what she already knew she had been discovered it was time to move on again emily had been running for years from the thing that was pursuing her she was getting better and better at concealing herself from it but not good enough to hide from it forever eventually she feared it would trap her it would trap her and it would consume her chapter eight i had the next day off and it was the first opportunity i had been given in some time to see how unsettled walter had become he would paw at the door to be let out then minutes later would beg to be let in once again he seemed not to want to leave my side for too long but struggled to sleep when bob johnson came over to say hi while out for his morning constitutional walter would not go to him not even when bob offered him half a cookie from his pocket you know said bob he was like that while you were away in new york i thought he might just be ailing that weekend but it doesnt seem to have gotten any better i took walter to the vet that afternoon but the vet could find nothing wrong with him is he alone for long periods she asked me well i work and sometimes i have to stay away from home for a night or two the neighbors look after him when im gone she patted walter my guess is he doesnt like that very much hes still a young dog he needs company and stimulation he needs a routine two days later i made the decision it was sunday and i was on the road early walter on the front seat beside me alternately dozing and watching the world go by i reached burlington before noon and stopped at a little toy store i knew to buy a rag doll for sam and at a bakery to pick up some muffins while i was there i bought a coffee at a place on church street and tried to read the new york times walter at my feet rachel and sam lived only ten minutes outside town but still i lingered i couldnt concentrate on the newspaper instead i stroked walter and his eyelids drooped with pleasure a woman emerged from the gallery across the street her red hair loose upon her shoulders rachel was smiling but not at me a man was behind her saying something t ld that was making her laugh he looked older than she did comfortable and paunchy he placed the palm of his hand lightly against the small of her back as they walked together walter spotted rachel and tried to rise his tail wagging but i held him back with his collar i folded the newspaper and tossed it aside today was going to be a bad day when i reached rachels parents property her mother joan was outside the main house playing ball with sam sam was two now and was already at that point where she knew the names of her favorite foods and understood the concept of mine which pretty much covered everything she had developed a liking for from other peoples cookies to the occasional tree i envied rachel and her family the opportunity she had to watch sam develop i seemed to see it only in fits and starts like a jerky film from which crucial frames had been excised sam recognized me as i stepped from the car actually i think she recognized walter before me because she called out a mangled version of his name that sounded like walnut and spread her arms in welcome she had never been afraid of walter walter fell into the category of mine where sam was concerned and walter i suspected regarded sam in much the same way he bounded up to her but slowed down when he was a couple of feet away so that he wouldnt knock her over when he reached her she threw her arms around him and after licking her some he lay down and let her fall upon him his tail wagging happily if joan had been gifted with a tail i dont think it would have been wagging she struggled to put a smile on her face as i approached and kissed me lightly on the cheek we werent expecting you she said rachel went into town im not sure when shell be back i can wait i said anyway i came to see sam and to ask a favor a favor the smile wavered again itll hold until rachel returns i said sam relinquished her grip on walter for long enough to toddle up to me and put her arms around my legs i lifted her up and stared into her eyes as i gave her the doll hey beautiful i said she laughed and touched my face daddy she said and my eyes grew warm joan invited me inside and offered coffee id had my fill of coffee for the day but it gave her something to do otherwise wed simply have ended up staring at each other or using sam and walter as a distraction joan excused herself and i heard a door close and then her voice speaking in a low tone i guessed that she was calling rachel while she was gone sam and i played with walter and i listened to her speaking a mixture of recognizable words and her own private language joan returned and poured the coffee then put some milk in a plastic cup for sam and we picked at the muffins while talking about nothing at all after about fifteen minutes i heard a car pull up outside then rachel entered the kitchen looking flustered and angry sam immediately went to her then pointed at the dog and said walnut again this is a surpr baás is a suise said rachel making it clear that as surprises went it was right up there with finding a corpse in ones bed a spurofthemoment decision i said sorry if i disrupted your plans despite my best efforts or maybe they just werent very good to begin with there was an edge to my voice rachel picked up on it and frowned joan ever the diplomat took sam and walter outside to play as rachel removed her coat and tossed it on a chair you should have called she said we might have been out or away somewhere she made an attempt to clear some plates from the draining board then gave up so she said how have you been ive been okay you still working at the bear yeah its not so bad she did a good imitation of her mothers pained smile im glad to hear that there was silence for a time then we need to formalize these visits thats all its a long way to come on a whim i try to come as often as i can rach and i do my best to call besides this isnt quite a whim you know what i mean yes i know more silence mom said you had a favor to ask i want you to keep walter for the first time she showed some emotion other than frustration and barely restrained anger what you love that dog yes but im not around enough for him and he loves you and sam at least as much as he loves me hes cooped up in the house when im working and i keep having to ask bob and shirley to look after him when i leave town its not fair to him and i know your mom and dad like dogs rachels parents had kept dogs until very recently when their two old collies had both died within months of each other since then theyd talked about getting another dog but they hadnt quite been able to bring themselves to do it they were still hurting from the earlier deaths rachels face softened ill have to ask mom she said but i think itll be fine are you sure though no i said but its the right thing to do she walked over to me and after a moments hesitation hugged me thank you she said id put walters basket and toys in the trunk and i handed them over to joan once it was clear that she was content to take him her husband frank was away on business but she knew that he wouldnt object especially if it made sam and rachel happy walter keáappy wal seemed to know what was happening he went where his basket went and when he saw it being placed in the kitchen he understood that he was staying he licked my hand as i was leaving then sat himself down beside sam in recognition of the fact that his role as her guardian had been restored to him rachel walked me to the car im just curious she said how come youre away so much if your job is at the bear im looking into something i replied where new york youre not supposed to be working it could prevent you from getting your license back its not business i said its personal its always personal with you hardly worth doing if it isnt well just be careful thats all i will i opened the car door i have to tell you something i was in town earlier i saw you her face froze who is he his name is martin she said after a moment how long have you been seeing him not long a month maybe she paused i dont know how serious it is yet i was going to tell you i just hadnt figured out how i nodded ill call next time i said then got into the car and drove away i learned something that day there may be worse things than arriving somewhere with your dog and leaving without him but there arent many it was a long quiet ride home ii a false friend is more dangerous than an open enemy francis bacon a letter of adviceto the duke of buckingham chapter nine nearly a week went by before i could make another trip to new york not that it mattered so much the bear was shortstaffed again and i ended up working extra days to take some of the load so there was no way that i could have gone down there even if i had wanted to i had been trying to contact jimmy gallagher for almost a month leaving messages on the machine at his home but there had been no reply until that week i received a letter from him not a phon i booked the cheapest flight that i could find and got into jfk shortly before am then took a cab to bensonhurst ever since i was a boy i had struggled to associate jimmy gallagher with bensonhurst of all the places that an irish cop and a closeted homosexual to boot might have called home bensonhurst initially seemed about as likely a choice as salt lake city or kingston jamaica true there were now koreans and poles and arabs and russians in the neighborhood and even africanamericans but it was the italians who had always owned bensonhurst figuratively if not literally when jimmy was growing up each nationality had its own section and if you wandered into the wrong one you were likely to get a beating but the italians gave out more beatings than most now even their age was passing bay ridge parkway was still pretty solidly italian and there was one mass said each day in italian at st dominics at twentieth avenue but the russians chinese and arabs were slowly encroaching taking over the side streets like ants advancing on a millipede the jews and the irish meanwhile had been decimated and the blacks whose roots in the area dated back to the underground railroad had been reduced to a fourblock enclave off bath avenue i was still two hours early for my meeting with jimmy i knew that he went to church every sunday but even if he was home he would resent it if i arrived early that was another thing about jimmy he believed in punctuality and he didnt care for people who erred on the side of early or late so while i waited i took a walk along eighteenth avenue to get breakfast at stellas diner on sixtythird where my father and i had eaten with jimmy on a couple of occasions because even though it was nearly twenty blocks from where he lived jimmy was close to the owners and they always made sure that he was taken care of while eighteenth still bore the title of cristoforo colombo boulevard the chinese had made their mark and their restaurants hair salons lighting stores and even aquarium suppliers now stood alongside italian law firms ginos focacceria queen anns gourmet pasta and the arcobaleno italiano music and dvd store where old men sat on benches with their backs to the avenue as though signaling their dissatisfaction with the changes that had occurred there the old cotillion terrace was boarded up twin pink cocktails on either side of the main marquee still bubbling sadly when i got to stellas it too was no mo b aoo was nore the name remained and i could see some of the stools were still in place in front of the counter but otherwise the diner had been stripped bare we had always sat at stellas counter when we ate there jimmy to the left my father in the middle and i at the end for me it was as close as i could get to sitting at a bar and i would watch as the waitresses poured coffee and the plates moved back and forth between the kitchen and the diners listening to snatches of conversation from all around while my father and jimmy talked quietly of adult things i tapped once upon the glass in farewell then took my new york times down to the corner of sixtyfourth and ate a slice at j vs pizzeria which had been in existence for longer than i had when my watch showed am i made my way to jimmys house jimmy lived on seventyfirst between sixteenth and seventeenth a block that consisted mostly of narrow row houses in a small onefamily semidetached stucco house with a wroughtiron fence surrounding the garden and a fig tree in the backyard not far from the area still known as new utrecht this had been one of the six original towns of brooklyn but then it was annexed to the city in the s and lost its identity it had been mostly farmland until when the coming of the brooklyn bath and west end railroad opened it up to developers one of whom james lynch built a suburb bensonhurstbythesea for a thousand families with the railroad came jimmy gallaghers grandfather who had been a supervising engineer on the project and his family eventually after some shuffling around the gallaghers returned to bensonhurst and settled in the house that jimmy still occupied not too far from the landmark new utrecht reformed church at eighteenth and eightythird in time the subway came and with it the middle classes including jews and italians who were abandoning the lower east side for the comparatively wide open spaces of brooklyn fred trump the donalds father made his name by building the shore haven apartments near the belt parkway at five thousand units the largest private housing development in brooklyn finally the southern italian immigrants arrived in force in the s and bensonhurst became percent italian by blood and percent italian by reputation i had visited jimmys house on only a couple of occasions with my father one of which was to pay our respects after jimmys father died all i could recall of that occasion was a wall of cops some in uniform some not with redeyed women passing around drinks and whispering memories of the departed shortly after his mother had moved out to a place on gerritsen beach to be closer to her sister who was ill and looking after her two grandchildren after their father was killed when his truck overturned somewhere near nogales and whose mother struggled with an alcohol addiction since then jimmy had always lived alone in bensonhurst the exterior of the house was much as i remembered it the yard tidy the paintwork recently refreshed i was reaching for the bell when the door opened saving me the trouble of ringing and there was jimmy gallagher older and grayer but still recognizably the same big man who had crushed my hand in his grip so that i might earn the dollar that was on offer his face was more florid now and although he had clearly had some sun while he was away a roseate tinge to his nose suggested that he was hitting the booze more often than was wise otherwise he was in good shape he wore a freshly pressed white shirt open at the collar and gray trousers with a razor pleat his black shoes were buffed and polished he looked like a chauffeur who was enjoying his final moments of leisure before ad b are beforeding the finishing touches to his uniform charlie he said its been a long time we shook hands and he grinned warmly patting me on the shoulder with a meaty left paw he was still four or five inches taller than me and i instantly felt as if i was twelve years old again do i get a dollar now i asked as he released his grip youd only spend it on booze he said inviting me inside the hallway boasted a huge coatrack and a grandmother clock that still appeared to be keeping perfect time its loud ticking probably echoed through the house i wondered how jimmy could sleep with the sound of it but i supposed that he had been listening to it for so long he hardly noticed it anymore a flight of carved mahogany stairs led up to the second floor and to the right was the living room furnished entirely with antiques there were photographs on the mantel and on the walls some of them featuring men in uniform among them i saw my father but i did not ask jimmy if i might look more closely at them the wallpaper in the hallway was a redandwhite print that seemed new but had a turnofthecentury look that fit in with the rest of the decor there were two cups on the kitchen table along with a plate of pastries and a fresh pot of coffee was brewing jimmy poured the coffee and we took seats at opposite ends of the small kitchen table have a pastry said jimmy theyre from villabate best in town i broke one apart and tasted it it was good you know your old man and i used to laugh about that booze you bought with the money i gave you hed never have told you because your mother thought it was the end of the world when she found that bottle but he saw that you were growing up and he got a kick out of it mind you he used to say that id put the idea in your head to begin with but he could never be angry at anyone for long and especially not you you were his golden boy he was a good man god rest him god rest them both he nibbled thoughtfully at his pastry and we were quiet for a time then jimmy glanced at his watch it wasnt a casual gesture he wanted me to see him do it and a warning noise went off in my brain i watched him and i realized that jimmy was uneasy it wasnt simply that the son of his old friend a man who had killed two others and then himself was sitting here in his kitchen clearly seeking to rake over the ashes of longdead fires there was more to it than that jimmy didnt want me here at all he wanted me gone and the sooner the better i got a thing he said as he saw me take in the movement some old friends getting together you know how it is any names i might recognize no none theyre all after your fathers time he leaned back in his seat so this isnt a casual call is it charlie i have some questions i said about my father and about what happened on the night those kids died well i cant help you much with the killings i wasnt there i didnt even see your father that day no no it was my birthday i wasnt working i made a good collar for some grass and got my reward your old man was supposed to join me after his tour finished the way he always did but he never made it he twisted his cup in his hands watching the patterns that resulted on the surface of the liquid i never celebrated my birthday the same way after that too many associations all of them bad i wasnt letting him off the hook that easily but your nephew was the one who came to the house that night yeah francis your father called me at cal s told me that he was worried he thought somebody might be trying to hurt you and your mother he didnt say why he believed that cal s was the cop bar that used to stand next door to the ninths precinct house it was gone now like so much else from my fathers time and you didnt ask jimmy puffed out his cheeks i might have asked yeah im sure i did it was out of character for will he didnt go jumping at shadows and he didnt have any enemies i mean there were guys he might have crossed and he put some bad ones away but we all did that was business not personal they knew the difference back then most of them anyway do you remember what he said i think he told me just to trust him he knew that francis lived in orangetown he asked if maybe i could get him to look out for you and your mother just until he had a chance to get back to the house everything happened pretty fast after that where did my father call you from jeez he appeared to be trying to remember i dont know not the precinct thats for sure there was noise in the background so i guess he was using the phone at a bar it was a long time ago i dont recall everything about it i drank some coffee and spoke carefully but it wasnt a typical night jimmy people got killed and then my father took his own life things like that theyre hard to forget i saw jimmy tense and i felt his hostility rise to the surface he had been good with his fists i knew good and quick to use them he and my father balanced each other well my father kept jimmy in check and he in turn honed an edge in my father that might otherwise have remained blunted what is this charlie you calling me a liar what is it jimmy what are you hiding no i said i just dont want you to keep anything from me because say youre trying to spare my feelings he relaxed a little well it was hard i dont like thinking about that time he was my friend the best of them i know that jimmy he nodded your father asked for help and i made a call in return francis stayed with you and your mother i was in the city but i thought you know i cant stay here when something bad might be happening by the time i got to pearl river tho b al river se two kids were dead and your father was already being questioned they wouldnt let me talk to him i tried but internal affairs they were tight around him i went to the house and talked to your mother you were asleep i think after that i only saw him alive one other time i picked him up after theyd finished the interview we went for breakfast but he didnt talk much he just wanted to collect himself before he went home and he didnt tell you why hed just killed two people come on jimmy you were close if he was going to talk to anyone it would have been you he told me what he told iad and whoever else was in the room with him the kid kept pretending to reach inside his jacket taunting will as if he had a gun there hed go so far then pull back will said that the final time he went for it his hand disappeared and will fired the girl screamed and started pulling at the body will warned her before he shot her too he said something snapped inside him when that kid started yanking his chain maybe it did those were different times violent times it never paid to take chances wed all known guys whod taken one on the streets the next time i saw will he was under a sheet and there was a hole in the back of his head that they were going to have to pack before the funeral is that what you wanted to know charlie do you want to hear how i cried over him about how i felt because i wasnt there for him about how ive felt all these years is that what youre looking for someone to blame for what happened that night his voice was raised i could see the anger in him but i couldnt understand its source it seemed manufactured no that wasnt true his sadness and rage were genuine but they were being used to some other end a smoke screen a means of hiding something from both me and himself no thats not what im looking for jimmy there was a weariness and a kind of desperation to what he said next then what do you want i want to know why there is no why cant you get that into your head people have been asking why for twentyfive years ive been asking why and theres no answer whatever the reason was it died when your father died i dont believe that youve got to let it go charlie no good can come of this let them rest in peace both of them your father and your mother this is all over you see thats the problem i cant let them rest why not because one or both of them was not blood to me it was as if someone had taken a pin and punctured jimmy gallagher from behind his back arched and some of his bulk seemed to dissipate he slumped back in the chair what he whispered what kind of talk is that its the blood types they dont match im type b my father was type b aer was tya my mother type o theres no way that parents with those two blood types could produce a child with type b blood its just not possible but who told you this i spoke to our family doctor hes retired now and old but hes kept his records he had them checked and sent me copies of two blood tests from my father and my mother that confirmed it for me its possible that im my fathers son but not my mothers this is madness said jimmy you were closer to my father than any of his other friends if he had told anyone about it he would have told you told me what that there was a cuckoo in the nest he stood up i cant listen to this i wont listen to it youre mistaken you must be he picked up the coffee cups and emptied their contents into the sink then left them there his back was to me but i could see that his hands were shaking im not i said its the truth jimmy spun around suddenly and moved toward me i felt sure that he was going to take a swing at me i stood and kicked the kitchen chair away tensing for the blow waiting to block it if i had time to see it but it did not come instead jimmy spoke calmly and deliberately then its a truth that they didnt want you to know and one that cant help you they loved you both of them whatever this is whatever you think youve discovered leave it alone its only going to hurt you if you keep searching you seem very sure of that jimmy he swallowed hard fuck you charlie you need to go now i have things to do he waved a hand in dismissal and turned his back on me once more ill be seeing you jimmy i said and i knew that he heard the warning in my voice but he said nothing i let myself out and walked back to the subway later i would learn that jimmy gallagher waited only until he was certain that i would not return before making the call it was a number that he had not dialed in many years not since the day after my fathers death he was surprised when the man answered the phone himself almost as surprised as he was to discover that he was still alive its jimmy gallagher i remember said the voice its been a long time dont take this the wrong way but not long enough he thought he heard something that might have been a laugh well what can i do for you mr gallagher charlie parker was just here hes asking questions about his parents he said something about blood types he knows about his mother there was silence on the other end of the line th b athe lineen it was always going to happen eventually he had to find out i didnt tell him anything im sure that you didnt but hell come back hes too good at what he does not to discover that youve lied to him and then the answer when it came gave jimmy his final surprise on a day already filled with unwanted surprises then you might want to tell him the truth chapter ten i spent that night at the home of walter cole the man after whom id named my dog and my former partner and mentor in the nypd and his wife lee we ate dinner together and talked of mutual friends of books and movies and how walter was spending his retirement which seemed to consist of little more than napping a lot and getting under his wifes feet at pm lee who was nobodys idea of a night owl kissed me softly on the cheek and went to bed leaving walter and me alone he threw another log on the fire and filled his glass with the last of the wine then asked me what i was doing in the city i told him of the collector a raggedy man who believed himself to be an instrument of justice a foul individual who killed those whom he considered to have forfeited their souls due to their actions i recalled the nicotine stink of his breath as he spoke of my parents the satisfaction in his eyes as he spoke of blood types of things that he could not have known but did and of how all that i had believed about myself began to fall away at that moment i told him of the medical records my meeting earlier that day with jimmy gallagher and of how i was convinced that he had knowledge he was not sharing with me i also told him one thing that i had not discussed with jimmy when my mother died of cancer the hospital had retained samples of her organs through my lawyer id had a dna test conducted comparing a swab taken from my cheek with my mothers tissue there was no match i had not been able to carry out a similar test on my fathers dna there were no samples available it would require an exhumation order on his remains for such a test to be carried out and i was not yet willing to go that far perhaps i was frightened of what i might find after discovering the truth about my mother i had wept i was not sure that i was ready to sacrifice my father on the same altar as the woman i had called my mother walter sipped his wine and stared into the fire not speaking until i was done why did this man this collector tell you all of this all of the truths and halftruths to begin with he asked it was a typical cop move dont go straight to the main issue but skirt it probe buy time in which to start connecting small details to larger ones because it amused him i replied because hes cruel in ways that we cant even begin to imagine he doesnt sound like the kind of guy who drops hints lightly no which means he was goading you into acting he knew you couldnt let this slide what are you saying im saying that from what youve told me hes used other people like this before to achieve his own ends hell hes even used you just be careful that hes not using you again to flush someone out walter was right the collector had used me to establish the identities of the depraved men he was seeking so that he could punish them for their failings he was cunning and absolutely without mercy now he had hidden himself away again and i had no desire to find him but if thats true then who is he looking for walter shrugged from what youve told me hes always looking for somebody then we came to it as for this blood thing well i dont know what to say what are the options either you were adopted by will and elaine parker and they kept that from you for reasons of their own or will parker fathered you by another woman and he and elaine raised you as their own child thats it those are the choices i couldnt disagree the collector had told me that i was not my fathers son but the collector from my past experience of him never told the truth not entirely it was all a game to him a means of furthering his own ends whatever they might be but always leavened with a little cruelty but it might also have been the case that he simply did not know the entire truth only that something in my parentage did not add up i still did not believe that i had no blood ties to my father everything in me rebelled against it i had seen myself in him i recalled how he had spoken to me how he had looked at me it was different from the woman i had known as my mother perhaps i simply did not want to admit the possibility that it was all a lie but i would not accept such a thing until i had irrefutable proof walter walked to the fire then squatted to stab at it with the poker before speaking again ive been married to lee for thirtynine years now if id cheated on her and the other woman became pregnant i dont think lee would have taken kindly to a suggestion that we raise the child alongside our own daughters even if something had happened to the mother walter thought about it again i can only speak from experience but the strain that would put on a marriage would be almost unendurable you know to be faced every day with the fruit of your husbands infidelity to have to pretend that this child was loved as much as another to treat it the same way as ones own child he shook his head no its too difficult im still inclined toward the first option adoption but they had no other children i thought would that have changed things but why keep it from me i asked putting that thought aside theres no shame to it i dont know maybe it wasnt an official adoption and they were frightened that you might be taken from them in that case it would have been better to b qen better keep it quiet until you were an adult i was a student when my mother died enough time had passed by then for her to have told me yeah but look at what shed gone through her husband takes his own life branded a killer she leaves the state takes her son back to maine with her then she contracts cancer it could be that you were all she had left and she didnt want to lose you as her son whatever the truth might have been he rose from the fire and resumed his seat walter was older than me by almost twenty years and in that moment the relationship between us seemed more like that of a father and a son than two men who had served together because heres the thing of it charlie no matter what you discover they were your mother and your father they were the ones who raised you who sheltered you who loved you what youre chasing is some kind of medical definition of a parent and i understand that it has meaning for you in your shoes id probably do the same but dont mistake this for the real thing will and elaine parker were your father and your mother and dont let anything that you discover obscure that fact he gripped my arm once tightly before releasing me so what now my lawyer has the papers prepared for an exhumation order i said i could have my dna checked against my fathers you could but you havent not ready for that yet right i nodded when do you go back to maine tomorrow afternoon after i speak to eddie grace who another of my fathers cop friends hes been ill but his daughter says that he might be up to a few minutes with me now if i dont tax him and if you dont get anything from him i put the squeeze on jimmy if jimmys hidden something then hes hidden it well cops gossip you know that theyre like fishwives hard to keep anything quiet once it gets out even now i know whos screwing around behind his wifes back whos fallen off the wagon whos using blow or taking kickbacks from hookers and dealers its the way of things and after those two kids died iad went over your fathers life and career with a magnifying glass and tweezers in an effort to find out why it happened the official investigation uncovered nothing screw the official investigation you more than anyone should know how these things work there would have been the official inquiry and the shadow one one that was recorded and open to examination and one that was conducted quietly and then buried in a pit what are you saying im saying ill ask around i still have favors owed lets see if there was a loose thread anywhere that somebody p b qt somebodulled in the meantime you do what you have to do he finished his wine now lets call it a night in the morning ill give you a ride out to pearl river i always did like to see how the micks live made me feel better about not being one chapter eleven eddie grace had recently been released from the hospital into the care of his daughter amanda eddie had been ailing for a long time and id been told that he wasnt well enough to talk to anyone and spent most of his time sleeping but it seemed that he had rallied in recent weeks he wanted to return home and the hospital was content to let him leave as there was nothing more that its staff could do for him the medication to control his pain could just as easily be given to him in his own bed as in a hospital room and he would be less anxious and troubled if surrounded by his family amanda had left a message on my phone in response to my earlier inquiries informing me that eddie was willing and it appeared able to meet with me at her home amanda lived up on summit street within praying distance of st margaret of antioch church and on the other side of the tracks from our old house on franklin street walter dropped me off at the church and went for coffee amanda answered the door seconds after i rang the bell as though she had been waiting in the hallway for me to arrive her hair was long and brown with a hint of some tone from a bottle that was not so far from her natural color as to be jarring she was small a little over five two with freckled skin and very light brown eyes her lipstick looked freshly applied and she smelled of some citrus fragrance that like her managed the trick of being both unassuming yet striking id had a crush on amanda grace while we were at pearl river high school together she was a year older than i and hung with a crowd that favored black nail polish and obscure english groups she was the kind of girl jocks pretended to abhor but about whom they secretly fantasized when their perky blond girlfriends were performing acts that didnt require their boyfriends to look them in the eyes about a year before my father died she began dating michael ryan whose main aims in life were to fix cars and open a bowling alley not worthless ends in themselves but not the level of ambition that i ever believed was going to satisfy a girl like amanda grace mike ryan wasnt a bad guy but his conversational skills were limited and he wanted to live and die in pearl river amanda used to talk about visiting europe and studying at the sorbonne it was hard to see where common ground could lie between her and mike unless it was somewhere on a rock in the midatlantic now here she was and although there were lines where there had not been lines before she was like the town itself largely unaltered she smiled charlie parker she said its good to see you i wasnt sure how to greet her i reached out a hand but she slipped by it and hugged me shaking her head against me as she did so still the same awkward boy she said not i thought without a hint of fondness she released her hold and looked at c anô me with amusement whats that supposed to mean you visit a goodlooking woman and you offer to shake her hand well its been a long time i dont like to make assumptions hows your husband still playing with bowling pins she giggled you make it sound kind of gay big man stroking hard phallic objects difficult not to draw those conclusions you can tell him that when you see him im sure hell take it under advisement im sure that or try to kick my ass from here to jersey the look on her face changed something of the good humor vanished and what replaced it was speculative no she said i dont think hed try that with you she stepped back into the house and held the door open for me come in ive made lunch well i bought some cold cuts and salads and theres fresh bread thatll have to do its more than enough i moved into the house and she closed the door behind me squeezing past me to lead me to the kitchen her hands resting for a moment at my waist her stomach brushing my groin i let out a deep sigh what she said wide eyed and radiating innocence nothing go on say it i think you could still flirt for your country as long as its in a good cause anyway im not flirting with you not much you had your chance a long time ago really i tried to remember any chance id had with amanda grace but nothing came to me i followed her into the kitchen and watched her fill a jug from a purified water faucet yeah really she said not turning you only had to ask me out it wasnt complicated i sat down everything seemed complicated back then not to mike well he wasnt a complicated guy no he wasnt she turned off the faucet and placed the jug on the table he still isnt as time goes on ive come to realize thats no bad thing what does he do he works on cars he runs an auto shop in orangetown still bowls but hell die before he ever owns an alley of his own and you i used to teach elementary school but i gave it up when my second daughter was born now i do some parttime work for a company that publishes schoolbooks i guess im a saleswo bishuoman but i like it you have kids i hadnt known two girls kate and annie theyre at school today theyre still adjusting to having my dad here though how is he she grimaced not good its just a matter of time the drugs make him sleepy but hes usually good for an hour or two in the afternoon soon hell have to go to a hospice but hes not ready for that not yet for now hell stay here with us im sorry dont be hes not he had a great life and hes ending it with his family hes looking forward to seeing you though he liked your father a lot liked you too i think hed have been happy if wed ended up together once her face clouded i think she had made a series of unspoken connections creating an alternative existence in which she might have been my wife but my wife was dead we read about all that happened she said it was awful all of it she was silent for a time she had felt obliged to raise the subject and now she did not know what to do to dispel the effect it had had i have a daughter too i told her really thats great she said with a little too much enthusiasm how old is she two her mother and i were not together anymore i paused i still see my daughter though whats her name samantha sam shes in maine no vermont when shes old enough she can vote socialist and start signing petitions to secede from the union she raised a glass of water well to sam then to sam we ate and talked about old school friends and her life in pearl river it turned out that she had made it to europe after all with mike the trip had been a gift for their tenth wedding anniversary they went to france and italy and england and was it what youd expected i asked some of it id like to go back and see more but it was enough for now i heard movement above us dads awake she said i just need to go upstairs and help him get organized she left the kitchen and went upstairs after a moment or two i could hear voices and a man coughing the coughs sounded harsh and dry and painful ten minutes later amanda led an old stooped man into the room keeping a reassuring arm around his waist he was so thin that her arm almost encircled him but even bent over b aridthe was nearly as tall as i was eddie graces hair was gone even his facial hair had disappeared his skin looked clammy and transparent tinged with yellow at the cheeks and a reddishpurple below the eyes there was very little blood in his lips and when he smiled i could see that he had lost many of his teeth mr grace i said its good to see you eddie he said call me eddie his voice was a rasp like a plane moving over rough metal he shook my hand his grip was still strong his daughter stayed with him until he had seated himself you want some tea dad nah im good thank you theres water in the jug you want me to pour some for you he raised his eyes to heaven she thinks that because i walk slow and sleep a lot i cant pour my own water he said i know you can pour your own water i was just trying to be nice jeez but youre an ungrateful old man she said it with affection and when she hugged him he patted her hand and grinned and youre a good girl he said better than i deserve well as long as you understand that she kissed his bald pate ill leave you two alone to talk ill be upstairs if you need me she looked at me from behind him and asked me silently not to tire him out i nodded slightly and she left us once he was comfortably seated but not before touching him gently on the shoulder as she pulled the door half closed behind her how are you doing eddie i asked soso he said still here though i feel the cold i miss florida stayed as long as i could but i wasnt able to look after myself once i started getting sick andrea my wife she died a few years back i couldnt afford a private nurse manda brought me up here said shed look after me if the hospital agreed and i still got friends you know from the old days its not so bad its just the damn cold that gets me he poured himself some water the jug shaking only slightly in his hand then took a sip whyd you come back here charlie what are you doing talking to a dying man its about my father huh he said some of the water dribbled from his mouth and ran down his chin he wiped at it with the sleeve of his gown im sorry he said clearly embarrassed its only when someone new comes along that i forget how little dignity i have left you know what ive learned from life dont get old avoid it for as long as you can getting sick dont help none either he seemed to drift for a moment and his eyes grew heavy eddie i said gently i wanted to talk to you about will he grunted and turned his attention back to me yeah will one of the good ones you were his friend i hoped that you might be able to tell me something about what happened about why it happened after all this time after all this time he tapped his fingers on the table he did things the quiet way your old man he could talk people down you know that was his thing never got real angry never had a temper even the move for a time from the ninth to uptown that was his decision probably didnt do much for his record requesting a transfer that early in his career but he did it for a quiet life of all the men who might have done what he did he wasnt the one id have picked not in a million years do you remember why he requested the transfer ah he wasnt getting on with some of the brass in the ninth he and jimmy both they were some team those two where one led the other followed between them i think they managed to spit in the eye of everyone who mattered that was the flip side of your father he had a devil in him but he kept it chained up most of the time anyway there was a sergeant in the ninth name of bennett you ever hear of him no never didnt last long he and your father they locked horns and jimmy backed will same as always you remember why they didnt get on nah clash of personalities i think happens and bennett was dirty and your father didnt care much for dirty cops didnt matter how many stripes they carried anyway bennett found a way to unlock the devil in your father punches were thrown one night and you didnt do that while in uniform it looked bad for will but they couldnt afford to lose a good cop i guess some calls were made on his behalf by whom eddie shrugged if you do right by others you build up favors you can call in your old man had friends a deal was cut and the deal was that my father would request a transfer that was it he spent a year in the wilderness until bennett took a beating from the knapp commission for being a meat eater the knapp commission which investigated police corruption in the early seventies came up with two definitions of corrupt cops the grass eaters who were guilty of petty corruption for tens and twenties and the meat eaters who shook down dealers and pimps for larger amounts and when bennett was gone my father returned something like that eddie made a movement with his fingers as of someone dialing a rotary phone i didnt know my father had those kinds of friends maybe he didnt either until he needed them i let it go do you remember the shooting i asked i remember hearing about it i was fourtwelve that week me and my partner we met up with two other guys kloske and burke for coffee theyd been over at the precinct house when the call came in next time i saw your father he was lying in a box they did a good job on him he looked like hed always done i suppose like himself sometimes these embalmers they make you look like a wax dummy he tried to smile i got these things on my mind as you can imagine theyll see you right i said amanda wouldnt have it any other way ill look better dead than i ever did alive she has her way better dressed too i brought us back to my father you have no idea why my father might have killed those kids none but like i said it took a lot to make will see red they must have turned it on real bad he sipped some more water keeping his left hand beneath his chin to stop it from spilling when he lowered the glass he was breathing heavily and i knew that my time with him was growing short what was he like in the days before it happened i mean did he seem unhappy distracted no he was the way he always was there was nothing but then i didnt see him much that week he was eightfour i was fourtwelve we said hello when we passed each other but that was about it no he was with jimmy gallagher that week you should talk to him he was with your old man on the day of the shooting what jimmy and your old man they always hooked up for jimmys birthday never missed it he told me that they didnt see each other that day jimmy was off hed made a good collar he said some drug thing a day off was a reward for a solid arrest you filled out a then submitted it to the precincts clerical guy the captains man most cops would slip him a couple of dollars or maybe a bottle of chivas earned from escorting a liquor store owner to the bank in order to ensure a prime day it was one of the benefits of handling paperwork for the precinct maybe said eddie but they were together on the day that your father shot those two kids i remember jimmy came in to meet will when he came off duty youre sure sure im sure he came down to the precinct to hook up with your old man i even covered for will so that he could leave early they were going to start drinking in cals i think then finish up at the anglers club the what the greenwich village anglers club it was kind of a private members place on horatio street a quarter for a can i sat back jimm bivagey had assured me that he wasnt with my father on the day of the shooting now eddie grace was directly contradicting him you saw jimmy at the precinct house you deaf thats what i said i saw him meet your old man saw the two of them leave together he tell you something different yes huh said grace again maybe hes misremembering a thought struck me eddie do you and jimmy stay in touch no not so much his mouth twitched an expression of distaste it gave me pause there was something here something between jimmy and eddie so does he know that youre back in pearl river if someone told him maybe he hasnt been to visit if thats what you mean i realized that i was tensed sitting forward in my chair eddie saw it too im old and im dying he said i got nothing to hide i loved your father he was a good cop jimmy was a good cop too i dont know what reason hed have to lie to you about your old man but you can tell him that you talked to me tell him that i said he should tell the truth if thats what you want i waited there was more coming i dont know what you expect to get out of this said eddie your father did what they accused him of doing he shot those two young people and then he shot himself i want to know why maybe there isnt a why can you deal with that as long as i tried i debated telling him more but instead asked youd have known if my father wasscrewing around right eddie reeled slightly then laughed it brought on another fit of coughing and i had to get him some more water your old man didnt screw around he said when hed recovered that wasnt his style he took some deep breaths and i caught a gleam in his eye it wasnt pleasant as though id seen him eyeing a young girl up and down on the street and had watched as the sexual fantasy played out in his eyes but he was human he continued we all make mistakes who knows someone say something to you he looked at me closely and that gleam remained no i replied nobody said anything he held my gaze for a while longer then nodded youre a good son help me up will you i think ill watch some tv ive got an hour in me yet before those damn drugs send me to sleep again i assisted him in getting out of the chair and helped him into the living room where he settled hi bd hugsmself on the sofa with the remotes and turned on a game show the sound drew amanda from upstairs you two all done she asked i believe so i said ill be going now thanks for your time eddie the old man raised the remote control in farewell but he didnt look away from the tv amanda was escorting me to the door when eddie spoke again charlie i went back to him his eyes were fixed on the television about jimmy i waited we were friendly but you know we were never really close he tapped the remote on the armrest of his chair you cant trust a man who spends his whole life living a lie thats all i wanted to say to you he hit a button changing the channel to an afternoon soap i returned to where amanda was waiting well was he helpful yes i said you both were she smiled and kissed me on the cheek i hope you find what youre looking for charlie you have my number i said let me know how things go with your father i will she said then she took a piece of paper from the telephone table and scribbled a number on it my cell phone she said just in case if id known it was that easy to get your number id have asked a long time ago you had my number she said you just never used it with that she closed the door and i walked back down the hill to the muddy brook café where walter was waiting to take me to the airport chapter twelve i was frustrated to be forced to leave new york with questions unanswered about jimmy gallaghers whereabouts on the day my father became a killer but i had no choice i owed dave evans and he had made it clear that he needed me at the bear for most of the coming week i also had only eddies word that jimmy and my father had met that day it was possible that he could have been mistaken and i wanted to be sure of the facts before i called jimmy gallagher a liar to his face i picked up my car at the portland jetport and got back to my house in time to shower and change my clothes for a moment i found myself walking in the direction of the johnson house to pick up walter but then i remembered where walter was and it put me in a black mood that i knew wouldnt lift for the rest of the night i spent most of the evening behind the bar with gary business was steady but there was still time for me to talk with customers and even get a little paperwork done in the back office the only moment che of excitement came when a steroid jockey who had stripped down his winter layers to only a wife beater and a pair of stained gym pants came on to a woman named hillary herman who was five two blond and looked as if a soft breeze would carry her away like a leaf when hillary turned her back on him and his advances he was dumb enough to lay a hand on her shoulder in an effort to regain her attention at which point hillary who was the portland pds resident judo expert spun and twisted her wouldbe suitors arm so far behind his back that his forehead and his knees hit the ground simultaneously she then escorted him to the door dumped him in the snow and threw his clothes out after him his buddies seemed tempted to make their displeasure known but the intervention of the other portland cops with whom hillary was drinking saved her from having to kick their asses as well when it was clear that everything had calmed down and nobody was hurt who didnt deserve to be i started bringing cases to the bottle coolers from the walkin it was still an hour before closing but it didnt look as if we were about to be hit by an unanticipated rush and it would save me time later it was as i was bringing out the third case that i saw the man who had taken a seat at the far end of the bar he was wearing the same tweed jacket and he had a notebook open beside his right hand it was gary s end of the bar but as he moved to serve the new arrival i indicated to him that i wanted to take care of it and he went back to talking to jackie garner for whom he seemed to have developed a worrying fondness even though jackie was trying to talk to a pretty but shy redhead in her forties he seemed grateful for gary s company jackie didnt do well with women in fact i couldnt recall jackie even dating a woman usually when a member of the opposite sex spoke to him he developed a confused expression like an infant being spoken to in a foreign language now he was blushing and so was the redhead it looked as if gary was acting as a gobetween in order to keep the conversation flowing if he hadnt been helping them along they might have lapsed into total silence or if they blushed any more simply exploded how you doin i said to notebook man back for more guess so he replied he was shrugging off his jacket his shirtsleeves were rolled up to his elbows his tie was loose and the top button of his white shirt was undone despite the casualness of his attire he gave the impression that he was about to get down to some serious work what can i get you just coffee please when i came back with a cup of fresh brew and some creamer and sweeteners there was a card beside the notebook facing me i placed everything on top of the card without looking at what was written on it beg your pardon said the man he lifted his cup then picked up the card and handed it to me i took it read it then put it back on the bar nice card i said and it was his name michael wallace was embossed on it in gold along with a box number in boston two telephone numbers an email address and a website the card named his profession as writer and reporter hold on to it he said no thanks seriously there was a set look on his face that i didnt much b hip like the kind that cops wore when they were doorstepping a suspect who wasnt getting the message seriously i didnt care for his tone he reached into his satchel and removed a pair of nonfiction paperback books i thought that i recognized the first from bookstores it detailed the case of a man in northern california who had almost managed to get away with killing his wife and two children by claiming that they had drowned when their boat got caught up in a storm he might have succeeded had a lab technician not spotted tiny chemical traces in the saltwater found in the lungs of the recovered bodies and matched it to solvent stains found in the sink of the boats galley indicating that the husband had drowned all three victims in the sink before tossing their bodies overboard his reason for the killings when he eventually confessed was that they were never on time for anything the second book seemed to be an older work a standard serialkiller volume concentrating on sex murderers its title was almost as lurid as its subject matter it was called blood on the sheets thats me he said somewhat unnecessarily michael wallace this is what i do i write truecrime books he reached out a hand my friends call me mickey were not about to become friends mr wallace he shrugged as if he had expected as much and nothing more heres the thing of it mr parker ive read a lot about you youre a hero youve brought down some real bad people but until now nobody has written the full history of what youve done i want to write a book about you i want to tell your story the deaths of your wife and child the way you hunted down the man responsible and the way youve hunted down others like him since then i already have a publisher for it and a title its going to be called the avenging angel good dont you think i didnt reply anyway the advance isnt hugemidfivefigure sum which still isnt too shabby for this kind of workbut ill split it with you fiftyfifty in return for your cooperation we can negotiate on the royalties my name will be on the cover but it will be your story as you want to tell it i dont want to tell my story sir this conversation is over the coffee is on me but i wouldnt advise you to linger over it i turned away but he kept talking i dont think you understand mr parker i dont mean to be confrontational but im writing this book whether you choose to help me or not theres a lot thats already public record and ill find out more as the interview process goes on ive already done a degree of background work and ive lined up a couple of people in new york who are willing to talk then therell be folks from your old neighborhood and from around here who can provide insights into your life im giving you the chance to shape the material to respond to it all i want is a few hours of your time over the next week or two i work quickly and i wont intrude any more than is absolutely necessary i think he was surprised by how fast i beadr tmoved but to his credit he didnt flinch even when i was in his face you listen to me i said softly this isnt about to happen youre going to get up and youre going to walk away and im never going to hear from you again your book dies here am i clear wallace picked up his notebook and tapped it once on the bar then slipped it back into his pocket he put his jacket on wrapped his scarf around his neck then put three dollars on the bar for the coffee and the tip he said ill leave the books with you take a look at them theyre better than you think they are ill call again in a day or two see if youve reconsidered he nodded in farewell then left i swept his books into the trash can under the bar jackie garner who had been listening to the whole exchange climbed from his stool and walked around to face me you want me to i can take care of this he said that assholes probably still in the parking lot i shook my head let him go i aint going to talk to him said jackie and if he tries to talk to paulie and tony theyll drop his body in casco bay thanks jackie yeah well a car started up in the bears lot jackie walked to the door and watched as wallace departed blue taurus he said mass plates old though not a rental not the kind of car a bigshot writer would drive he returned to the bar you think you can make him stop i dont know i can try he looks like the persistent type yeah he does well you remember that offer still stands tony and paulie and me were good with persistence we see it as a challenge jackie hung around after the bar had closed but it was clear that it wasnt out of any concern for me he only had eyes for the woman whose name he whispered to me was lisa goodwin i was tempted to tell her to run and never look back if she was seriously considering dating jackie but that didnt seem fair to either of them according to dave who knew a little about her from previous visits shed paid to the bear she was a nice woman who had made some bad choices in the past when it came to men by comparison with most of her former lovers jackie was practically cary grant he was loyal and goodhearted and unlike some of this womans exes he would never resort to violence against her true he lived with his mother and had a fondness for homemade munitions and the munitions were less volatile than his mother but lisa could deal with those issues if and when they arose i filled a mug with the last of the coffee from the pot and wandered out to the back office there i turned on the computer and found out all that i could about michael wallace i visited his website then read some of his newspaper stories which came to an end after and reviews of his first two books after an hour i had hi b hii cs home address his employment history details of his divorce in and a dui that hed incurred in id have to talk to aimee price in the morning i wasnt sure what action if any i could legally take to prevent wallace from writing about me but i just knew that i didnt want my name on the cover of a book if aimee couldnt help id be forced to lean on wallace and something told me that he wouldnt respond well to that kind of pressure reporters rarely did gary entered as i was finishing up you okay he asked yeah im fine well were all done out here thanks go home get some sleep ill lock up good night then he lingered at the door what is it if that guy comes back the writer what should i do poison his drink be careful where you dump the body though gary looked confused as if uncertain whether or not i was being serious i recognized the look most of the people who worked at the bear knew something about my past especially the locals whod been there for a few years who could guess what kind of stories theyd been telling gary when i wasnt around just let me know if you see him i said maybe you could spread the word that id appreciate it if nobody spoke to him about me sure thing said gary brightening noticeably then left i heard him talking to sergei one of the line chefs and then a door closed behind them and all was quiet the coffee had gone cold i poured it down a sink printed out all that i had learned about wallace and went home mickey wallace sat in his motel room out by the maine mall and wrote up the notes on his encounter with parker it was a trick hed learned as a reporter write everything down while it was still fresh because even after a couple of hours the memory began to play tricks you could fool yourself into thinking that you were remembering only the important stuff but that wasnt the case you were just remembering what you hadnt forgotten important or not mickey was in the habit of recording his material in longhand in a series of notebooks and then transferring it to his computer but the notebooks remained the primary record and it was to them that he always returned during the process of writing a book he hadnt been disappointed or surprised by parkers response to his initial overture in fact he regarded the mans possible participation in the venture as something of a long shot to begin with but it never hurt to ask what was surprising to him was that someone hadnt written a book about parker already given all that hed done and the cases with which hed been involved but that was just one of the many strange things about charlie parker somehow despite his history and his actions he had managed to remain just slightly off the radar even in the coverage of the most highprofile cases his name usually appeared buried in the fine print somewhere it was almost as if ther be a mae was an element of collusion when it came to him an unspoken understanding that his part in what had occurred should be played down and those were just the ones that had made it into the public arena wallace had already done more than a little snooping and parkers name had been mentioned in connection with some business in upstate new york involving russian mobsters or so the story went mickey had managed to get a local cop in massena to talk to him over some beers and quickly came to realize that something was being covered up in a big way but when he tried to talk to the cop again the next day mickey was run out of town and warned in no uncertain terms never to come back the trail had died after that but mickeys curiosity had been piqued he could smell blood and blood sold books chapter thirteen emily kindler left the little town in which she had been living for the past year shortly after the funeral for her deceased boyfriends parents an open verdict was delivered as to the cause of their deaths but it was understood in the town that they had taken their own lives although chief dashut increasingly wondered why they had done so before theyd had a chance to bury their son properly he couldnt think of any parents who would not want to do right by their deceased child no matter how traumatized they were by what had occurred he questioned the verdict both publicly and privately and yoked the deaths of the parents to the murder of their son in both his mind and his own investigation there had been no denying that emily kindlers shock at their deaths was genuine one of the local doctors had been forced to give her a sedative to calm her down and there were concerns for a time that she might have to be admitted to a psychiatric facility she told the chief that she had visited the faradays on the evening before they died and daniel faraday in particular had appeared distressed but there had been no indication that one or both of the faradays might have been planning suicide the only lead so far in the killing of bobby faraday had come from the state police who had discovered that bobby had been involved in an altercation in a bar some eight miles from the town line two weeks before his death the bar in question was a roadside gin mill popular with bikers and it seemed that bobby while intoxicated had put the moves on a girl who was peripherally involved with the crusaders biker gang the crusaders base was in southern california but their reach extended as far as oklahoma and georgia words had been exchanged and a couple of punches thrown before bobby was dumped in the parking lot and given a kick in the ass to send him home he was lucky not to have been stomped but someone at the bar who knew bobby had intervened on his behalf arguing that he was just a kid who didnt know any better a kid whats more who was hurting over the end of a relationship common sense had prevailed well common sense and the fortuitous arrival of a state police cruiser just as the crusaders were debating the wisdom of giving bobby some serious physical pain to distract him from his emotional distress the crusaders were bad but the chief didnt see them strangling a boy just because hed crossed them still the state police detectives seemed to feel that it was worth pursuing and were now engaged in a game of catchup with the crusade cth ef rs assisted by the fbi in the meantime dashut had pointed out to the state police the symbol carved into the beech tree and additional photographs had been taken but he had heard nothing more about it emily kindler had been home alone at the time her boyfriend was believed to have been killed which meant that she didnt have an alibi but that counted for half of the town too the gas in the faraday house had been turned on sometime after midnight and before am at best reckoning again most of the people in town were home in bed at that time but the chief didnt really suspect the kindler girl of any involvement in bobby faradays death and by extension any suspicions that he had about how bobbys parents had met their end did not center on her even though he considered the possibility of her involvement out of due diligence when the chief had quietly mentioned emily as a suspect to homer lockwood the assistant me who was a resident in the town and knew both emily and the faradays by sight the old man had just laughed she doesnt have the strength not to do what was done to bobby faraday he told the chief those arent arms of steel so when emily told the chief that she planned to leave town he could hardly have blamed her he did request that she notify him when she settled down somewhere and keep him apprised of her movements for a time and she agreed to do so but he had no reason to prevent her from going she gave the chief a cell phone number at which she could be contacted and the address of a resort hotel in miami where she intended to seek work as a waitress and told him that she would be willing to return at any time if she could be of help in the investigation but when dashut eventually tried to contact her the cell phone number was no longer in use and the manager of the miami resort told him that she had never taken up his offer of a job emily kindler it seemed had vanished emily headed northeast she wanted to smell the sea to clear her senses she wanted to try to shake whatever was shadowing her it had found her in that small midwestern town though and it had taken the faradays it would find her again she knew but she wasnt prepared simply to lie down in a dark corner and wait for it to happen in the distance canada beckoned men looked at her as she sat on the greyhound bus watching the monotonous flat landscape gradually transform into gentle hills snow still thick upon them a guy in a worn leather jacket who smelled of sweat and pheromones tried to talk to her at one of the rest stops but she turned away from him and resumed her seat behind the driver a man in his late fifties who sensed her vulnerability but unlike others had no intention of exploiting it instead he had taken her under his wing and glared balefully at any male below the age of seventy who threatened to take the empty seat beside the girl when the man in the leather jacket got back on the bus and seemed intent on changing seats to be closer to the object of his interest the driver told him to sit his ass back down and not to move again until they hit boston still the mans attentions made emily think of bobby and she felt tears well she had not loved him but she had liked him he was funny and sweet and awkward at least until he started drinking when some of his anger and frustration at his father the small town even her would bubble to the surface bupond she had never been entirely sure what she wanted in a man sometimes she thought that she caught some inkling of it a brief flash of what she sought like a light briefly glimpsed in the darkness she would respond to it and then the man would respond in turn sometimes it had been too late for her to retreat and she had suffered the consequences verbal abuse sometimes even physical violence and on one occasion very nearly worse than that like some young men and women her age she had struggled to find a sense of purpose the path that she wanted her life to take had not yet become clear to her she thought that she might become an artist or a writer for she loved books and paintings and music in big cities she would while away hours in museums and galleries standing before the great canvases as though she hoped that by doing so she might be absorbed into them becoming one with their world when she could afford it she would buy books when money was not so freely available she would go to a library although the experience of reading a book that she could not call her own was not the same still they gave her a sense of possibility so that she did not feel so lost so adrift in the world others had struggled with some of the same problems that she had and they had endured she did not make it as far as canada but stopped off at a town in new hampshire she could not have said why but she had learned to trust her instincts after a week there she still had developed no fondness for it but she stayed despite herself this was not a community of art or culture it had one tiny museum a mishmash of history most of it local and art most of that local too any other acquisitions felt like an afterthought the impulse of those who did not have the funds to match their taste or perhaps the taste to match their funds in a town that felt a museum was appropriate even necessary without fully understanding why this attitude seemed to have permeated all of its strata and she could not recall another environment in which creativity was so stifled or at least she could not until she remembered the small town she had once called home art and beauty had no place there either and the house in which she had grown up was barren of all such fripperies even magazines had no part to play unless one counted her fathers stash of porn she had not thought of him in so long her mother had left when she was still a child promising to return for her but she never came back and in time word came that she had died somewhere in canada and had been buried by her new boyfriends family emilys father did what was necessary for her education and survival but little more she went to school and always had money for books they ate adequately but only at home and never in restaurants some money was put aside in a jar for household expenses and he gave her a little for herself but she did not know where the rest of his money went he did not drink to excess and he did not take drugs neither did he ever lay a hand upon her in affection or anger and as she grew older and her body matured he was careful never to do or say anything that might be deemed inappropriate or suggestive for this she was more grateful than he would ever know she had heard the tales told by some of the other girls in her school stories of fathers and stepfathers of brothers and uncles of the new boyfriends of tired lonely mothers her father was not such a man instead he merely kept his distance and his conversations with her to a minimum yet she had never regarded herself as neglected when she began having trouble at schoolacting up in class crying in the restroomsas she entered adolescence her father spoke to the principal and arranged for bnlys n emily to see a psychologist although she chose to share as little with the kindly softspoken man in the rimless glasses as she did with her father she did not want to speak with a psychologist she did not want to be perceived as different in any way and so she did not tell him of the headaches or the blackouts or the strange dreams that she had in which something was emerging from a dark pit in the ground a thing with teeth that gnawed at her soul she did not speak of her paranoia or the sense that her identity was a fragile thing that could be lost and broken at any time after ten sessions the psychologist concluded that she was what she appeared to be a normal if sensitive girl who would in time find her place in the world there was the possibility that her difficulties presaged something more serious a form of schizophrenia perhaps and he advised both her and particularly her father to be aware of any significant changes in her behavior her father had looked at her differently after that and twice in the months that followed she had woken to find him standing in his robe at the door to her room when shed asked what was wrong he told her that she had been shouting in her sleep and she wondered if he had heard what she might have said her father worked as a driver for a furniture warehouse trejo sons inc mexicans who had made good her father was the only nonmexican who worked for the trejos she did not know why this should be when she asked her father about it he admitted that he did not know either maybe it was because he drove his truck well but she thought it might have been the fact that the trejos sold many types of furniture some of it expensive and some of it not to many different types of people some of them mexicans and some of them not her father had a sense of authority about him and he spoke softly and well for their wealthier customers he was the acceptable face of the trejos every piece of furniture in their home had been bought at a discount from his employers usually because it was damaged or torn or so ugly that all hope of ever selling it had been abandoned her father had cut and sanded the legs on the kitchen table in an effort to make them even but the result was only that the table forever after seemed too low and the chairs could not be pushed under it when they had finished eating the couches in the living room were comfortable but mismatched and the rugs and carpets were cheap but hard wearing only the succession of tvs that graced one corner of the room were of any quality and her father regularly upgraded the sets when a better model came on the market he watched history documentaries and game shows he rarely watched sports he wanted to know things to learn and in silence his daughter learned alongside him when she finally left she wondered if he would even notice she suspected that he might simply be grateful for her absence only later did it strike her that at times he had seemed almost frightened of her she found another waitressing job this one in the closest thing to a boho coffeehouse that the town could boast it didnt pay much but then her rent wasnt very much either and at least they played good music and the rest of the staff werent total assholes she was supplementing her income with weekend bar work which wasnt so pleasant but she had already met a guy who seemed to like her he had come in with some of his buddies to watch a hockey game but he was different from them and he had flirted with her some he had a nice smile and he didnt swear like his buddies which she admired in a man hed returned a couple of times since then and she could feel him working up the co b shmeurage to ask her out she wasnt sure that she was ready yet though not after what had happened before and she still wasnt certain about him there was something there though something that interested her if he asked she would say yes but she would keep some space between them as she tried to find out more about him she did not want things to turn out the way they had with bobby at the end on her fourth night in the new town she woke to a vision of a man and a woman walking up the street toward her rented apartment it was so vivid that she went to the window and looked out at the world beyond expecting to see two figures standing beneath the nearest streetlight but the town was quiet and the street was empty in her dream she had almost been able to see their faces the dream had been coming to her for many years now but it was only recently that the features of the man and woman had begun to seem clearer to her growing sharper with each visitation she could not yet recognize them but she knew that the time was coming when she would be able to do so there would be a reckoning then of that at least she was certain iii so so break off this last lamenting kiss which sucks two souls and vapours both away turn thou ghost that way and let me turn this john donne the expiration chapter fourteen i spent each friday at the bear dealing with our biggest distributor nappi the bear took delivery of beer three times a week but nappi accounted for percent of all our taps so its consignment was a big deal the nappi truck always arrived on fridays and once the thirty kegs had been checked and stored and i had paid for the delivery according to the bears cod policy i would buy the driver lunch on my tab and we would talk about beer and his family and the downturn in the economy the bear had a slightly different yardstick from most bars by which to judge how things were going for its customers the bar had always been popular with repo men and we had seen increasing numbers of them parking their trucks in the lot it wasnt a job i would have cared to do but the majority of them were pretty philosophical about it they could afford to be they were with only a couple of exceptions big hard men although the toughest of them jake elms who was eating a burger and checking his phone at the bar was only five five and barely tipped the scales at pounds he was softspoken and i had never heard him swear but the stories that circulated about him were legendary he traveled with a mangy terrier in the front of his truck and kept an aluminum baseball bat in a rack beneath the dashboard as far as i was aware he did not own a gun but that bat had broken some heads in its time and jakes dog was reputed to have the singular talent of being able to grip a mans testicles in its jaws and then dangle from them growling if anyone had the temerity to threaten i bts curd tog fots beloved owner the dog needless to say wasnt allowed in the bar i hate this time of year said nathan the nappi driver as he finished off his wrap and prepared to head out into the cold i ought to find me a job down in florida you like the heat no i dont much care for it but this he gestured at the world beyond the dark cocoon of the bear as he shrugged on his coat they can call it spring but its not this is still the dead of winter he was right there were only three seasons in this place or so it seemed winter summer and fall there was no spring already it was the middle of february yet there were no real signs of returning life no hints of renewal the streets of the city were fortified with ramparts of snow and ice the wider sidewalks etched with the treads of the machines that had cleared them over and over true the worst of the snow had departed but in its place had come freezing rain and the dread siege of lingering cold augmented at times by high winds but even in its stillest form capable of turning ears and noses and fingertips raw sheltered streets were caked with patches of ice some visible and some not those that sloped upward from commercial into the old port were treacherous to tackle without grips on ones soles and the cobblestone paving so beloved of the tourists did nothing to make the ascent any less hazardous the task of sweeping the floors of bars and restaurants was rendered more tedious by the accumulation of slush and ice of grit and rock salt in placesby the parking lots on middle street or down by the wharfsthe accumulated piles of snow and ice were so high as to give the impression that pedestrians were engaged in a form of trench warfare some of the ice chunks were as big as boulders as though expelled from the depths of some strange nearfrozen volcano on the wharfs the lobster boats were shrouded in snow occasionally a brave soul would make a foray out onto the bay and when he returned the blood of the fish would stain the ice pink and red but mostly the seagulls fluttered disconsolately waiting for summer and the return of easy pickings at night there was the sound of tires seeking purchase on treacherous ice of feet stamping impatiently as keys were sought and of laughter that teetered on the brink of tears at the pain that the cold brought and march still waited in the wings a miserable month of dripping ice and melting snow and the last vestiges of winter lurking filthily in shadowy places then april and may summer and warmth and tourists but for now there was only winter without the promise of spring here there were ice and snow and the traces of old footprints retained amid the crystals like unwanted memories that refused to die the people huddled together and waited for the siege to break but that day the day that nathan spoke of the dead of winter brought something strange and different to this part of the world it brought the mist it brought them it had been bitterly cold for days weeks unusually so even for the time of year snow had fallen day after day and then just before valentines day it turned to freezing rain that flooded streets and turned the drifts of accumulated snow to rugged slabs of ice then the jrillen rain stopped but the cold stayed until at last the weather broke and temperatures climbed and the mist rose off the white fields like smoke from a cold burning carried by air currents unfelt by man so that it seemed almost a living thing a pale manifestation with a purpose untold and unknown the shapes of the trees became indistinguishable the forests lost to the enveloping fog it did not diminish or falter but appeared to grow denser and deeper as the day drew on dampening the towns and cities and falling like soft rain on windows and cars and people by nightfall visibility was down to a matter of feet and the highway signs flashed warnings about speed and distance and still the mist came it took over the city turning the brightest lights to ghosts of themselves cutting off those who walked the streets from others like them so that all felt alone in the world in its way it brought closer together those with families and other loved ones for they sought solace with one another a point of contact in a world that had grown suddenly unfamiliar perhaps that was why they came back or did i still believe that they had never quite departed to begin with i had set them free these ghosts of my wife and child i had asked their forgiveness for my failings and i had taken all that i had retained of their livesclothes and toys dresses and shoesand burned them in my yard i had felt them leave following the marsh streams into the waiting sea beyond and when i set foot in the house again the smell of smoke and lost things thick upon me it seemed different to me lighter somehow as though a little of the clutter had been cleared from it or an old stale odor banished by the breezes through open windows they were my ghosts of course i had created them in my way i had given form to them making my anger and grief and loss their own so that they became to me hostile things with all that i had once loved about them gone and all that i hated about myself filling the void and they took that shape and accepted it because it was their way to return to this world my world they were not ready to slip into the shadows of memory to become like dreams to relinquish their place in this life and i did not understand why but that was not them that was not the wife i had loved however poorly and the daughter i had once cherished i had caught glimpses of them as they truly were before i allowed them to be transformed i saw my dead wife leading the ghost of a boy into a deep forest his small hand in hers and i knew that he felt no fear of her she was the summer lady taking him to those whom he had lost accompanying him on his last journey through the thickets and trees and so that he would not be frightened so that he would not be alone there was another with him a girl close to his own age who skipped in winter sunlight as she waited for her playmate to arrive this was my wife and child this was their true form what i released in smoke and flames were my ghosts what returned with the mist were their own i worked that night i was not scheduled to do so but al and lorraine two of the regular bartenders who had been living together for almost as long as they had been working at the bear were involved in a collision on route not far from scarborough downs and both were taken to the hospital as a precaution with nobody to cover for them it meant that i had to spend another night behind the bar i was still tired from the night before but there was nothing to be done except to j ona p keep going i figured that i could probably get an extra day in comp time from dave which would give me a little more time to spend in new york the following week but for now it was just me and gary and dave serving up beers and burgers and trying to keep our heads above water mickey wallace had planned to talk to parker again at the bear that day but an incident in the motel parking lot early in the afternoon had caused him to reconsider a man who had been sitting at the bar earlier in the week the one who had been flirting with the little redhead was waiting beside mickeys car when he went outside shortly after pm both car and man barely visible in the thickening fog the man who didnt introduce himself but who mickey remembered was called jackie hadnt said much but hed made it clear to mickey that he didnt approve of him bothering parker and if mickey continued to do so he threatened to acquaint him with two gentlemen who were both bigger and less reasonable than he jackie was and who would fold mickey into a packing crate breaking limbs if they had to in order to make him fit and then mail him to the darkest hole in africa by the slowest and most circuitous route possible when mickey asked jackie if parker had put him up to this jackie had replied in the negative but mickey wasnt sure whether to believe him or not it didnt matter in the end mickey wasnt above playing dirty himself he called the bear to make sure that parker was still working and when he was asked if he wanted to talk to him mickey said that it was okay hed drop by and see him in person as darkness settled on the city and while the mist was still heavy on the land mickey drove out to scarborough it was past pm as mickey moved through the fog toward the house on the hill he knew that parker would not return until one or two in the morning and the house next door was dark an old couple the johnsons lived there but they seemed to be away what was it that they called people who left for florida when the cold began to bite birds no snowbirds that was it even if they were home it wouldnt have deterred him from what he was planning to do it would just have meant a longer walk with them gone he could park his car close to the house and not have to get his feet cold and wet or risk being asked by a curious cop what he happened to be doing walking down a marsh road in the winter darkness he had already driven by the subjects house a couple of times in daylight but he couldnt take the chance of looking at it up close without the risk of being seen now that he wasnt working as a pi any longer parker spent more of his time at home but mickey hadnt been allowed the luxury of watching the house for long enough to establish his routines that would come in time mickey still entertained the possibility that he could wear down parkers defenses and receive at least a modicum of cooperation from him mickey was tenacious in a quiet way he knew that most people wanted to talk about their lives even if they didnt always realize it themselves they wanted a sympathetic ear someone who would listen who would understand sometimes all it took was a cup of coffee but hed seen it take a bottle of chivas too they were the two extremes and the rest of humanity in mickeys experience slotted into various points between mickey wallace had been a good reporter he was genuinely interested in those whose stories he wrote he didnt have to fake it human beings were just endlessly fascinating to him and even the dullest had a story worth telling however short buried somewhere deep inside but in time journalism began to weary and frustrate him he didnt have the energy for it that he had once enjoyed or the hunger to go chasing people day after day just for the stories that he uncovered to be forgotten before the weekend he wanted to write something that would last he thought about writing novels but it wasnt for him he didnt read them so why would he want to write them real life was curious enough without the embellishments of fiction no what interested mickey was good and evil it always had ever since he was a kid watching the lone ranger and the virginian on tv even as a reporter it was the crime stories to which he was most drawn true they were more likely to appear above the fold and mickey liked seeing his name as close to the masthead as possible but he was also fascinated by the relationship between killers and their victims there was an intimacy a bond between a murderer and a victim it seemed to mickey that a little of the victims identity was transferred to the killer passed on at the moment of death retained deep within his soul he also believed somewhat more controversially that in a sense the victims deaths were ultimately what gave meaning to their lives what defined them what raised them from the anonymity of daytoday ordinariness and bequeathed a kind of immortality on them or as close to immortality as the temporary nature of public attention could allow mickey supposed that it wasnt quite immortality after all especially since the victims in question were dead but it would do until he could think of a better word it was as a reporter that he had first come into indirect contact with the subject parker he had been among the throng outside the little house in brooklyn on the night that parkers wife and child were killed he had reported on the case the stories getting smaller and smaller and falling deeper and deeper into the main body of the paper as lead after lead dried up eventually even mickey gave up on the parker killings and put them on the back burner for a time he had heard rumors that the feds were looking at a possible serialkiller connection but the price of that information was a promise that he would sit on it until the time was right while mickey was genuinely interested in human beings and their stories he also acknowledged to himself a kind of numbness of the heart that afflicted many in his trade he was curious about people but he did not care about them or not enough to feel their pain as his own he sympathized with them a temporary shallow emotion but he did not empathize perhaps it was a consequence of his work of being forced to deal with story after story in close succession the depth and duration of his involvement dependent entirely on the publics appetite and by extension his newspapers that was in part why he had decided to leave the world of journalism behind and devote himself to books by immersing himself in only a handful of cases he hoped to sensitize himself anew that and make a little money along the way he just needed to find the right story to tell and he was convinced that in charlie parker he had found that story mickey could recall the moment when he had become convinced that there was something different about the man he hadnt faded away after the deaths of his family neither had he gone on daytime shows to talk about his pain in an effort to keep t jplethehe killings in the public eye and ensure that the pressure on the law enforcement community to track down their killer remained constant no he had picked up a pis license and then he had gone hunting both for the killer the one who would come to be called the traveling man and for others the first one he found was the modine woman and that was when the bells started ringing for mickey that was a story in itself right there worthy of a sunday supplement father loses his wife and child to a killer then hunts down a pair of child killers in turn it had everything that a jaded public could desire except parker wouldnt tell it requests for interviews were politely and sometimes impolitely declined thenbangthere he was again and this time it was the big one he was trying to hook the traveling man over the years that followed it became clear to mickey and to others like him that there was something strange going on here something quite exceptional this man had a gift of sorts although it wasnt a gift that anybody in his right mind would wish to have it seemed that he was drawn to evil and evil in turn was drawn to him and when he found it he destroyed it it was as simple or as complex as that depending upon how you chose to view it because mickey wallace was not dumb and he knew that a man couldnt do what parker had done and not suffer serious damage along the way now here he was working in a bar in a northeastern city separated from his girlfriend seeing the child hed had with her maybe once or twice each month and living alone in the big house upon which mickey was now carefully shining his flashlight mickey wanted to go inside he wanted to poke around in desk drawers to open files in cabinets and on computers to see where the subject ate sat slept he wanted to walk in his footsteps because what mickey proposed to do was to give parker a voice to take his words his experiences and improve upon them creating a new version of him that was somehow greater than the sum of his parts to do that mickey needed to become him for a time to understand the reality of his existence and if parker ultimately decided not to cooperate mickey was trying not to think about that he had spoken to his publisher that morning and the publisher had made clear his preference for parker being involved with the project it wasnt a deal breaker but it would affect the number of copies that would be printed and the nature of the publicity for the book his view was understandable but it would make mickeys task more difficult anyone could put together a cutandpaste job although not as good a cutandpaste job as mickey could but that wasnt what the big bucks would be paid for it wasnt just about the money either there was a real story to be told here something deep and peculiar and unsettling and the words had to come from the subjects own mouth mickey would wear him down of that he was certain or reasonably certain in the meantime he had begun making contact with other prospective interviewees in the hope of establishing a more detailed background dossier about the subject because mickey wanted to know more about parker than parker did about himself except the people who were close to him were also loyal to him and so far all mickey had to show for his efforts was for the most part a series of rebuffs true he had sessions lined up both on and off the record with a couple of excops who remembered parker from new york and a former captain from internal affairs who mickey was reliably informed believed that the subject should be behind bars the subject and his buddies they interested mickey too all he knew about them were their names angel and louis j ju wa the captain said that he could help him with them too just not as much he was only willing to talk off the record but he had promised mickey copies of investigation reports and some juice that a good reporter like he was would easily be able to corroborate it was a start but mickey wanted more his clothes felt damp the mist was a blessing in that it concealed him from any casual observer passing on the road below and even someone coming up the drive would struggle to see his car or him until they reached the house itself in fact mickey had parked the car beneath a copse of trees and unless somebody was actively looking for it he was pretty certain that it would pass unnoticed even if parker returned unexpectedly mickey was convinced that he would drive right by it but the mist was also cold and wet and so thick that mickey felt he might almost clasp a clump of it in his hand if he tried like cotton candy in the pocket of his coat he had a set of lock picks he climbed up to the porch of the house and more out of hope than expectation tried the door it was locked he thought for a moment then gave the door a hard push with his shoulder rattling it in its frame no alarm went off good thought mickey another lucky break to add to the absent neighbors and the fact that parker no longer seemed to have a dog hed heard him talking about it with one of the bartenders shortly before parker gave him the bums rush he moved to the left and peered in the window there was a nightlight burning in the kitchen at the back of the house that shed a little illumination into the living room the rooms looked comfortably furnished with a lot of books to the right of the front door was a small office a computer on a desk papers piled neatly around it and on the floor mickey knew that parker had been down in new york recently he wondered why he desperately wanted to look through those papers he walked to the back of the house and stood in the segmented square of illumination cast by the nightlight the mist seemed thicker here and when he looked behind him it formed a nearimpenetrable wall of white obscuring the trees and the marshes beyond mickey shivered he tried the back door with no result once again he pressed his face to the glass and something moved inside the house for a moment he thought that it was reflected light or a car passing on the road creating shadows in the room beyond the kitchen but he had heard no car he blinked and tried to recall what he had seen he couldnt be sure but he thought it might have been a woman a woman in a dress that hung just below her knees it wasnt the kind of dress anyone would usually wear at this time of year it was a summer dress he considered leaving but then he realized that an opportunity to enter the house might just have presented itself without necessitating a breach of the law if there was someone inside maybe he could introduce himself as a friend of the detective there might be a cup of coffee in it for him or a drink and once mickey got himself seated he would be difficult to roust cockroaches were harder to get rid of than mickey wallace in interrogation mode hello he called anybody home he knocked on the door hello im a friend of mr parkers can you the light went out in the kitchen the shock of it was so sudden that mickey stumbled backward in fright spots before his eyes as they adjusted to the dar jthadikness he recovered himself and took a breath maybe it was time to leave he didnt want the woman inside to take fright and call the cops that would jeopardize everything still he carefully approached the door one more time his flashlight was in his right hand and he used it to rap on the door as he leaned against the glass shielding his eyes with his left the woman was standing in the doorway between the kitchen and the living room she was looking right at him her hands by her sides he could see the shape of her legs through the thin material but her face was cast in shadow im sorry he called to her i didnt mean to frighten you my name is michael wallace im a writer heres my card he found a card in his pocket im going to slide it under the door so youll know im legit he knelt down and slipped the card through when he stood up the woman was gone maam something white appeared at his feet his card had been pushed back at him jesus thought mickey shes at the door shes hiding at the door i just want to talk to you he said go away for a moment mickey wasnt sure that hed heard right the words had been clear enough but they seemed to come from behind him he turned around but there was nothing there only mist he put his face to the glass again trying to catch a glimpse of the woman hiding inside he could almost see her a patch of darkness on the floor a palpable presence who is she he wondered parkers girlfriend was supposed to be in vermont not here mickey planned to try to talk to her sometime over the next couple of weeks anyway they were estranged there was no reason for her being here and even less reason for her to try to hide herself if she was something began nagging at mickey something that made him uneasy but he tried to force it from his mind he only partially succeeded he felt it lurking at the edge of his consciousness just like the woman who was squatting in the shadows by the door an unwelcome presence to which he was frightened of giving his complete attention please i just wanted to speak to you for a moment about mr parker michael the voice came again only this time it was closer he thought that he could feel breath on his neck or maybe it was just the wind coming in from the sea except there was no wind he spun around breathing heavily he felt the mist enter his lungs it made him cough and he tasted snow and saltwater in his mouth he hadnt liked the way the voice had spoken his name he hadnt liked it one little bit there was a hint of mockery to it and an implicit threat he felt like a recalcitrant child being spoken to by a nanny except except it was a childs voice that had spoken whos out there he said show yourself but there was no movement and no response not from before him instead he became aware of movement at his back slowly he craned his neck not wishing to turn away from whatever had spoken to him fr j the woman was now standing in the kitchen once again midway between the back door and the entrance to the living room but there was a lack of substance to her she cast no shadow distorting instead of blocking what little light was filtering through the glass like a piece of gauze in the shape of a human being go away please it was the use of the word please that finally got to him he had heard the word used in that way before usually before a cop wrestled someone to the ground or a doorman at a nightclub applied brute force to a drunk it was a final warning couched in a version of politeness he shifted position so that he could see both the door and the mist then began to retreat moving toward the corner of the house because the shadow that was troubling him had just assumed a recognizable form even as he tried to deny the reality of it a woman and a child a little girls voice a woman in a summer dress mickey had seen that dress before or one very like it it was the dress that parkers wife had been wearing in the pictures that were circulated to the press after her death as soon as he was out of sight of the door mickey began to run he slipped once and landed heavily soaking his trousers and plunging his arms into the icy snow up to his elbows he whimpered as he got to his feet and brushed himself off as he did so he heard a sound from behind him it was muffled slightly by the mist but it was still clearly identifiable it was the back door opening he ran again his car came in sight he found the keys in his pocket and pushed the unlock button once to turn on the lights as he did so he stopped short and felt his stomach lurch there was a child a little girl on the far side of the car staring at him through the passenger window her left hand was splayed against the glass while the index finger of her right traced patterns in the moisture he couldnt see her face clearly but he knew instinctively that it wouldnt have made any difference if he had been inches away from her instead of feet she was as insubstantial as the mist that surrounded her no said mickey no no he shook his head from behind him came the sound of hard snow crunching underfoot of an unseen figure drawing nearer even as he heard it he sensed that if he were to retrace his steps to the back door he would find the imprint of his own footsteps and nobody elses oh jesus whispered mickey jesus jesus but already the little girl was moving away receding into the mist and the trees her right hand raised in a mocking gesture of farewell mickey took his chance and made a final dash for the car he wrenched the door open slammed it behind him and hit the internal locking button hard his fingers didnt fumble despite his fear as he started the car and pulled onto the driveway looking neither right nor left but staring only ahead he hit the road at speed and hung a sharp right back over the bridge toward scarborough the headlight beams assuming a definition of their own as they tried to slice through the mist houses appeared and then in time the reassuring lights of the businesses on route only when he reached the gas station on his right did he slow down he pulled into t j seoughe lot and hit the brakes then leaned back against his seat and tried to get his breathing under control the traffic signal at the intersection began to change color the action drew his attention to the passenger window and what had seemed at first to be random patterns in the moisture now assumed a definite shape they were words on his window someone had written stay away from my daddy mickey stared at the words for a few moments longer then hit the button to wind down the window destroying the message when he was sure that it was gone he drove back to his motel and went straight to the bar it was only after a double vodka that he found it within himself to begin updating his notes and it took another double to stop his hand from shaking that night mickey wallace did not sleep well chapter fifteen i didnt find wallaces card until i opened the back door on the afternoon of the next day to put out the trash it lay on the step frozen to the cement i looked at it then went back inside and dialed his cell phone number from my office he answered on the second ring mickey wallace this is charlie parker he didnt reply for a moment or two and when he did he sounded initially uneasy although like a true professional he quickly rallied mr parker i was just about to call you i was wondering if youd considered my offer ive given it some thought i said id like to meet great his voice rose an octave in surprise then resumed its usual timbre where and when why dont you come out to my place in say an hour do you know where it is there was a pause no i dont can you give me directions my directions were intricate and detailed i wondered if he was even bothering to take them down got that i said when i was done yeah i think so i heard him take a sip of liquid you want to read them back to me wallace almost choked when he had finished coughing he said that wont be necessary well if youre sure thank you mr parker ill be with you shortly i hung up i put on a jacket then went down the drive and found the tire tracks beneath the trees if it was wallace who had parked there kparithhed left in a real hurry hed managed to churn up ice and snow to reveal the dirt beneath i walked back to the house sat in a chair and read the pressherald and the new york times until i heard the sound of a car pulling into the drive and wallaces blue taurus came into view he didnt park in the same spot as the night before but drove right up to the house i watched him get out take his satchel from the passenger seat and check his pockets for a spare pen when he was satisfied that all was in order he locked the car in my drive in maine in winter i didnt wait for him to knock instead i opened the door and hit him once in the stomach he buckled and dropped to his knees then doubled over and retched get up i said he stayed down he was struggling for breath and i thought that he might vomit on my porch dont hit me again he said it was a plea not a warning and i felt like a piece of grit in a dogs eye i wont i helped him to his feet he sat against the porch rail his hands on his knees and recovered himself i stood opposite him regretting what i had done i had allowed my anger to simmer and then i had taken it out on a man who was no match for me you okay he nodded but he looked gray what was that for i think you know for sneaking around my property for being dumb enough to drop your card while you were here he leaned against the rail to support himself i didnt drop it he said youre telling me you left it for me in the dirt on my back porch that doesnt sound likely im telling you that i didnt drop it i slipped it under the door for the woman who was in your house last night but she just pushed it back i looked away i saw skeletal trees amid the evergreens and the channels in the salt marshes shining coldly amid the frozen snow i saw a single black crow lost against the gray sky what woman a woman in a summer dress i tried to speak to her but she wouldnt say anything i glanced at him his eyes couldnt meet mine he was telling a version of the truth but he had hidden away some crucial element he was trying to protect himself but not from me mickey wallace was scared to death i could see it in the way his eyes kept returning to something behind the window of my living room i dont know what he expected to see but whatever it was he was glad that it hadnt appeared tell me what happened i came out to the house i thought you might be more amenable to a discussion away from the bar i knew that he was lying but i wasnt about to call him on it i wanted to hear what he had to say about the events of the previous night ji slyii saw a light and i went around to the back door there was a woman inside i slipped my card under the door and she slid it back then he stopped go on i said i heard a girls voice he continued but she was outside i think the woman joined her at some point but i didnt look so i cant be sure why didnt you look i decided to leave his face and those four words spoke volumes a wise choice its just a shame that you were here in the first place i just wanted to see where you lived i didnt mean any harm by it no he breathed in deeply and once he was certain that he wasnt going to throw up he rallied and pulled himself up to his full height who were they he asked and now it was my turn to lie a friend a friend and her daughter your friends daughter always goes walking in the snow in dense fog writing things on other peoples windows writing what are you talking about mickey swallowed hard his right hand was trembling his left was jammed in his coat pocket there was something written on the window of my car when i got back to it he said it said stay away from my daddy it took all of my selfcontrol not to reveal myself to him i wanted so badly to look up at the attic window for i remembered a message written on the glass there a warning left by an entity that was not quite my daughter yet the house did not feel the same way that it had felt then it was no longer haunted by rage and grief and pain before i had sensed their presence in the shifting of shadows and the creaking of boards in the slow closing of doors where there was no breeze and in the tapping on windows where there were no branches to touch them now the house was at peace but if wallace was speaking the truth then something had returned i recalled my mother once telling me some years after my father died that on the night his body was taken to the church she dreamed that she woke to a presence in the bedroom and thought she could feel her husband close to her in the far corner of the room there was a chair upon which he used to seat himself every night to finish undressing he would ease himself into it in order to take off his shoes and socks and sometimes he would remain there quietly for a while his bare feet planted firmly on the carpet his chin resting on the palms of his hands and reflect upon the day that was coming to a close my mother said that in her dream my father was back in his chair except she couldnt quite see him when she tried to focus on the shape in the corner of the room there was only a chair but when she looked away a figure shifted position in the corner of her eye she should have been frightened but she was not in her dream her eyes became heavy but how can my eyes be heavy she thought when i am still asleep she fought against it but the urge to sleep was too strong j thr d and just as she lost consciousness she felt a hand on her brow and lips softly brushed her cheek and she sensed his sorrow and guilt and in that moment i think that perhaps she started to forgive him at last for what he had done for the rest of the night she slept soundly and deeply and despite all that had occurred she did not weep as the final prayers were said for him in the church and when his body was at last lowered into the ground and the flag was folded and laid in her hands she smiled sadly for her lost man and a single tear fell to the earth and exploded in the dirt like a fallen star my friends daughter i said playing tricks on you really said wallace and he did not even try to keep the skepticism from his voice they still here no theyre gone he let it go that was a low thing you did you always hit people without warning it comes from the line of work if i had told some of them that i was going to hit them they would have shot me first a warning kind of dulls the impact you know right now i kind of wish someone had shot you at least youre honest is that why you called me out here to warn me off again im sorry that i hit you but you need to hear this facetoface and not in a bar either im not going to help you with your book in fact ill do everything in my power to make sure that it never gets beyond some scratches in one of your notebooks youre threatening me mr wallace do you recall the gentleman at the bear who was discussing the possible motives of alien abductors i do in fact i met him again yesterday he was waiting for me in the parking lot of my motel i assumed that youd sent him jackie i should have known that hed take matters into his own hands in some misguided effort to help me part of me even felt a kind of admiration for him i wondered how long hed spent trawling the parking lots of the citys motels looking for wallaces car i didnt but hes the kind of man who cant easily be controlled and he has two buddies who make him look like a gentle soul theyre brothers and there are prisons that dont want them back because they frighten the other inmates so youre going to set your buddies on me tough guy if i wanted to hurt you that badly id do it myself there are other ways to deal with the kind of problem that you represent im not a problem i just want to tell your story im interested in the truth i dont know what the truth is if i dont know after all this time then youre not going to have any more success than ive had his eyes narrowed shrewdly and some of the color returned to his face j thot i had made a mistake even discussing the matter with him he was like an evangelical christian who finds someone on a doorstep willing to debate theology with him but i can help you he said im a neutral party i can find out things that might be useful to you it doesnt all have to go in the book youll have control over how your image is presented my image he realized that he had taken a wrong turn and backpedaled furiously its just a phrase it means nothing what i meant to say was this is your story if its to be told properly it has to be told in your voice no i said thats where youre wrong it doesnt have to be told at all dont come to my home or to my place of work again im sure you know that i have a child her mother wont talk to you that i can tell you for sure if you approach them if you even pass them on the street and catch their eye ill kill you and bury you in a shallow hole you need to let this slide wallaces face hardened and i saw the mans own inner strength reveal itself instantly i felt tired wallace wasnt going to fade into the night well let me tell you something mr parker he mentioned the name of a famous actor a man around whom rumors of a sexual nature had long circled without finding purchase two years ago i agreed to write an unauthorized biography of him its not my area all that hollywood bullshit but the publisher had heard of my talents and the money was good given the subject hes one of the most powerful men in hollywood his people threatened me with financial ruin the loss of my reputation even the loss of limbs but that book is due to be published in six months time and i can stand behind every word of it he wouldnt cooperate but it didnt matter the book is still going to appear and ive found people whove sworn that his whole life is a lie you made a mistake punching me in the gut it was the action of a frightened man for that alone im going to claw and dig in every dirty corner of your life im going to find out things about you that you didnt even know existed and then im going to put them in my book and you can buy a copy and read about them and maybe then youll learn something about yourself but i can tell you for sure that youll learn something about mickey wallace and if you ever lay a hand on me again ill see you in court you fuck with that wallace turned around and trudged back to his car and i thought aw hell aimee price dropped by later that evening after i had left another message for her at her office detailing most of what had happened since wallace had appeared at the bear she declined coffee and asked if i had any wine uncorked i didnt but i was happy to open a bottle for her it was the least that i could do okay she said once she had sipped the wine carefully and decided that it wasnt about to send her into convulsions this isnt my area so ive had to ask around but here is where we stand in legal terms on the book potentially as the jin rs subject of an unauthorized biography of your life you could bring a lawsuit for a number of legal reasonslibel misappropriation of the right of publicity breach of confidencebut the most likely avenue in your case would be invasion of privacy youre not a public figure in the way an actor or a politician might be so you have a certain right to privacy were talking about the right not to have private facts publicized that might prove embarrassing if theyre not related to matters of public concern the right not to have false or misleading statements or suggestions made about you and protection against intrusion which means literal physical intrusion on your privacy by entering onto your property which wallace did i said yes but he could argue that the first time he came by was to remonstrate with you and to leave his card and the second time according to what youve told me was at your invitation i shrugged she was right so how did that second visit go she asked could have gone better i said in what way not punching him in the stomach would have been a start oh charlie she seemed genuinely disappointed and i felt even more ashamed of my actions earlier that day in an effort to make up for my failings i recounted my conversation with wallace in as much detail as i could remember leaving out any mention of the woman and child that he claimed to have glimpsed youre telling me that your friend jackie threatened wallace too she said i didnt ask him to he probably thought that he was doing me a favor at least he exhibited more restraint than you did wallace could have you charged with assault but my guess is that he probably wont clearly he wants to write this book and that may override any other concerns as long as you didnt do him any lasting damage he walked away under his own steam i said well if he knows anything about you at all he can probably consider himself lucky i took the hit i wasnt in any position to argue so where does that leave us you cant stop him writing the book she said simply as he said himself a lot of the relevant material is a matter of public record what we can do is request or otherwise obtain a copy of the manuscript and go through it with a finetooth comb looking for instances of libel or egregious invasion of privacy we could then apply to the courts for an injunction preventing publication but i have to warn you that the courts are generally reluctant to permit injunctions of this kind in deference to the first amendment the best we could hope for would be monetary damages the publisher has probably had a warranty and indemnity clause inserted into wallaces contract assuming the contract has been formally agreed upon also if the whole thing has been handled right there will be a mediaperils insurance policy in place to cover the work in other words not only will we not be able to stop this horse from bo jd tf tlting but we probably wont even be able to do more than close the door halfway once its gone i sat back in my chair and closed my eyes you sure you dont want some of this wine said aimee im sure if i start i may not stop im sorry she said ill talk to some more people and see if there are any other avenues open to us but i dont hold out much hope and charlie i opened my eyes dont threaten him again just keep your distance if he approaches you walk away dont get drawn into confrontations that goes for your friends too regardless of their good intentions which brought us to another problem yeah well that could be an issue i said how angel and louis i had told aimee enough about them for her to be under no illusions if wallace starts digging then their names may come up i said i dont think they have any good intentions they dont sound like the kind of men who leave too many traces it doesnt matter they wont like it louis especially then warn them i thought about it no i said lets see what happens are you sure thats a good idea not really but louis believes in preventive measures if i tell him that wallace may start asking questions about him he could decide that it might be better if wallace didnt ask any questions at all ill pretend i didnt hear that said aimee she finished her wine in a single gulp and appeared to be debating whether or not to have more in the hope that it might destroy any memory of what id just said jesus how did you end up with friends like that im not sure i replied but i dont think that jesus had anything to do with it chapter sixteen mickey wallace left portland early the next day he was simmering with resentment and a barely containable anger that was unfamiliar to him for mickey rarely got truly angry but his encounter with parker combined with the efforts of parkers neanderthal friend to scare him off had transformed him utterly he was used to lawyers trying to intimidate him and had been pushed up against walls and parked cars and threatened with more serious damage at least twice but nobody had punched him the way parker had in k pa ut many years in fact the last time mickey had been in anything approaching a serious fight was when he was still in high school and on that occasion he had landed a lucky punch that had knocked one of his opponents teeth out he wished now that he had managed to strike a similar blow at parker and as he boarded the shuttle at logan he played out alternative scenarios in his mind ones in which it was he who had brought parker to his knees he who had humiliated the detective and not vice versa he entertained them for a couple of minutes and then dispensed with them there would be other ways to make parker regret what he had done principal among them the completion of the book project on which mickey had set his heart and he felt his reputation but he was still troubled by his experience at the parker house on that mistshrouded night he had expected the intensity of his responses to it his fear and confusion to diminish but they had not instead he continued to sleep uneasily and had woken on the first night after the encounter at precisely am convinced that he was not alone in his motel room on that occasion he had turned on the lamp by his bed and the ecofriendly bulb had glowed slowly into life gradually spreading illumination through most of the room but leaving the corners in shadow which gave mickey the uncomfortable sensation that the darkness around him had receded reluctantly from the light taking whatever presence he had sensed with it and hiding it in the places where the lamp could not reach he remembered the woman crouched behind the kitchen door and the child moving her small finger across the window of his car he should have been able to glimpse their faces but he had not and something told him that he should be grateful for that small mercy at least their faces had been concealed from him for a reason because the traveling man had torn them apart thats why because he left nothing there but blood and bone and empty sockets and you didnt want to see that no sir because that sight would stay with you until your eyes closed for the last time and they pulled the sheet over your own face nobody could look upon that degree of hurt of savagery and not be damaged by it forever and if those were people whom you loved your wife and your child well a friend and her daughter two visitors that was how parker had described them to mickey but mickey didnt accept that explanation for one moment oh they were visitors all right but not the kind who slept in the spare room and played board games on winter evenings mickey didnt understand their nature not yet and he hadnt decided whether or not to include his encounter in the book that he would present to his publishers he suspected that he would not after all who would believe him by including a ghost story in his narrative he risked undermining the factual basis of his work and yet this woman and child and what they had endured represented the heart of the book mickey had always thought of parker as a man haunted by what had happened to his wife and child but not literally so was that the answer was what mickey had witnessed evidence of an actual haunting and all of these thoughts and reflections he added to his notes mickey checked into a hotel over by penn station a typical tourist trap with a warren of tiny rooms occupied by noisy but polite asians and families of rubes trying to see new york on the cheap by late that afternoon he was sitting in what was by his standards and the standar j a the stands of most other people who werent bums a dive bar and considering what he could order without endangering his health he wanted coffee but this looked like the kind of place where ordering coffee for any reason unconnected with a hangover would be frowned upon at the very least if not considered actual evidence of homosexual leanings in fact thought mickey even washing ones hands after visiting the restroom might be viewed as suspect in a hole like this there was a bar menu beside him and a list of specials chalked on a board that might as well have been written in sanskrit theyd been there so long and unchanged but nobody was eating nobody was doing much of anything because mickey was the only person in the place the bartender excepted and he looked like hed consumed nothing but human growth hormone for the past decade or so he bulged in places where no normal person should have bulged there were even bulges on his bald head as though the top of his skull had developed muscles so as not to feel excluded from the rest of his body get you something he asked his voice was pitched higher than mickey had anticipated he wondered if it was something to do with the steroids there were peculiar swellings on the bartenders chest as though his breasts had grown secondary breasts of their own he was so tan that he seemed at times almost to fade into the wood and grime of the bar to mickey he looked like a pair of womens stockings that had been stuffed with footballs im waiting for someone well order something while youre waiting look on it as rent for the stool friendly place said mickey you want friends call the samaritans this is a business mickey ordered a light beer he rarely drank before nightfall and even then he tended to limit his intake to a beer or two the night of the visit to parkers house excepted and that night had been exceptional in so many ways he wasnt thirsting for a beer now and even the thought of sipping it made him feel queasy but he wasnt about to offend someone who looked like he could turn mickey inside out and back again before hed even realized what was happening the beer arrived mickey stared at it and the beer stared back its head began to disappear as though responding in kind to mickeys lack of enthusiasm for it the door opened and a man stepped inside he was tall with the natural bulk of someone who had never felt the need to use any form of artificial growth enhancers stronger than meat and milk he wore a long blue overcoat that hung open revealing a substantial gut his hair was short and very white his nose was red and not just from the cold wind outside mickey realized that hed made the right choice in ordering a beer hey said the bartender its the captain long time no see he reached out a hand and the newcomer took it and shook it warmly using his free hand to slap the mans substantial upper arm how you doin hector see youre still using that shit keeps me big and lean captain youve grown tits and you must be shaving your back twice a day maybe ill keep it long give the boys something to hold on to youre a deviant hector and proud of it what can i get you first one is on the house thats decent of you hector a redbreast if you dont mind to get the cold out of my bones he walked down to the end of the bar where mickey was sitting you wallace he asked mickey stood up he was about five ten and the newcomer towered over him by seven or eight inches captain tyrrell they shook hands i appreciate you taking the time to talk to me well after hector has obliged me the drinks are on you itll be my pleasure hector placed a substantial glass of whiskey untroubled by ice or water beside tyrrells right hand tyrrell gestured to a booth against the back wall lets take our drinks down there you eaten yet no they do a good hamburger here you eat hamburger mickey doubted that this place did a good anything but he knew better than to refuse yes a hamburger sounds fine tyrrell raised a hand and shouted the order to hector two hamburgers medium with all the trimmings medium thought mickey jesus hed prefer it charred to within an inch of its life in the hope of killing whatever bacteria might have taken up residence in the meat hell this might be the last burger he ever ate hector duly entered the order on a surprisingly modernlooking register even if he operated it like a monkey wallace thats a good irish name said tyrrell irishbelgian thats some mix europe the war tyrrells face softened unpleasantly with sentimentality like a marshmallow melting my grandfather served in europe royal irish fusiliers got shot for his troubles im sorry to hear it ah he didnt die lost his left leg below the knee though they didnt have prosthetics then or not like they do now he used to pin up his trouser leg every morning think he was kind of proud of it he raised his glass to mickey sláinte he said cheers said mickey he took a mouthful of beer mercifully it was so cold that he could barely taste it he reached into his satchel and produced a notebook and pen straight down to business said tyrrell if yo j aifud prefer to wait nah its good mickey took a little olympus digital voice recorder from his jacket pocket and showed it to tyrrell would you object if yes i would put it away better still take the batteries out and leave that thing where i can see it mickey did as he was told it would make things a little more difficult but mickey had reasonable shorthand and a good memory in any case he wouldnt be quoting tyrrell directly this was background and deep background tyrrell had been quite clear about that when he had agreed to meet with mickey if his name appeared anywhere near the book hed stomp mickeys fingers until they looked like corkscrews tell me some more about this book youre writing so mickey did he left out the more artistic and philosophical elements of his proposal and tried to tread as neutral a path as possible as he described his interest in parker although he hadnt yet ascertained tyrrells views on the subject he suspected that they were largely negative if only because so far anyone who liked or respected parker had refused pointblank to talk to him and have you met parker asked tyrrell i have i approached him about an interview what happened he suckerpunched me in the gut thats him all right hes a sonofabitch a thug and thats not the worst of it he took a sip of his whiskey it was already half gone you want another one asked mickey sure mickey turned to the bar he didnt even have to order hector just nodded and went for the bottle so what do you want to know about him said tyrrell i want to know what you know and tyrrell began to talk he spoke first of parkers father who had killed two young people in a car and then taken his own life he could offer no insights into the killings beyond suggesting there was something wrong with the father that had passed itself on to the son a faulty gene perhaps a predilection toward violence the hamburgers arrived along with tyrrells second drink tyrrell ate but mickey did not he was too busy taking notes or that would be his excuse if he were asked we think the first man he killed was named johnny friday said tyrrell he was a pimp beaten to death in the washroom of a bus station he was no loss to the world but thats not the point why do you suspect parker because he was there cameras picked him up entering and leaving the station during the killing window were there cameras on the bath j a on the broom door there were cameras everywhere but he didnt appear on them we just got him entering and leaving the station mickey was puzzled how could that be for the first time tyrrell looked uncertain i dont know the cameras werent fixed then except for the ones on the doors it was a costcutting measure they moved from side to side i guess he timed them then moved in conjunction with them difficult to do though difficult not impossible still it was odd was he interviewed we had a witness who placed him at the scene washroom attendant guy was korean couldnt speak more than about three words of english but he picked out parkers image from the door cameras well he picked out parkers image as one of five possibles from a series of images trouble was we all looked alike to him of those five people four were as different from one another as i am from you anyway parker was hauled in and agreed to be questioned he didnt even lawyer up he admitted to being at the bus station but nothing more than that said it was in connection with some runaway hed been asked to find it checked out he was working a teen case at the time and thats as far as it went there wasnt enough to charge him on and no appetite for it anyway here was an excop who had lost his wife and child only months before he may not have been loved by his fellow officers but cops support their own in times of trouble it would have been a more unpopular case to prosecute than charging goldilocks with burglary and like i said johnny friday was no eagle scout a lot of people out there felt that someone had done humanity a service by taking him off the team permanently why wasnt parker popular dunno he wasnt meant to be a cop he never fit in there was always something odd about him so why did he join some misplaced loyalty to his old mans memory i suppose maybe he thought he could make up for those kids deaths by being a better cop than his father was you ask me its about the only admirable thing he ever did mickey let that slide already he was startled by the depths of tyrrells bitterness toward parker he couldnt figure out what parker might have done to deserve it short of burning tyrrells house down and then screwing his wife in the ashes you said that johnny friday was the first killing in which parker was suspected of involvement there were others id guess so youd guess tyrrell signaled for a third whiskey he was slowing down some but he was also getting tetchy look most are a matter of record here in louisiana in maine in virginia in south carolina hes like the grim reaper or cancer if those are the ones that we know about j a know abo dont you think there are others that we dont know about you think he called the cops every time he or one of his buddies punched someones clock his buddies you mean the men known as angel and louis shadows said tyrrell softly shadows with teeth what can you tell me about them rumors mostly angel he did time for theft from what i can tell parker might have used him as a source and in return he offered him protection so it started out as a professional relationship you could say that the other one louis hes harder to pin down no arrests no history hes a wraith there was some stuff last year an auto shop he was reputed to have a silent interest in got targeted a guy one of the shooters ended up in the hospital then died a week later of his injuries after that hector appeared at his elbow and replaced an empty glass with a full one tyrrell paused to take a mouthful well this is where it gets strange one of louiss friends business partners whatever he died too they said that he had a heart attack but i heard different one of the mortuary attendants said that they had to fill in a bullet hole in his throat who did it louis nah he doesnt hurt those close to him hes not that kind of killer the whispers were that this was a revenge raid gone wrong thats what he was doing up in massena said mickey more to himself than to tyrrell who didnt seem to notice anyway theyre like him theyre being looked after said tyrrell looked after a man doesnt get to do what parker has done to kill with impunity unless someone is watching his back the ones on record were justifiable homicides i heard justifiable you dont find it strange that none of them ever even made it to the steps of a court that every investigation into his actions exonerated him or just petered out youre talking about a conspiracy im talking about protection im talking about people with a vested interest in keeping parker on the streets why i dont know could be because they approve of what hes done but hes lost his pis license he cant own a firearm he cant legally carry a firearm in the state of maine you can be damned sure he has guns squirreled away somewhere what im saying is if there was a conspiracy to protect him then something has changed not enough to land him behind bars where he belongs tyrrell rapped an index finger on the table to emphasize his point mickey leaned back he had filled pages and pages of notes his hand ached he watched tyrrell the older man was staring into his third glass theyd been huge measures as big as any mickey had ever seen poured in a bar had he himself drunk that much alcohol he would be asleep by now tyrrell was still upright but he was on the ropes mickey wasnt going to get anything more of use from him why do you hate him so much he asked huh tyrrell looked up even through a fug of progressive intoxication he was still surprised by the directness of the question parker why do you hate him because hes a killer just that tyrrell blinked slowly no because hes wrong hes all wrong its likeits like he doesnt cast a shadow or theres no reflection when he looks in a mirror he seems normal but then you look closer and he isnt hes an aberration an abomination christ thought mickey you go to church asked tyrrell no you should a man ought to go to church helps him to keep himself in perspective ill remember that tyrrell looked up his face transformed mickey had overstepped the mark and badly dont get smart with me boy look at you scrabbling in the dirt hoping to make a few bucks off another mans life youre a parasite you dont believe in anything i believe i believe in god and i believe in the law i know right from wrong good from evil ive spent my life living by those beliefs i cleaned out precinct after precinct in this city rooting out the ones who thought that being lawmen made them above the law well i showed them the error of their ways nobody should be above the law especially not cops doesnt matter if they wear a badge now or wore one ten years ago twenty years ago i found the ones who stole who ripped off dealers and whores who dispensed their version of street justice in alleyways and empty apartments and i brought them to book i called them on it and i found them wanting because there is a process in place there is a system of justice its imperfect and it doesnt always work the way it should but its the best we have and anyoneanyonewho steps outside that system to act as judge jury and executioner on others is an enemy of that system parker is an enemy of that system his friends are enemies of that system by their actions they render it acceptable for others to act the same way their violence begets more violence you cannot perform acts of evil in the name of a greater good because the good suffers it is corrupted and polluted by what has been done in its name do you understand mr wallace these are gray men they shift the boundaries of morality to suit themselves and they use the ends to justify the me j astify theans that is unacceptable to me and if you have a shred of decency it should be unacceptable to you too he pushed the glass away were finished here but what if others wont act cant act asked mickey is it better to let evil go unchecked than to sacrifice a little of the good to resist it and who decides that asked tyrrell he was swaying slightly as he pulled on his coat struggling to find the armholes you parker who decides what is an acceptable level of good to sacrifice how much evil has to be committed in the name of good before it becomes an evil in itself he patted his pockets and heard the satisfying jangle of his keys mickey hoped that they werent car keys go write your book mr wallace i wont be reading it i dont think youll have anything to tell me that i dont already know ill give you one piece of advice for free though no matter how bad his friends are parker is worse id step lightly when im asking about them and maybe id be inclined to leave them out of your story altogether but parker is lethal because he believes that hes on a crusade i hope that you expose him for the wretch he is but id watch my back all the way tyrrell made a gun with his hand pointed it at mickey and let his thumb fall like a hammer on a chamber then he walked a little unsteadily from the bar shaking hands with hector one more time before he left mickey put away his notebook and pen and went to pay the tab you a friend of the captains asked hector as mickey calculated the tip and added it to the bill by hand for tax purposes no said mickey i dont think i am the captain doesnt have many friends said hector and there was something in his tone it might almost have been pity mickey looked at him with interest what do you mean i mean that we get cops in here all the time but hes the only one who drinks alone he was iad said mickey internal affairs hector shook his head i know that but thats not it hes just hector searched for the right word hes just a prick he concluded then went back to reading his bodybuilding magazine chapter seventeen mickey wrote up his notes on the tyrrell interview in his room while the details were still fresh in his mind the pimp stuff was interesting he googled the name johnny friday along with the details that tyrrell had shared with him and up came some contemporary news reports as well as a longer article that had been written for one of the free papers entitled pimp the brutal life and bad end of johnny friday there were two pictures of friday accompanying the article the k arä asfirst showed friday as he was in life a spare rangy black man with hollow cheeks and eyes that were too large for his face he had his arms around a pair of young women in lacy underwear both of whom had their eyes blacked out to preserve their anonymity mickey wondered where they were now according to the main article young women who became professionally acquainted with johnny friday were not destined to lead happy existences the second picture had been taken on the mortuary slab and showed the extent of the injuries that friday had received in the course of the beating that took his life mickey figured that fridays family must have asked for the photograph to be released that or the cops had wanted it done in order to send out a message friday wasnt even recognizable as the same man his face was swollen and bloodied his jaw nose and one of his cheekbones broken and some of his teeth were sheared off at the gums he had suffered extensive internal injuries too one of his lungs had been punctured by a broken rib and his spleen had ruptured parkers name wasnt mentioned which was no surprise but a police source had indicated to the writer that there was a suspect in the killings although there was not enough evidence as yet to press charges mickey calculated the odds in favor of tyrrell being that source and decided they were about even if he was then it meant that even a decade ago hed had doubts about parker and he might have had some justification for them mickey hadnt cared much for tyrrell but there was no denying that the man who had killed johnny friday was dangerous someone capable of inflicting grave violence on another human being an individual filled with anger and hatred mickey tried to balance that with the man he had encountered in maine and what he had heard about him from others he rubbed his still tender belly at the memory of the punch that he had received on parkers front porch and the light that had flared briefly in the mans eyes as he had struck the blow yet no other blows had followed and the anger in his eyes was gone almost as quickly as it had first appeared to be replaced by what mickey thought was shame and regret it hadnt mattered to mickey thenhe had been too busy trying not to cough his guts upbut it was clear upon reflection that if parkers anger was still not yet fully under his control then he had learned to rein it in to some degree although not quickly enough to save mickey from a bruised belly but if tyrrell was right this man had johnny fridays blood on his hands he was not just a killer but a murderer and mickey wondered how much he had truly changed in the years since johnny fridays death when he was finished with the tyrrell material he opened a paper file on his desk inside were more notes twentyfive or thirty sheets of paper each covered from top to bottom in mickeys tiny handwriting illegible to anyone else thanks to a combination of his personal shorthand and the size of the script one sheet was headed with the words fathermother he intended to head out to pearl river at some point to talk to neighbors store owners anyone who might have had contact with parkers family before the killings but he had some more homework to do on that first he checked his watch it was after eight he knew that jimmy gallagher who had partnered parkers father down in the ninth precinct lived out in brooklyn tyrrell had given him that along with the name of the investigator from the rockland county district attorneys office who had been present at the interviews with parkers father following the killings tyrrell thought that the latter exnypd name of kozelek mig j qkozelek ht talk to wallace and had initially offered to smooth the way but that was before their conversation had come to a badtempered end wallace figured that call wasnt going to be made now although he wasnt afraid to tap tyrrell again once hed sobered up if the investigator proved reluctant to speak the partner gallagher was another matter wallace could tell that tyrrell hadnt liked gallagher any more than hed liked charlie parker he went back to his notes from that afternoon and found the exchange in question w who were his friends t parkers w no his fathers t he was a popular guy well liked down in the ninth he probably had a lot of friends w any in particular t he was partnered withuh what was his name nowgallagher thats it jimmy gallagher was his partner down there for years laughs i alwaysah it doesnt matter w maybe it does t i always thought he was queer myself w there were rumors t just that rumors w was he interviewed in the course of the investigation into the pearl river killings t oh yeah he was interviewed all right i saw the transcripts it was like talking to one of those monkeys you know the ones see no evil speak no evil hear no evil said he knew nothing hadnt even seen his old buddy that day w except t except that it was gallaghers birthday when the killings occurred and he was down in the ninth even though hed requested and been given a day off hard to believe that he would have gone to the ninth on his day off and his birthday whats more and not hooked up with his partner and best friend w so you think that gallagher went down to meet some people for a birthday drink and if that was the case parker would have been among them t makes sense doesnt it heres another thing parker was on an eighttofour tour that day a cop named eddie grace covered for parker so that he could finish his tour early why would parker have been calling in favors unless it was to meet up with jimmy gallagher w did grace say that was why he covered for parker t like everyone else involved grace knew nothing and said nothing the precinct clerk demartini saw parker skip out but didnt say anything about it he knew when to turn a blind eye a waitress in cal s said gallagher was with someone on the night of the killings but she didnt get a good look at the guy and he didnt stay long she said it might have been will parker but then the bartender contradicted her said it was someone else in the bar with gallagher a stranger and the waitress subsequently decided that shed been mi j quod beenstaken w you think someone put pressure on her to change her story t they closed ranks its what cops do they protect their own even if its the wrong thing to do mickey paused at that point in his notes tyrrells face had changed when he spoke about ranks closing of men being protected perhaps it was the iad investigator in him a deepseated hatred of corrupt men and the code of omerta that protected them but mickey didnt think that was all he suspected that tyrrell had always been outside the loop even before he joined iad he wasnt a likable man as hector had pointed out and it might have been the case that the rat squad had given him the opportunity to punish those whom he despised in the guise of a crusade against corruption mickey filed that observation away and returned to his reading t what i couldnt figure out was what did it matter if gallagher was with parker that night unless gallagher knew something about what was going to happen w youre talking about a premeditated killing mickey recalled that tyrrell had reconsidered at that point t maybe or gallagher knew the reason parker ended up killing those two kids and wanted to keep that knowledge to himself whatever the reason i know jimmy gallagher lied about what happened that night ive read the iad reports as far as we were concerned after that jimmy gallagher was a marked man for the rest of his career mickey found gallaghers name in the phone book he considered making a call to him before heading out to bensonhurst then decided that he might be better off surprising him he wasnt sure what he hoped to gain from speaking to gallagher but if tyrrell was right then there was at least one crack in the story constructed around the events of the day on which the pearl river killings had taken place as a reporter mickey had learned to become the water in the crack widening it weakening the structure itself until it finally collapsed to reveal the truth the killings and their aftermath would play an important part in mickeys book theyd offer him scope to consult a couple of rentapsychologists whod give him chapter and verse on the impact on a son of his fathers involvement in a murdersuicide readers ate that stuff up he took the subway out to bensonhurst to save a few bucks and found gallaghers street he knocked on the door of the neat little house after a couple of minutes a tall man answered the door mr gallagher thats right gallaghers lips and teeth were stained red hed been drinking wine when mickey called that was good unless he had company it could mean that his defenses might be down some mickey had his wallet in his hand he removed a card from it and handed it over j q ldqmy names michael wallace im a reporter i was hoping to talk to you for a few minutes about what and now it was time for mickey to massage the truth a little a lie in the service of a greater good he doubted if tyrrell would have approved im putting together a piece about changes in the ninth precinct over the years i know you served down there id like to speak to you about your memories of that time a lot of cops passed through the ninth why me well when i was looking for people to talk to i saw that youd been involved in a lot of community activities over here in bensonhurst i thought that social conscience might give you a better insight into the nature of the ninth gallagher looked at the card wallace huh thats right he leaned forward and tucked the card carefully into the pocket of mickeys shirt it was a curiously intimate gesture youre full of shit said gallagher i know who you are and i know what youre trying to write cops talk i knew about you from the moment you started sniffing around in things that dont concern you take my advice let this one go you dont want to go nosing around in these corners nobody worth talking to is going to help you and you may just bring a heap of trouble down on your head in the process mickeys eyes glittered they had turned to hard little jewels set into his head he was getting tired of being warned off im a reporter he said even though this was no longer the case then again there was no such thing as a former reporter just as there was no such thing as an exalcoholic the old hunger never went away the more people tell me not to look into something the more i want to do it that doesnt make you a reporter said gallagher it makes you a fool youre also a liar i dont much care for that in a man really said wallace youve never lied i didnt say that i like it as little in myself as i do in you good because i believe that you lied about what happened on the day that will parker killed those two teenagers out in pearl river im going to do my best to find out why then ill be back here and well talk again gallagher looked weary mickey wondered how long hed been waiting for all of this to come back on him probably since the day his partner had turned into a murderer get off my step mr wallace youre spoiling my evening he closed the door in mickeys face mickey stared at it for a moment then took the business card from his pocket and tucked it into the door frame before heading back to manhattan inside the house jimmy sat at his kitchen table there was an empt j q was an ey glass beside him and half a bottle of syrah along with the remains of his evening meal jimmy liked cooking for himself even more than he liked cooking for other people when he cooked for himself he didnt have to fret about the results about what other people might think of what hed prepared he was able to cook entirely to his own satisfaction and he knew what he enjoyed hed been looking forward to a quiet evening with a good bottle of wine and an old noir movie on tcm now his sense of calm which had already been fragile was shattered it had been fragile ever since charlie parker came to his door at that moment jimmy had felt as though the ground were slowly being eroded from beneath his feet he had hoped that the past had been laid to rest however uneasily now the earth was shifting exposing tattered flesh and old bones he had always been troubled by the possibility that in lying to the investigators in keeping silent over the decades that followed he had done the wrong thing like a splinter buried deep in the flesh the knowledge of how he had conspired with others to bury the truth even the little of it that he knew had festered inside him now he knew that the time was fast approaching when the infection would either be purged from his body or it would destroy him he filled his glass and walked to the hallway taking a sip of his wine he dialed the number for the second time since parker had visited him it was answered after five rings in the background he heard noisesplates being washed the laughter of womenas the old man said hello its jimmy gallagher he said theres another problem go on said the voice ive just had a reporter here name of wallace mickey wallace he was asking aboutthat day there was a brief silence we know about him what did you tell him nothing i stuck to the story like you told me to like ive always done but go on its coming apart first charlie parker now this guy it was always going to come apart i am only surprised that it has taken so long what do you want me to do about the reporter nothing his book will never be published you seem very certain about that we have friends wallaces contract is about to be canceled without the promise of money for his efforts hell lose heart jimmy wasnt so sure about that hed seen the look on wallaces face money might have been part of the impulse behind his investigation but it wasnt the sole motivation he was almost like a good cop jimmy thought you didnt pay him to do his job you paid him not to do something else wallace wanted the story he wanted to find out the truth like all those who achieve success against the odds there was a touch of the fanatic in him have you spoken to charlie parker not yet if you wait for him to come to you you may find that his anger is commensurately greater call him tell him to come down and talk and do i also tell him about you tell him everything mr gallagher youve been faithful to your friends memory for a quarter of a century youve protected his son and us for a long time were grateful to you but its time now to expose these hidden truths to the light thank you said jimmy no thank you enjoy the rest of your evening the phone was hung up jimmy knew that it might be the last time he heard that voice and in truth he wasnt sorry chapter eighteen the day after my confrontation with mickey wallace i decided to tell dave evans that i wanted to take a week off from the bear i was determined to put pressure on jimmy gallagher and maybe hit eddie grace again i couldnt do that while commuting back and forth between portland and new york and relying on having sundays off and something else had emerged walter cole had been unable to turn up anything new about the investigation into the pearl river killings except for one curious detail the reports are too clean he told me over the phone the whole thing was a whitewash i spoke to a guy in records he said the file is so thin if you turn it sideways its invisible thats no surprise they buried it there was no percentage in doing anything else yeah well i still think there was more to it than that the record was purged you ever hear of something called unit five doesnt ring any bells ten years ago all records relating to the pearl river killings were ringfenced any request for information beyond what was in the files had to go through this unit five clearance which meant contacting the commissioners office my guy didnt feel comfortable even talking about it but anyone who wants to know more than the bare details about what happened at pearl river has to put in a request to unit five but walter wasnt finished you know what else is covered by the unit five order the deaths of susan and jennifer parker so whats unit five i asked i think you are i met dave at arabica at the corner of free and cross which as well as having some of the best coffee in town now occupied the best space with art on the walls and light pouring through its big picture windows the pixies were playing in the background all things considered it was hard to find fault with the place khtôst dave wasnt overjoyed at being asked to give me time away from the bar and i could hardly blame him he was about to lose two of his staff one to maternity and the other to a girlfriend in california i knew he felt that he was spending too much time doing general bar work and too little time on paperwork and accounts i had been hired to take some of that burden off him and instead i was leaving him mired even more deeply than he had been before i arrived im trying to run a business here charlie said dave youre killing me were not real busy dave i said gary can take care of the nappi delivery and then ill be back in time for next weeks truck were overstocked on some of the microbrews anyway so we can let them run down what about tomorrow night nadines been asking for extra shifts let her take up some of the slack dave buried his face in his hands i hate you he said no you dont yes i do take your week off if were still here when you get back you owe me you owe me big time that night did nothing to improve daves mood somebody tried to steal the ornamental bear head from the dining room and we only spotted that it was missing when the thief was about to drive from the parking lot with the head sticking out of the passenger window we were hit by cocktail freaks so that even gary who seemed to have a better knowledge of cocktails than most was forced to resort to the cheat sheet kept behind the bar students ordered rounds of cherry bombs and jäger bombs and the sickly smell of red bull tainted the air we changed fifteen kegs three times as many as the average for an evening although still some way off the record of twentytwo and there was also sex in the air there was a woman in her fifties at the far end of the bar who couldnt have been more predatory if shed had claws and razor teeth and she was soon joined by two or three others to form a pack the bartenders called them flossies after a semimythical dental supplies saleswoman who was reputed to have serviced a series of men in the parking lot over the course of a single evening eventually they attracted a couple of international players of the world to themselves macho types whose aftershave fought a battle of the fragrances with the lingering odor of red bull at one point i considered turning a hose on them all to cool them down but before the need arose they eventually departed for a darker corner of town by the time am arrived all fifteen of the staff were exhausted but nobody wanted to go home just yet after the beer towers were cleaned and the coolers stocked we fixed some burgers and fries and most people had a drink to unwind we turned off the satellite system that provided music for the bar and instead put a mellow ipod playlist on shuffle sun kil moon fleet foxes the reissue of dennis wilsons pacific ocean blues finally people started to drift away and dave and i checked that everything was off in the kitchen snuffed the last of the candles checked the bathrooms to make sure everyone was out then put the cash in the safe and locked up we said goodbye in the parking lot and before we went our separate j aur separaways dave told me again that he hated me after i had opened the front door of my house i paused at the threshold and listened my encounter with mickey wallace and his story about the two figures he had glimpsed had unsettled me i had let those ghosts go they didnt belong here any longer yet as before when i had gone through the house after wallaces departure i experienced no sense of dread no true unease instead the house was quiet and i felt its emptiness whatever had been here was now gone the message light on my answering machine was flashing i hit the button and heard jimmy gallaghers voice he sounded a little drunk but the message was still clear and simple and the timing of it preordained charlie come on down here said jimmy ill tell you what you want to know iv three may keep a secret if two of them are dead benjamin franklin poor richards almanack chapter nineteen jimmy gallagher must have been watching for me to come as he answered the door before i even knocked i imagined him for a moment sitting at his window his face reflected in the gathering dark his fingers tapping on the sill anxiously seeking the one whom he was expecting but as i looked into his eyes i saw that there was no anxiety no fear or concern in truth he appeared more relaxed than i had ever seen him he was wearing a tshirt over a pair of paintstained tan trousers topped off by a yankees hooded top and an old pair of penny loafers he looked like a man in his twenties who had suddenly woken up from a nap to find that he had aged forty years in appearance while still being forced to wear all the same clothes i had always believed him to be a man for whom appearance was everything for i could never recall him without a jacket and a clean starched shirt often finished with a tasteful silk tie now all formality had been stripped from him and i wondered as the night drew on and i listened to the secrets pour out of him if those strictures he had placed on his dress had merely been one part of the defenses he had constructed to protect not only himself and his own identity but the memories and lives of those about whom he cared he didnt say anything when he saw me he just opened the door nodded once then turned around and led the way to the kitchen i closed the door behind me and followed him a pair of candles burned in the kitchen one on the windowsill and a second on the table beside the second candle stood a bottle of goodmaybe very goodred wine a decanter and two glasses jimmy tenderly touched the neck of the bottle stroking it as though it were a beloved pet ive been waiting for an excuse to open it he said but these days i dont seem to have too many causes for j ø end celebration mostly i go to funerals you get to my age thats what you do ive been to three funerals already this year they were all cops and they all died of cancer he sighed i dont want to go that way eddie grace is dying of cancer i heard i thought about going to see him but eddie and me he shook his head all we had in common was your old man when he went eddie and me had no reason to talk i recalled what eddie had said to me before i left him about how jimmy gallagher had spent his life living a lie maybe eddie had been referring however obliquely to jimmys homosexuality but i knew now that there were other lies to be uncovered even if they were lies of omission still it wasnt for eddie grace to judge how any man lived his life not in the way that he had judged jimmy we all presented one face to the world and kept another hidden nobody could survive in it otherwise as jimmy unburdened himself and my fathers secrets were slowly revealed to me i came to understand how will parker had buckled under the weight of them and i felt only sadness for him and for the woman he had betrayed jimmy took a waiters friend from a drawer and carefully cut the foil on the bottle before inserting the tip of the corkscrew into the cork it took only two twists and then a single pull for the cork to release with a satisfying airy pop he looked at it to make sure that it wasnt dry or decaying and cast it to the side i used to sniff the corks he said but then someone pointed out that it tells you nothing about the quality of the wine shame i liked the ritual of it until i found out that it made me look like a knownothing he positioned the candle behind the bottle as he decanted it so that he could see the sediment approaching the neck no need to let it stand for long he said once he was finished thats just with younger wines it softens the tannins he poured two glasses and sat he held his glass to the candlelight to examine it lifted it to his nose sniffed then swirled the wine around before sniffing again holding the bowl in his hands to warm it finally he tasted it moving the wine around in his mouth savoring the flavors fantastic he said then raised his glass in a toast to your old man to my old man i echoed i sipped the wine it tasted rich and earthy domaine de la romanéeconti ninetyfive said jimmy a pretty good year for burgundy thats a sixhundreddollar bottle of wine were drinking what are we celebrating the end of what of secrets and lies i put my glass down so where do you want to begin with the dead baby he said with the first dead baby neither of them ha r ar of themd wanted to work the twelvetoeight that week but that was the way the cookie had crumbled them was the breaks or whatever other cliché one might have decided to apply to a situation when there was only one end of the stick to grasp and it wasnt the fragrant end that evening the precinct was holding a party at the ukrainian national home over on second avenue which always smelled of borscht and pierogi and barley soup from the restaurant on the first floor and where the director sidney lumet would rehearse his movies before beginning filming so that over time paul newman and katharine hepburn al pacino and marlon brando would all walk up and down the same steps as the cops of the ninth the party was to celebrate the fact that three of its officers had been awarded combat crosses that month the name given to the green bars received by those who had been involved in a shootout the ninth was already the wild west back then cops were dying if it came down to you and the other guy you shot first and worried about the paperwork later new yorkthen wasnt like it was now in the summer of the racial tensions in the city had come to a head with the killing of fifteenyearold james powell in harlem by an offduty patrolman what started out as orderly protests against the killing turned into riots on july when a crowd gathered at the onetwothree in harlem shouting murderers at the cops inside jimmy and will had been sent up as part of the reinforcements bottles and bricks and garbagecan lids raining down on them looters helping themselves to food and radios and even weapons from the neighborhood stores jimmy could still recall a police captain pleading with the rioters to go home and hearing someone laugh and call back we are home white boy after five days of rioting in harlem and bedstuy one person was dead had been arrested and the writing was on the wall for mayor wagner his days had already been numbered even before the riots the annual murder rate had doubled to six hundred a year under his administration and even before the powell shooting the city had been reeling from the murder of a woman named kitty genovese in her middleclass queens neighborhood who was stabbed in the course of three separate assaults by the same man winston moseley twelve people either witnessing or hearing the murder while it was in progress most of them declining to intervene in any way beyond calling the cops it was felt that the city was coming apart and wagner bore the brunt of the blame none of these concerns about the state of the city came as news to the men of the ninth the ninth was affectionately known as the shithouse by those who served there less so by everyone else they were a law unto themselves the men of that precinct and they guarded their territory well keeping an eye out not only for the bad guys but for some of the good guys too like captains looking to kick ass on a slow day fly in the shithouse someone would call in over the radio and then everyone would stand a little straighter for as long as was necessary jimmy and will were ambitious back then both looking to make sergeant as soon as possible the competition was tougher than before since felicia spritzers lawsuit in that resulted in female officers being allowed to take promotional examinations for the first time with spritzer and gertrude schimmel making sergeant the following year not that jimmy and will gave a rats ass unlike some of the older guys who had a lot of views on where a womans place was none of which included wearing three stripes in one of their precincts they both had a copy of the r a copy of patrol guide thick as a bible in its blueplastic ring binder and they carried the guide with them whenever they took a break so that they could test each others knowledge in those days you had to do detective work as a patrol officer for five years before you could make detective but you wouldnt start bringing in a sergeants money until you made second grade they didnt want to be investigators anyway they were street cops so they decided that theyd both try for the sergeants exam even if it meant that theyd have to leave the ninth maybe even have to serve in different precincts it would be tough but they knew that their friendship would survive it unlike a lot of other cops who worked as bouncers keeping the guineas from brooklyn out of the clubs or as bodyguards for celebrities which was boring they didnt have second jobs jimmy was a single man and will wanted to spend more time with his wife not less there was still a lot of corruption in the force but it was mostly smalltime stuff later drugs would change everything and the commissions would come down hard on bent cops for now the best that could be hoped for would be the occasional dollar job escorting the movie theater manager to the night safe with the days takings and getting a couple of bucks for drinks left on the backseat in return even taking lunch on the arm would soon come to be frowned upon though most places in the ninth didnt do it anyway cops paid for their own lunches their own coffee and doughnuts the majority ate lunch at the precinct house it was cheaper and there werent too many places to eat in the ninth anyway at least none that the cops liked the ham and cheddar with hot mustard at mcsorleys apart or in later years jack the ribbers over on third although eat lunch at jack the ribbers and you werent going to be doing anything more strenuous than rubbing your stomach and groaning for the rest of the day the guys in the seventh were lucky because they had katzs but the cops in the ninth werent allowed to cross precinct lines just because the bologna was better down the block the nypd didnt work that way on the night of the first dead baby jimmy was working as recorder for the first half of the tour the recorder took all of the notes during the tour and the driver took the wheel halfway through they switched jimmy was the better recorder he had a good eye and a sharp memory will had just enough recklessness to make him the better driver together they made a good team they were called to a party over on avenue a a some neighbors complaining about the noise when they got to the building a young woman was puking into the gutter while her friend held her hair away from her face and stroked her back they were so stoned that they barely glanced at the two cops jimmy and will could hear music coming from the top floor of the walkup as a matter of course they kept their hands on the grips of their guns there was no way of telling if this was just a regular party that was getting a little out of hand or something more serious as always in these situations jimmy felt his mouth go dry and his heart began to beat faster a week earlier a guy had taken a flight off the top of a tenement in the course of a party that had started off just like this one hed almost killed one of the cops who was arriving to investigate landing just inches from him and spraying him with blood when he hit turned out that the flyer had been skimming from some guys with vowels at the ends of their names italians who were applying their business acumen to the newly resurge r aewly resunt heroin market which had been largely dormant since the teens and twenties the italians not yet realizing that their time was coming to an end their dominance soon to be challenged by the blacks and the colombians the apartment door was open and music blared from a stereo jagger singing about some girl they could see a narrow hallway leading into a living area and the air was thick with tobacco and booze and grass the two officers exchanged a look call it said will they stepped into the hall jimmy leading nypd he shouted everybody stay calm and stay still cautiously will behind him jimmy peered into the living room there were eight people in various stages of intoxication or druginduced stupor most were sitting or lying on the floor some were clearly asleep a young white woman with purple stripes through her blond hair was stretched out on the couch beneath the window a cigarette dangling from her hand when she saw the cops she said oh shit and began to get up stay where you are said jimmy motioning with his left hand that she should remain on the couch now one or two of the more together partygoers were waking up to the trouble they might be in and looking scared while jimmy kept an eye on the people in the living room will checked the rest of the apartment there was a small bedroom with two beds one an empty childs cot the other a double piled with coats he found a young man probably nineteen or twenty and barely compos mentis on his knees in the bathroom trying unsuccessfully to flush an ounce of marijuana down a toilet with a broken cistern when he frisked him will found three twists of heroin in one of the pockets of the kids jeans what are you an idiot will asked huh said the kid youre carrying heroin but you flush the marijuana you in college yeah bet youre not studying to be a rocket scientist you know how much trouble youre in but man said the kid staring at the twists that shit is worth money will almost felt sorry for him he was so dumb come on knucklehead he said he pushed him into the living room and told him to sit on the floor okay said jimmy the rest of you against the walls you got anything i should know about you tell me now and itll go easier on you those who were able to rose and assumed the position against the walls will nudged one comatose girl with his foot come on sleeping beauty nap times over eventually they had all nine standing will frisked eight of them excluding the boy he had searched earlier only the girl with the striped hair was carrying three joints and a twist she was both drunk and r ah drunk ahigh but was coming down from the worst of it what are these will asked the girl i dont know said the girl her voice was slightly slurred a friend gave them to me to look after for her thats some story whats your friends name hans christian andersen who doesnt matter this your place yes whats your name sandra sandra what sandra huntingdon well sandra youre under arrest for possession with intent to supply he cuffed her and read her her rights then did the same with the boy he had searched earlier jimmy took the names of the rest and told them that they were free to stay or to leave but if he passed them on the street again hed bust them for loitering even if they were running a race at the time all of them went back to sitting around they were young and scared and they were gradually coming to realize how lucky they were not to be in cuffs like their buddies but they werent together enough to head out into the night just yet okay time to go will said to the two in cuffs he began to lead huntingdon from the apartment jimmy behind him with the boy whose name was howard mason but suddenly something seemed to flare in huntingdons brain cutting through the drug fog my baby she said i cant leave my baby what baby asked will my little girl shes two i cant leave her alone miss theres no child in this apartment i searched it myself but she struggled against him im telling you my baby is here she shouted and he could tell that she wasnt faking or deluded her concern was very real one of the group in the living room a black man in his twenties with a beginners afro said she aint lyin man she do have a baby jimmy looked at will you sure you searched the place its not central park hell he turned mason back toward the living room you sit on the couch and dont move he told him okay sandra you say you have a kid lets find her whats her name melanie melanie right youre sure you didnt ask someone to look after her for the evening no shes here huntingdon was crying now im not lying well well soon find out there werent very many places to search but they called the girls name just the same the two cops searched behind the couches in the bathtub and in the kitchen closets it was will who found her she was under the pile of coats on the bed he could tell that the child was dead from the moment that his hand touched her leg jimmy took a sip of wine the kid must have wanted to lie on her mothers bed he said maybe she crawled under the first coat for warmth then fell asleep the other coats were just piled on top of her and she suffocated under them i can still remember the sound her mother made when we found her it came from someplace deep and old it was like an animal dying and then she just folded to the floor her arms still cuffed behind her she crawled to the bed on her knees and started to burrow under the coats with her head trying to get close to her little girl we didnt stop her we just stood there watching her she wasnt a bad mother she worked two jobs and her aunt looked after her kid while she was at work maybe she was doing a little dealing on the side but the autopsy found that her daughter was healthy and well cared for apart from the night of the party nobody ever had any cause to complain about her what im saying is that it could have happened to anyone it was a tragedy thats all it was nobodys fault your old man though he took it bad he went on a bender the next day back then your father could drink some when you knew him hed cut all that stuff out apart from the occasional night out with the boys but in the old days he liked a drink we all did that day was different though id never seen him drink the way he did after he found melanie huntingdon i think it was because of his own circumstances he and your mother wanted a child real bad but it didnt look like it was going to happen for them then he sees this little kid lying dead under a pile of coats and something breaks inside him he believed in god he went to church he prayed that night it must have seemed as if god was mocking him just for the hell of it forcing a man who had seen his wife miscarry again and again to uncover the body of a dead child worse than that maybe he stopped believing in any kind of god for a time as if someone had just pulled up a corner of the world and revealed black empty space behind it i dont know anyway finding the huntingdon kid changed him thats all i can say after it he and your mother went through a real rough patch i think she was going to leave him or he was going to leave her i dont recall which wouldnt have mattered i suppose the end result would still have been the same he put the glass down and let the candlelight play upon the wine spreading red fractals upon the tabletop like the ghosts of rubies and that was when he met the girl he sai r adquo he d her name was caroline carr or that was what she said her name was they had responded to an attempted b and e call at her apartment it was the smallest apartment they had ever seen barely large enough to contain a single bed a closet and a table and chair the kitchen area consisted of two gas rings in one corner and the bathroom was so tiny that it didnt even have a door just lengths of beaded string for privacy it was hard to see why anyone might have considered it worth breaking into one look around told them that the girl didnt have anything worth stealing if she had she would have sold it to rent a bigger place but in a strange way the space suited her she was tiny just a shade over five feet tall and thin with it her hair was long and dark and very fine and her skin was translucently pale it seemed to jimmy that she might expire at any minute but when he looked in her eyes he saw a real strength and ferocity at her core she might have appeared fragile but so did spider silk until you tried to break it she was frightened though of that he was certain at the time he put it down to the attempted burglary someone had clearly tried to jimmy the lock on the window from the fire escape outside she had woken to the noise and had immediately run to the phone in the hallway outside to call the cops one of her neighbors an elderly woman named mrs roth had heard her screaming and offered her safe haven in her apartment until the police came as it happened jimmy and will had been only a block away when the call from central came through whoever had tried to break in was probably still at the window when the sirens began to sound they filled out a but there wasnt much more that they could do the perps were gone and no harm had been done will suggested talking to the landlord about getting a better lock for the window or maybe a security grille of some kind but carr just shook her head i wont be staying here she said im going to leave its the big city said will these things happen i understand i have to move though her fear was palpable but it didnt seem to be controlling her it wasnt unreasoning and it wasnt merely an overreaction to a disturbing if commonplace incident whatever was frightening her it was related only in part to the events of that night your father must have felt it too said jimmy he was quiet as we drove away we stopped to pick up a couple of coffees and as we sat drinking them he said what do you suppose that was about its going down as a thats all there is to it but that woman was scared she lives alone in a shoebox someone tries to break in she hasnt got too many places to run no its more than that she didnt tell us everything what are you now psychic r a then he turned to me he didnt say anything he just stared me down okay i said youre right i felt it too you want to go back no not now maybe later but we never did go back at least i didnt your father did though he went back he might even have gone back that night after the tour ended and that was how it began will told jimmy that he didnt sleep with caroline until the third time they met he claimed that it had never been his intention to get involved with her in that way but there was something about her something that made him want to help her and protect her jimmy didnt know whether to believe him or not and he didnt suppose it mattered much one way or another there had always been a sentimental streak to will parker and as jimmy liked to say quoting oscar wilde sentimentality is the bank holiday of cynicism will was having problems at home and he was still troubled by the death of melanie huntingdon so maybe he saw the possibility of some kind of escape in the form of caroline carr he helped her to move he found her a place on the upper east side with more space and better security he put her in a motel for two nights while he negotiated the rent down on her behalf then drove into the city one morning instead of taking the train and put all of her belongings which didnt amount to much in the back of his car and took her to her new apartment the affair didnt last longer than six or seven weeks during that time she became pregnant i waited i had finished my wine but when jimmy tried to refill my glass i covered it with my hand i felt lightheaded but it was nothing to do with the wine pregnant i said thats right he lifted the wine bottle you mind if i do it makes all this easier ive been waiting a long time to get rid of it he filled the glass halfway she had something that caroline carr said jimmy even i could see that even you despite myself i smiled she wasnt to my taste he said smiling back i hope i dont need to say any more than that i nodded that wasnt all of it though your father was a goodlooking man there were a lot of women out there whod have been happy to ease him of some of his burdens no strings attached he wouldnt have been obliged to buy them more than a drink instead here he was finding a place for this woman and lying to his wife about where he was going so that he could help her move you think he was infatuated with her thats what i believed at the start she was younger than he was though not by much and like i said she had a certain allure i think it r a i think was tied up with her size and the impression of fragility that she gave even if it was deceptive so yeah sure i thought it was an infatuation and maybe it was at the start but later will told me the rest of it or as much of it as he wanted to tell me that was when i started to understand and thats when i started to worry his brow furrowed and i could tell that even now decades later he struggled with this part of the story we were in cal s on the night will told me that caroline carr was convinced she was being hunted i thought he was joking at first but he wasnt then i started to wonder if the girl had spun him some kind of line of bullshit you know damsel in distress bad men on the horizon shitty boyfriend maybe or psycho exhusband but that wasnt it she was convinced that whoever whatever was hunting her wasnt human she talked about two people a man and a woman she told your father that theyd started hunting her years before shed been running from them ever since and my father believed her jimmy laughed are you kidding me he might have been a sentimentalist but he wasnt a fool he thought she was a wacko he figured hed made the biggest mistake of his life he had visions of her stalking him arriving at his house decked out in garlic and crucifixes your old man might have gone off the rails a little but he was still capable of driving the train so no he didnt believe her and i think he started trying to disentangle himself from the whole mess i guess he also realized that he ought to be with his wife that leaving her wouldnt solve any of his problems but would just give him a whole new set of them to deal with then caroline told him she was pregnant and his world collapsed around him they had a long talk on the evening of her visit to the clinic to get checked out she never even mentioned abortion and your father to his credit never raised it either it wasnt just because he was catholic i think he still recalled that little girl buried under the pile of coats and his wifes miscarriages even if it meant the end of his marriage and a life of debt he wasnt going to suggest that the pregnancy should be terminated and caroline you know she was really calm about the whole thing not happy exactly but calm as if the pregnancy was a minor medical procedure or something a thing that was worrying but necessary your father well he was kind of shocked he needed some air so he left her and went to take a walk he decided after thirty minutes of his own company that he wanted to talk to someone so he stopped at a pay phone across from her apartment and started to call me and that was when he saw them they were standing in a doorway close by a convenience store hand in hand a man and a woman both in their early thirties the woman had mousy hair that brushed her shoulders and she wore no makeup she was slim and dressed in an oldfashioned black skirt that clung to her legs before flaring slightly at her shins a matching black jacket hung open over a white blouse that was buttoned to the neck the man wore a black suit with a white shirt and black tie his hair was short at the back and long in front parted on the left and hanging greasily over one eye both of them were staring up at the window of caroline carrs apart r asquos apment strangely it was their very stillness that drew wills attention to them they were like pieces of statuary that had been positioned in the shadows a temporary art installation on a busy street their appearance reminded him of those sects in pennsylvania the ones who frowned upon buttons as signs of vanity in their utter focus on the windows of the apartment he saw a fanaticism that bordered on the religious and then as will watched them they began to move they crossed the street the man reaching beneath his jacket as he went and will saw the gun appear in his hand he ran he had his own with him and he drew it the couple was halfway across the street when something in the manner of the strangers approach drew the mans attention he registered the approaching threat and turned to face it the woman continued moving her attention fixed only on the apartment building before her and the girl who was hiding within but the man stared straight at parker and the policeman felt a slow tightening in his gut as though someone had just pumped cold water into his system and it was responding with the urge to void itself even at this distance he could tell that the mans eyes were not right they were at once too dark like twin voids in the pallor of the gunmans face and yet too small chips of black glass in a borrowed skin pulled too tightly over a larger skull then the woman looked around only now becoming aware that her partner was no longer beside her she opened her mouth to say something and parker saw the panic on her face the truck hit the gunman hard from behind briefly pitching him forward and upward his feet leaving the ground before he was dragged beneath the front wheels as the driver braked his body disintegrating beneath the massive weight of the truck his life ending in a smear of red and black the force of the impact knocked him out of his shoes they lay nearby one upside down the other on its side a tendril of blood seeped out toward the shoes from the broken form under the truck as though the body were trying to reconstitute itself to build itself once again from the feet up somebody screamed by the time will reached the body the woman had disappeared he glanced under the truck the mans head was gone crushed by the leftfront wheel of the truck will showed his shield and told an ashenfaced man standing nearby to call in the accident the driver climbed down from his cab and tried to grab hold of will but he slipped by him and was only barely aware of the driver falling to the ground behind him he ran to carolines building but the front door was still locked he inserted the key and opened the door by touch his attention fixed on the street not the keyhole as the key turned he slipped inside and closed the door hard behind him when he got to the apartment he stood to one side breathing hard and knocked once caroline he called there was no reply for a moment then softly yes you okay honey i think so open up his eyes searched the shadows he thought that he could sm r a he couldell a strange perfume on the air it was sharp and metallic it took him a few seconds to realize that it was the smell of the dead mans blood he looked down and saw that it was on his shoes she opened the door he stepped inside when he tried to reach for her she moved away i saw them she said i saw them coming for me i know he said i saw them too the one who got hit hes dead she shook her head no im telling you hes dead his skull was crushed she was leaning against the wall now he gripped her shoulders look at me he said she did as he asked and he saw hidden knowledge in her eyes hes dead he said for the third time she let out a deep breath her eyes flicked toward the window okay she said and he knew that she did not believe him although he could not understand why what about the woman gone shell come back well move you where somewhere safe this place was supposed to be safe i was wrong you didnt believe me he nodded youre right i didnt i do now i dont know how they found you but i was wrong look did you make any calls did you tell anyonea friend a relativewhere you were her eyes turned back to him she looked tired not frightened or angry just weary who would i call she asked i have no one theres only you and with nowhere else to turn will called jimmy gallagher so that while the cops gathered statements jimmy was moving caroline to a motel in queens but not before driving around for hours trying to shake off anyone who might be following them when he had her safely checked in he stayed with her in her room until at last she fell asleep then he watched tv until morning came while he did so will was lying to the cops on the scene he told the officers that hed be r aeden uptown visiting a friend and had seen a man crossing the street with a gun in his hand he had challenged him and the man had been turning in response his gun raised when the truck hit him none of the other witnesses seemed to recall the woman who had been with him in fact the other witnesses couldnt even remember seeing the man cross the street it was as though for them he had materialized in that spot even the driver of the truck said that one second the street in front of him was empty and the next there was a man being pulled under the wheels of his vehicle the driver was in shock although there was no question of any blame accruing to him the lights had been in his favor and he had been well within the speed limit once he had made his statement will waited for a time in a coffee shop watching the front of the nowempty apartment house and the bustle at the spot of the mans death hoping to see again the woman with the washedout face and the dark eyes but she did not come if she was mourning the loss of her partner she was doing so elsewhere finally he gave up and joined jimmy and caroline at the motel and while caroline slept he told jimmy everything he told me about the pregnancy the woman the dead man said jimmy he kept returning to the way the guy had looked trying to pinpoint what it was about him that was sowrong and what did he decide i asked another mans clothes said jimmy what does that mean you ever see somebody wearing a suit that isnt his or trying to fit his feet into borrowed shoes ones that are maybe a size too small or too large well that was what was wrong with the dead man according to your father it was like hed borrowed another mans body but it didnt fit the way that it should your old man worried at it like a dog at a bone and that was the best that he could come up with weeks later it was almost as if he felt there was something living inside that guys body but it wasnt him whatever he had once been or whoever he had once been was long gone this thing had chewed it away he watched me then waiting for a response when none came he said im tempted to ask if you think that sounds crazy but i know too much about you to believe you if you said yes you ever get a name on him i asked ignoring what he had just said there wasnt much of the guy left to identify a sketch artist came up with a pretty good likeness though based on your fathers description and we circulated it bingo a woman comes forward says it looks like her husband name of peter ackerman hed run off on her five years before met some girl in a bar and that was it thing about it was the wife said it was completely out of character for her husband he was an accountant a bythenumbers guy loved her loved his kids he had his routines and he stuck to them i shrugged he wouldnt be the first man to disappoint his wife in that way no i guess not but we havent even gotten to the strange stuff ackerman had served in korea so his prints eventually checked out the wife gave a r awife gavedetailed description of his appearance though since his face was gone he had a marine tat on his left arm an appendectomy scar on his abdomen and a chunk missing from his right calf where a bullet had caught him at the chosin reservoir the body taken from under the truck had all of those markings and one more it seemed like hed picked up another tattoo since hed deserted his wife and family well not so much a tattoo more of a brand a brand it was burned into his right arm hard to describe id never seen anything like it before but your old man followed it up he found out what it was and it was the symbol of an angel a fallen angel an something was the name animal no thats not it hell itll come to me i was treading carefully now i didnt know how much jimmy knew of some of the men and women i had encountered in the past and of how some of them shared strange beliefs convinced that they were fallen beings wandering spirits demons this man was marked with an occult symbol thats right a fork that was a mark i had seen before the ones who bore it had called themselves believers what jimmys eyes narrowed in confusion then his expression changed and i understood that he knew more about me than i might have wished and i wondered how no not a fork it was different it didnt seem like anything that had meaning but everything does if you look hard enough at it and the woman jimmy stood he went to his wine rack and removed another bottle oh she came back he said with a vengeance chapter twenty thetwo men keptcaroline carr on the move never allowing her to stay in any one place for more than a week they used motels and shortterm rentals for a time they put her in a cabin in the woods upstate close to a small town where a former cop from the ninth a cousin of eddie graces had moved to become chief of police the cabin was occasionally used to stash witnesses or those who just needed to be hidden away for a time until a particular situation cooled off but caroline hated the quiet and the isolation it made her more nervous than she had been before for she was a creature of cities out in the country every sound signaled an approaching threat after three days in the cabin her nerves were shredded she was so frightened that she even called will at home thankfully his wife wasnt there but the call shook will his affair with the young woman had already come to a mutually agreedupon end but sometimes he would stand in his yard and wonder just how he had managed to screw everything up so badly he was constantly tempted to confess all to his wife he ev sis ä haen dreamed that he had done so and he would awake wondering why she was still sleeping beside him he felt sure that she must suspect something and was just waiting for the right moment to voice those suspicions nothing was ever said but her silence served only to increase his paranoia he was also becoming increasingly aware of the fact that he knew almost nothing about caroline carr she had sketched only the barest details of her life for him an upbringing in modesto california the death of her mother in a fire and her growing awareness of the two figures that were now pursuing her caroline had managed to stay ahead of them for so long but she had grown careless and become tired of running she had almost begun to welcome the thought that they might find her until that night when they tried to break into her apartment and her fear of them overcame any misplaced desire she might have held to end the chase she could not tell will why they had targeted her for she said that she did not know she knew only that they were a threat to her and they wanted to end her life when he asked her why she had not gone to the police she had laughed at him and the scorn in her voice had hurt him you think i didnt i went to them after my mother died i told them that the fire had been started deliberately but they were looking at a disturbed griefstricken girl and they didnt listen to a word i said after that i decided that the only thing for it was to look after myself what else could i do tell people i was being hunted for no reason by a man and woman that nobody had ever seen except me theyd have locked me up and then i would have been trapped i kept everything to myself until i met you i thought that you were different and will had held her and told her that he was different even as he wondered if he was being drawn into a frightened young womans elaborate fantasy but then he recalled the man with the gun and the pale woman with the dead eyes and he knew that there was some truth in all that caroline carr had told him he had begun to make informal inquiries about the tattoo on the late peter ackermans arm and eventually he was referred to a young rabbi by the name of epstein out in brooklyn heights over a glass of sweet kosher wine the rabbi had talked to him of angels of obscure books that as far as will could tell had been left out of the bible because they were even stranger than most of the stuff that had been left in and that was saying something as they spoke will began to realize that the rabbi was interrogating him as much as he was interrogating the rabbi so this is a sect a cult of some kind that peter ackerman became involved with said will perhaps said the rabbi then why does this man interest you so much im a cop i was there when he died no theres more to this the rabbi sat back in his chair and tugged on his short beard his eyes never left wills face eventually he seemed to reach a decision may i call you will will nodded his assent i am going to tell you something now will if i have guessed right then i would appreciate it if you would confirm that it is so will felt that he had no choice but to agree as he told jimmy later he had somehow become involved in an exchange of information this man was not alone said epstein there was a woman with him she was probably close to his own age is that correct will thought about lying but only for a second how did you know that epstein produced a copy of the symbol that had been found on peter ackermans body because of this they always hunt in pairs after all they are lovers the malehe pointed to the ackerman symbol before slipping another sheet of paper from behind itand the female will examined them both so this woman is part of the same cult no will i dont believe that this is a cult at all this is something much worse jimmy pressed his fingertips to his head he was thinking hard i left him to it epstein i had met the rabbi on a number of occasions and had helped him to track down his sons killers and in all that time he had never told me that he had known my father their names jimmy said i cant remember their names what names the names the rabbi told will the man and the woman they each had names like i told you the mans was an something but i cant remember the womans its like theyve been cut from my memory he was becoming frustrated and distracted it doesnt matter for now i said we can come back to it later they all had names said jimmy he sounded confused what it was something else the rabbi told will he said that they all had names he looked at me with something like despair what does that mean and i remembered my own grandfather in maine uttering those same words as alzheimers began snuffing out his memories like candle flames caught between fingers they all have names charlie he had said his face bright with a terrible urgency they all have names i didnt know what he meant not then it was only later when faced by creatures like kittim and brightwell that i began to learn it means that even the worst of things can be named i told jimmy and its important to know those names because with naming came an understanding of the thing and with understanding came the possibility of its destruction the need to protect caroline carr put huge additional pressure on them both at a time when the city was in turmoil and the demands upon them as police officers were seemingly unceasing in january the transit workers had gone out on strike all thirtyfour thousand of them crippling the transport network and wreaking havoc with the citys economy eventually mayor lindsay who had succeeded wagner in january had buckled what with the public complaining and michael quill the union leader taunting him from behind bars as a pipsqueak and a boy in short trousers by giving in to the transit workers though lindsaywho was a good mayor in so many ways let no one say otherwisehad opened the floodgates to an ongoing series of municipal strikes that would blight his administration the antidraft movement was starting to simmer a pot that had been threatening to come to a boil ever since four hundred activists had picketed the whitehall street induction center a couple of them even burning their draft cards it was still open season on dissenters though because most of the country was behind lbj even though us troop strength had escalated that year from to us casualties had tripled and us soldiers would be dead by the end of that year alone it would be another year before public opinion truly began to turn but for now activists were more concerned with civil rights than vietnam even as some were gradually beginning to realize that one fed into the other that the draft was unfair because most of those being called up by white draft boards were young black men who couldnt use college as an excuse to defer since they had no chance of going to college in the first place there were socalled new bohemians in the east village and marijuana and lsd were becoming the drugs of choice and will parker and jimmy gallagher both young men themselves and not unintelligent put on their uniforms each day and wondered when they would be asked to break the heads of kids their own age kids with whom at least in wills case they were largely in agreement everything was changing they could smell it in the air meanwhile jimmy was wishing that theyd never met caroline carr after she made the call to wills home jimmy had to drive up and take her back to brooklyn where she stayed in his mothers house in gerritsen beach close to the shell bank creek mrs gallagher owned a small onestory bungalow with a peaked roof and no yard that stood on melba court one of the warren of alphabetically ordered streets that had once served as a summer resort for irishamericans until gerritsen proved so popular that the houses were winterized so that people could live there yearround hiding her in gerritsen gave jimmy and occasionally will an excuse to see her because jimmy went down to visit his mother at least once every week in addition this part of gerritsen was small and tightly knit strangers would stand out and mrs gallagher had been warned that there were people looking for the girl it made jimmys mother more vigilant than she already was even at her most relaxed she put the average presidential bodyguard to shame when neighbors asked about the young woman who was staying with her mrs gallagher told them that she was a friend of a friend and had recently been bereaved a terrible shame what with the poor girl expecting she gave caroline a thin gold band that had once belonged to her own mother and told her to wear it on her ring finger her supposed bereavement kept even the worst snoopers at b r qnoopers aay and on the handful of occasions when caroline joined mrs gallagher for an evening at the ancient order of hibernians on gerritsen avenue she was treated with a gentleness and respect that made her feel both grateful and guilty in gerritsen caroline was content she was close to the sea and to the residentsonly kiddie beach perhaps she even saw herself playing there on the sand with her own child spending summer days eating at the concession stand listening to bands on the stage and watching the big parade on memorial day but if she did imagine such a future for herself and her unborn child she never spoke of it it might have been that she did not want to put a hex on her wish by speaking it aloud or maybeand this was what mrs gallagher told her son on the phone when he called one day to check on the girlshe saw no future at all shes a nice girl said mrs gallagher shes quiet and respectful she doesnt smoke and she doesnt drink and thats good but when i try to talk to her about what she plans to do once the baby is born she just smiles and changes the subject and its not a happy smile jimmy shes sad all the way through more than that shes frightened i hear her crying out in her sleep for gods sake jimmy why are these people after her she doesnt look like she could do harm to a fly but jimmy gallagher didnt have the answer and neither did will parker but then will had problems of his own his wife was pregnant again will watched her bloom as her term drew on even though shed suffered so many miscarriages in the past she told him that this one felt different from the others at home he would catch her humming softly to herself in the chair by the kitchen window her right hand resting on her belly she could stay that way for hours watching clouds scud by and the last leaves slowly spiraling from the trees in the garden as winter began to take hold it was almost funny he thought hed slept with caroline carr three or four times and shed become pregnant now his wife after so many miscarriages had managed to carry their unborn child for seven months she looked like she was actually glowing from within he had never seen her happier more content within herself he knew of the guilt that she had experienced after the earlier losses her body had betrayed her it would not do what it was supposed to do it was not strong enough now at last she had what she wanted what they had both wanted for so long and he was tormented by it he was having a second child with another woman and the knowledge of his betrayal was tearing him apart caroline had told him that she wanted nothing from him except that he keep her safe until the baby was born and after that but as with jimmy gallaghers mother she declined to answer the question well see she would say then turn away the child was due to be born one month before his wife was likely to give birth they would both be his children yet he knew that he would have to let one go that if he wanted his marriage to surviveand he did more than anything r qhan anyth elsethen he could not be a part of his first childs life he wasnt even sure that he could offer more than minimal financial support not on a cops salary despite carolines protestations that she didnt want his money and yet he didnt wish to let this child simply disappear he was despite his failings an honorable man he had never cheated on his wife before and he felt his guilt about sleeping with caroline as an ache so strong that it made him reel more than ever before he felt the urge to confess but it was jimmy gallagher who dissuaded him one evening after a posttour beer in cal s are you crazy jimmy said your wife is pregnant shes carrying the child that youve both wanted for years after all thats happened you may not get a second chance like this one apart from what the shock might do to her itll destroy her and itll destroy your marriage you live with what you did caroline says that she doesnt want you to be part of her childs life she doesnt want your money and she doesnt want your time most men in your situation would be happy with that if youre not then the loss is the price that you pay for your sins and for keeping your marriage together you hear me and will had agreed knowing that what jimmy said was true you have to understand something said jimmy your old man was decent and loyal and brave but he was also human hed made a mistake and he was trying to find a way to live with it to live with it and to do the right thing by all concerned but that just wasnt possible and the knowledge of it was ripping him apart one of the candles was sputtering as it neared the end of its life jimmy went to replace it then paused and said you want i can put the kitchen light on i shook my head and told him that the candles were fine thats what i thought he said somehow it doesnt seem right telling a story like this in a brightly lit room its just not that kind of story he lit a new candle then resumed his seat and continued his tale at epsteins request a meeting was arranged with caroline it took place in the back room of a jewish bakery in midwood jimmy and will drove caroline to the rendezvous under cover of night the bynow heavily pregnant young woman lying uncomfortably under some coats on the backseat of jimmys mothers eldorado the two men were not privy to what passed between the rabbi and caroline although they were together for over an hour when they were finished epstein spoke with will and asked him about the arrangements that had been made for carolines lyingin jimmy had never heard that phrase used before and was embarrassed when it had to be explained to him will gave epstein the name of the obgyn and the hospital in which caroline intended to deliver her baby epstein told him that alternative arrangements would be made through epsteins agencies a place was obtained for caroline in a small private clinic in gerritsen beach itself not far from ps on the other side of the creek from w r qcreek frohere she was staying jimmy had always known that the clinic was there and that it catered to those for whom money was no great object but he hadnt been aware of the fact that babies could be delivered behind its doors later he learned that it wasnt usually the case but an exception had been made at epsteins request jimmy had offered to lend will money to cover some of the medical costs and he had accepted on condition that a firm schedule of repayments was agreed upon with interest on the afternoon that carolines water broke both jimmy and will were on the eighttofour tour and they drove together to the hospital after mrs gallagher had left a message for jimmy at the station house asking him to call her as soon as he could will in turn phoned his wife intending to tell her that he and jimmy were helping jimmys mother with some stuff which had a grain of truth embedded in the substance of the lie but she was not home and the phone remained unanswered when they arrived at the clinic the receptionist said shes in eight but you cant go in theres a waiting room down the hall on the left with coffee and cookies which one of you is the father i am said will the words sounded strange in his mouth well well come get you when its over the contractions have started but she wont give birth for a couple of hours ill ask the doctor to talk to you and maybe he can give you a few minutes with her off you go she made a shooing movement with her hands a gesture she had presumably demonstrated to thousands of useless men who had insisted on trying to clutter up her wards when they had no business being around dont worry she added as will and jimmy resigned themselves to a long wait shes got company her friend the older lady she arrived with her and her sister went in just a few minutes ago both men stopped sister said will yeah her sister the nurse spotted the look on wills face and instantly became defensive she had id a drivers license same name carr but will and jimmy were already moving heading right not left hey i told you you cant go down there shouted the receptionist when they ignored her she reached for a phone and called security the door to room was closed when they reached it and the corridor was empty they knocked but there was no reply as jimmy reached for the handle his mother appeared from around the corner what are you doing she said then she saw the guns no i just went to the bathroom i the door was locked from the inside jimmy stepped back and kicked at it twice before the lock shattered and the door flew open exposing them to a blast of cool air caroline carr lay on a raised gurney her he r qrney herad and back supported by pillows the front of her gown was drenched with red but she was still alive the room was cold because the window was open get a doctor said will but jimmy was already shouting for help will went to caroline and tried to hold her but she was starting to spasm he saw the wounds to her stomach and chest a blade he thought someone used a blade on her and on the child no not just someone the woman the one who had watched her lover die beneath the wheels of a truck carolines eyes turned to him her hand gripped his shirt staining it with her blood and then there were doctors and nurses he was pulled away from her forced out of the room and as the door closed he saw her fall back against the pillows and lie still and he knew that she was dying but the child survived they cut it from her as she died the blade had missed its head by a quarter of an inch and while they delivered it will and jimmy went hunting for the woman who had killed caroline carr they heard the sound of the car as soon as they exited the clinic and seconds later a black buick shot from the lot to their left and prepared to turn onto gerritsen avenue a streetlight caught the face of the woman as she glanced toward them it was will who reacted first firing three shots as the woman responded to their presence turning left instead of right so that she would not have to cross in front of them the first shot took out the drivers window and the second and third hit the door the buick sped away as will fired a fourth time running behind it as jimmy raced for their own car then as will watched the buick seemed to wobble on its axles then began to drift to the right it struck the curb outside the lutheran church then mounted it and came to a rest against the railings of the churchyard will continued running now jimmy was at his side all thoughts of their own vehicle abandoned when the other car had come to a stop as they drew nearer the drivers door opened and the woman stumbled out clearly injured she glanced back at them a knife in her hand will didnt hesitate he wanted her dead he fired again the bullet struck the door but by then the woman was already moving abandoning the car her left foot dragging she dived left onto bartlett her pursuers closing the distance rapidly as they turned the corner she seemed frozen beneath a streetlight her head turned her mouth open will aimed but even injured she was too fast she stumbled to her right down a narrow alley called canton court we have her said jimmy thats a dead end theres just the creek down there they paused as they reached canton then exchanged a look and nodded their weapons held high they entered the dark space between two cottages that led to the creek the woman was standing with her back to the creek bank caught in the moonlight the knife was still held in her hand her coat was slightly too long for her and the sleeves hung over the second knuckles of her fingers but not so far as to obscure the blade put it down said jimmy but he was not talki r qas not tang to her not yet instead while his eyes remained fixed on the woman he laid the palm of his hand on the warm barrel of wills revolver gently forcing it down dont do it will just dont the woman twisted the blade and jimmy thought that he could still see traces of caroline carrs blood on it its over she said her voice was surprisingly soft and sweet but her eyes were twin shards of obsidian in the pallor of her face thats right said jimmy now drop the knife it doesnt matter what you do to me said the woman i am beyond your law she dropped the knife but at the same time her left hand moved the sleeve of her coat pulling back to reveal the little pistol concealed by its folds it was jimmy who killed her he hit her twice before she could get a shot off she remained standing for a second then tumbled backward into the cold waters of the shell bank creek she was never identified the receptionist at the hospital confirmed that she was the same woman who had claimed to be caroline carrs sister a false virginia drivers license in the name of ann carr was found in her coat pocket along with a small quantity of cash her fingerprints were not on file anywhere and nobody came forward to identify her even after her picture appeared on news shows and in the papers but that came later for now there were questions to be asked and to be answered more cops came they flooded the clinic they sealed off bartlett they dealt with reporters with curious onlookers with distressed patients and their relatives while they did so a group of people met in a room at the back of the hospital they included the hospital director the doctor and midwife who had been monitoring caroline carr the nypds deputy commissioner for legal affairs and a small quiet man in his early forties rabbi epstein will parker and jimmy gallagher had been instructed to wait outside and they sat together on hard plastic chairs not speaking only one person except for jimmy had expressed her sorrow to will at what had occurred it was the receptionist she knelt before him while he waited and took his hand im so sorry she said we all are he nodded dumbly i dont know if she began then stopped no i know it wont help but maybe you might like to see your son she led him to a glasswalled room and she pointed out the tiny child who lay sleeping between two others thats him she said thats your boy they were called into the meeting room minutes later those present were introduced to them all except for one man in a su r q man in ait who had followed the two cops into the room and was now watching will carefully epstein leaned toward will and whispered im sorry will did not reply it was the deputy commissioner frank mancuso who formally broke the silence they tell me youre the father he said to will i am what a mess said mancuso with feeling we need to get the story straight said mancuso are you two listening will and jimmy nodded in unison the child died said mancuso what said will the child died it lived for a couple of hours but it seems that there was some damage caused by the knife wound to the womb it died as ofhe checked his watchtwo minutes ago what are you talking about said will i just saw him and now hes dead will tried to leave but epstein grabbed his arm wait mr parker your child is alive and well but as of now only the people in this room know it already hes being taken away where somewhere safe why hes my son i want to know where he is think mr parker said epstein for a moment just think will was silent for a time when he spoke he said you believe that someone is going to come after the child we believe that its a possibility they cant know that he survived but theyre dead the man and the woman i saw them both die epstein looked away there may be others he said and even amid his grief and confusion the cop in will wondered what epstein was trying to hide what others who are these people were trying to find that out said epstein it will take time right and in the meantime what happens to my son eventually hell be placed with a family said mancuso thats all you need to know no said will i r qll ldqut isnt hes my son mancuso bared his teeth youre not listening officer parker you dont have a son and if you dont walk away from this you wont have a career either you have to let him go said epstein gently if you love him as a son then you have to let him go will looked at the unknown man standing by the wall who are you will asked where do you fit into all of this the man didnt answer and he didnt flinch under the glare of wills anger hes a friend said epstein thats enough for now mancuso spoke again are we all singing from the same hymn sheet officer youd better tell us now i wont be so goodnatured if this matter raises its head outside these four walls will swallowed hard yes he said i understand yes sir said mancuso yes sir repeated will and you mancuso turned his attention to jimmy gallagher im with him said jimmy whatever he says goes glances were exchanged it was over go home said mancuso to will go home to your wife and when they passed the glasswalled room again the cot was already empty and the receptionists face was creased with grief as they passed her desk already the coverup had begun without words to convey her sympathy for a man who had in one night lost his child and the mother of his child she could only shake her head and watch as he disappeared into the night when will at last returned home elaine was waiting for him where have you been her eyes were swollen he could tell that she had been crying for hours something came up he said a girl died i dont care it was a scream not a shout he had never heard her utter such a sound before those three words seemed to contain more pain and anguish than he had ever thought could be contained inside the woman he loved then she repeated the words this time softly forcing each one out expelling them like phlegm from her mouth i dont care you werent here you werent here when i needed you he knelt down before her and took her hands in his what he said what is it i had to go to the clinic today why something was wrong i felt it inside he tightened his grip on her but she would not could not look up at him our babys dead she said softly im carrying a dead baby he held her then and waited for her to cry but she had no more tears left to shed she simply lay against him silent and lost in her grief he could see his reflection in the mirror on the wall behind her and he closed his eyes so he would not have to look at himself will led his wife to the bedroom and helped her to get between the sheets the doctors at the clinic had given her some pills and he made her take two they wanted to induce it she said as the drugs took hold they wanted to take our baby away but i wouldnt let them i wanted to keep it for as long as i could he nodded but now he could not speak his own tears began to fall his wife reached up and wiped them away with her thumb he sat beside her until she fell asleep then stared at the wall for two hours her hand in his until slowly carefully he released it and let it fall to the sheets she stirred slightly but she did not wake he went downstairs and called the number that epstein had given him when they first met a woman answered sleepily and when he asked for the rabbi she told him that he was in bed he had a long night she explained i know he replied i was there wake him tell him its will parker the woman clearly recognized the name she put the phone down and will heard her walk away five minutes passed and then he heard epsteins voice mr parker i should have told you at the hospital its not good for us to stay in contact this way i need to see you thats not possible whats done is done we must let the dead rest my wife is carrying a dead baby said will he almost vomited the words out what you heard me our child is dead in the womb they think the umbilical cord got wound around its throat somehow its dead they told her yesterday theyre going to induce labor and remove it im sorry said epstein i dont want your pity said will i want my son epstein was silent what youre suggesting isnt will cut him off dont tell me that you make this happen you go to your friend mr quiet in his nice suit and you tell him what i want otherwise i swear ill make so much noise that your ears will bleed suddenly the energy began to leach from his body he wanted to crawl into bed and hold his wife hold his wife and their dead child look you told me that the boy would have to be taken care of i can take care of him hide him with me hide him in plain sight please he heard epstein sigh i will talk to our friends he said at last give me the name of the doctor who is looking after your wife will did so the number was in the address book beside the telephone where is your wife now shes asleep upstairs she took some pills ill call you in one hour said epstein and he hung up one hour and five minutes later the phone rang will who had been sitting on the floor beside it picked it up before it had a chance to ring a second time when your wife wakes up mr parker you must tell her the truth said epstein ask her to forgive you then tell her what you propose will did not sleep that night instead he mourned for caroline carr and when dawn broke he put his grief for her aside and prepared for what he felt certain would be the death of his marriage he called me that morning said jimmy he told me what he intended to do he was prepared to gamble everything on the possibility of holding on to the boy his career his marriage the happiness even the sanity of his wife he was about to pour some more wine into his glass then stopped i cant drink any more he said the wine looks like blood he pushed the bottle and the glass away were nearly done anyway for now ill finish this part and then i have to sleep we can talk again tomorrow if you want you can spend the night theres a guest room i opened my mouth to object but he raised his hand believe me when ive finished tonight youll have enough to think about youll be grateful that ive stopped he leaned forward his hands cupped before him and i saw that they were trembling so your old man was waiting at your mother rsquo r qmother rss bedside when she woke i think sometimes of what my father and mother endured that day i wonder if there was a kind of madness to his actions spurred on by his fear that he seemed destined to lose two children one to death and the other to an anonymous existence surrounded by those who were not related by blood to him he must have known as he stood above my mother debating whether to wake her or let her sleep on for a time delaying the moment of confession that it would sunder relations with her forever he was about to inflict twin wounds upon her the pain of his betrayal and the perhaps greater agony of learning that he had succeeded in doing with another what she had failed to do for him she was carrying a dead child in her womb while her husband had only hours before looked upon his own son born of a dead mother he loved his wife and she loved him and he was now going to hurt her so badly that she would never fully recover he did not tell anyone of what transpired between them not even jimmy gallagher all i know is that my mother left him for a time and fled to maine a precursor to the more permanent flight that would occur after my fathers death and a distant echo of my own actions after my wife and child were taken from me she was not my birth mother and i understand now the reasons for the distance there was between us even unto her death but we were more similar than either of us could have imagined she took me north after the pearl river killings and her father my beloved grandfather became a guiding force in my life but my mother also assumed a greater role as i came of age i think sometimes that only after my father died did she truly find it in her heart to forgive him and perhaps to forgive me the circumstances of my birth slowly we drew closer to each other she taught me the names of trees and plants and birds for this was her place this northern state and although i did not fully appreciate then the knowledge that she was trying to impart i think i understood the reasons for her wanting to communicate it to me we were both grieving but she would not allow me to be lost to it and so each day we would walk together for a time regardless of the weather and sometimes we would talk and sometimes we would not but it was enough that we were together and we were alive during those years i became hers and now every time i name to myself a tree or a flower or a tiny creeping thing it is a small act of remembrance for her elaine parker called her husband after a week had passed and they spoke for an hour will was granted unpaid leave authorized to the puzzlement of some at the precinct by the deputy commissioner for legal affairs frank mancuso will went north to join his wife and when they returned to new york they did so with a child and a tale of a difficult premature birth they named the boy charlie after his fathers uncle charles edward parker who had died at monte cassino the secret friends kept their distance and it was many years before will heard from any of them again and when they did make contact it was epstein who was sent epstein who told him that the thing they had long feared was upon them once more the lovers had returned chapter twentyone mickey wallace felt as though the mist had followed him from maine tendrils of it drifted past his face reacting to each movement of his body like a living thing slowly assuming new shapes before slipping away altogether as though the darkness were weaving itself into being around him enfolding him in its embrace as he stood before the small house on hobart street in bay ridge bay ridge was almost a suburb of brooklyn a neighborhood unto itself originally it had consisted mostly of norwegians who lived there when it was known as yellow hook in the nineteenth century and greeks with some irish thrown in as there always were but the opening of the verrazanonarrows bridge in the s had changed that makeup as people began to move out to staten island and by the early s bay ridge was becoming progressively more middle eastern the bridge dominated the southern end of the area although mickey had always felt that it looked more real by night than by day the lights seemed to give it substance during the day by contrast it looked like a painted backdrop a gray mass too big for the buildings and streets below an unreal thing hobart street lay between marine avenue and shore road where a series of benches overlooked shore road park a steep treelined slope leading down to the belt parkway and the waters of the narrows at first glance hobart seemed to consist only of apartment buildings but on one side was a small row of brownstone onefamily homes each separated from its neighbor by a driveway only bore the marks of abandonment and neglect the presence of the mist reminded mickey of what he had experienced out at scarborough now once again he was standing before a house that he believed to be empty this was not his neighborhood not even his city yet he did not feel out of place here after all it was a crucial element in the story that he had followed for so long the story that he was now going to set down in print he had stood here before over the years the first time was after charlie parkers wife and child had been found their blood still fresh on the walls and floor the second time was after parker had found the traveling man when the reporters had an ending to their story and sought to remind viewers and readers of the beginning lights shone upon the walls and windows and neighbors came onto the street to watch their proximity to the action a good indication of their willingness to talk of their desire to be interviewed about what had happened there even those who were not residents at the time had opinions for ignorance was never an obstacle to a good sound bite but that was a long time ago mickey wondered how many people even remembered what had taken place behind those walls then figured that anyone who had lived in this place when the murders were committed and who continued to live here now would find it hard to erase the memory of them in a way the house challenged them to forget its past it was the only unoccupied residence on the street and its exterior spoke eloquently of its emptiness for those who knew of its history the simple sight of it its very otherness would be enough to evoke memories for them there would always be blood on its walls mickeys search of the property records indicated that there had been three different occupants in the years since the killings and the house was currently owned by the bank that had taken possession of it after the most recent residents had defaulted on their payments he found it hard to imagine why anyone would want to live in a place that had known such violence true the house had probably initially been sold for far less than its market value and the cleaners employed to scrub every visib randd wle trace of the killings from within would have done their job well but mickey felt certain that something must have lingered some trace of the agonies that had been endured there physical yes there would be dried blood between the cracks in the floor he had been told that one of susan parkers fingernails had not been recovered from the scene initially it was thought that her killer had taken it as a souvenir but now it was believed that it had broken as she scraped at the boards and had slipped between them despite repeated searches it had not been found it was probably still down there somewhere lying amid dust and wood chips and lost coins but it was not the physical aspects that interested mickey he had been to many murder sites and had grown attuned to their atmosphere there were some places that had one not known in advance of the killings that had occurred in them might well have seemed normal and undisturbed flowers grew in yards beneath which children had once been buried a little girls playroom painted in bright oranges and yellows banished all memories of the old woman who had died there smothered during a botched burglary when this was still her bedroom couples made love in rooms where husbands had beaten wives to death and women had stabbed errant lovers while they slept such sites were not tainted by the violence to which they had played host but there were other gardens and other houses that would never be the same after blood was spilled upon them people sensed that something was wrong as soon as they set foot on the property it didnt matter that the house was clean that the yard was well tended that the door was freshly painted instead an echo remained like the slow fading of a final cry and it triggered an atavistic response sometimes the echo was so pronounced that even the demolition of the premises and the construction of a replacement markedly different from its predecessor was not enough to counter the malign influences that remained mickey had visited a condo in long island built on the site of a house that had burned down with five children and their mother inside a fire set by the father of two of the children the old lady who lived down the street told him that on the night that they died the firemen could hear the children crying for help but the heat of the flames was too intense and they were not able to rescue them the newly built condo had smelled of smoke mickey recalled smoke and charred meat nobody who lived there stayed longer than six months on the day that he had inspected it all of the apartments were available for rent perhaps that was why the parker house still stood even to have knocked it down would have made no difference the blood had seeped through the house and into the soil beneath and the air was filled with the sound of screams stifled by a gag mickey had never been inside hobart he had seen pictures of the interior though he had prints of them in his possession as he stood at the gate tyrrell had provided them dropping them off at the hotel earlier that day along with a terse note apologizing for some of the things that he had said in the course of their meeting mickey didnt know how tyrrell had come by them he figured that tyrrell must have retained his own private file on charlie parker after he left the department mickey was pretty sure that was illegal but he wasnt about to complain hed looked at the photos in his hotel room and even after all that hed seen as a reporter and his own knowledge of the details of the parker killings they had still shaken him there was so much blood mickey had approached the realtor appointed by the ba rhadm i dont think that it would be appropriate for me to show you that property sir she had said may i ask why i think you know why i dont believe youre serious about your inquiry what does that mean it means that were aware of who you are and of what youre doing i dont think admitting you to the hobart street property would be helpful to any future sale mickey had hung up he should have known better than to use his real name but he hadnt expected parker to obstruct him in that way assuming it was parker who had made the call to the realtor he remembered tyrrells stated belief that someone was protecting parker if that was true then a person or persons as yet unknown might have alerted the realtor to what mickey was doing it didnt matter he wasnt above bending the law a little to suit his own purposes and breaking into the old parker house didnt strike him as a felony no matter what a judge might say he was pretty certain that the house wouldnt have an alarm it had been vacant for too long and he didnt figure that a realtor would want to be disturbed in the dead of night because an alarm was ringing in an unoccupied property he checked to make sure that the street was quiet then made his way up the drive to the gate at the side of the house a grassless yard beyond he tried the gate it didnt move for a moment he thought it might be locked but he could see no way that it could be unless it had been welded shut simultaneously he pushed down on the handle and pressed the weight of his body against the gate he felt it give the metal of the handle scraping against the concrete pillar and then it opened he stepped through and closed it behind him then turned the corner of the house so that he was hidden from view the back door had two locks but the wood was damp and rotting he tested it with his fingernails and pieces of it fell to the ground he took the crowbar from beneath his coat and began working at the wood within minutes he had made a gap big enough to gain access to the top lock he inserted the crowbar as far as it would go then pushed sideways and up there was a cracking sound from inside and the lock broke he moved on to the second lock the frame quickly splintered and the bolt broke through the wood mickey stood on the step and stared into the kitchen this was where it had happened this was the place in which parkerparker the revenger parker the hunter parker the executionerhad been born before the deaths of his wife and daughter he had been just another face on the street a cop but not a very good one a father and a husband and not much good in those roles either a man who drank somenot enough to qualify as an alcoholic not yet but enough that in years to come he might find himself starting on the booze a little earlier each day until at last it became a way to start the day instead of finishing it a drifter a being without purpose then on a december night the creature that became known as the traveling ma rcrey un entered this place and took the lives of the woman and child within while the man who should have protected them sat on a bar stool feeling sorry for himself those deaths had given him purpose at first it was revenge but that gave way to something deeper something more curious the desire for revenge alone would have destroyed him eating away at him like a cancer so that even when he found the release for which he had yearned the disease would already have colonized his soul slowly blackening his humanity until shriveled and rotten it was lost forever no parker had found a greater purpose he was a man who could not easily turn away from the sufferings of others for he found its twin deep within himself he was tormented by empathy more than that he had become a magnet for evil or perhaps it would be truer to say that a shard of evil deep within himself resonated in the presence of a greater foulness and drew him to it and it to him all of this born in blood mickey closed the door flicked on his flashlight and walked through the kitchen looking neither right nor left taking in nothing of what he saw there he would conclude his visit in that room just as the traveling man had done he wanted to follow the killers trail to view this house as the killer had viewed it and as parker had seen it on the night that he returned home to find what was left of his wife and child the traveling man had come in through the front door there was no sign of forced entry the hallway was now empty mickey compared it with the first of the photographs that he had brought with him he had ordered them carefully numbering them on the back in case he dropped them the first showed the hallway as it had once been a bookcase on the right and a coatrack on the floor was a mahogany flower stand and beside it a broken flowerpot and a plant of some kind its roots exposed behind the plant the first of the stairs leading up to the second floor three bedrooms there one no larger than a storage room and a single small bathroom mickey didnt want to go up there just yet jennifer parker three years old had been asleep on the couch in the living room when the killer entered she had a weak heart and it spared her the agony of what was to come between the time that the killer entered and the final display of the bodies she had suffered a massive release of epinephrine into her system resulting in ventricular fibrillation of the heart in other words jennifer parker had died of fright her mother had not been so lucky there had been a struggle probably near the kitchen she had managed to get away from her attacker but only momentarily he had caught up with her in the hall and had stunned her by banging her face against the wall mickey moved on to the next photograph a smear of blood on the wall to his left he found what he believed to be the spot and ran his fingers across it then he knelt down and examined the floorboards trailing his hand along the wood just as susan parker had done as she was dragged back to the kitchen the hallway had been only partially carpeted leaving the edges of the boards exposed on either side it was here somewhere that susan had lost her fingernail was her daughter dead by then or had the sight of her mother dazed and bleeding triggered the attack that led to jennifers death maybe she had fought to save her mother yes that was probably it mickey thought already piecing together the most favorable narrative the most gripping version he could find of the story there had been rope marks on the childs wrists and ankles indicating that she had been restrained at some point she woke realized what was happening t roin coried to scream to fight a blow was struck knocking her to the ground just such an injury had been recorded in the autopsy once her mother had been subdued the killer restrained the daughter in turn but by then the girl was already dying mickey glanced into the living room now furnished only with dust and discarded paper and dead insects another photograph this time of the couch there was a doll lying on it half obscured by a blanket mickey moved on trying to visualize the scene as parker had experienced it blood on the walls and on the floor the kitchen door almost closed the house cold he took a deep breath and turned to the final photograph susan parker on a pine chair her arms tied behind her back her feet bound separately to the front legs her head down her face obscured by her hair so that the damage to the face and eyes was not visible not from this angle her daughter lay across her mothers thighs not so much blood on her her throat had been cut as was her mothers but by then jennifer was already dead light shone through what seemed at first glance to be a thin cloak laid across susan parkers arms but which mickey knew to be her own skin pulled back to complete the macabre pietà with the image clear in his head mickey opened the kitchen door ready to impose this old vision of hell on the empty room except now the room was not empty the back door was half open and there was a figure in the shadows behind it watching him mickey stumbled back in shock his hand instinctively raised to his heart jesus he said what the figure moved forward and was caught by the moonlight wait a minute said mickey as unbeknownst to him the final sands of his life began slipping through his fingers i know you chapter twentytwo jimmy had moved on to coffee enlivened by a glass of brandy i stuck with coffee alone but i barely touched it i tried to pinpoint how i was feeling but at first there was only a numbness that gradually gave way to a kind of sadness and loneliness i thought of all that my parents had endured of my fathers lies and betrayal and my mothers pain for now my only regret was that they were no longer there for me that i could not go to them and tell them that i understood that it was all okay had they lived i wondered when or if they would together have told me of the circumstances of my birth and i recognized that coming from them the details would have been more difficult to bear and my reactions would have been more extreme sitting in jimmy gallaghers candlelit kitchen watching his winestained lips move i felt that i was listening to the story of another mans life one with whom i shared certain qualities but who was ultimately distant from me with each word that he spoke jimmy seemed to relax a little more but he also appeared to be growing older although i knew it was only a trick of the light he had lived to be a repository of secrets now as they seeped from him at last so some of his life force went with them he sipped his brandy like i said theres not mu srsqch more to tell not much more to tell only the story of my fathers final day and the blood that he shed and the reasons why not much more to tell only everything jimmy and will kept their distance from each other after will and elaine returned from maine with their new child and they spoke to no one else of what they knew then one december night jimmy and will got drunk together at chumleys and the white horse and will thanked jimmy for all that he had done for his loyalty and his friendship and for killing the woman who had taken carolines life you think of her asked jimmy caroline yes sometimes more than sometimes did you love her i dont know if i didnt then i do now does that make any sense as much as anything does you ever visit the grave just a couple of times since the funeral jimmy remembered the funeral in a quiet corner of bayside cemetery caroline had told will that she didnt have much time for organized religion her folks had been protestants of some stripe so they found a minister who said the right things as she and the child were laid in the ground will jimmy and the rabbi epstein were the only other people in attendance epstein had told them that the male infant had come from one of the hospitals in the city his mother had been a junkie and the kid hadnt lived for more than a couple of hours after he was born the mother didnt care that her child was dead or if she did she didnt show it she would later jimmy believed he couldnt countenance the possibility that a woman no matter how sick or high she was could remain untroubled by the death of her child elaines own labor had been discreetly induced while she was in maine there had been no formal burial after she had made the decision to stay with will and to protect the child cut from caroline carr epstein had spoken with her over the phone and had made her understand how important it was that everyone believed carolines child was elaines own she had been given time to mourn her own baby to cradle the small dead thing in her arms and then it was taken from her id go more often but it upsets elaine said will ill bet it does thought jimmy he didnt know how the marriage had survived and from the hints will had dropped it wasnt entirely certain that it would survive still jimmys respect for elaine parker had only grown in the aftermath of what had occurred he couldnt even begin to imagine what she felt as she looked at her husband and at the child she was raising as her own he wondered if she could yet even distinguish hatred from love i always bring two bunches of flowers continued will one fo rfron dr caroline and one for the kid they buried with her epstein said it was important it had to look like i was mourning both of them just in case in case what in case someone is watching said will theyre gone said jimmy you saw them both die epstein thinks there might be others worse than that he stopped talking what could be worse asked jimmy that somehow they might come back what does that mean come back doesnt matter the rabbis fantasies jesus fantasies is right jimmy raised his hand for another round of drinks and the woman the one i shot what did they do with her he asked they burned her body and scattered the ashes you know id like to have taken a minute with her before she died so you could have asked her why said jimmy yes she wouldnt have told you anything i could see it in her eyes and go on itll sound strange will laughed after all that weve been through could anything sound strange i suppose not so she wasnt afraid to die she was a fanatic fanatics are too crazy to be afraid no it was more than that i thought just before i fired that she smiled at me as if it didnt matter if i killed her or not and that stuff about being beyond your law jesus she gave me the creeps she was sure that shed done what she came to do as far as she was concerned caroline was dead and so was her baby jimmy frowned maybe he said but he didnt sound like he believed it and he wondered at what epstein had told will about how they might come back but he couldnt figure out what that might mean and will wouldnt tell him in the years that followed they rarely d r rsquoiscussed the subject epstein did not contact either will or jimmy although will thought that he had sometimes seen the rabbi when will took his family into the city to shop or to see a movie or a show epstein never acknowledged his presence on those occasions and will did not approach him but he had the sense that epstein both in person and through others was keeping an eye on will his wife and most especially his son only very reluctantly would will tell jimmy of the state of his relationship with his wife it had never recovered from his betrayal and he knew that it never would yet at least they were still together but there were times when his wife would be distant from him both emotionally and physically for weeks on end she struggled too with their son or as she would throw at will when her rage and hurt got the upper hand your son but slowly that began to change for the boy knew no mother but her will thought that the turning point came when charlie then eight years old was struck by a car while learning to ride his new bike around the neighborhood elaine was in the yard when it happened saw the car strike the bike and the boy fly into the air and land hard upon the road as she ran she heard him calling for her not for his father to whom he seemed naturally to turn for so many things but for her his left arm was badly brokenshe could see that as soon as she reached himand there was blood pouring from a wound in his scalp he was struggling to remain conscious and something told her that it was important for him to stay with her that he should not close his eyes she called his name over and over as she took a coat from the driver of the car and gently placed it under the boys head she was crying and he saw that she was crying mommy he said softly mommy im sorry no she replied im sorry it wasnt your fault it was never your fault and she stayed with him kneeling over him whispering his name the palm of her hand caressing his face and she sat beside him in the ambulance and she sat outside the theater as they operated on him to stitch his scalp and set his arm and hers was the first face he saw when he came to after that things were better between them my father told you all this no said jimmy she told me after he died she said you were all that she had left of him but that wasnt why she loved you she loved you because you were her child she was the only mother you knew and you were the only son she had she said that shed sometimes forgotten that or didnt want to believe it but as time went by she realized the truth of it he got up to go to the bathroom i remained seated thinking of my mother in her final days lying transformed in her hospital bed so altered by the disease that i hadnt recognized her when id first entered her room believing instead that the nurse had made some mistake when she directed me down the corridor but then she made some small gesture in her sleep a raising of her right hand and even in her illness the grace of it was familiar to me and in that moment i knew it was her in the days that followed as i waited for her to die she had only a few hours of lucidity her voice was almost gone and it seemed to pain her to speak so i rmed monstead i read to her from my college texts poetry short stories snippets from the newspaper that i knew would interest her her father would come over from scarborough and we would talk to each other as she dozed between us did she consider as she felt the darkness clouding her consciousness like ink through water telling me all that she had withheld from me i am sure that she did but i understand now why she did not i think that she may also have warned my grandfather to say nothing because she believed that if i knew the truth then i might begin digging and if i began digging i would draw them to me jimmy went to the bathroom when he returned i saw that he had splashed water on his face but he had not dried it properly and the drops looked like tears on that last night he began they were in cals together jimmy and will celebrating jimmys birthday some things had changed in the ninth but they were still the same in many ways there were galleries where once there had been dive bars and deserted buildings and shaky underground movies were being shown in empty storefronts that were now functioning as avantgarde theaters a lot of the old places were still there although their time too would soon come to an end some of them with shadows cast over the memories of them at second and fifth the binibon was still serving greasy chicken salad but now people looked at the binibon and recalled how in one of its customers had been jack henry abbott an excon who had been championed by norman mailer who had worked for his release one night abbott got into an argument with a waiter asked him to step outside and then stabbed him to death jimmy and will had been among those cleaning up the aftermath the two men like the precinct that they worked both changed yet still the same altered in aspect but still in uniform they had never made sergeant and they never would that was the price they had paid for what had happened on the night caroline carr died they were still good cops though one of the small cadre of city transit and housing officers who did more than the minimum fighting the general strain of apathy that had infected the force in part a consequence of a widespread belief that the suits and brass at the puzzle palace as one police plaza was known to the rank and file were out to get them it wasnt entirely untrue either make too many drug busts and you attracted the attention of your superiors for all the wrong reasons make too many arrests and because of the overtime payments required to process them and see them through court you were accused of taking money from the pockets of other cops best to keep your head down until you could cash out at twenty the result was that there were now fewer and fewer older cops to act as mentors to the new recruits by virtue of their years on the force jimmy and will practically qualified as village elders they had become part of the plainclothes anticrime unit a dangerous assignment that involved patrolling highcrime areas waiting for signs that something was about to go off usually a gun for the first time both were talking seriously about cashing out somehow they had found a quiet corner away from the rest cut off by a raucous throng of men and women in business suits celebrating an office promotion after that night will parker would be dead and jimmy gallagher would never set foot in cal s again after ranthro wills death he found that he could not remember the good times that he had enjoyed there they were gone excised from his memory instead there was only will with a cold one at his elbow his hand raised to make a point to jimmy that would remain forever unspoken his expression changing as he looked over jimmys shoulder and saw who had entered the bar jimmy had turned around to see what he was looking at but by then epstein was beside them and jimmy knew that something was very wrong you have to go home said epstein to will he was smiling but his words gave the lie to his smile and he did not look at will as he spoke to a casual observer he would have appeared only to be examining the bottles behind the bar choosing his poison before he joined the company he wore a white raincoat buttoned to the neck and on his head was a brown hat with a red feather in the band he had aged greatly since jimmy had last seen him at caroline carrs funeral whats wrong asked will whats happened not here said epstein as he was jostled by perrson the big swede who was the linchpin of the cabaret unit it was a thursday night and cal s was buzzing perrson who stood taller than anyone else in the bar was handing shots of booze over the heads of those behind him sometimes baptizing them a little along the way god bless you my son he said as someone protested he guffawed at his own joke then recognized jimmy hey its the birthday boy but jimmy was already moving past him following another man and perrson thought that it might have been will parker but later when questioned he would claim to have been mistaken or confused about the time it might have been later when he saw jimmy and will could not have been with him because will would have been on his way back to pearl river it was cold outside the three men kept their hands thrust deep into their pockets as they walked away from cals from the precinct house from familiar faces and speculative glances they did not stop until they came to the corner of st marks you remember franklin said epstein he was the director of the gerritsen clinic he retired two years ago will nodded he recalled the worriedlooking man in the small office part of a conspiracy of silence that he still did not fully understand he was killed at his home last night someone cut him badly to make him talk before he died why do you think that its something to do with us said will a neighbor saw a male and a female leave the house shortly after eleven they were both young he said older teenagers at most they were driving a red ford this morning the offices of dr anton bergman in pearl river were burgled dr bergman i believe looks after the health of your family a red ford was seen parked close by it had outofstate plates alabama dr bergman and his secretary are still trying to confirm what was removed but th rh utere drug cabinets were intact only the patient records were rifled your familys records are among those that are missing somehow theyve made the connection we didnt hide our tracks as well as we thought will looked pale but still he tried to argue that doesnt make any sense who are these kids it took a moment for epstein to answer theyre the same ones who came for caroline carr sixteen years ago he said no it was jimmy gallagher uhuh theyre dead one of them got crushed by a truck and i shot the other i watched them pull her body from the creek and even if they had lived theyd be in their forties or fifties by now they wouldnt be children epstein turned on him theyre not children theyre he composed himself something is inside each of them something much older these things dont die they cant die they move from host to host if the host dies then they find another they are reborn over and over again youre crazy said jimmy youre out of your mind he turned to his partner for support but none came instead will looked frightened aw jesus you dont believe this do you said jimmy they cant be the same ones its just not possible it doesnt matter said will theyre here whoever they are franklin would have told them about how the death of the baby was covered up i have a boy the same age as the one who was supposed to have died they made the connection and the medical records will confirm it hes right i have to go home well have people looking for them too said epstein ive made some calls were moving as fast as we can but ill go with you said jimmy no go back to cal s why will gripped jimmys arms and looked him in the face because i have to end this he said do you understand i dont want you to be caught up in it you have to stay clean i need you to be clean then he seemed to remember something your nephew he said maries boy hes still with the orangetown cops isnt he yeah hes out there i dont think hes on duty until later though can you call him just ask him to go to the house and stay with elaine and charlie for a while dont tell him why just make up some excuse about an old case maybe an excon with a grudge will you do that will he do that hell do it said jimmy epstein handed will a set of car keys take my car he said pointing to an old chrysler parked nearby will nodded his thanks then began to stride away but epstein reached for his arm holding him back dont try to kill them said epstein not unless you have no other choice jimmy saw will nod but his eyes were far away then and there jimmy knew what will intended to do epstein walked away in the direction of the subway jimmy made the call to his nephew from a phone booth afterward he went back to cals where he drank and made small talk his mind detached from the actions of his body his mouth moving of its own volition and he stayed there until word came that will parker had shot two kids up in pearl river and he had been found in the locker room of the ninth tears streaming down his face waiting for them to come for him and when they asked him why he had driven all the way back to the city he could tell them only that he wanted to be among his own chapter twentythree he could have goneto his fellow cops of course but what would he have told them that two kids were coming to kill his son that those two kids could be hosts for other entities malign spirits who had already killed the boys mother and had now returned to murder her child perhaps he might have concocted a lie some tale of how they had threatened his family or he could have fed them the information that a car resembling the one they were driving had been seen close to the directors office after his death and a young man and a young woman had been glimpsed leaving his house on the night that he was killed all of that might well have been enough to hold them assuming they were found but he didnt want them merely to be held he wanted them gone forever the rabbis warning against killing them had not gone unheeded instead it had broken something inside him he had thought that he could cope with anythingmurder loss a child suffocated beneath a pile of coatsbut now he was no longer certain that this was true he did not want to believe what the rabbi had told him because to do so would be to throw aside all of the certainties he felt about the world he could accept that somebody some agency as yet unknown wanted his son dead it was an appalling purpose and one that he could not understand but he could deal with it as long as its agents were human after all there was no proof that what the rabbi believed was actually true the man and woman who had been hunting caroline were dead he had watched them both die and had gazed upon their bodies after death but they were different then werent they the dead are always different smaller somehow and shrunken in upon themselves their faces change and their bodies collapse over the years he had become convinced of the existence of a human soul if only because of the absence he witnessed in the bodies of the deceased something departed at the moment of death altering the remains and the evidence of its leaving was visible in t ss vhe appearance of the dead and yet and yet he thought back to the woman she had been less damaged than the man in the course of her dying the wheels of the truck had rendered him beyond identification but she was physically intact apart from the holes that jimmys bullets had made in her and they had all caught her in the upper body looking upon her face after she was pulled from the water parker had been astonished at the change in her it was hard to believe that this was the same woman the cruelty that had animated her features was gone but more than that her looks were softer somehow as though her bones had been blunted the sharp edges removed from her cheeks and her nose and her chin the imperfect mask that had covered her face for so long one that was based on her own appearance yet subtly altered had fallen away disintegrating in the cold waters of the creek he had looked at jimmy and seen the same reaction unlike him though jimmy had spoken it aloud it doesnt even look like her he had said i see the wounds but its not her the crime scene guys had looked at him in puzzlement but had said nothing they knew that different cops responded in different ways to their involvement in fatal shootings it was not their place to comment oh yes something had left her as she died but will did not believe or did not want to believe that it had come back again so while jimmy gallaghers nephew guarded wills son he drove around pearl river pausing at intersections to peer along the cross streets shining his flashlight on dark cars in parking lots slowing down to stare at young couples daring them to look back at him for he felt sure that he would be able to identify the ones who had come for his son by the look in their eyes perhaps he had always been fated to find them in the hours that followed he wondered if they had been waiting for him knowing that he would come yet certain that he would not be able to act against them they were strangers to him and even if the rabbi had warned him of their true nature who could ever truly believe such a thing and something would come for epstein too in time it was not their purpose it would be left to another the rabbi could wait and so they had not moved as his flashlight found them on the patch of waste ground not far from his home they had seen the other man big redheaded arrive at the house and they had glimpsed the pistol in his hand now that they knew where the boy was and had learned for certain the truth about his parentage they were anxious to move against him to finish the task they had been assigned so long before but if they were to rush it and make a mistake then he would be lost to them again the redheaded man with them was armed and they did not want to die neither one nor both they had been separated for too long and they loved each other this time the struggle to reunite had been shorter than before but the separation had still been painful for them the boy had been traced by another the one called kittim who had whispered foul things in his ear and the boy had known them to be true he had traveled north and in time aided by kittim he had found the girl now they burned for each other rejoicing rdiperin their physicality once the boy was dead they could disappear and be together forever they just had to be careful they did not want to take any chances and here was the boys father approaching for they recognized him immediately curious the girl thought the last time she had seen him was at the moment of her death now here he was older and grayer tired and weak she smiled to herself then leaned over and gripped the boys hand he turned to look at her and she saw an eternity of longing in his eyes i love you she whispered and i love you he replied will got out of the car he had a gun in his hand held close to his right thigh he shone his flashlight on them the boy raised his hand to shield his eyes hey man he said whats the deal with the light will thought that the boy looked vaguely familiar he was from somewhere in rockland county of that will was certain although he was a recent arrival he seemed to recall something about juvie stuff maybe from visiting down at orangetown with the local cops keep your hands where i can see them both of you they did as they were told the boy resting his palms upon the wheel the girl placing her painted fingernails upon the dashboard license and registration said will hey you a cop said the boy he had a lazy drawl and he grinned as he spoke letting parker know that this was all a charade a farce maybe you need to show me some id first shut up license and registration behind the visor reach up slowly with your left hand the boy shrugged but did as he was told holding the license for the cop to see once he had retrieved it alabama youre a long way from home ive always been a long way from home how old are you sixteen he said and then some will stared at him and he saw the darkness in the boys eyes what are you doing here sitting taking time out with my best girl the girl giggled but it wasnt a pretty sound parker thought that it sounded like something bubbling in a pot on an old stove something that would scour you if it touched your skin parker stepped back get out of the car why we aint done nothing wrong the tone of the boys voice changed and parker heard the adult in him come through besides you still aint shown us no id you might not be a cop at all you could be a thief or a rapist we aint moving until i see a badge the boy watched as the flashlight wavered for a moment and knew that the cop was uncertain now he had his suspicions but they werent enough to act on and the boy was enjoying taunting him although not as much as he would enjoy leaving him with the knowledge that he had been unable to save his son from death but it was the girl who spoke and doomed them so what you gonna do officer parker she said giggling there was a moment of silence and the boy realized that she had made a terrible mistake how do you know my name the girl was no longer giggling the boy licked his lips maybe the situation could yet be rescued i guess someone pointed you out to us lot of cops around here guy was naming them off to me what guy someone we met people are friendly to strangers in this town thats how i know who you are he licked his lips again and i know what you are said parker the boy stared at him and he changed he had an adolescents inner rage an inability to control himself in adult situations now as the cop challenged him the old thing inside him was revealed for an instant a thing of ash and fire and charred flesh a thing of transcendent beauty and untrammeled ugliness fuck you and your child said the boy you have no idea what we are he turned his left wrist slightly and the symbol on his arm was revealed to will by the flashlights beam and in that instant what was fractured inside will parker came apart forever and he knew that he could take no more the first shot killed the boy entering just above his right eye and exiting through the back of his head burying itself in the rear seat amid blood and hair and brain matter there was no need for a second but will fired one anyway the girl opened her mouth and screamed she leaned over and cradled the ruined head of her lover then gazed at the one who had taken him from her again well come back she whispered well keep coming back until its done will said nothing he simply lowered the gun and shot her once in the chest when she was gone he went back to his car and placed his gun on the hood there were lights coming on in nearby porches and hallways and he saw a man standing in his yard looking over at the two cars he tasted salt on his lips and thought that he had been crying but then the pain came and he realized that he had bitten his tongue in a daze he got back in the car and began to drive as he passed the man in the yard he saw recognition brighten the witnesss face but he didnt care he didnt even know where he was going until the lights of the city appeared before him and then he understood he was going home they questioned him for most of that night once they got him back to orangetown they told him that he was in trouble having left the scene of a shooting and in response he gave them the least elaborate lie that he could concoct he had seen the car on waste ground as he was heading home having been alerted to its presence by someone who had recognized him at an intersection but whose name he did not know the car had flashed its lights and he thought that the horn might have sounded he stopped to check that everything was okay the boy had taunted him pretending to reach for something inside his jacket a weapon perhaps will had warned him and then had fired killing the boy and the girl after he had gone over the story for the third time kozelek the investigator from the rockland county das office had requested a moment alone with him and the other cops both iad and local had consented when they were gone kozelek stopped the tape and lit a cigarette he didnt offer the pack to will who had already declined a cigarette earlier in the interview you werent driving your own car said kozelek no i borrowed a friends what friend just a friend hes not involved i wasnt feeling so good i wanted to get home as quickly as possible so this friend gives you his car he didnt need it i was going to drop it back off in the city tomorrow where is it now what does it matter it was used in the course of a shooting i dont remember i dont remember much after the shooting i just drove i wanted to get away from it you were traumatized is that what youre saying that must have been it i never shot anybody before there was no gun said kozelek we looked they were unarmed both of them i didnt say that they were armed i said that i thought the boy might have been armed rhtanrdquo kozelek drew on his cigarette and examined the man seated opposite him through the smoke he had appeared detached from the whole process from the moment they had taken him in for questioning it could have been shock the iad detectives had arrived from the city with copies of will parkers service record as he had just said he had never killed anyone before either officially or from what kozelek could ascertain unofficially he had been with the nypd himself for twenty years and he had no illusions about such matters his responsibility for the shootings of the two young people would be difficult for him to accept but that wasnt how kozelek read the situation it wasnt so much that will parker was in shock but that he seemed to want the whole thing to be over and done with like a condemned man who seeks only to be taken straight from the courtroom to his place of execution even his description of events which kozelek believed to be a lie was halfhearted in its absence of truth parker didnt care if they believed him or not they wanted a story and he had given them a story if they wanted to pick holes in it they could go right ahead and do it he didnt care that was it thought kozelek the man didnt care his reputation and career were on the line he had blood on his hands when the circumstances of the killings began to emerge the press would be baying for his blood and there would be those within the department who might be prepared to throw will parker to the dogs as a sacrifice as a way of showing that the department wouldnt tolerate killers on the force already kozelek knew that discussion was taking place as men with reputations to protect balanced the advisability of weathering out the storm and standing by their officer against the possibility that to do so might further tarnish the reputation of a department that was already unloved and still reeling from a series of corruption investigations you say that you didnt know these kids said kozelek the question had been asked more than once already in that room but kozelek had caught a flicker of uncertainty in parkers face each time he had denied any knowledge of them and he saw it again now the boy looked familiar but i dont think id ever met him his name was joe dryden native of birmingham alabama arrived here a couple of months ago he already had a record nickelanddime stuff mostly but he was on his way to greater things like i said i didnt know him personally and the girl never saw her before missy gaines came from a nice family in jersey her family reported her missing a week ago any idea how she might have come to be with dryden in pearl river you asked me these questions already i told you i dont know who visited your house yesterday evening i dont know i wasnt there we have a witness who says he saw a man enter you rani r house last night he stayed for some time the witness seems to be under the impression that the man had a gun in his hand like i said i dont know what youre talking about but your witness must be mistaken i think the witness is reliable why didnt he call the cops because your wife answered the door and allowed the man to enter it appears that she knew him will shrugged i dont know anything about it kozelek took a final drag on his cigarette then stubbed it out in the cracked ashtray whyd you turn off the tape asked will because iad doesnt know about the armed man said kozelek i was hoping you might tell me why you thought they were sufficiently at risk that you needed to protect them and how that might connect to the two kids you shot but will didnt answer and kozelek realizing that the situation was unlikely to change gave up for the time being if iad does find out theyll question your wife you need to get your story straight jesus why couldnt you just have thrown down a gun a gun in the car and all of this would be unnecessary because i dont have a throwdown said will and for the first time he showed some real animation im not that kind of cop well said kozelek i have news for you there are two dead kids in a car both of them unarmed so as of now you are that kind of cop chapter twentyfour we were coming to the end i picked your father up from the orangetown pd before noon said jimmy there were reporters outside so they put a cop whod just come off duty in the backseat of an unmarked sedan with a coat over his head and then they drove him out in an explosion of flashbulbs while i waited at the back of the station house for your father we drove to a place called creeleys in orangetown its not there anymore theres a gas station where it used to be back then it was the kind of bar that did a good burger kept the lights low and nobody asked anybody anything beyond another one or you want fries with that i used to go there with my nephew and my sister sometimes we dont talk so much anymore my sister and me she lives out in chicago now she thought i put my nephew at risk by asking him to do what he did for you and your mother but wed been growing apart from each other long before that i didnt interrupt him he was circling the awfulness of what was ss oto come like a dog fearful of taking tainted meat from a strangers hand as it happened there was nobody in the place when we got there apart from the bartender i knew him and he knew me i guess he might have recognized your father too but if he did he didnt say anything either way we had coffee we talked what did he say jimmy shrugged as if it were a matter of no consequence he said what epstein had said they were the same people they looked different but he saw it in their eyes and the girls words and the marking on the boy just confirmed it that threat of returning i think of it all the time he seemed to shiver slightly still water brushed by a cold breeze and then just before he fired the first shot he said he could have sworn that their faces changed changed yeah changed just like the woman i killed at gerritsen i guess best he could explain it he said it was like a pair of masks that they wore became transparent for an instant and he saw the things behind them that was when he pulled the trigger on the boy he couldnt even remember killing the girl he knew that hed done it he just couldnt recall how it had happened after an hour he asked me to drive him back home but when we left creeleys there were two iad guys waiting for us they told me that theyd take will to the house they said they were worried about reporters but i think they just wanted a few more minutes alone with him in the hope that i might have convinced him to come clean i mean they knew what he had told them didnt add up they were just having trouble finding the cracks in his version i dont think he said anything more though later after he died they tried to sweat me but i didnt tell them anything either after that i was pretty much done as a cop i served out my time at the ninth just so i could claim my full benefits and pension so that was the last time i saw will as the iad guys were taking him away he thanked me for all that id done and he shook my hand i should have known what was coming then but i wasnt looking out for it we had never shaken hands before not since the first day we met at the academy it just wasnt a thing for us i watched him go and then i came back here the call came through before id even had a chance to take off my shoes it was my nephew who told me the thing of it was if youd asked me then if i was surprised id have said no twentyfour hours earlier id have told you it could never happen will parker eating his gun but looking back when we were sitting in creeleys i could tell that he wasnt the same man he looked old and beaten i dont think he could believe what he had seen and what he had done it was just too much for him the funeral was a strange one i dont know what you remember of it but there were people who should have been there but werent the commissioner didnt show but that wasnt a surprise not for what was being tagged as a murdersuicide but there were othersbrass mainly suits from the puzzle palacewho stayed away when usually theyd have made an appearance there was a bad smell around what happened and they knew it the papers were all over them and they didnt like it in a way and youll forgive me f r wiaveor saying it your old man dying was the best thing that could have happened for them if an inquiry had vindicated him the press would have hauled them over the fires of hell for it if the shootings were found to be unjustified then there would have been a court case and the cops on the street and the union theyd all have been spitting nails when will killed himself they got to bury the whole mess along with him the investigation into what happened was always set to be inconclusive once he was gone the only people who knew the truth of what took place on that patch of waste ground were all dead will got an inspectors funeral though the whole deal the band played and there were white gloves and black ribbons and a folded flag for your mother because of the way he went his benefits were in doubt you may not know this but an inspector from police plaza a guy named jack stepp he had a quiet word with your mother as she was walking back to the funeral car stepp was the commissioners fixer the guy who cleaned up behind the scenes he told her that shed be taken care of and she was they paid the benefits under the table somebody made sure that she was done right by that you were both looked after epstein contacted me after the funeral he didnt attend i dont know why i think it was too high profile for him and hes not a highprofile guy he came here to this house and he sat in the chair that youre sitting in now and he asked me what i knew about the killings and i told him the same thing that ive told you all of it then he went away and i never saw him again i didnt even speak to him until you came along asking questions and then wallace turned up after you and i felt that i had to inform epstein wallace i wasnt worried about so much there are ways that these things can be handled and i figured he could be frightened off if the need arose but you i knew youd keep coming back that once youd gotten it into your head to go nosing around in the dirt then you wouldnt stop until you came up with bones epstein told me that his people were already working on stopping wallace and that i should tell you what i knew he sat back in his chair spent so now you know everything and you kept it hidden all this time i didnt even discuss it with your mother and to tell you the truth i was kind of glad when she said she was taking you up to maine it made me feel like i didnt have to be responsible for you it made me feel that i could pretend to forget everything would you ever have told me if i hadnt come asking no what good would it have done then he seemed to reconsider look i dont know he said ive read about you and ive heard the stories about the people youve found and the men and women youve killed all those cases have been touched by something strange maybe in the last couple of years ive thought that you should be told so that he was struggling to find the right words so that what he settled upon them although not happily so that youd be ready for them when they came again he said chapter twentyfive the call came through to my cell phone shortly before midnight jimmy had gone to make up the bed in the spare room and i was seated at the kitchen table still trying to come to terms with what he had told me the ground beneath my feet no longer seemed solid and i did not trust myself to stand and remain upright perhaps i should have doubted jimmys story or at least remained skeptical of some of the details until i could investigate them further for myself but i did not i knew in my heart that all he had told me was true i checked the caller id display before i answered but i did not recognize the number hello mr parker charlie parker yes this is detective doug santos over at the sixeight sir i was wondering where you happen to be right now the sixeight covered bay ridge where i had once lived with my family cops from that precinct including walter cole had been the first on the scene on the night that susan and jennifer died why i asked whats going on please just answer the question im in brooklyn bensonhurst his tone changed where at first he had merely been brusque and efficient there was now a greater urgency to his words i didnt know how it had happened but in the space of a couple of seconds i sensed that i had become a potential suspect can you give me an address id like to talk to you whats this about detective its late and ive had a long day id prefer to speak to you in person that address hold on jimmy had just come back from the bathroom he raised an eyebrow in inquiry as i covered the phone with my hand its a cop from the sixeight he wants to talk to me is it okay with you if i meet him here im getting a vibe from him that tells me i might be in need of an alibi sure said jimmy you get a name santos jimmy shook his head dont know him its late but if you want i can make some calls find out whats happening i gave santos the address he told me that hed be there within the hour meanwhile jimmy had begun to call his own contacts although walter cole remained an option if he came up short he also disposed of the empty wine bottle while he made the first call which turned out to be enough for him to find out something when he hung up the phone he was shaken theres been a killing he said height widthwhere you wont like it hobart theres a dead man in the kitchen of your old house you may have mixed feelings when you hear who it is its mickey wallace santos arrived half an hour later he was tall and dark and probably not much more than thirty years of age he had the hungry look of someone who intended to ascend the career ladder as fast as humanly possible and wouldnt be troubled by stomping on fingers on the way up he looked disappointed when it emerged that i had an alibi for the entire evening and a cop alibi at that still he accepted a cup of coffee and if he wasnt exactly friendly he thawed enough not to hold the fact that i was no longer a viable suspect against me you knew this guy he asked he was planning to write a book about me and how did you feel about that not so good i tried to discourage him you mind if i ask how if santos had been endowed with antennae theyd have started twitching i might not have killed wallace myself but i could have found someone else to do it for me i told him that i wouldnt cooperate i made sure that nobody else i was close to would cooperate with him either looks like he didnt take the hint santos sipped his coffee he seemed pleasantly surprised by the taste its good coffee he said to jimmy blue mountain said jimmy only the best you say you worked the ninth said santos thats right santos turned his attention back to me your father worked the ninth too didnt he i almost admired santos s ability to come up to speed so quickly unless hed been keeping tabs before now someone must have read the salient details of my file on the phone to him as hed driven to bensonhurst right again i said catching up on old times is that relevant to the case in hand i dont know is it look detective i said i wanted wallace to stop nosing around in my life but i didnt want him dead and if i was going to have him killed i wouldnt have had it done in the room where my wife and daughter died and id have made sure that i was far away when it happened santos nodded guess youre right i know who you are whatever else people say about you youre not dumb nice to hear i said aint it though he sighed i talked to some people before i came here they said it wasnt your style they tell you what was my style they told me i didnt want to know and i trusted them on it but they confirmed that it wasnt what was done to mickey wallace i waited he was tortured with a blade said santos it wasnt sophisticated but it was effective my guess is that someone wanted him to talk once hed told what he knew his throat was cut nobody heard anything no how was he found patrol saw that the side gate to the house was open the uniform went around back saw a light in the kitchen a small flashlight probably wallaces but well have it checked for prints just in case so whats next you free right now no later this week for a date the hell do you think im done here i said i wasnt of course had there been no other distractions i would have stayed with jimmy in the hope of squeezing every last detail out of him early the next morning once id had a chance to absorb all that i had been told i might have made him go through everything again just to be certain that there was nothing he had omitted but jimmy was tired he was a man who had spent an evening confessing not only his own sins but the sins of others he needed to sleep i knew what santos was about to ask and i knew that i would have to say yes no matter how much it pained me id like you to take a look at the house said santos the bodys gone but theres something i want you to see what just take a look okay i agreed i told jimmy that i would probably return to speak to him over the next few days and he said that he would be there i should have thanked him but i did not he had held too much back for too long as we left he stood on the porch and watched us go he raised a hand in farewell but i did not respond i had not been back at hobart street for years not since i had removed the last of my familys possessions from the house sorting them into those that i would keep and those i would discard i think that it was one of the hardest tasks i have ever performed that service for the dead with each item that i put asidea dress a hat a doll a toyit seemed that i was betraying their memory i should have kept it all for these were things that they had touched and held and something of them resided in these familiar objects now rendered strange by loss it took me three days even now i can recall sitting for an hour on the edge of our bed with susans hairbrush in my hand stroking the hairs that had tangled on its bristles was this too to be discarded or should i keep it along with the lipstick that had molded itself to the shape of her the blusher that retained the imprint of her finger upon it the unwashed wineglas r ahed winegs marked by her hands and her mouth what was to be kept and what was to be forgotten in the end perhaps i kept too much that or not enough too much to truly let go and too little to lose myself entirely in their memory you okay asked santos as we stood at the gate no i said i saw tv cameras and flashes exploded in my eyes leaving red spots in their wake i saw patrol cars and men in uniform and i was back in another time my knee bruised and my trousers torn my head in my hands and the image of the dead frozen on my retina you want a minute more flashbulbs closer now i heard my name being called but i did not react no i said again and i followed santos to the back of the house it was the blood that did it blood on the kitchen floor and blood on the walls i could not enter the kitchen instead i gazed upon it from outside until i felt my stomach begin to churn and sweat broke out on my face i leaned against the cool woodwork of the house and closed my eyes until the nausea passed did you see it asked santos yes i said the symbol had been drawn in wallaces blood his body had already been removed but the position in which he was found had been marked the symbol had been created just above where wallaces head had rested nearby the contents of a plastic folder had been scattered across the floor i saw the photographs and knew why wallace had been here he wanted to relive the killings and their discovery do you know what that symbol means asked santos ive never seen it before me neither but im guessing that whoever did this signed his handiwork weve searched the rest of the house its clean looks like it all happened in the kitchen i turned to look at him he was young he probably didnt even understand the import of his own words and yet i could not forgive him his crassness were finished here i said i walked away from him and straight into another barrage of flashes of camera lights and shouted questions i froze for a moment as i realized that i had no way of leaving this place i had come with santos i had no car of my own i saw someone standing under a tree a familiar figure a big tall man with short silver hair shorn in a military cut in my confusion it took me a moment to place him tyrrell tyrrell was here a man who even after i left the force had made it clear to me that he believed i should be behind bars now he was striding toward me outside the place where mickey wallace had been killed wallace had hinted that some people had been willing to talk to him and i knew then that tyrrell had been one of them some of the reporters saw him coming and one of them a guy named mcgarry whod been on the police beat for so long that his skin had a blue tinge called tyrrells name it was r aname it clear from the way the older man was moving that some kind of confrontation was about to occur and it would take place in the glare of cameras and the red lights of handheld recording devices that was how tyrrell would want it you sonofabitch he shouted this is your fault more flashes now and the bright steady light of a tv camera shining upon tyrrell hed been drinking but he was not intoxicated i prepared to face him and then a hand gripped my arm and jimmy gallaghers voice said come on lets get you out of here exhausted though he was he had followed me here and i was grateful to him for it i saw the frustration in tyrrells face as he watched his quarry escape denied his moment in front of the media and then the more together reporters were turning to him for a comment and he began to spill his bile santos watched parker depart and saw tyrrell begin talking to the reporters santos didnt know why tyrrell was blaming parker for what had happened but he knew now that there was bad blood between the two men he would talk to tyrrell in time he turned away and watched a man in a nicely cut dark suit who had slipped past the cordon and seemed to be staring intently at the receding lights of jimmy gallaghers car santos moved toward him sir you have to step back behind the line the man flipped the wallet in his palm to reveal a badge and a maine state police id but he didnt look at santos who felt his hackles rise as a consequence detective hansen said santos can i help you with something only when the car had turned onto marine avenue and was gone from sight did hansen turn to santos his eyes like his hair and his suit were very dark i dont think so he said and walked away that night i slept in jimmy gallaghers house in a clean bed in an otherwise unfurnished room and in my dreams i saw a dark figure bent over mickey wallace whispering and cutting in the house on hobart street and behind them as in one film playing over another each depicting the same setting from a similar angle but at different moments in time i saw another man hunched over my wife speaking softly to her as he cut her the body of my dead child on the floor nearby waiting to be violated in turn and then they were gone and there was only wallace in the darkness the blood bubbling from the wound in his throat his body trembling he was dying alone and afraid in a strange place a woman appeared in the doorway of the kitchen she wore a summer dress and a little girl stood beside her gripping the thin material of her mothers dress with her right hand they walked to where wallace lay and the woman knelt beside him and stroked his face and the child took his hand and together they calmed him until his eyes closed and he left this world forever chapter twentysix the girls body had been wrapped in plastic sheeting then weighted with a rock and dumped in a pond it was discove sit äred when a cow slipped into the water and one of its legs became tangled on the rope securing the plastic as the cow a horned hereford of no small value was hauled from the pond the body came with it almost as soon as it was found the locals in the small southern idaho town of goose creek knew who it was her name was melody mcready and she had disappeared two years earlier her boyfriend wade pearce had been questioned in connection with her disappearance and although the police had subsequently ruled him out as a suspect he had killed himself one month after melody went missing or so the official version went he had shot himself in the head even though he didnt appear to own a gun then again people said there was no understanding the nature of griefor guilt for there were those who felt that regardless of anything the cops might have said wade pearce had been responsible for whatever happened to melody mcready although such suspicions owed more to a general dislike of the pearce family than to any real evidence of wrongdoing on wades part still even those who believed wade was innocent werent too sorry when he shot himself because wade was a vicious jerk just like the rest of the men in his family melody mcready had ended up with him because her own family was almost as screwed up as his was everybody knew that it would end in tears they just hadnt expected bloodshed too and a body eventually dragged from still waters on the leg of a cow dna tests were conducted on the remains to confirm the identity of the young woman and to find any possible traces left by whoever had killed her and dumped her in old sideys pond although the investigators were skeptical of anything useful being revealed too much time had gone by and the body had not been sealed in the plastic so the fish and the elements had had their way with her to their surprise then one usable print was recovered from the plastic it was submitted to afis the fbis fingerprint identification system the detectives investigating the discovery of the body then sat back to wait afis was overburdened by submissions from law enforcement agencies and it could take weeks or months for a check to be conducted depending upon the urgency of the case and the extent of the afis workload as it happened the print was checked within two weeks but no match was found along with the print had come a photograph of a mark that had been found carved on a rock by the pond a photograph that eventually found its way to unit five of the agencys national security division the arm of the fbi responsible for collecting intelligence and carrying out counterintelligence actions related to national security and international terrorism unit five of the nsd was nothing more than a secure computer terminal in the new york field office at federal plaza its recent nsd designation and the new title of unit five that came with it were both flags of convenience approved by the office of the general counsel in order to ensure that cooperation from law enforcement was swift and unconditional unit five was responsible for all inquiries linked however peripherally to the investigation into the actions of the killer known as the traveling man the individual responsible for the deaths of a number of men and women at the end of the s among them susan and jennifer parker wife and daughter of charlie parker unit five had over time also absorbed earlier information on the death of a man named peter ackerman in new york in the late sixties the shooting of an unidentified woman at gerritsen beach some months later and the pearl river killings involving william parker information that had been assembled by an asac an assistant special agent in charge of the new york field office and r q office asubsequently passed on to one of his successors in addition its files contained all known material on the cases with which charlie parker had been involved since he became a pi other agencies including the nypd were aware of unit five designations but ultimately only two people had full access to the units records the special agent in charge of the new york field office edgar ross and his assistant brad it was this assistant who twenty minutes after the initial referral knocked on his bosss door with four sheets of paper in his hands youre not going to like this he said ross looked up as brad closed the door behind him i never like anything that you tell me you never bring good news you never even bring coffee what have you got brad seemed reluctant to hand over the papers like a child concerned about submitting flawed homework to his teacher fingerprint request submitted to afis taken from a body dump in idaho local girl melody mcready she disappeared two years ago body was found in a pond wrapped in plastic the print came from the plastic and we got a match no but there was something else a photograph that started ringing bells why brad looked uneasy despite the fact that he had been with his boss for almost five years now everything to do with unit five made him uneasy hed read details of some of the other cases that had been automatically flagged for the units attention without exception every one of them gave him the creeps similarly without exception every one of them seemed to involve peripherally or directly the man named charlie parker the prints didnt match but the symbol did its been found on two earlier bodies the first was the corpse of an unknown woman fished from the shell bank creek in brooklyn over forty years ago after she was shot by a cop she was never identified the second match comes from the body of a teenage girl killed in a car at pearl river about twentysix years ago her name was missy gaines a runaway from jersey ross closed his eyes and waited for brad to continue gaines was shot by charlie parkers father the other woman was killed by his fathers partner sixteen years earlier now reluctantly he proffered the papers ross examined the symbol on the first sheet from the mcready body dump and compared it to the symbol from the earlier killings aw hell he said brad reddened even though he knew that he was not to blame for what was to come it gets worse look at the second sheet this was found hacked into a tree near the body of a kid called bobby faraday this time ross swore more forcefully the third one was cut into the wood beside the back door of the faraday house it was assumed r q was assu that theyd killed themselves but the chief a guy named dashut didnt seem so sure took them five days to find it and were only getting it now state police never passed it on theyre kind of territorial out there eventually dashut just got tired of the lack of progress and went over their heads get me every piece of paper you can find on the mcready girl and the faradays already on their way said brad they should be here within the hour go wait for them brad did as he was told ross put the papers beside a set of photographs that had been on his desk since earlier that morning they came from the previous nights crime scene on hobart street and showed the symbol that had been drawn on the wall of the kitchen with mickey wallaces blood ross had been informed of the murder within an hour of the discovery of wallaces body and had asked for evidence photos and copies of all documentation relating to the case to be made available to him by nine the following morning as soon as he saw the symbol ross began covering the trail calls were made to one police plaza and the symbol was scrubbed from the kitchen wall all those who had been present at the scene were contacted and warned that the symbol was crucial to the case and any mention of it outside the immediate investigative team would result in disciplinary action and ultimately dismissal without recourse to appeal additional locks were placed on all police files relating to the pearl river killings the shooting in gerritsen beach and the accidental death of peter ackerman at the intersection of seventyeighth and first nine months before the lock prevented those files from being accessed without the express permission of both sac ross and the nypds deputy commissioners of operations and intelligence even though all the relevant files had been carefully sterilized after the events in pearl river to ensure that any matches that might arise at a later date would be referred to the commissioners office and when it subsequently came into being unit five any inquiries relating to them would immediately be red flagged ross knew that the death of a reporter even a former one would draw other reporters like flies and the circumstances of wallaces death killed in a house where two highprofile murders had been committed a decade earlier would attract further attention it was important to keep a lid on the investigation but it couldnt be too tight or the more excitable reporters would start to sense a coverup therefore it was decided in conjunction with one police plaza that a suitably sympathetic face would be presented to the media and a series of carefully controlled unofficial briefings would disseminate enough information to keep the media at bay without actually divulging anything that might be considered dangerous to the conduct of the investigation ross traced his fingers over the picture of the symbol on the wall then retrieved copies of four different photos from the various files on his desk soon its surface was covered with variations on the same images symbols burned into flesh cut into wood and carved on r qd carved stone ross turned his chair to the window and looked out over the city as he did so he dialed a number using a secure line a woman answered let me speak to the rabbi please said ross within seconds epstein was on the line its ross i was expecting your call youve heard then i received a call last night to alert me do you know where parker is mr gallagher gave him a bed for the night is that common knowledge not to the media mr gallagher had the foresight to remove his license plate when he realized that he might be forced to conduct a rescue ross was relieved he knew that in the absence of a new york lead reporters had already attempted to track parker through the bar in maine in which he was working a call to the field office in portland requesting a driveby at the parker house had revealed two cars and a tv van parked outside and the owner of the great lost bear had told an agent that hed been forced to put a no reporters sign on his door to ensure that his request was complied with hed hired two large men in hastily made no reporters tshirts to man the doors according to the agent in question those men had been waiting to start work when hed visited the bar they were he said without question two of the widest individuals he had ever seen in his life and now asked ross parker left the gallagher house this morning said epstein i have no idea where he is have you spoken to gallagher he says that he doesnt know where parker has gone but he confirmed that parker now knows everything then hes going to come looking for you im prepared for that i have some material im sending over to you you might find it interesting what kind of material the symbol that was found on the dead women at shell bank creek and pearl river ive got three more versions of it in front of me one from two years ago the others from earlier this year there were apparent killings involved in each case shes leaving signs markers for the other and now weve got her opposite number leaving his name in blood at charlie parkers old house so hes doing the same keep me informed please i will they exchanged farewells and hung up ross summoned brad back into his presence and told him to put a trace on parkers cell phone and two men o r qnd two men rabbi epstein i want to know where parker is before the end of the day he said do you want him brought in no just make sure nothing happens to him said ross a little late for that isnt it sir said brad get the hell out of here said ross but he thought from the mouths of babes chapter twentyseven i made the call to epstein from a pay phone on second avenue outside an indian restaurant that was offering an allyoucaneat buffet that nobody wanted to eat so in an effort to drum up business a sadfaced man in a bright polyester shirt had been posted at the door to hand out flyers that nobody wanted to read it was raining softly and the flyers hung damply from his hand ive been expecting your call said epstein once he had identified himself for a long time from what i hear i replied i take it that youd like to meet you take it right come to the usual place make it late nine oclock i look forward to seeing you again then he hung up i was staying in an apartment at twentieth and second just above a locksmiths store it extended over two decentsize rooms with a separate kitchen that had never been used and a bathroom that was just wide enough to accommodate a full rotation of the human body as long as the body in question kept his arms at his sides there was a bed a couch and a couple of easy chairs and a tv with a dvd player but no cable there was no phone which was why id called epstein from a pay phone even then id stayed on the line for only the minimum time required to arrange our meeting i had already taken the precaution of removing the battery from my cell phone and had bought a temporary replacement from a drugstore i picked up some pastries from the bakery next door then went back to the apartment the landlord was sitting on a chair to the right of the living room window he was cleaning a sig pistol which was not what landlords usually did in their tenants apartments unless the landlord in question happened to be louis so he said im meeting him tonight you want company a second shadow wouldnt hurt is that a racist remark i dont know you do minstrel songs nope but i brought you a gun he reached into a leather bag and tossed a small pistol on the couch i removed the gun from its holster it was about seven inches long and weighed it seemed less than two pounds kimber ultra ten two said louis tenshot box magazine rear corner of the butt is sharp so watch it i put the gun back in its holster and handed it to him youre kidding he said no im not i want my license to carry back i get caught with an unregistered firearm and im done theyll flay me alive then toss whats left in the sea angel appeared from the kitchen he had a pot of coffee in one hand you think whoever killed wallace tortured him to find out his taste in music he said he was cut so that hed tell what hed learned about you we dont know that for sure yeah like we dont know evolution for sure or climate change or gravity he was killed in your old house while investigating you and then someone signed off on it in blood pretty soon that someone is going to try to do to you what was done to wallace thats why louis is going to stick with me tonight yeah said louis cause if i get caught with a gun then its okay black man always slides on gun charges i heard that said angel i think its a selfdefense thing brotheronbrother crime he took the bag of pastries tore it open and laid it on the small scarred coffee table then he poured me a cup of coffee and took a seat beside louis as i told them everything i had learned from jimmy gallagher the orensanz center had not changed since i had last visited it some years earlier it still dominated its section of norfolk street between east houston and stanton a neogothic structure designed by alexander seltzer in the nineteenth century for the arriving german jews his vision inspired by the great cathedral of cologne and the tenets of german romanticism then it was known as the anshei cheshed the people of kindness before that congregation merged with temple emanuel coinciding with the migration of the german jews from kleine deutschland in lower manhattan to the upper east side their place was taken by jews from eastern and southern europe and the neighborhood became a densely populated warren thronged by those who were still struggling to cope with this new world both socially and linguistically anshei chesed became anshei slonim after a town in poland and thus it remained until the s when the building began to fall into disrepair only to be rescued by the sculptor angel orensanz and converted into a cultural and educational center i did not know what rabbi epsteins connection to the orensanz center was whatever status he enjoyed it was unofficial yet powerful i had seen some of the secrets that the center hid below its beautiful interior and epstein was the keeper of them when i entered there was only an old man sweeping the floor i stared at him he had been there when last i visited and he had been sweeping then too i gues r a too i gsed that he was always there cleaning polishing watching he looked at me and nodded in recognition the rabbi is not here he said instinctively understanding that there could be no other reason for my presence in this place i called him i said hes expecting me hell be here the rabbi is not here he repeated with a shrug i took a seat there didnt seem to be any point in prolonging the argument the old man sighed and went back to his sweeping half an hour passed then an hour there was no sign of epstein when at last i stood to leave the old man was seated at the door his broom held upright between his knees like a banner held aloft by some ancient forgotten retainer i told you he said yeah you did you should listen better i get that a lot he shook his head sorrowfully the rabbi he said he does not come here so much now why he has fallen out of favor i think or perhaps it is too dangerous for him now for all of us it is a shame the rabbi is a good man a wise man but some say that what he does is not fit for this this bet shalom he must have noticed my puzzlement a house of peace he explained not sheol not here sheol hell he said not here no longer here and he tapped his foot meaningfully on the floor indicating the hidden places beneath when last i had visited the orensanz center epstein had shown me a cell beneath the basement of the building in it he had secured a thing that called itself kittim a demon who wished to be a man or a man who believed himself to be a demon now if what the old man was saying was true kittim was gone from this place banished along with epstein his captor thank you i said bevakashah he replied betakh baadonai vaaseitov i left him there and stepped outside into the cold spring sunlight i had come here for nothing it seemed epstein was no longer comfortable being at the orensanz center or the center was no longer willing to countenance his presence i looked around half expecting to see him waiting nearby but there was no sign of him something had happened he was not coming i tried to pick out louis but there was no trace of him either still i knew he was close i walked down the steps and headed toward stanton after a minute i felt someone begin to fall into step beside me i looked to my left and saw a young jewish man wearing a skullcap and a loosefitting leather jacket he kept his right hand in his jacket pocket i thought i could discern the gun sight of a small pistol digging into the material behind me another young man was shadowing my footsteps they both looked strong and fast you took your time in there rdq r an there uo said the man to my left he had the slightest hint of an accent who knew you had such patience ive been working on it i said it was much needed i hear well im still working on it so maybe youd like to tell me where were going we thought you might like to eat he steered me onto stanton between a deli that didnt appear to have brought in fresh stock since the previous summer judging by the number of dead insects scattered among the bottles and jars in the window and a tailor who seemed to regard silk and cotton as passing fads that would ultimately bow down before artificial fibers was a small kosher diner it was dimly lit with four tables inside the wood dark and scarred by decades of hot coffee cups and burning cigarettes a sign on the glass in hebrew and english announced that it was closed only one table was occupied epstein sat in a chair facing the door his back to the wall he was wearing a black suit with a white shirt and a black tie a dark overcoat dangled from a hook behind his head topped by a narrowbrimmed black hat as though their occupant were not sitting below them but had recently dematerialized leaving only his clothing as evidence of his previous existence one of the young men took a chair and carried it outside then took a seat with his back to the window his companion the one who had spoken to me on the street sat inside but on the opposite side of the door he did not look back at us there was a woman behind the counter she was probably in her early forties but in the shadows of the little diner she could have passed for a decade younger her hair was very dark and when i passed her i could see no trace of gray in it she was also beautiful and smelled faintly of cinnamon and cloves she nodded at me but she did not smile i took the seat across from epstein but turned so that i also had a wall against my back and could see the door you could have told me that you were persona non grata at the orensanz center i said i could have but it would not have been true said epstein a decision was made one that was entirely mutual too many people pass through its doors it was not fair or wise to put them at risk i am sorry to have kept you waiting but there was a purpose we were watching the streets and did you find anything epsteins eyes twinkled no but had we ventured farther into the shadows then something or someone might have found us i suspected that you would not come alone was i right louis is nearby the enigmatic louis it is good to have such friends but bad to have such need of them the woman brought food to our table baba ghanoush with small pieces of pita bread burekas and chicken cooked with vinegar olives raisins and garlic with some couscous on the side epstein gestured to the food but i did not eat what he said about the orensanz cen r aorensanz ter i dont think i believe that youre on such good terms after all really you dont have a congregation you dont teach you travel everywhere with at least one gunman today you have two and there was something you said to me a long time ago we were talking and you used the term jesus christ none of that strikes me as very orthodox i cant help but feel that you might have earned a little disapproval orthodox he laughed no i am a most unorthodox jew but still a jew youre a catholic mr parker a bad catholic i corrected im not in a position to make such judgments still i am aware that there are degrees of catholicism i fear that there are many more degrees of judaism mine is cloudier than most and sometimes i wonder if i have spent too long divorced from my own people i find myself using terms that i have no business using slips of the tongue that embarrass me and worse or entertaining doubts that do not entertain me so perhaps it would be true to say that i left orensanz before i was asked to leave would that make you more comfortable he gestured once again at the food now eat its good and our hostess will be offended if you do not taste what she has prepared i hadnt arranged the meeting with epstein to play semantic games or to sample the local cuisine but he had a way of manipulating conversations to his own satisfaction and i had been at a disadvantage from the moment i traveled here to meet him yet there had been no choice i could not imagine epstein or his minders permitting an alternative arrangement so i ate i inquired politely after epsteins health and his family he asked about sam and rachel but he did not pry further into our domestic arrangements i suspected he was well aware that rachel and i were no longer together in fact i now believed that there was little about my life of which epstein was not aware and it had always been that way right from the moment my father approached him about the mark on the man who died beneath the wheels of a truck and whose partner had subsequently killed my birth mother when we were done baklava was brought to the table i was offered coffee and accepted i added a little milk to it and epstein sighed such a luxury he said to be able to enjoy a coffee with milk so soon after ones meal youll have to forgive my ignorance one of the laws of kashrut said epstein one is prohibited from eating dairy products within six hours of consuming meat exodus thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mothers milk you see i am more orthodox than you might think the woman hovered nearby waiting i thanked her for her kindness and for the food despite myself i had eaten more than i had intended this time she did smile but she did not speak epstein made a small gesture with his left hand and she retreated shes a deaf mute said epstein when her back was turned she reads lips but she will not read ours i glanced at the woman her face was tu r a face wasrned from us and she was examining a newspaper her head bent now that the time had arrived to confront him i felt something of my anger at him dissipate he had kept so much hidden for so long just as jimmy gallagher had done but there were reasons for it i know that youve been asking questions he said and i know that you have received some answers when i spoke i thought that i sounded like a petulant teenager you should have told me when we first met why because you believe now that you had a right to know i had a father and two mothers they all died for me in their way and that was precisely why you could not be told said epstein what would you have done you were still an angry violent man when we met grief stricken bent on revenge you could not be trusted there are some who would say that you still cannot be trusted and remember mr parker i had lost my son when first we met my concerns were for him not for you pain and grief are not your exclusive preserves but still you are right you should have been told before now but perhaps you chose the time that was right for you you decided when to begin asking the questions that led you here most have been answered for you i will do my best to deal with the rest now that the time had come i was not sure where to start what do you know of caroline carr next to nothing he said she came from what is now a suburb of hartford connecticut her father died when she was six and her mother when she was nineteen there are no surviving relatives if she had been bred to be anonymous one could not have asked for more but she wasnt anonymous someone came looking for her so it seems her mother died in a house fire subsequent investigations revealed that it might have been started deliberately might have been a cigarette smoldering at the bottom of a trash can with papers piled on top of it and a gas stove that was not turned off fully it could have been an accident except neither caroline nor her mother smoked a visitor there were no visitors that night according to caroline her mother sometimes entertained gentlemen but on the night that she died only she and caroline were asleep in the house her mother drank she was asleep on the couch when the fire broke out and was probably dead before the flames reached her caroline escaped by climbing out of an upstairs window when we met she told me that she saw two people watching the house from the woods while it burned a man and a woman they were holding hands but by that time someone had raised the alarm and there were neighbors rushing to help her and the fire trucks were on their way her main concern was for her mother but the first floor had already been engulfed when she thought again about the man and the woman they were gone she told me that she believed the couple in the woods had r ahe woods started the fire but when she tried to tell the police of what she had seen they dismissed the sighting as irrelevant or as the imaginings of a griefstricken young woman but caroline saw them again shortly after her mothers funeral and became convinced that they intended to do to her what they had done to her mother or that in fact she might have been the target all along why would she think that a sense she had the way they looked at her the way she felt when they looked at her call it a survival instinct whatever the reason for it she left town after her mothers funeral intending to find work in boston there someone tried to push her under a t train she felt a hand on her back and teetered on the edge of the platform before a young woman pulled her to safety when she looked around she saw a man and a woman moving toward the exit the woman glanced back at her and caroline said she recognized her from hartford the second time she saw them was at south station as she boarded a train to new york she thought that they were watching her from the platform but they didnt follow her who were they we did not know then and we still do not know for sure now oh we know the name of the man who died beneath the wheels of a truck and of the boy and girl your father killed at pearl river but those names ultimately proved useless the confirmation of their identities did nothing to explain how they came to be hunting caroline carr or you my father believed that missy gaines and the woman who killed my mother were the same person i said by extension he must have believed that peter ackerman and the boy who died with missy gaines were also the same how is that possible we have both witnessed strange things in the years since we first met epstein replied who knows what we should believe and what we should discount nevertheless let us look at the most logical or plausible explanation first over a period of more than forty years someone has repeatedly dispatched a pair of killers a man and a woman on a series of assassinations aimed at you or those close to you including the woman who ultimately gave birth to you when one couple died another eventually replaced them these killers were distinguished by marks on their arms one for the man and another for the woman just here he indicated a point halfway between his wrist and his elbow on his left forearm there is no reason that we can find for why a succession of couples have been chosen to do this the investigations into missy gaines joseph dryden and peter ackerman revealed that all led entirely normal existences for most of their lives ackerman was a family man missy gaines a model teenager dryden already a tearaway but no worse than many others then at some point their behavior changed they cut themselves off from family and friends they found a member of the opposite sex previously unknown to them formed a bond and went hunting apparently first for caroline carr and then in the cases of gaines and dryden for you so that is the logical explanation disparate couples linked only by their intent to do harm to you and your family either of their own volition or acting on the will of another but you dont believe the logical explanation no i do not epstein reached behind him a r abehind hind rummaged in the pocket of his overcoat emerging with a piece of photocopied paper that he unfolded on the table it was a copy of a scientific article and it showed an insect in flight a wasp so what do you know of wasps mr parker they sting true some the largest group in hymenoptera are also parasitic they target host insectscaterpillars spiderseither by laying eggs externally that attack the host from outside or by inserting eggs into the host body eventually the larvae emerge and consume the host such behavior is relatively common in nature and not just among wasps the ichneumon fly for example uses spiders and aphids to host its young when it injects its eggs it also injects a toxin that paralyzes the host the young then consume the host from the inside out starting with the organs least necessary for survival such as fat and entrails in order to keep the host alive for as long as possible before finally progressing to the essential organs eventually all that is left behind is an empty shell the manner of consumption does display a certain instinctive understanding that a live host is better than a dead one but otherwise its all rather primitive if undeniably nasty he leaned forward tapping the picture of the wasp now there is a variety of orb spider known as plesiometa argyra found in costa rica it too is preyed upon by a wasp but in an interesting way the wasp attacks the spider temporarily paralyzing it while it lays its eggs in the tip of the spiders abdomen then it leaves and the spiders ability to move is restored it continues to function as it has always done building its webs trapping insects even as the wasp larvae cling to its abdomen and feed on its juices through small punctures this continues for perhaps two weeks and then something very odd occurs the spiders behavior changes somehow by means unknown the larvae using chemical secretions compel the spider to alter its web construction instead of a round web the spider builds a smaller reinforced platform once that is complete the larvae kill their host and cocoon themselves in the new web safe from wind rain and predatory ants and the next stage of their development begins he relaxed slightly suppose we were to substitute wandering spirits for wasps and humans for spiders then perhaps we might begin to have some understanding of how seemingly ordinary men and women could at some point change utterly slowly dying inside while remaining unchanged without an interesting theory dont you think interesting enough to get a man banned from the local cultural center or committed if he were unwise enough to speak such thoughts too loudly but this is not the first time that you have heard of such things spirits flitting from body to body and people who apparently live beyond their allotted span slowly rotting yet never dying is that not right and i thought of kittim trapped in his cell retreating into himself like an insect hibernating even as his body withered and of a creature named brightwell glimpsed in a centuriesold painting in a photograph of the second world war and finally in this time as he hunted for a being like himself human in form but not in nature yes i knew of what epstein was speaking the difference between a spider and r a spider aa human though is the matter of consciousness of awareness said epstein since we must assume that the spider has no awareness of its own identity as a spider then the pain of its own consumption aside it has no understanding of what is happening to it as its behavior alters and ultimately it begins to die but a human being would become aware of the changes in its physiology or more correct its psychology its behavior it would be troubling at the very least the host might even consult a doctor or a psychiatrist tests could be carried out an effort would be made to discover the source of the imbalance but were not talking about parasitic flies or wasps no were talking about something that cannot be seen but is consuming the host just as surely as the wasp larvae consume the spider except in this case it is the identity that is being taken over the self and something in us would slowly become aware of this other this thing preying upon us and we would fight back at the darkness as it began to consume us i thought for a moment you used the word apparently earlier i said as in apparently they were targeting my birth mother why apparently well if caroline carr was their primary target why then did they return sixteen years later only to die at pearl river the answer it would seem is that they were not trying to kill caroline carr but the child she was carrying again why i dont know except that you are a threat to them and you have always been a threat perhaps even they do not know for certain the nature of the threat that you pose but they sense it and they react to it and their purpose is to extinguish it they were trying to kill you mr parker and they probably believed that they had succeeded for a time until they found out that they were wrong and you had been hidden from them so they were forced to return and rectify their mistake and failed a second time and failed echoed epstein but in the years since then you have begun to draw attention to yourself you have encountered men and women who share something of their nature if not their purpose and it may be that whoever or whatever dispatched these things has begun to notice you its not hard to draw the necessary conclusion which is that theyll return to try again i finished not will return said epstein they have returned and from beneath the description of the wasp and its actions he withdrew a photograph it showed the kitchen at hobart street and the symbol that had been painted in blood upon its wall this is also the mark that was found on the body of peter ackerman and on the boy dryden killed by your father at pearl river he said then he added more photographs this is the mark that was found on the bodies of missy gaines and your birth mothers killer it has since r ait has si been found at three more crime scenes one of them old two of them recent how recent weeks but unconnected to me yes it would appear so what are they doing leaving signs for each other and perhaps in the case of hobart street for you he smiled and there was pity in that smile you see something has returned and it wants you to know it v for the dead travel fast bram stoker dracula after burgers lenore chapter twentyeight the drunks were out in force a hockey game had been played that night and the bar was a magnet for fans because one of the owners ken harbaruk had enjoyed brief spells with both the toronto maple leafs and the bruins before a motorcycle accident put an end to his career he used to say that it was the best thing that could have happened to him under the circumstances he was good but he wasnt good enough eventually he knew he would have found himself in the minors playing for nickels and trying to pick up women who were easily impressed in bars a lot like the one he now owned instead hed been compensated well for his injuries and had plowed the money into a half share in a bar that seemed destined to guarantee him the kind of comfortable retirement that would have been denied him had he been able to continue playing in addition had he wished he could still have picked up women who were easily impressed or so he told himself but more usually he found himself thinking about his quiet apartment and his soft bed as the long nights in the bar drew to a close he had a comfortable yet casual relationship with a lawyer who was a wellpreserved fiftyone they each had homes of their own and they alternated overnight stays from weekend to weekend although he sometimes wished for something a little more defined secretly he would have liked for her to move in with him but he knew that wasnt what she wanted she valued her independence at first he thought that she was keeping him at a remove in order to ascertain how serious he was about her now after three years he realized he was being kept at a distance because that was exactly how she wanted it and if he desired something more then he would have to look elsewhere he figured he was too old to look elsewhere and he should be thankful for what he had he was he felt reasonably lucky and reasonably content yet on nights like this when the bruins were playing and the bar was filled with men and women who were too young to remember her or him or old enough to recall how inconsequential his career had been harbaruk experienced a nagging sense of regret at the path his life had taken which he hid by being even louder and more boisterous than usual but thems the breaks he had told emily kindler after hed interviewed her for the waitress job in fact shed hardly been required to say a word all she had to do was listen and nod occasionally as he retold the story of his life altering her expression as required to look sympathetic interested angry or happy according to the dictates of the plot she believed that she knew his type genial smarter than he appeared to be but with no illusions about his intelligence the kind of guy who might fantasize about making a pass at her but would never act on it and would feel guilty for even thinking such a thing he told her about the lawyer and mentioned the fact that he had been married way back but it hadnt worked out if he was surprised by how much he was willing to share with her then she was not she had found that men wanted to tell her things they exposed their inner selves to her and she did not know why never was able to talk much to women harbaruk told her as the interview drew to a close might not seem that way now but its true the girl was unusual he thought she looked like she could do with a little fattening up and her arms were so thin that he was pretty sure he could entirely encircle the widest point of her biceps with one meaty hand but she was undeniably pretty and what he had first taken for fragility to the extent that he had almost dismissed the possibility of hiring her as soon as he set eyes on her was revealing itself to be something more complex and ineffable there was strength there maybe not physical although he was starting to believe that she was not as weak as she looked because one thing ken harbaruk had always been good at was judging the strength of an opponent but an inner steeliness harbaruk sensed that the girl had been through some hard times but they hadnt broken her well you talked okay to me she said she smiled she wanted the job harbaruk shook his head knowing that he was being played but he still found that he was blushing slightly he felt the heat rise in his cheeks its nice of you to say he replied its just a shame that everything in life cant be handled with an interview over a soda he stood and extended his hand she took it and they shook you seem like a good kid talk to shelley over there shes the bar manager shell fix you up with some shifts and well see how you get along she thanked him and that was how she came to be waitressing in ken harbaruks sports bar and restaurantlocal home of the nhl as the sign above the door announced in big blackonwhite letters beside it a neon hockey player shot a puck then raised his hands in the air in triumph the hockey player was dressed in red and white a nod to kens polish ancestry he was always being asked if he was related to nick harbaruk who had enjoyed a career spanning sixteen years from to including four seasons with the pittsburgh penguins in the s he wasnt but it didnt bother him to be asked he was proud of his fellow poles who had succeeded on the ice nick pete stemkowsk z ate stemkoi john miszuk eddie leier among the oldtimers and czerkawski oliwa and sidorkiewicz among the new boys there were photographs of them on the wall below one of the tvs part of a little shrine dedicated to poland the shrine was close to where the girl was now working picking up glasses and taking last orders it had been a long night and she had earned every lousy dollar in tips her shirt smelled of spilled beer and fried food and the soles of her feet were aching she just wanted to finish up go home and sleep she had a day off tomorrow the first day since she had arrived here that would not involve working at either the coffee shop or the bar or both she intended to sleep late and do her laundry chad the young man who had been circling her had asked her out on a date and she had tentatively agreed to go to a movie with him even though her thoughts were still filled with memories of bobby faraday and what had befallen him still she was lonely and she figured a movie couldnt hurt too much ken killed the postmatch commentary in an effort to move folks along a little more quickly and replaced it with the news the girl liked the fact that life didnt begin and end with sports for ken he read some and he knew about what was going on in the world he had opinions on politics history art according to shelley he had too many damn opinions and he was too willing to share them with others shelley was in her fifties and married to an amiable slob who thought that the sun rose when shelley awoke and that nightfall was the worlds way of mourning the fact that soon it would be deprived of the sound of shelleys voice while she slept he was already seated at the bar sipping a light beer as he waited to drive her home shelley was fair and worked hard but as a consequence she didnt like to see any of her girls working less hard than she did she worked three nights behind the bar sometimes overlapping with ken if there was a game on the girl had so far worked for her five times and after the first night she had been grateful for the comparative peace of the third night when ken had taken charge and everything had been a little more relaxed if also a little less efficient and a little less profitable there were only two men left in her section and they had reached that point of near intoxication where had the bar not been about to close she would have been obliged to cut them off she could tell that they were about to progress from melancholy to mean and she would be relieved when they were gone now as she cleared away the glasses and empty chicken wing baskets from the table to their right she felt a pair of taps on her back hey said one of the men hey honey hit us again she ignored him she didnt like men touching her like that the other one giggled and sang a snatch of a britney lyric hey the tap was harder this time she turned were closing she said no you aint he ostentatiously examined his watch we got another five minutes yet you can see us right for two more beers im sorry guys i cant serve you any more above their heads the news story on the tv changed she glanced at it there were flashbulbs and police cars photographs were superimposed upon the sce z aupon the ne a man a woman and a child she wondered what had happened to them she tried to figure out if it was someplace local then saw nypd on the side of one of the cars and knew that it was not still it couldnt be anything good not if they were showing photographs that woman and the little girl were either missing or dead maybe the man too what do you mean you cant give us no more it was the smaller yet more belligerent of the drunks he wore a patriots shirt smeared with ketchup and wing juice and his eyes were glazed behind his cheap spectacles he was in his midthirties and there was no sign of a wedding ring a sour smell rose from him it had been there right from the moment he arrived at first she had thought it was because he didnt wash but now she suspected that it was a substance he secreted a contaminant from within that mingled with his sweat let it go ronnie said his friend who was taller and fatter and also far drunker than his buddy i got to hit the head he stumbled by her mumbling an apology he wore a black tshirt with a white arrow that pointed toward his groin the picture on the screen changed again she looked up another man different from the first was caught in the glare of the lights he looked confused as though hed wandered out of his house expecting to find quiet not chaos wait she thought wait i know you i know you it was an old memory one that she couldnt quite place she felt something stir inside her there was a buzzing in her head she tried to shake it away but it grew louder her mouth filled with saliva and there was a growing pain between her eyes as though a pin were being inserted into her skull through the bridge of her nose her fingertips began to itch look at me when im talking to you said ronnie but she ignored him she was experiencing flashes of memory scenes from a series of old movies playing in her head except in each one she was the star killing melody mcready in a pond in idaho holding her head beneath the water as her back bucked and the last bubbles of air broke the surface telling wade pearce to close his eyes and open his mouth promising him something nice a big surprise and then jamming the gun between his teeth and pulling the trigger because she had been wrong about him she thought he might have been the onewhat onebut he was not and he had begun asking questions about melody his girlfriend and she had smelled the suspicion upon him bobby faraday kneeling in the dirt before her weeping pleading with her to come back to him as she walked behind him took the rope from his saddlebag and slipped the cord lightly around his neck bobby wouldnt leave her alone he wouldnt stop talking he was weak he had already tried to kiss her to hold her but his touch repelled her now because she knew that he wasnt the one for her she had to stop him from talking from trying to act upon his desires so the rope tightened and bobbystrong lean bobbystruggled against her but she was strong so strong stronger than anyone could have imagined a hand on a stove and the soft hiss as the gas began to seep out just as it had seeped out decades before in a house owned by a woman named jackie carr the girl waiting for the faradays to die one window op z ane windowen just enough so that she could take breaths of night air and then noise from the bedroom a body tumbling to the floor kathy faraday almost overcome by fumes trying to crawl to the kitchen to turn off the gas her husband already dead beside her the girl had been forced to sit on kathys back her mouth covered to protect her from the fumes until she was sure that the woman was no more leaving signs carving a nameher name her real namein places where others might find it no not others the other the one she loved and who loved her in return and dying dying as the bullets ripped into her and she tumbled into cold water dying while the other bled upon her as she slumped forward in the car seat and her head came to rest upon his lap dying over and over again yet always returning a hand tugged on her arm you fucking bitch i said but emily wasnt listening these were not her memories they belonged to another one who was not her yet was in her and at last she understood that the threat from which she had been fleeing for so long the shadow that had haunted her life had not been an external force an outside agency it had been inside her all along waiting for its moment to emerge emily raised her hands to her head pressing her fists into the sides of her skull she closed her eyes tightly and ground her teeth as she struggled against the gathering clouds trying in vain to save herself to hold on to her identity but it was too late the transformation was occurring she was no longer the girl she had once believed herself to be and soon she would cease to be forever she had a vision of a young woman drowning just as melody mcready had drowned fighting against the coming oblivion and she was both that woman and the one who was holding her down forcing her beneath the water the dying girl broke the water for the last time and looked up and in her eyes was reflected a being both old and terrible a black sexless thing with dark wings that unfurled from its back blocking out all light a creature that was so ugly it was almost beautiful or so beautiful that it had no place in this world it and emily died beneath its hand drowning in black water lost forever she had always been lost right from the moment of her birth when this strange wandering spirit had chosen her body for its abode hiding in the shadows of her consciousness waiting for the truth of itself to be revealed now the thing that she had become looked down at the little man who was holding on to her arm she could no longer understand what he was saying his words were merely a buzzing in her ear it didnt matter nothing that he said mattered she smelled him and sensed the foulness inside him that had forced the stench from his pores a serial abuser of women a man filled with hatred and strange violent appetites yet she did not judge him just as she would no more have judged a spider for consuming a fly or a dog for gnawing on its bone it was in his nature and she found its echo in her own his grip tightened spittle flew from his mouth but she saw only the movements of his lips he started to rise then paused he seemed to realize that something had changed that what he thought was familiar had suddenly become desperately alien she freed her arm and moved in closer to him she placed the palms of her hands on his face then leaned in to kiss z ad in to k him her open mouth closing on his ignoring the bitterness of him the stink of his breath his decaying teeth and yellowed gums he struggled against her for a moment but she was too strong for him she breathed into him her eyes fixed on his and she showed him what would become of him when he died shelley did not see her go nor harbaruk nor any of the others who had worked alongside her had their memories of that night been played back for them displayed on a screen so that they could see all that had passed before their eyes the girls departure would have appeared as a grayish mass moving through the bar an excised form loosely resembling a human being the big man in the arrow tshirt returned from the mens room his friend was sitting where he had left him staring vacantly at the wall his back to the bar time to go ronnie he said he patted ronnie on the back but the smaller man did not move hey ronnie he stepped in front of him and stopped speaking even in his drunken state he knew that his friend was broken beyond salvation ronnie was weeping tears of blood and water and his mouth was moving forming the same words over and over every capillary had burst in his eyes and the whites had turned entirely red twin black suns set against their skies he was whispering but his friend could still hear what he was saying im sorry said ronnie im sorry im sorry im sorry im sorry chapter twentynine the woman at a signal from epstein had brought more coffee once again black for him and a little milk for mine between us lay the two symbols what do they mean i asked they are letters of the enochian or adamical alphabet supposedly communicated to the english magician john dee and his associate over a period of decades during the sixteenth century communicated through occult workings although it may be a constructed language whatever its origins this first is the enochian letter und the equivalent of our letter a in this case it represents a name anmael jimmy gallagher struggling to remember animalno thats not it and what is anmael anmael is a demon one of the grigori or the sons of god said epstein the grigori are also known as watchers or the ones who never sleep according to elements of the apocrypha and the book of enoch in particular they are gigantic beings who in one version precipitated the great fall of the angels through the sin of lust he held up two hands before him but kept the thumb of his right hand tucked into the palm nine orders of angels he said all sexless and above reproach he moved his thumb adding it to the rest the tenth is the grigori of a different essence from the rest in form and sexual appetite similar to man and it is this order that fell in genesis it is the grigori who lusted after flesh and took themselves wives from among the children of men such theories have always been a matter of some dispute the great rabbi simeon ben yohai blessed be his name forbade his disciples to speak of such matters but i as you can see have no such qualms so anmael was one of the grigori he in turn is linked to semjaza one of the leaders of the order some say that the angel semjaza repented of its actions but that i suspect had more to do with a desire in the early church for a figure of repentance than anything else now we have twin angels anmael and semjaza but here christian and jewish views diverge in christian orthodoxy derived in part from jewish sources angels are traditionally viewed as sexless or in the case of the higher orders exclusively male the later jewish view by contrast allows the possibility of male and female angels the bibliographer hayyim azulal wrote in his milbar kedemot of that the angels are called women as it is written in zechariah verse nine then lifted i up mine eyes and looked and behold there came out two women the yalkut hadash says of angels we can speak both in masculine and in feminine the angels of a superior degree are called men and the angels of an inferior degree are called women at the very least then judaism has a more fluid concept of the sexuality of such beings the body of ackerman and the boy killed by your father at pearl river both bore the enochian a or und burned into their flesh the women by contrast were marked with the letter uam or s for semjaza he paused for a moment and seemed to consider something i have often thought he resumed that the children of men must have been a grave disappointment to such beings it was our flesh and our bodies that they desired yet our minds and our life spans must have been like those of insects by comparison but what if two angels one male one female could inhabit the bodies of a man and a woman and enjoyed their union as equals and as those bodies wear out they move on finding others to inhabit and then begin to seek each other once again sometimes it may take years it may even be that on occasion they fail to come together and the search continues in another body but they never stop looking for they cannot be content without each other anmael and semjaza soul mates if one could speak in such a way of beings without a soul or lovers of beings who cannot love and the price they pay for their union is i believe to do the bidding of another in this case that bidding is to bring an end to your existence another a controlling consciousness it may be that some of those whom you have encountered in the pastpudd brightwell our friend kittim perhaps even the traveling man among those whose human nature is not in dispute for did the traveling man not reference the book of enochalso did its bidding but without even knowing it think of the human body some of its processes are involuntary the heart beats the liver purifies the kidneys process the brain does not have to tell them to perform these z qerform th tasks but they serve the function of sustaining the body but to lift up a book to drive a car to fire a gun in order to end a life these are not involuntary functions so perhaps there will be some who perform services for another without being aware of it simply because their own acts of evil fulfill a larger purpose there will be others though who are specifically charged with certain tasks and hence their awareness will ultimately be greater and what is this controlling consciousness that we dont yet know we i said i take it youre not talking about you and me not entirely the collector spoke of my secret friends do you qualify i would be honored to think so and there are others yes although some might not be so willing to wear the mantle of friendship in the general sense of the word said epstein choosing his words with consummate diplomacy no cards at christmas no cards at any time and you wont tell me who they are for now its better that you dont know are you afraid that im going to make unwanted calls no but if you dont know their names then you cant reveal their identities to others like anmael if he chose to take his blade to me youre not alone in this matter mr parker granted you are an unusual man and i have not yet figured out why you have always been such an object of hatred and dare i say it attraction for such foul things but i have other people to think of too is that what unit five is code for what you call my secret friends for a moment epstein seemed taken aback but recovered himself unit five is just a name for what initially for the investigation into the traveling man since then its remit has broadened somewhat i believe you are part of that remit rain began to fall i looked over my shoulder and saw it darken the sidewalk and fall from the dark red awning over the doorway so what do i do about what about anmael or whoever thinks hes anmael hes waiting for for his other half to join him he must believe that she is close otherwise he wouldnt have revealed himself she in turn is leaving traces fo z qng tracesr him perhaps even without realizing it when she comes theyll make their move it wont be long not if anmael was prepared to kill wallace and mark the wall with his name he senses her approach and it will not be long before they are drawn together we could hide you away i suppose but that would be merely to delay the inevitable to amuse themselves and to draw you out they might hurt those close to you so what would you do in my shoes i would choose the ground upon which to fight you have your allies angel and the one who is presumably still lurking outside i can spare a couple of young men who will maintain a discreet distance from you yet keep you in sight tether yourself lightly in the place of your choosing and we will trap them when they come epstein stood our meeting was over i have one more question i said what might have been irritation flitted across epsteins face but he crushed it and assumed once more his habitual expression of benign amusement ask it elaine parkers child the one who died was it a boy or a girl it was a girl i believe she named it sarah it was taken from her and buried secretly i do not know where it was best that nobody knew sarah my half sister buried anonymously in an infants cemetery in order to protect me but i may have a final problem for you to consider in turn said epstein how did they find caroline carr on two occasions your father and jimmy gallagher hid her well once uptown before ackerman died beneath the wheels of a truck and then during her pregnancy still the man and the woman managed to track her down then someone found out that will parker had lied about the circumstances of his sons birth and they came back to try again it could have been one of your people i said jimmy told me about the meeting at the clinic one of them could have let it slip either deliberately or inadvertently no they did not said epstein and he spoke with such conviction that i did not contradict him and even were i to doubt them which i do not none of them was made aware of the nature of the threat to caroline carr until she died all they knew was that she was a young woman in trouble and in need of protection it is possible that the secret of your parentage might have leaked out we excised the details of elaine parkers dead child from her medical records and she severed all contact with the hospital and the obstetrician concerned with monitoring the early stages of her pregnancy their files were subsequently purged your blood group was a problem but that should have been a confidential matter between your family and their doctor and he appears to have been above reproach in all respects and then we warned your father to always be vigilant and he rarely failed to heed our warnings right up to the night that he fired his gun at pearl river i said yes until then you shouldnt have let him go back there alone i didnt z qidn rsquoknow what he was going to do said epstein i wanted them taken alive that way we could have contained them and ended this thing he put on his hat and coat and prepared to slip by me remember what i said i believe that someone who knew your father betrayed him it may be that you are at risk of betrayal too i commit you to the care of your colleague and he and his bodyguards departed leaving me with the darkhaired mute who smiled sadly at me before she began to extinguish the lights a bell rang somewhere in the back of the diner causing a red bulb to flash above the counter for the woman to see she put a finger to her lips telling me that i should remain quiet then disappeared behind a curtain seconds later she gestured with a finger asking me to join her a small video screen revealed a figure standing in the bay behind the store it was louis i indicated to her that i knew him and it was okay to let him in she opened the door theres a car out front said louis looks like it followed epstein here two men inside wearing suits figure feds more than cops they could have taken me while i was talking to epstein maybe they dont want to take you maybe they just want to find out where youre staying my landlord wouldnt like that which is why your landlord is standing here freezing his ass off i thanked the woman and joined louis she closed the door behind us doesnt say much said louis shes a deaf mute that would explain it goodlooking woman though if you like the quiet type you ever think of taking sensitivity training i said you think it would help probably not well there you go at the end of the street louis paused and glanced back at the next corner a cab appeared he hailed it and we pulled away with no signs of pursuit the cabdriver seemed more concerned with his bluetooth conversation than with us but to be certain we switched cabs before we returned to the safety of the apartment chapter thirty wrongly jimmy gallagher had never believed himself to be good at keeping secrets he was garrulous he liked to drink to tell stories when he drank his tongue ran away with itself and his filters disintegrated he would say things and wonder where they came from as though he were standing outside himself and watching a stranger speak but he knew the importance of keeping quiet about the origins of will parker rsq illôuos son and even in his cups parts of his own life had remained concealed still he had kept his distance from the boy and his mother after will killed himself better to stay away from them he felt than risk saying something in front of the boy that might cause him to suspect or offend his mother by speaking of things that were better left hidden in cluttered careworn hearts and despite his many flaws in all the years since elaine parker had left for maine with her son he had never once spoken of what he knew but he had always suspected that charlie parker would come looking for him it was in his nature to question to seek out truths he was a hunter and there was a tenacity to him that would ultimately jimmy believed cost him his life sometime in the future he would overstep the mark and look into matters that were best left unexamined and something would reach out and destroy him jimmy was certain of it perhaps the nature of his own identity and the secret of his parentage might well prove to be that mistake he sipped the last of his wine and toyed with the glass causing candlecast patterns to flicker upon the walls there was still a half bottle left beside the sink a week ago he would have finished it off and maybe opened another one for good measure but not now some of the urge to drink more than he should had fallen away he understood that it was to do with the clearing of his conscience he had told charlie parker all that he knew and now he was absolved and yet he also felt that in confessing some connection between them had been severed it was not a bond of trust exactly for he and charlie had never been close and never would be he had sensed that from an early age the boy had been uneasy around him but then jimmy had never really figured out how to relate to kids his sister was more than fifteen years older than he was and he had grown up feeling like an only child then too his parents had been old when he was born old he chuckled what had they been thirtyeight thirtynine still there had always been a lack of understanding between his parents and their son even though he had loved them both dearly and the chasm between them had only widened as he had grown older they had never discussed his sexuality although he had always understood that his mother and perhaps his father too realized that their son was never going to marry any of the girls who occasionally accompanied him to dance halls or to the movies and while he himself recognized his urges he had never acted upon them it was partly out of fear he thought he did not want his fellow officers to know that he was gay they were his family his true family he did not want to do anything to alienate them now in retirement he remained a virgin funny but he found it hard to equate that word with a man who was now in his late sixties it was a description that should be applied to young men and women on the brink of new experiences not older ones oh he was still energetic and he still sometimes thought that it might benice interestingto start a relationship but that was the problem he wasnt sure where to start he wasnt some blushing bride waiting to be deflowered he was a man with a certain knowledge of life both good and bad it was too late he thought to surrender himself now to someone with a greater degree of experience in matters of sex and love he carefully vacuumsealed the bottle of red wine and placed it in the refrigerator it was a hint that hed picked up from the local liquor store and it worked fine as long as he remembered to let the wine warm up for a time before he began drinking it again the next day he turned off the lights doublelocked the front and back doors a zhtswornd went to bed he managed to incorporate the noise into his dream at first the way he sometimes did when the alarm went off and he was so deep in sleep that bells began ringing in his dreams in turn in the dream a wineglass fell from the table and shattered on the floor it wasnt his wineglass though and it wasnt quite his kitchen although it resembled it in ways it was now bigger the dark corners stretching away into infinity the tiles on the floor were the tiles from the house in which he had grown up and his mother was nearby he could hear her singing even though he could not see her he woke there was silence for a time then the faintest disturbance a sliver of glass caught underfoot scraping against a tile he climbed silently from his bed and opened his bedside cabinet the lay on the shelf cleaned and loaded he padded across the room in his underwear and the boards did not creak beneath his feet he knew this place intimately every crack and join of it even though it was an old house he could move through it without making a sound he stood at the top of the stairs and waited all was silent again but still he sensed the presence of another the darkness became oppressive to him and suddenly he was frightened he debated calling out a warning and by doing so cause whoever was below to flee but he knew that if he did so his voice would tremble and he would reveal his fear better to keep going he had a gun he was an excop if he was forced to shoot then his own people would look after him screw the other guy he made his way down the stairs the kitchen door was open a single shard of glass shone in the moonlight jimmys hand was shaking and he tried to still it by assuming a doublehanded grip on the gun there were only two rooms on the lower level the living room and the kitchen linked by a pair of interconnecting doors he could see that those doors were still closed he swallowed and thought that he could taste some of that evenings wine in his mouth it had gone sour like vinegar his bare feet felt cold and he realized that the basement door was open that was how the intruder had entered and maybe that was how he had left after the wineglass broke jimmy winced he knew that was wishful thinking someone was there he could feel him the living room was closest he should search it first so that whoever was there could not come from behind him when he searched the kitchen he glanced through the crack in the door the drapes were not drawn but the streetlight outside was broken and only a thin stream of moonlight filtered through the drapes so it was hard to make out anything at all he stepped inside quickly and immediately knew that he had made a mistake the shadows altered and then the door struck him hard knocking him off balance as he tried to adjust the position of his gun and fire there was a burning at his wrists skin was opened tendons severed the gun fell to the floor blood from his wound sprinkling it something hit him once on the crown of the head then again and as he lost consciousness he thought that he glimpsed a long flat blade when he came to he was lying on his belly in the kitchen his hands tied behind his back his feet bound and drawn up to his buttocks then linked to the ropes on his hands so that he could not move he felt cold air on his bare skin but not as badly as before the basement door had been closed again and now only a slight draft came from the gap between the kitchen d z drcouoor and the floor the tiles were freezing though he felt weak his hands and face were slick with blood and his head ached he tried to cry for help until a blade touched his cheek the figure beside him had been so quiet and still that he had not even sensed its presence until it moved no said a mans voice one that he did not recognize what do you want to talk talk about what charlie parker his father his mother jimmys movement had caused the blood to flow once again from the wound on his head it trickled into his eyes stinging them talk to him yourself you want to know anything i havent seen charlie parker in years not since an apple was forced into his mouth pushed in so hard and so far that he could not expel it or even sever it by biting down on it he stared at his attackers face and thought that he had never seen eyes so dark and so merciless a piece of broken wineglass was held before his eyes jimmys gaze drifted from it to the symbol that seemed to be burned into the skin of the mans forearm then back to the glass again he had seen that mark before and he knew now what he was facing animal amale anmael youre lying im going to show you what happens to faggot cops who tell lies with one hand anmael gripped the back of jimmys neck holding his head down while the other hand pushed the broken stem of the wineglass into the skin between his shoulder blades against the apple jimmy began to scream chapter thirtyone jimmy gallagher was discovered by esmerelda the el salvadoran woman who came to his house twice every week to clean when the police arrived they found her weeping but otherwise calm it turned out that shed seen a lot of dead men back home and her capacity for shock was limited nevertheless she could not stop crying for jimmy who had always been gentle and kind and funny with her and had paid her more than was necessary with a bonus at christmas it was louis who told me he came to the apartment shortly after am the story had already made the news shows on radio and tv although the victims name had not been confirmed but it hadnt taken louis long to find out that it was jimmy gallagher i didnt say anything for a time i couldnt he had kept his secrets out of love for my father and mother and i believe out of a misplaced concern for me of all my fathers friends it was jimmy who had been the most loyal to him i contacted santos the detective who had taken me to hobart street on the night that mickey wallaces body had been discovered it wa s bad he replied someone took his time in killing him i tried to call you but your phone was out of service he told me that jimmys body had been brought to the brooklyn office of the chief medical examiner at kings county hospital on clarkson avenue and i offered to meet him there santos was smoking a cigarette outside when the cab pulled up to the mortuary youre a hard man to find he said you lose your cell phone something like that we need to talk when this is done he tossed the butt and i followed him inside he and a second detective named travis stood at either side of the body while the attendant pulled back the sheet i was beside santos he was watching the attendant travis was watching me jimmy had been cleaned up but there were multiple cuts to his face and upper body one of the incisions to his left cheek was so deep that i could see his teeth through the wound turn him over travis said you want to help me said the attendant hes a heavy guy travis was wearing blue plastic gloves as was santos i was barehanded i watched as all three of them shifted jimmys body turning him first on his side and then onto his chest the word fag had been carved into jimmys back some of the cuts were more jagged than the rest but all were deep there must have been a lot of blood and a lot of pain what was used it was santos who replied the stem of a broken wineglass for the letters and a blade of some kind for the rest we didnt find the weapon but there were unusual wounds to the skull gently he moved jimmys head then parted the hair at the crown of his head to reveal a pair of overlapping squareshaped contusions to the scalp santos made his right hand into a fist and brought it down twice through the air im guessing a big knife of some kind maybe a machete or something similar we figure the killer hit jimmy a couple of times with the hilt to knock him out then tied him up and went to work with the sharp edge there were apples beside his head with bite marks in them that was why nobody heard him screaming he did not speak casually or with a hint of callousness instead he looked tired and sad this was an excop and one who was remembered fondly by many the details of the killing the word cut into his back would have circulated by now the sadness and anger at his death would be tempered slightly by the circumstances a fag killing that was how some would speak of it who knew that jimmy gallagher was queer they would ask after all theyd been drunk alongside him theyd shared comments with him about passing women hell hed even dated some and all that time he was hiding the truth and some would say that they had suspected all along and wonder what he had done to bring this upon himself there would be whispers he made an advance to the wrong guy he touched a kid ah a kid are you treating this as a hate crime i asked travis shrugged and spoke for the first time it might come down to that either way we have to ask questions that jimmy wouldnt have wanted asked well need to find out if there were lovers or casual flings or if he was into anything extreme there wont be any lovers i said you seem pretty sure of that i am jimmy was always kind of ashamed and always frightened of what of someone finding out of his friends knowing they were all cops and old school i dont think he trusted most of them to stand by him he thought theyd laugh or turn their backs on him he didnt want to be a joke he preferred being alone to that well if its not down to his lifestyle then what is it i thought for a moment apples i said what said travis you said you found applesmore than onebeside him three maybe the killer thought that jimmy might bite through after a while or maybe he stopped after each letter why to ask questions about what it was santos who answered about him he said pointing at me he thinks this is connected to the wallace thing dont you wallace didnt have fag cut into his flesh said santos but i could tell that he was playing devils advocate they were both tortured to make them talk i said and you knew them both said santos why dont you tell us again what youre doing down here im trying to find out why my father killed two teenagers in a car in i said and did jimmy gallagher have the answer i didnt reply i just shook my head what do you think he told his killer asked travis i looked at the wounds that had been inflicted on him i would have talked its a myth that men can stand up to torture eventually everybody breaks whatever he could to make it stop i said how did he die he choked a wine bottle was forced into his mouth neck first thats going to hang weight on the hate crime side it was whatchacallit phallic or thats how it will play it was vindictive humiliating an honorable man had been left naked and bound with a brand upon his back that would mark him among his fellow cops casting shadows upon the memory of the individual they had known i believed then that it wasnt about what jimmy gallagher knew or did not know he had been punished for remaining silent and nothing that he could have said would have spared him from what was to come santos nodded at the attendant together they moved jimmy onto his back and covered his face once again then restored him to his place among the numbered dead the door was closed on him and we left outside santos lit another cigarette he offered one to travis who accepted you know he said if youre right and this isnt a hate deal then he died because of you what are you keeping back from us what did it matter now it was all coming to a close go back and look at the files on the pearl river killings i said the boy who died had a mark on his forearm it looked like it had been burned into the skin that mark is the same one that was found on the wall at hobart street drawn in wallaces blood my guess is that somewhere in jimmys house youll find a similar mark travis and santos exchanged a look where was it i said on his chest said santos written in blood weve been warned to keep quiet about it i guess im telling you because he thought about it well i dont know why im telling you so what was all that about in there you dont believe this was a hate crime you know this is connected to wallaces death we just wanted to hear your side of the story first said travis its called detecting we ask you questions you dont answer them we get frustrated i hear its an established pattern with you we know what the symbol means said santos ignoring travis we found a guy at the institute of advanced theology who explained it for us its the enochian a i said how long have you known not long i didnt know when you showed it to me what are we looking at asked travis calming down some now that he realized that neither santos nor i was going to be drawn by his baiting a cult ritual killings and whats the connection to you beyond the fact that you knew both of the victims asked santos i dont know i said thats what im trying to find out why not just torture you said travis i mean i could understand the impulse i ignored him theres a man named asa durand he lives out in pearl riv zou diver i gave them the address he says a guy was casing his property a while back and asking about what happened there asa durand lives in the house where i lived before my father killed himself might be worth sending out a sketch artist to test durands memory santos took a long drag on his cigarette and expelled some of the smoke in my direction those things will kill you i said i was you id worry about my own mortality said santos i assume that youre lying low but turn your damn cell phone back on dont make us haul you in and lock you up for your own protection were letting him walk asked travis incredulously i think hes told us all that hes going to for now said santos isnt that right mr parker and its more than we could get from our own people unit five i said santos looked surprised you know what it is do you some kind of security clearance that a regular wage earner like me doesnt have i guess thats about the size of it i dont know much more about it than you do somehow i dont believe thats true but i suppose that all we can do now is wait because my guess is that your name is on the same list that jimmy gallagher and mickey wallace were on when whoever killed them gets around to you either someone will be tagging your toe or theirs come on well give you a ride to the subway the sooner youre out of brooklyn the happier ill be they dropped me at the subway station be seeing you said santos dead or alive said travis i watched them drive away they hadnt spoken to me in the car and i hadnt cared i was too busy thinking about the word that had been carved into jimmy gallaghers back how had his killer come to the conclusion that jimmy was gay he had kept his secrets close all his life his own and those of others i only became aware of his sexuality from things my mother said after my fathers death when i was a little older and a little more mature and she had assured me that few of jimmys colleagues had known about it in fact she said only two people knew for certain that jimmy was gay one of them was my father the other was eddie grace chapter thirtytwo amanda grace answered the door her hair was tied loosely with a red band and her face bore no trace of cosmetics she was wearing a pair of sweatpants and an old shirt and she was bathed in perspiration n p in her right hand she held a kitchen plunger great she said when she saw me just great i take it this isnt a good time you could have called ahead first i might even have had time to put the plunger away id like to talk to your father again she stepped back inviting me inside he was real tired after your last visit she said is it important i think it is its about jimmy gallagher isnt it in a way i followed her into the kitchen there was a pungent smell coming from the sink and i could see dirty water that wasnt draining somethings backed up down there she said she handed over the plunger i slipped off my jacket and went to work on the sink while she rested a hip against the sideboard and watched whats going on charlie what do you mean we watch the news we saw what happened at your old home and we heard about jimmy theyre connected arent they i could feel the water starting to move i stepped back and watched it disappear down the sink did your father have anything to say about it he seemed sad about jimmy they used to be friends any idea why they fell out she looked away i dont think my father liked the way jimmy lived his life is that what he told you no i guessed it for myself you still havent answered my question whats going on i turned to her and held her gaze until she looked away damn you she said like i told you id appreciate a few minutes with eddie she wiped a hand across her brow her frustration palpable hes awake but hes still in bed itll take him a while to get dressed theres no need to go to that trouble i can talk to him in his room it wont take long she still seemed to be debating the wisdom of allowing me to see him i could sense her unease youre different today she said from from the last time you were here i dont think i like it i need to talk to him amanda then ill be gone and it wont matter z l heif you ever liked me she nodded upstairs second door on the right knock before you go in my tapping on eddie graces door was answered by a hoarse croak the drapes were closed in the room and it stank of illness and decay eddie graces head was supported by a pair of large white pillows he wore bluestriped pajamas and the dim light somehow accentuated the pallor of his skin so that he seemed almost to glow where he lay i closed the door behind me and looked down on him you came back he said there was a hint of what might have been a smile on his face but there was no joy to it instead it was a knowing unpleasant thing an expression of malevolence i figured you would why he didnt even try to lie because theyre coming for you and youre scared do you know what was done to jimmy i can guess he was carved up he was tortured and then killed all because he kept his secrets all because he was a friend to my father and to me he should have picked his friends more carefully i guess so you were his friend eddie laughed softly it sounded like air being forced from a corpse and smelled just as bad it brought on a fit of coughing and he gestured for the covered plastic cup on the bedside locker the kind that little children used with a raised perforated lip from which to drink i held it for him as he sucked from it one of his hands touched mine and i was surprised by how cold it was i was his friend said eddie then he had to tell your father and me about himself and after that i cut him loose he was a faggot barely a man he disgusted me so you cut him off id have cut his balls off if i could id have told everyone what he was he shouldnt have been allowed to wear that uniform so why didnt you i asked because they didnt want me to who didnt anmael and semjaza although that wasnt what they called themselves not the first time they came to me i never found out the womans name she never said much the man was called peter but later i found out his true name he did most of the talking how did they find you i had weaknesses not like jimmys i had a mans weaknesses i liked them young he smiled again his lips were cracked and his remaining teeth were rotting in their gums girls not boys he continued never boys they found out thats what they do they find your weaknesses and they use them against you a carrot and a stick they threatened zp anmael wanted to know where she was i didnt ask why i found out where will had stashed her on the upper east side then anmael died and the woman disappeared they kept moving caroline carr around after that your father and jimmy but they did it quietly i told semjaza to follow jimmy because your father trusted him more than anyone else i thought that they just wanted to follow her maybe steal the child i was as surprised as anyone when they killed her it was strange but i believed him he had no reason to lie not now and he was not seeking absolution he spoke of it as if it were an event that he had witnessed but in which he had played no direct part when will came back from maine with a baby boy i was suspicious i knew all about his wifes medical history about the problems shed had conceiving and carrying a child it was all too neat but by then id fallen out with jimmy i was still on good terms with your old man or i thought i was but something changed between us i suppose jimmy must have spoken to him and he chose jimmy over me i didnt care fuck him fuck em both i heard nothing for maybe fifteen years i didnt expect anything else after all they were dead anmael and the woman and id found ways to keep myself satisfied without them then a boy and a girl showed up at my place they sat outside in a car watching the house i was bowling and my wife called me told me she was worried i came home and i swear i knew it was them i knew before they even showed me the marks on their arms before they started talking about things that must have happened before they were born conversations that id had with anmael and the woman before they died i mean it was them in another form i didnt doubt it i could see it in their eyes i told them what i believed about the boy will and his wife were raising but they already seemed to have their own suspicions that was what had brought them back they knew that the boy was still alive that you were still alive so i helped them again and still you wouldnt die his eyes closed i thought he might have drifted off to sleep but then he spoke his eyes still shut i cried when your old man killed himself he said i liked him even if he did cut me loose why couldnt you just have died back in that clinic if you had then it would all have ended there and then you just wont die his eyes opened again but this time its different theyre not kids hunting you and theyve learned from their mistakes thats the thing about them they remember each time theyve come a little bit closer to succeeding but its urgent now they want you dead why he stared at me his eyebrows raised he looked amused i dont think they know zloshei he said you might as well ask why a white blood cell attacks an infection its what its programmed to do to fight a threat and neutralize it not mine though mine are screwed where are they ive only seen him the other the woman she wasnt there he was waiting for her willing her to come to him thats the way they are they live for each other who is he whats he calling himself i dont know he didnt say he came here no it was while i was still in the hospital but not so long ago he brought me candy it was like meeting an old friend did you feed jimmy to him no i didnt have to they knew all about jimmy from way back because of you what does it matter now it mattered to jimmy do you know how much he suffered before he died eddie waved a hand in a gesture of dismissal but he would not meet my eyes describe him to me he indicated once again that he needed water and i gave it to him his voice had grown hoarser and hoarser as he spoke now it was barely a whisper no he said i wont tell you and anyway do you really think any of this will help you i wouldnt tell you anything if i thought it would i dont care about you or about what happened to jimmy im almost done with this life ive been promised my reward for what ive done he lifted his head from the pillow as though to confide some great secret their master is good and kind he said almost to himself then sank back on the bed exhausted his breathing grew shallower and he drifted off to sleep amanda was waiting for me at the bottom of the stairs her lips were set so firmly that there were wrinkles around her mouth did you get what you wanted from him yes confirmation hes an old man whatever he did in the past hes paid more than enough for it in suffering you know amanda i dont believe thats true her face flushed red get out of here the best thing you ever did was leave this town and that much at least was true chapter thirtythree the woman wh o was now emily kindler in name only arrived at the port authority bus terminal two days after jimmy gallagher was killed after leaving the bar she had spent an entire day alone in her little apartment ignoring the ringing of the telephone her date with chad now forgotten chad himself reduced to nothing more than a fleeting memory from another life once the doorbell rang downstairs but she did not answer it instead she reconstructed past lives and thought about the man whom she had seen on the tv screen in the bar and she knew that when she found him then so too would she find her beloved using a poker she carefully burned her flesh she knew the exact place upon which to work for she could almost see the pattern hiding beneath her skin when she was done she bore the old mark in time she left for the city at the bus station it took her almost an hour of looking lost before she was approached while she was freshening up for the third time in the womens restroom a young woman not much older than she was approached her and asked if she was okay the womans name was carole coemer but everyone called her cassie she was blond and pretty and clean and looked nineteen even though she was actually twentyseven her job was to scout the bus station for new female arrivals particularly those who looked lost or alone and befriend them she would tell them that she was new in town herself and offer to buy them a cup of coffee or something to eat cassie always carried a backpack even though it was filled with newspapers topped off with a pair of jeans and some underwear and tshirts just in case she had to open it to convince the more skeptical of the waifs and strays if they didnt have somewhere to stay or if nobody was really expecting them in town she would propose that they spend the night with a friend of cassies and then try to find somewhere more long term the next day cassies friend was called earle yiu and he maintained a number of cheap apartments across the city but the principal one was on thirtyeighth and ninth above a grimy bar called the yellow pearl which was also owned by earle yiu this was a little joke on earles part as he was part japanese and yellow pearl wasnt a million miles removed from yellow peril earle was very good at assessing the vulnerabilities of young women although not quite as good as cassie coemer who even earle had to admit was a predator of the first degree so cassie would take the girlor girls if her day had been particularly productiveto meet earle and earle would welcome them and arrange to have food delivered or if he was in the mood he sometimes cooked for the girls himself it would usually be something simple and tasty like teriyaki with rice beers would be offered and a little pot maybe even something stronger then earle if he thought the new arrival was suitable and sufficiently vulnerable would offer to let her and cassie stay in the apartment for a couple of days telling them to take it easy that he knew someone who might be looking for waitresses the next day cassie would drift away isolating the new arrival after two or three days earles disposition would alter he would arrive early in the morning or late at night and wake the girl he would demand payment for his hospitality and when the girl couldnt payand they could never pay enough to satisfy earlehe would make his move most ended up turning tricks once earle and his buddies had broken them in first if that was necessary usually in one of earles other apartments particularly promising can z anovedidates would be sold off elsewhere or escorted to other cities and towns where new blood was scarce the most unfortunate simply disappeared off the face of the earth for earle knew men and some women with very particular needs earle was careful in how he used cassie he didnt want her to draw any attention to herself or to become overly familiar to the port authority cops at the bus station or the amtrak station often he would let months go by without putting her into the field contenting himself with the plentiful supply of chinese and korean women who were easily available to him and harder for the authorities to track once they became part of his operation but there was always a need for caucasians and negroes too and earle liked to provide a little variety and so it was that cassie approached emily and asked if she was okay then said you new in town emily stared at her and cassie squirmed for a moment she was sure that shed made a mistake this girl looked young but like cassies her looks were deceptive and she was older than she at first appeared the problem for cassie was that for an instant she experienced a kind of atavistic rush a sense that this girl was not just old but very old it was there in her eyes which were very very dark and in a musty odor that seemed to hang about her cassie was ready to back away cutting her losses when the girls demeanor subtly changed she smiled and cassie was captivated by her she stared deep into the girls eyes and felt that she had never seen anyone quite so beautiful earle would be pleased with this one and cassies reward would be commensurately greater as a consequence yes said emily im new very new im looking for a place to stay do you think you can help me sure i can help you said cassie id love to she thought id do anything for you anything whats your name the girl thought about the question emily she said at last cassie knew that it was a lie but it didnt matter to her earle would give her a new name anyway if she worked out im cassie well cassie said emily i guess im following you together the girls walked to earle yius apartment earle wasnt there which surprised cassie but she had a key and a prepared story about how shed been there earlier in the day and how earle had given her a key and told her to come back because the apartment was being cleaned emily just smiled and all was right in cassies world when they were inside the apartment cassie offered to show emily around there wasnt much to show as the apartment was very small consisting only of one modestly sized area that doubled as living room and kitchen and a pair of tiny bedrooms each barely large enough for a single mattress and this is the bathroom said cassie opening the door onto a room that was so small the sink and toilet almost overlapped from opposite walls with a shower stall that was little bigger than an upright coffin emily gripped cassie by the hair and struck her face hard against the edge of the sink she did it again zp higg and again until cassie was dead then left her lying against the wall before closing the bathroom door carefully behind her she took a seat on the old foulsmelling couch in the living area and turned on the tv flicking through the channels until she found the local news she turned up the volume when the anchorman returned to the story of jimmy gallaghers killing despite the best efforts of the cops and the fbi someone had been speaking out of turn a reporter came onscreen and spoke of a possible connection between the death of gallagher and the killing of one mickey wallace at hobart street emily knelt down and touched the screen with her fingertips she was still in that position when earle yiu entered he was in his forties carrying a little extra weight that he hid with wellcut suits who are you he asked emily smiled at him im a friend of cassies she said earle smiled in return well any friend of cassies is a friend of mine he said where is she in the bathroom instinctively earle glanced in the direction of the bathroom which was just to his left his brow furrowed there was a dark spreading stain on the carpet where it met the door cassie he knocked once cassie you in there he tried the handle and the door opened he was still taking in the sight of cassie coemers ruined face when a kitchen knife entered his back and pierced his heart when she was sure that earle yiu was dead emily searched him and found a with a taped butt and nearly seven hundred dollars in cash she took yius cell phone and made a call when she ended it she knew where jimmy gallagher was to be buried and when there were strong locks on the apartment door as much to prevent anyone from leaving as from entering without permission emily secured them all then turned off the television and sat still and silent upon the couch as day became night and night at last gave way to morning chapter thirtyfour choose your ground that was what epstein had told me choose the place where you will confront them i could have run i could have hidden myself away and hoped that they would not find me but they had always found me before i could have chosen to return to maine and face them there but how could i have slept fearing at any time that they might come for me how could i have worked at the bear knowing that my presence there might put others at risk so i spoke to epstein and i talked with angel and louis and i chose the ground upon which i would fight i would draw them to me and we would end it at last they gave jimmy the inspectors funeral the full nypd works even better than that which they had given my father six whitegloved patrolmen carried his flagdraped coffin on their shoulders from s oult dominics roman catholic church their shields masked by black ribbons as the coffin passed by cops old and new some in street uniform some in dress blues others in the oldman coats and hats of retirement saluted as one nobody smiled nobody spoke all were quiet a couple of years before a westchester da had been seen laughing and chatting with a state senator while the body of a slain cop was being carried from a church in the bronx until a cop told her to shut up she had done so instantly but the slight had not been forgotten there was a way these things were done and you screwed with it at your peril jimmy was buried at holy cross cemetery on tilden in a plot alongside his mother and father his older sister who now lived in colorado was his closest surviving relative she was divorced so she stood by the graveside with her three children one of them jimmys nephew francis who had come to our home on the night of the pearl river killings and she wept for the brother she had not seen in five years the emerald society pipes and drums played steal away and nobody spoke ill of him even though the news of what had been carved into his body had by then leaked out some might whisper later and let them whisper such men were worth little but not now not on that day today he would be remembered as a cop and a wellliked one and i was there too in plain sight because i knew they would be watching in the hope that i might appear i mingled i spoke with those whom i recognized after the burial i went to a bar named donaghys with men who had served alongside jimmy and my father and we exchanged stories about both men and they told me things about will parker that made me love him even more because they had loved him in turn all the time i stayed close to groups i didnt even go to the restroom alone and i watched what i was drinking even though i gave the impression that i was matching the others beer for beer shot for shot it was easy enough to disguise for they were more concerned with one another than with me even though i was welcome in their company one of them a former sergeant named griesdorf did ask me about the rumored connection between mickey wallaces death and what had happened to jimmy and for a time there was an awkward silence until a redfaced cop with dyedblack hair said jesus stevie this isnt the time or the place lets drink to remember then drink to forget and the moment passed i spotted the girl shortly after pm she was slim and pretty with long black hair in the dim light of donaghys she looked younger than she was and the bartender might have been forced to card her had she asked for a beer i had seen her at the cemetery laying flowers on a grave not far from where jimmy was being buried i had seen her again walking down tilden after the funeral but so were many other people and i had noticed her more because of her looks than because of any suspicion i might have had of her now here she was in donaghys nibbling at a salad a book on the bar before her a mirror facing her so that she could see all that was happening behind her a couple of times i thought i saw her glancing at me it might have been nothing but then she smiled at me when i caught her looking it was a comeon or the appearance of one her eyes were very dark griesdorf had spotted her too girl likes you charlie he said go on were old men we need to live vicariously through the young well look after your coat hell you must be dying under there take it off son i stood and swayed no im done i said i wouldnt be good for much anyway i shook hands with them all and dropped fifty bucks on the table a round of the best i said for my old man and for jimmy there was a cheer and as i left them i staggered griesdorf reached out a hand to help me you okay there i didnt eat much today i said dumb of me think you could get the bartender to call me a cab sure where do you want to go bay ridge i said hobart street griesdorf looked at me oddly you sure about that yeah im sure i handed him the fifty dollars call those whiskeys while youre there you want one for the road no thanks if i have one more ill be lying on the road he took the money i leaned back against a pillar and watched him go i saw him call over the bartender and could hear a little of what passed between them from where i stood there was no music playing in donaghys and the afterwork crowd had not yet begun to arrive if i could hear what was being said at the bar so could anyone else the cab arrived ten minutes later by then the girl was gone the cab dropped me outside my former home the cabdriver looked at the fluttering crime scene tape and asked if i wanted him to wait he looked relieved when i said no there were no cops watching the house under ordinary circumstances there would have been at least one officer on duty to secure the scene but these were not ordinary circumstances i walked around to the side of the house the gate to the backyard had been secured loosely with a chain and some tape but the chain lacked a lock it was there purely for show the kitchen door though had been secured with a new lock and hasp but it was the work of a moment to open it with the little electric rake that angel had given me it sounded very loud in the stillness of the late evening and as i entered the house i saw a light go on somewhere nearby i closed the door and waited until the light was extinguished and the darkness grew deeper i flicked on my little maglite its beam hooded with masking tape so that it would not attract attention if someone happened to look at the back of the house anmaels mark had been removed from the wall probably in case reporters or the terminally curious took it upon themselves to take surreptitious photographs of the kitchen the position in which mickey wallace had been found was still marked and the cheap linoleum was stained with his dried blood my beam picked up the kitchen cabinets more modern than those that had been in the house when i lived there yet also cheaper and flimsier and the gas stove now disconnected there was no other furniture apart from a single wooden chair painted a sickly green that stood against the far wall three people had died in this room nobody would ever live here again the best thing for everyone would be to tear the house down an z aouse downd start afresh but in the current climate that was unlikely to happen and so it would fall further and further into decay and children would dare one another to run into the yard and taunt its ghosts at halloween but sometimes it is not places that are haunted but people i knew then why they had returned those remnants of my wife and daughter i think i had understood from the moment that wallaces body was discovered here and i sensed that he might not have been alone and uncomforted in his final moments that whatever he had seen or thought he had seen while prowling around my property at scarborough had come to him here in a different form there was a sense of expectation about the house as i passed through the kitchen and when i touched the handle on the door my fingertips tingled as though a small electrical charge had just run through them the front door had been taped from the outside but only the door lock and the security dead bolt held it closed from the inside i opened them both and left the door slightly ajar there was no wind so it stayed as it was i climbed the stairs and wandered through the empty rooms a ghost among ghosts and wherever i stopped i recreated our home in my mind adding beds and closets mirrors and pictures transforming it from what it now was to what it once had been there was the shadow of a dressing table against the wall of the bedroom that susan and i had once shared and i brought it back filling its surface with bottles and cosmetics and a hairbrush with blond strands still caught in its bristles our bed returned two pillows hard against the wall an imprint of a womans back upon them as though susan had only just absented herself a book lay with its cover exposed on the bedsheet lectures by the poet e e cummings it was susans comfort book cummingss descriptions of his life and work interspersed with a selection of poems only some of them written by the poet himself i could almost smell her perfume on the air across the hallway was another smaller bedroom and as i watched the vibrancy of its colors was restored the dull scarred walls becoming a clean vista of yellow and cream like a summer meadow ringed with white flowers the walls were covered mostly with handdrawn pictures although there was one large painting of a circus above the small single bed and another smaller painting of a girl with a dog that was bigger than she was the girls arms were curled around the dogs neck her face buried in its fur and the dog stared out from the frame as if daring anyone to interfere with its charge the bright blue sheets on the bed were pulled back and i could see the outline of a small body against the mattress and the dent in the pillow where until seemingly only moments before a childs head had rested the carpet beneath my feet was a deep blue this was my home on the night that susan and jennifer died restored to me now as i felt them return as they all drew closer the dead and the living i heard a sound from downstairs and stepped into the hallway the light in our bedroom flickered and then went out something shifted inside i did not stop to see what it was but i thought i saw in the shadows a figure moving and a hint of scent came to me i stopped at the top of the stairs and i heard a sound from behind me as of small bare feet running across carpeted floors a child moving from her room to be with her mother but it might simply have been the boards settling beneath my feet or a rat disturbed from its lair beneath the floor i descended at the bottom of z ahe bottom the stairs a poinsettia stood upon a small mahogany table sheltered from drafts by the coatrack it was the only houseplant that susan had been able to keep alive and she was immensely proud of it checking it daily and being careful to keep it watered just enough so as not to drown it on the night that they had died it had been knocked from its stand and the first thing that i saw when i entered the house was its roots lying amid scattered earth now it was as it had always been cared for and loved i reached out for it and my fingers passed through its leaves there was a man standing in the kitchen close to the back door as i watched he moved forward a step and the moonlight filtering through the window caught his face hansen his hands were hidden in the pockets of his overcoat youre a long way from home detective i said and you couldnt stay away from yours he replied must have changed a lot since then no i said it hasnt changed at all he looked puzzled youre a strange man i never understood you well i know now why you never liked me but even as i said the words i felt that something was wrong this wasnt how it was supposed to be hansen didnt belong here a puzzled look came across his face as if he had just realized the same thing his body stretched as though he were feeling a twinge at his back he opened his mouth and a trickle of blood spilled from one corner he coughed wetly and more blood came a cloud of it that sprayed the wall as he was pushed forward collapsing to his knees his right hand fumbled at his pocket as he tried to withdraw his gun but his strength failed him and he fell flat on his stomach his eyes half closed his breathing growing shallower and shallower the man who had attacked him stepped over his body he was in his midtwenties twentysix years old to be exact about it i knew because i had hired him i had worked alongside him in the great lost bear i had seen his kindness to customers witnessed his easy way with the line chefs and the waitstaff and for all that time he had kept his true nature hidden hello gary i said or do you prefer your other name gary maser held the sharpened machete in one hand in the other was a gun it doesnt matter he said theyre just names ive had more of them than you could imagine youre deluded i said somebody has been whispering lies to you youre a nobody you cut up jimmy and you killed mickey wallace in that kitchen back there but that doesnt make you special youre barely human but that doesnt mean youre an angel believe that if you like he said its of no consequence but my words sounded hollow to me i had chosen this place in which to confront what had been hunting me transforming it in my mind to what it once was but something in gary m z ang in garaser seemed to sense that and respond to it for an instant i saw what my father had seen on that night in pearl river before he pulled the trigger i saw what had concealed itself within maser eating away at him until at last there was nothing left of him but an empty shell his face became a mask transparent and temporary behind it a dark mass moved old and withered and filled with rage shadows curled around it like black smoke polluting the room fouling the moonlight and i knew in my heart that more than my life was at risk here whatever torments maser might inflict upon me in this house they would be nothing compared with what was to come when my life was ended he took another step forward even in the moonlight i could see that his eyes were blacker than i remembered pupil and iris forming what appeared to be a single dark mass why me i asked what have i done it is not only what you have done but what you may do and what is that how can you know whats to come we sensed the threat that you posed he sensed it who who sent you maser shook his head no more he said and then almost tenderly time to stop running close your eyes and i will bring all of your grief to an end i tried to laugh im touched by your concern i needed time we all needed time youve been patient i said how long have you worked with me five months i was waiting he said for what he smiled and his face changed there was a radiance to it that had not been there before for her he said i turned slowly as i felt a draft at my back in the fully open doorway stood the darkhaired woman from the bar like gary s her eyes now seemed entirely black she too held a gun a silver the shadows that formed around her were like dark wings against the night so long she whispered but her eyes were fixed on the man across from her not on me so very long i understood then that they had come to this place separately drawn by me and the promise of seeing each other again but this was the first time they had met the first time if epstein was to be believed since my father had pulled the trigger on them at a patch of waste ground in pearl river but suddenly the woman broke from her reverie and spun the gun barked softly twice as she fired into the darkness maser startled seemed uncertain of what to do and i knew then that he wanted me to die slowly he wanted to use his blade on me but as i moved he fired the gun and i felt the ferocious impact as the bullet hit my chest i stumbled back striking the door as i fell and it struck the woman in the back but did not close a second bullet hit me and this time there was a searing pain at my neck i raised my left hand to the wound and blood pumped through my fingers i staggered up the stairs but masers attention was no longer focused on me there were voices at the back of the house z a the housand he had turned to face the threat i heard the front door slam shut and the woman screamed something as i reached the top of the stairs and threw myself flat on the floor as more shots came carving a path through the dusty air above my head my vision was blurring and now that i was lying down i found myself unable to rise again i crawled along the floor using my right hand like a claw pushing myself with my feet my left hand still trying to stem the flow of blood from my neck i drifted from past to present so that at times i was moving along a carpeted hallway through clean brightly lit rooms and at others there were only bare boards and dust and decay there were footsteps coming up the stairs i heard firing from the kitchen below but there was no gunfire in response it was as though maser were shooting at shadows i slipped into our old bedroom and managed to get to my feet using the wall as support then stumbled through the ghost of a bed and slumped in a corner bed no bed the sound of water dripping from a faucet no sound there were footsteps on the stairs the woman appeared in the doorway her face was clearly visible in the light from the window behind me she looked troubled what are you doing she said i tried to answer but i could not bed no bed water footsteps but the woman had not moved she looked around and i knew that she was seeing what i was seeing worlds upon worlds it wont save you she said nothing will she advanced as she did so she ejected the spent clip and prepared to insert another then stopped she looked down to her left bed no bed water a little girl was beside her and then another figure emerged from the shadows behind her a woman with blond hair her face now visible for the first time since i had found her in the kitchen and where once there had been only blood and bone there was now the wife i had loved as she was before the blade had finished its work upon her light no light an empty hallway a hallway empty no longer no whispered the darkhaired woman she slammed the full clip home and tried to fire at me but she seemed to be struggling to maintain her aim as though she were being hampered by figures i could only half glimpse a bullet struck the wall two feet to my left i could barely keep my eyes open as i reached into my pocket and felt my palm close around the compact device i withdrew it and pointed it at the woman as she wrenched her own weapon free at last striking out with her left hand to repel what was behind her bed no bed a woman falling susan a little girl at semjazas side tugging at her pants leg clawing at her belly and semjaza herself as she truly was a thing hunched and dark pink skulled and winged ugliness with a terrible remnant of beauty i raised my weapon it looked like a flashlight to her you cant kill me she said not with that she smiled and raised her gun dont want to i said and fired the little taser c couldnt miss from that range the barbed electrodes caught her in the chest and she went down jerking as fifty thousand volts shot through her the gun falling from her hand her body twisting on the floor bed no bed woman wife daughter darkness chapter thirtyfive i remember voices i can recall the kevlar vest being pulled from me and someone pressing a gauze pad against the wound in my neck i saw semjaza struggling against her captors and thought that i recognized one of the young men who had been with epstein when we met earlier in the week someone asked me if i was okay i showed them the blood on my hand but did not speak it didnt hit any arteries or else youd be dead by now said the same voice it tore a hell of a furrow but youll live they offered me a stretcher but i refused i wanted to stay on my feet if i lay down i was sure that i would lose consciousness again as they helped me downstairs i saw epstein himself kneeling beside the fallen hansen as a pair of medics worked on him and i saw maser his arms behind his back four taser electrodes dangling from his body angel standing above him and louis beside him epstein rose as i was brought down and came to me he touched my face with his hand but said nothing we need to get him to a hospital said one of the men who was holding me up there were sirens in the distance epstein nodded looked past me to the top of the stairs then said just one moment hell want to see this two more men brought the woman down her hands were bound behind her with plastic restraints and her legs were tied at the ankles she was so light that they had lifted her off her feet although she continued to try to fight them while she did so her lips moved and she whispered what sounded like an incantation as she drew closer i heard it clearly what she said was dominus meus bonus et benignitas est when they reached the bottom of the stairs someone else took her legs so that she was stretched horizontally between her captors she looked to her right and saw maser but before she could speak epstein stepped between them foul he said as he gazed down upon her she spit at him and the sputum stained his coat epstein moved to one side so that she could see maser once again he tried to rise but louis walked over to where he sat and placed a foot against his throat forcing h oatäis head back against the wall go on look at each other said epstein it will be the last time you ever meet and as semjaza realized what was about to happen she began to scream the word no over and over until epstein forced a gag into her mouth as she was laid on a stretcher and secured a blanket was placed over her and she was carried from the house into a waiting ambulance that sped away without sirens or lights i looked at maser and i saw desolation in his eyes his lips moved and i heard him whispering something repeatedly i couldnt catch what he was saying but i was sure that they were the same words spoken by his lover dominus meus bonus et benignitas est then one of epsteins men appeared and jammed a hypodermic needle into masers neck and within seconds his chin slumped to his chest and his eyes closed its done said epstein done i said and at last i let them lay me down and the light faded from my eyes three days later i met epstein once again in the little diner the deaf mute woman served us the same meal as before then disappeared into the rear of the place and left us alone only then did we talk in earnest we spoke of the events of that night and of all that had transpired in the days preceding it including my conversation with eddie grace there is nothing that can be done about him said epstein even if it could be proved that he had been involved he would die before they could even get him out of the house a cover story had been invented for the events at hobart street hansen was a hero while shadowing me as part of an ongoing investigation he had encountered an armed man who had attacked him with a blade although seriously injured hansen managed to fatally wound in turn his asyetunidentified assailant who died on the way to the hospital the blade was the same one that had been used to kill mickey wallace and jimmy gallagher blood traces on the hilt matched theirs a photograph of the man in question had appeared in the newspapers as part of the police investigation it bore no resemblance to gary maser it bore no resemblance to any person living or dead no mention was made of the woman i didnt ask what had become of her or her lover i didnt want to know but i could guess they had been hidden away somewhere deep and dark far from each other and there they would rot hansen was one of us said epstein hed been keeping tabs on you ever since you left maine he shouldnt have entered the house i dont know why he did perhaps he saw maser and decided to try to intercept him before he got to you hes being kept in a medically induced coma for now its unlikely that hell ever be able to return to his duties my secret friends i said remembering the words that the collector had spoken to me i never figured hansen for one of them i must be lonelier than i thought epstein sipped his water he was perhaps overzealous in ensuring that your activities were restricted the decision to rescind your licenses was not his but he was willing to enforce a z qto enforcny decisions that were made it was felt that you were drawing too much attention and that you needed to be protected from yourself it helped that he didnt like me anyway epstein shrugged he believed in the law that was why we chose him and there are others yes how many not enough and now we wait youll get your investigators license back and your firearms permit will be restored to you if we cant protect you from yourself then i suppose that we have to give you the ability simply to protect yourself there may be a price though there always is an occasional favor nothing more youre good at what you do the way will be smoothed with state police local law enforcement in the event that your involvement might prove useful consider yourself an adviser an occasional consultant on certain matters and who is going to smooth the way you or another of my friends i heard the door open behind me i turned sac ross entered but he did not remove his coat or join us at the table instead he simply leaned against the counter of the deli his hands entwined before him and looked at me like a social worker forced to engage with a repeat offender of whom he is starting to despair youve got to be kidding ross and i had history him him said epstein unit five unit five with friends like that one needs enemies to match finished epstein ross nodded this doesnt mean that im your goto guy every time you mislay your keys he said you need to keep your distance that wont be hard epstein raised a placatory hand gentlemen please i have another question i said absolutely said epstein go ahead that woman was whispering something as she was carried away before i went out cold i thought i saw maser saying the same thing it sounded like latin dominus meus bonus et benignitas est said epstein my master is good and kind eddie grace used almost those same words i said except he said them in english what does it mean some kind of prayer that and perhaps more said epstein its a play on words a name has recurred over the course of many years i z qany yearsts appeared in documents records at first we thought it was a coincidence or a code of some kind but now we believe that its something else like what we think that its the name of the entity the controlling force said epstein my master is good and kind good and kind thats what they call the one whom they serve they call him goodkind mister goodkind it would be a long time before i learned of what passed between ross and epstein once i was gone and only the silent woman kept them company in the dim light of the diner are you sure its wise to let him roam asked ross as epstein struggled to find the sleeve of his coat we are not letting him roam replied epstein hes a tethered goat even if he doesnt realize it we simply have to wait and see what comes to feed goodkind asked ross eventually perhaps if he truly exists said epstein finding at last his sleeve or if our friend lives long enough i left new york that evening after performing one more service for the dead this one long delayed beneath a simple marker in the corner of bayside cemetery i laid flowers on the grave of a young woman and an unknown child the final resting place of caroline carr my mother epilogue my heart asks for peace day after day flies by and every hour takes away a little piece of life but you and i we two we contemplate living aleksandr pushkin its time my friend its time i spent the rest of the week alone i saw no one i spoke to no one i lived with my thoughts and in the silence i tried to come to terms with all that i had learned on friday night i went to the bear dave evans was working the bar i had already told him by phone that i was done with the job and he had taken it well i guess he knew that it would only be a matter of time i had already received unofficial confirmation that my pis license would be restored to me within days just as epstein had told me and all objections to my license to carry had been withdrawn but that night it was clear that dave was swamped the main bar area was jammed so it was standing room only i stepped aside to let sarah pass by with a tray of beer orders in one hand a stack of food orders in the other she looked frazzled which was unusual but then i noticed that everybody else who was working d z pèid too gary maser gave me twentyfour hours notice then left said dave as he juggled mixing a brandy alexander with keeping an eye on three pints that were pouring simultaneously pity i liked him i figured he might stay on any idea what happened there none i said well you hired him my mistake what the hell it wasnt fatal he gestured at the dressing on my neck although that looks like it could have been i guess i shouldnt ask you could ask but id have to lie to you one of the taps began to splutter and froth damn it all said dave he looked at me do a favor for an old friend im on it i said i went in back and changed the keg while i was there two more ran down so i changed those too when i came back out dave was taking care of the service bar which dealt with orders from the restaurant and there were at least ten people waiting for drinks and only one bartender to deal with them so for one more night i slipped back into my old role i didnt mind i knew now that i would be returning to what i did best so i enjoyed working one last time for dave and quickly fell into all the old routines customers came in and i remembered them by their orders even if i couldnt recall their names tanqueray guy margarita girl five guys in their thirties who came in every friday and always ordered five of the same beer never once experimenting with some of the more exotic brews so that their arrival was always known as the charge of the coors light brigade the fulci brothers arrived with jackie garner in tow and dave contrived to look pleased to see them he owed them for keeping reporters away from the bar after mickey wallace died even if he suspected that their presence had scared off regular customers too now though they were sitting in a corner eating burgers and knocking back belfast bay lobster red like men who were about to be returned to prison the next day an experience with which the fulcis were not unfamiliar and so the evening passed eddie grace woke to the sound of a match being struck in the darkness of his bedroom the drugs had dulled the pain some but they had also dulled his senses so that he struggled for a moment to figure out what time it was and why he was awake he thought that he might have dreamed the sound after all nobody in the house smoked then a cigarette flared red and a figure shifted in the easy chair to his left he caught a glimpse of a mans face he looked thin and unhealthy his hair slicked back from his head his fingernails long and it seemed nicotine tinged with yellow his clothes were dark even in his own stinking sickbed eddie could smell the dankness of him what are you doing here said eddie who are you the man leaned forward in his hand he was holding an old police whistle on a silver chain it had belonged to eddies father and had been passed on to him when the old man retired c quoi like this said the stranger dangling the whistle by its chain i think ill add it to my collection eddies right hand sought the alarm that summoned amanda to him it would ring in her bedroom and she or mike would come his finger pressed down on the button but he heard nothing i took the trouble of disconnecting that said the man you wont be needing it anymore i asked what you were doing here eddie croaked he was frightened now it was the only appropriate response in the face of this mans presence everything about him was wrong everything im here to punish you for your sins for my sins for betraying your friend for putting his son at risk for the death of caroline carr for the girls you hurt im here to make you pay for all of them you have been judged and found wanting eddie laughed hollowly fuck you he said look at me im dying every day im in pain what can you do to me that hasnt been done already and suddenly the whistle was replaced by a sliver of sharp metal as the man rose and leaned over eddie and eddie thought that he saw other figures crowding behind him men with hollow eyes and dark mouths who were both there and not there oh whispered the collector im sure i can think of something by midnight the bar was almost empty the weather report had promised more snow after midnight and most people had opted to leave early rather than risk driving in a blizzard jackie and the fulcis still remained bottles racked up before them but the rest of the customers in the restaurant area were already standing and putting on their coats two men at the far end of the bar called for their check wished me good night and then departed leaving only one other drinker at the counter she had been with a group of portland cops earlier in the evening but when they had gone she had stayed taking a book from her bag and reading it quietly nobody bothered her although she was small and dark and pretty she gave off a vibe and even the international players of the world kept their distance from her still she looked familiar to me from somewhere it took me a moment or two and then i had it she glanced up and saw me staring at her its okay she said im leaving you dont have to i replied the staff usually stay on for a drink maybe something to eat on friday nights youre not in anybodys way i indicated the glass of red wine at her right hand there was only a single mouthful left fill that up for you i asked its on the house isnt that illegal after hours you going to report me officer macy her nose wrinkled you know who i am read about you in c abe wthe papers and ive seen you around some you were involved in that business out on sanctuary as were you only at the edges i reached out a hand my friends call me charlie mine call me sharon we shook hands shaving cut she asked pointing at my neck i have an unsteady hand i said bad news for a bartender thats why i quit tonights a favor for an old friend what will you do instead what i used to do they took away my license for a time soon ill have it back evildoers beware she said there was a smile on her face but her eyes were serious something like that i replaced her glass with a clean one and filled it with the best california we had in the house will you join me she said and when she said those words they seemed to promise at some point in the future more than a drink in a dimly lit bar sure i said it would be a pleasure acknowledgments i am immensely grateful to a number of people who gave generously of their time and their knowledge when it came to
