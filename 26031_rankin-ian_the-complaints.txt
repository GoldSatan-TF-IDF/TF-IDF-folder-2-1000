ian rankin the complaints friday february there was a smattering of applause as malcolm fox entered the room dont strain yourselves he said placing his scuffed briefcase on the desk nearest the door there were two other complaints in the office they were already getting back to work as fox slipped out of his overcoat three inches of snow had fallen overnight in edinburgh a similar amount had stopped london dead a week ago but fox had managed to get into work and so by the look of it had everyone else the world outside felt temporarily cleansed there had been tracks in foxs garden he knew there was a family of foxes somewhere near his estate the houses backed on to a municipal golf course his nickname at police hq was foxy but he didnt think of himself that way a bear of a man that was the way one of his previous bosses had described him slow but steady and only occasionally to be feared tony kaye a bulging folder tucked beneath one arm walked past the desk and managed to squeeze foxs shoulder without dropping anything nice one all the same he said thanks tony fox said lothian and borders police hq was on fettes avenue from some windows there was a view towards fettes college a few of the officers in the complaints had been to private schools but none to fettes fox himself had been educated largely free of charge boroughmuir then heriot watt supported hearts fc though seldom managed even a home fixture these days had no interest in rugby even when his city played host to the six nations february was six nations month meaning thered be hordes of the welsh in town this weekend dressed up as dragons and toting oversized inflatable leeks fox reckoned he would watch the match on tv might even rouse himself to go down the pub five years now hed been off the drink but for the past two hed trusted himself with occasional visits only when he was in the right frame of mind though only when the willpower was strong he hung up his coat and decided he could lose the suit jacket too some of his colleagues at hq reckoned the braces were an affectation but hed lost the best part of a stone and didnt like belts the braces werent the shouty kind dark blue against a plain lightblue shirt his tie today was a deep dark red he draped his jacket over the back of his chair smoothed it at the shoulders and sat down sliding the locks of the briefcase open easing out the paperwork on glen heaton heaton was the reason the complaints had summoned up the brief round of applause heaton was a result it had taken fox and his team the best part of a year to compile their case that case had now been accepted by the procurator fiscals office and heaton having been cautioned and interviewed would go to trial glen heaton fifteen years on the force eleven of them in cid and for most of those eleven hed been bending the rules to his own advantage but hed stepped too far over the line leaking information not only to his pals in the media but to the criminals themselves and that had brought him once more to the attention of the complaints complaints and conduct to give the office its full title they were the cops who investigated other cops they were the soft shoe brigade the rubber heels within complaints and conduct was another smaller grouping the professional standards unit while complaints and conduct worked the meatandpotatoes stuff grievances about patrol cars parked in disabled bays or cop neighbours who played their music too loud the psu was sometimes referred to as the dark side they sniffed out racism and corruption they looked at bungs received and blind eyes turned they were quiet and serious and determined and had as much power as they needed in order to do the job fox and his team were psu their office was on a different floor from complaints and conduct and a quarter of the size heaton had been under surveillance for months his home phone tapped mobile phone records scrutinised computer checked and checked again all without his knowledge hed been tailed and photographed until fox had known more about the man than his own wife did right down to the lapdancer hed been dating and the son from a previous relationship a lot of cops asked the complaints the same question how can you do it how can you spit on your own kind these were officers youd worked with or might work with in future these were it was often said the good guys but that was the problem right there what did it mean to be good fox had puzzled over that one himself staring into the mirror behind the bar as he nursed another soft drink its us and them foxy you need to cut corners sometimes or nothing ever gets done have you never done it yourself whiter than white are you the pure driven not the pure driven no sometimes he felt swept along swept into psu without really wanting it swept into relationships and then out again not too long after hed opened his bedroom curtains this morning and stared at the snow wondering about phoning in saying he was stuck but then a neighbours car had crawled past and the lie had melted away he had come to work because that was what he did he came to work and he investigated cops heaton was under suspension now albeit on full pay the paperwork had been passed along to the procurator fiscal thats that then foxs other colleague was standing in front of the desk hands bunched as usual in trouser pockets easing back on his heels joe naysmith six months in still keen he was twentyeight which was young for the complaints tony kayes notion was that naysmith saw the job as a quick route towards management the youngster flicked his head trying to do something about the floppy fringe he was always being teased about so far so good malcolm fox said hed pulled a handkerchief from his trouser pocket and was blowing his nose drinks on you tonight then over at his own desk tony kaye had been listening he leaned back in his chair establishing eye contact with fox mind its nothing stronger than a milkshake for the wean hell be after long trousers next naysmith turned and lifted a hand from its pocket just long enough to give kaye the finger kaye puckered his lips and went back to his reading youre not in the bloody playground a fresh voice growled from the doorway chief inspector bob mcewan was standing there he sauntered in and grazed his knuckles against naysmiths forehead haircut young joseph whatve i told you sir naysmith mumbled heading back to his desk mcewan was studying his wristwatch two bloody hours i was in that meeting im sure a lot got done bob mcewan looked at fox chief thinks theres the whiff of something septic up in aberdeen any details not yet cant say ive any enthusiasm to see it in my intray youve friends in grampian ive friends nowhere foxy and thats just the way i like it the chief inspector paused seeming to remember something heaton he enquired watching fox nod slowly good good the way he said it fox knew the boss had qualms back in the mists of time hed worked alongside glen heaton mcewans take was that the man had done solid work earned any advancement that came his way a good officer for the most part good mcewan said again even more distantly he roused himself with a roll of the shoulders so what else have you got on today odds and ends fox was blowing his nose again have you not shifted that cold yet it seems to like me mcewan took another look at his watch its already gone lunchtime why not knock off early sir friday afternoon foxy might have something new starting monday so best get those batteries recharged mcewan could see what fox was thinking not aberdeen he stated what then could well peter out over the weekend mcewan offered a shrug well talk monday he made to move away but hesitated what did heaton say he just gave me one of those looks of his ive seen men run for the hills when he does that not me bob no not you mcewans face creased into a smile as he made for the far corner of the room and his own desk tony kaye had tipped back in his chair again the man had ears as sharp as any bit of electronic kit if youre heading off home leave me that tenner what for those drinks you owe us couple of pints for me and a milkshake for the bairn joe naysmith checked that the boss wasnt watching then gave kaye the finger again malcolm fox didnt go home not straight away his father was in a care home over to the east of the city not far from portobello portobello had been quite the place at one time it was where youd go at the summer youd play on the beach or walk along the promenade thered be icecream cones and onearmed bandits and fish and chips sandcastles down near the water where the sand was sticky and pliable people would be flying kites or tossing sticks into the surf for their dog to retrieve the water was so cold youd lose the ability to breathe for the first few seconds but after that you didnt want to come out parents seated on their stripy deckchairs maybe with a windbreak hammered into the sand mum would have packed a picnic the gritty taste of meat paste on thin white bread warm bottles of barrs cola smiles and sunglasses and dad with his rolledup trousers malcolm hadnt taken his dad to the seafront for a couple of years some weeks he got the notion without taking it any further the old boy wasnt too steady on his pins that was what he told himself he didnt like to think it was because people might stare at the pair of them an elderly man melted ice cream running down the back of his hand from the cone he was holding being directed towards a bench by his son they would sit down and malcolm fox would wipe the ice cream from his fathers slipon shoes with his handkerchief then use that same item to dab at the greyflecked chin no that wasnt it at all today it was just too cold fox paid more for the care home than he did on his own mortgage hed asked his sister to share the burden and shed answered that she would when she could the home was private fox had looked at a couple of council alternatives but theyd been drab and acridsmelling lauder lodge was better some of the money fox had shelled out had gone into the pot and come out as anaglypta and pine freshener he could always smell talcum powder too and the lack of any unpleasant aromas from the kitchen was testament to quality venting he found a parking space round the side of the building and announced himself at the front door it was a detached victorian house and would have been worth seven figures until the recent crunch there was a waiting area at the foot of the stairs but one of the staff told him he could go to his fathers room you know the way mr fox she trilled as he nodded and made for the longer of the two corridors there was an annexe built on to the original structure about ten years back the walls had a few hairline cracks in them and some of the double glazing suffered from condensation but the rooms were light and airy the very words hed been plied with when hed first inspected the place light and airy and no stairs plus en suites for the lucky few his dads name was on a typed sliver of card taped to the door mr m fox m for mitchell this being malcolms grandmothers maiden name mitch everyone called malcolms dad mitch it was a good strong name fox took a deep breath knocked and walked in his dad sat by the window hands in his lap he looked a little more gaunt a little less animated they were still shaving him and his hair seemed freshly washed it was fine and silver and the sideburns were kept long the way theyd always been hiya dad fox said resting against the bed how you doing mustnt complain fox smiled at that as was expected you injured your back at the factory where you worked you were on disability for years then cancer came along and you got treated successfully if painfully your wife died soon after you got the allclear and then old age crept in and you mustnt complain because you were the head of the family the man of the house your sons own marriage broke up after less than a year he already had a problem with drink but it got worse then for a while your daughter flew far from the nest and kept in touch infrequently until landing back home with an unlikeable partner in tow but you couldnt complain at least your room didnt smell of piss and your son came to see you when he could hed done pretty well for himself all things considered you never asked if he liked what he did for a living you never thanked him for the fees he paid on your behalf i forgot to bring you chocolate the girls fetch it if i tell them to turkish delight not so easy to find these days mitch fox nodded slowly but didnt say anything has jude been round i dont think so the eyebrows bunched together when was it i saw her since christmas dont fret ill ask the staff i think she has been here was it last week or the week before fox realised that hed taken out his mobile phone he was pretending to look for messages but actually checking the time less than three minutes since hed locked the car i finally closed that case i was telling you about he snapped the phone shut again met with the procurator fiscal this morning looks like its going to trial theres still plenty that can go wrong though is it sunday today friday dad i keep hearing bells theres a church round the corner maybe its a wedding fox didnt think so hed driven past and the place had looked empty why do i do that he asked himself why do i lie to him answer the easy option hows mrs sanderson he asked reaching into his pocket again for his handkerchief shes got a cough doesnt want me to catch it mitch fox paused are you sure you should be here with those germs of yours then he seemed to think of something its friday and its still light shouldnt you be at work time off for good behaviour fox rose to his feet and prowled the room got everything you need he saw a stack of elderly paperbacks on the bedside table wilbur smith clive cussler jeffrey archer books men were supposed to like they would have been chosen by the staff his father had never been much of a reader the tv was attached to a bracket in a corner of the room high up towards the ceiling difficult to watch unless you were in bed hed come to visit one time and it had been tuned to the horseracing even though his father had never shown an interest the staff again the door to the bathroom was ajar fox pushed it open and looked in no bath but a shower cabinet fitted with a foldaway seat he could smell vosene shampoo same stuff his mum had used on jude and him when theyd been kids its nice here isnt it he asked the question out loud but not so his father could hear hed been asking the selfsame thing ever since theyd moved dad out of the semidetached house in morningside at first it had been rhetorical he wasnt so sure now the family home had needed to be cleared some of the furniture was in foxs garage his attic was full of boxes of photographs and other mementoes the majority of which meant little or nothing to him for a time he would bring some with him when he visited but they upset his father if he couldnt place them names he felt he should have known had been wiped from his memory items had lost their significance tears would well in the old boys eyes want to do anything fox asked seating himself on the edge of the bed again not really watch tv cup of tea maybe im all right mitch fox suddenly fixed his son with a look youre all right too arent you never better doing well at work revered and respected by all who know me got a girlfriend not at the moment how long is it since you divorced the eyebrows knitted again her names on the tip of my elaine and shes ancient history dad mitch fox nodded and was thoughtful for a moment youve got to be careful you know i know machinery its not to be trusted i dont work with machinery dad but all the same malcolm fox pretended to be checking his phone again i can look after myself he assured his father dont you worry about me tell jude to come and see me mitch fox said she needs to be more careful on those stairs of hers malcolm fox looked up from his phone ill tell her he said whats this dad tells me about stairs fox was outside standing beside his car it was a silver volvo s with three thousand miles on the clock his sister had picked up after half a dozen rings just as hed been about to end the call youve been to see mitch she surmised he was asking for you i was there last week after you fell down the stairs im fine a few bumps and bruises would those bruises be facial jude you sound just like a cop malcolm i was bringing some stuff downstairs and i fell fox was silent for a moment watching the traffic so how are things otherwise i was sorry we didnt get the chance to catch up over christmas did i thank you for the flowers you sent a text at hogmanay wished me a gappy new zear im hopeless with that phone the buttons are too small maybe drink had been taken maybe that too you still on the wagon five years dry no need to sound so smug how was mitch fox decided hed had enough fresh air opened the car door and got in im not sure hes eating enough we cant all have your appetite do you think i should get a doctor to look at him would he thank you for it fox had taken a packet of mints from the passenger seat popped one into his mouth we should get together some night sure just you and me i mean he listened to his sisters silence waiting for her to mention her partner if she did that maybe they could have the real conversation the one theyd been dancing around what about vince no just the two of us why because i know he hits you jude and that makes me want to hit him back youre wrong malcolm am i want to show me those bruises and the staircase where its supposed to have happened but all she said was okay then well do that yes soon they were saying their goodbyes and fox was flipping shut the phone and tossing it across to the other seat another wasted opportunity he started the engine and headed home home being a bungalow in oxgangs when he and elaine had bought the place the sellers had called it fairmilehead and the solicitor colinton both neighbourhoods seen even then as being more desirable than oxgangs but fox liked oxgangs fine there were shops and pubs and a library the city bypass was minutes away buses were regular and there were two big supermarkets within a short drive fox couldnt blame his father for misplacing elaines name the courtship had lasted six months and the marriage a further ten all of it six years back theyd known one another at school but had lost touch met again at an old friends funeral arranged to go for a drink after the meal and fell into bed drunk and filled with lust lust for life shed called it elaine had just come out of a longterm relationship the word rebound had only occurred to fox after the wedding shed invited her old flame to the ceremony and hed come well dressed and smiling a month after the honeymoon corfu they both got sunburn theyd realised their mistake she was the one who walked hed asked if she wanted the bungalow but shed told him it was his so hed stayed redecorating it more to his taste and completing the attic conversion bachelor beige had been one friends description followed by a warning watch your life doesnt go the same way as fox turned into the driveway he wondered what was so wrong with beige it was just a colour like any other besides which hed repainted the front door yellow hed put up a couple of mirrors one in the downstairs hall one upstairs on the landing framed paintings brightened both living and dining room the toaster in the kitchen was shiny and silver his duvet cover was a vibrant green and the threepiece suite oxblood far from beige he muttered to himself once inside he remembered that his briefcase was locked in the cars boot as soon as you joined the complaints you were warned leave nothing in open view he headed out again to fetch it placing it on the kitchen worktop while he filled the kettle plan for the rest of the afternoon tea and toast and putting his feet up there was lasagne in the fridge for later hed bought half a dozen dvds in the zavvi closingdown sale he could watch one or two this evening if there was nothing on the box at one time zavvi had been virgin their shops had gone bust so had the woolworths on lothian road fox had gone there regularly almost religiously as a kid buying toys and sweets when he was younger then singles and lps as a teenager as an adult hed driven past it a hundred times or more but never with a reason to stop and go in there was a daily paper in his briefcase more doom and gloom for the economy maybe that helped explain why one in ten of the population was taking antidepressants adhd was on the increase and one in five primary school kids was overweight and heading for diabetes the scottish parliament had passed its budget at the second attempt but commentators were saying too many jobs depended on the public sector only places like cuba were worse apparently by coincidence one of the dvds hed bought was buena vista social club maybe hed try it tonight a little bit of cuba in oxgangs a little bit of light relief another of the stories in the paper was about a lithuanian woman shed been killed in brechin her body dismembered and tossed into the sea washing up again piece by piece along arbroath beach some kids had discovered the head and now a couple of migrant workers were on trial for her murder it was the sort of case a lot of cops would relish fox hadnt worked more than a handful of murders during his previous life in cid but he remembered each scene of crime and autopsy hed been present when family members had been given the news or had been escorted into the mortuary to identify their loved ones the complaints was a world away from all that which was why other cops would say that fox and his colleagues had it easy so how come it doesnt feel easy he asked out loud just as the toaster finished toasting he took everything newspaper included through to the livingroom sofa there wouldnt be much on the tv this time of day but there was always the bbc news his gaze shifted to the mantelpiece there were framed photos there one showed his mother and father probably on holiday in the midsixties the other was of fox himself not quite a teenager with his arm around his younger sister as they sat together on a sofa he got the feeling it was an aunts house but didnt know which one fox was smiling for the camera but jude was interested only in her brother an image flashed into his mind she was tumbling down the stairs at her home what had she been carrying empty mugs maybe or a basket of washing but then she was at the foot of the stairs unharmed and vince was standing in front of her bunching a fist it had happened before jude arguing that shed struck first or had given as good as she got it wont happen again foxs appetite had gone and the tea smelled as if hed put too much milk in it his mobile phone sounded an alert incoming text message it was from tony kaye he was in the pub with joe naysmith get thee behind me fox said to himself five minutes later he was looking for his car keys monday february monday morning malcolm fox spent almost as much time finding a parking space at hq as it had taken him to drive there in the first place tony kaye and joe naysmith were already in the office as the junior naysmith had brewed a pot of coffee and provided a carton of milk to go with it come friday he would ask the others to chip in sometimes they would and sometimes they wouldnt and naysmith would continue the pretence of keeping tabs on what he was owed a quid outstanding he said now standing in front of foxs desk hands bunched in pockets double or quits at the end of the week fox answered hanging up his coat it was a beautiful bright day outside the road surfaces free of ice gardens fox had driven past on his estate had boasted blobs of white where snowmen had once stood he removed his jacket displaying the same darkblue braces his tie today was a more vibrant red than fridays his shirt white with stripes of yellow as fine as strands of hair there wasnt much in his briefcase but he opened it anyway naysmith had retreated to the coffee jug three sugars kaye was reminding him receiving the expected gesture in reply no sign of bob fox asked naysmith shook his mop of hair his weekend hadnt included a trim and pointed towards foxs desk should be a message there though fox looked but couldnt see anything he slid back his chair and peered beneath the desk a slip of paper was lying on the floor already boasting the imprint of his shoe sole he lifted it up and turned it over studying mcewans writing inglis ceop ceop meant child protection child exploitation and online protection to give it its full title most of the cops pronounced it chop room at the far end of the corridor and round the corner was the chop shop fox had been inside a couple of times stomach clenched at the very thought of what went on there know anyone called inglis he asked out loud neither naysmith nor kaye could help fox looked at his watch was over an hour away naysmith was stirring a mug noisily kaye was leaning back in his chair stretching his arms and yawning fox folded the piece of paper and placed it in his pocket got up and slipped his jacket back on wont be long he said well soldier on somehow kaye assured him the corridor was a few degrees cooler than the complaints office fox didnt rush but it still took him only a few moments to reach it was the very last door and unusual in that it had its own highsecurity lock and entryphone there were no names listed the chop shop kept itself to itself not unlike the complaints a sign on the door spelled out a warning there may be disturbing sounds and images in this room when working at screens a minimum of two people must be present fox took a deep breath pressed the button and waited a male voice came from the speaker yes inspector fox im here to see inglis there was silence then the voice again youre keen am i ten thirty wasnt it says half nine here another silence then hang on he waited studying the tips of his shoes hed bought them on george street a month back and they still rubbed the skin from his heels quality shoes though the assistant had said theyd last till doomsday or the tram lines up and running whichever comes first bright kid sense of humour fox had asked why she wasnt in college whats the point shed answered no good jobs anyway not unless you emigrate that had taken fox back to his own teenage years a good many of his contemporaries had dreamed of earning big money abroad some of them had succeeded too but not many the door in front of him was being opened from within a woman was standing there she wore a pale green blouse and black trousers she was about four inches shorter than him and maybe ten years younger there was a gold watch on her left wrist no rings on any of her fingers she held out her right hand for him to shake im inglis she said by way of introduction fox he replied then with a smile malcolm fox youre psu it was a statement but fox nodded anyway behind her the office was more cramped than he remembered five desks with just enough room between them for anyone to squeeze by the walls were lined with filing cabinets and freestanding metal shelves on the shelves sat computers and their hard drives some of the hard drives had been stripped back to show their workings others were bagged and tagged as evidence the only free wall space had been covered with head shots the men didnt all look the same some were young some old some had beards and moustaches some were dulleyed and shifty others unapologetic as they faced the camera there was only one other person in the room presumably the man who had spoken over the intercom he was seated at his desk studying the visitor fox nodded towards him and the man nodded back thats gilchrist inglis said come in and make yourself comfortable is that even possible fox asked inglis looked around her we do what we can are there just the two of you at the moment inglis admitted high rate of attrition and all that plus we mostly end up passing cases to london gilchrist added theyve got a hundredstrong team down there a hundred seems a lot fox commented youve not seen their workload inglis said and do i call you inglis i mean is there a rank or maybe a first name annie she eventually told him there was no one at the desk next to hers so she motioned for fox to seat himself there give us a twirl anthea gilchrist said from the way he said it fox got the notion that the joke was wearing thin for all concerned bruce forsyth he guessed the generation game inglis nodded im supposedly named after the gorgeous pouting assistant but you prefer annie i definitely prefer annie unless you want to keep things formal in which case its ds inglis annies fine by me fox seated picked a loose thread from the leg of his trousers he was trying to avoid the file on the desk in front of him it was marked school uniform he cleared his throat my boss told me you wanted to see me inglis nodded she had settled in front of her computer an additional laptop was balanced precariously atop the hard drive how much do you know about ceop she asked i know you spend your time rounding up perverts well put said gilchrist hammering away at his keyboard im told it was easier in the old days inglis added but now weve all gone digital nobody hands their photos in for processing any more nobody has to buy magazines or even go to the trouble of printing anything except in the privacy of their own home you can groom a kid from the other side of the world only meet up with them when youre sure theyre ready good and ready gilchrist echoed fox ran a finger around his shirt collar it was hellishly warm in here he couldnt take off his jacket this was a business meeting first impressions and all that he noted though that annie ingliss jacket was over the back of her chair it was pale pink and looked fashionable her hair was cut short almost in what would have been called a pageboy it was a glossy brown and he wondered if she dyed it she wore a little makeup not too much and no nail varnish he noticed too that unlike the rest of the offices on this floor the windows were opaque it gets hot in here she was telling him all the hard drives we keep running take off your jacket if you like he gave a thin smile all the time hed been trying to read her shed been reading him too he dispensed with the jacket draping it across his knees when inglis and gilchrist exchanged a glance he knew it was to do with his braces other problem with our client base she went on is that theyre getting smarter all the time they know the hardware and software better than we do were always trying to catch up heres an example she had nudged the mouse on her desk with her wrist the computer screen which had been blank now showed a distorted image we call this a swirl she explained offenders send each other pictures but only after theyve encrypted them then we need to devise software to allow us to unswirl them with a click of the mouse the photo began to resolve itself into an image of a man with his arm around an asian boy you see inglis asked yes fox said plenty of other tricks too theyve gotten so they can hide images behind other images if you dont know thats the case you might not bother stripping them out weve seen hard drives hidden inside other hard drives weve seen everything gilchrist stressed inglis looked across at her colleague except we havent she reminded him every week theres something new something more revolting all of it accessible twentyfour seven you sit at your computer at home surfing maybe buying stuff or reading the gossip and youre about four clicks away from hell or heaven gilchrist interrupted eyes fixed on his own screen its all a matter of taste weve got stuff that would make the hairs on your scrotum stand on end fox knew that the chop shop considered itself a breed apart different from the other cops at fettes hq thickerskinned resilient toughened by the job a macho outfit too he wondered how hard annie inglis had worked in order to fit in youve got my attention was all he said inglis was tapping at her screen with the tip of a ballpoint pen this guy here she said indicating the man with the asian boy we know who he is we know quite a lot about him is he a cop she looked at fox what makes you ask why else would i be here she nodded slowly well youre right but our man is an aussie based in melbourne and and like i say we know a lot about him she opened a folder and brought out some sheets of paper he runs a website for likeminded people theres an entrance fee to be paid before they come aboard they have to share gilchrist said twentyfive pics minimum pics of them with kids share and share alike but theres a nominal cash fee too paid by credit card inglis added she handed fox the top two sheets a list of names and numbers recognise anyone fox went down the list twice there were almost a hundred names he shook his head slowly j breck inglis announced the js for jamie jamie breck the name did mean something then fox got it hes lothian and borders he said yes he is inglis agreed if its the same jamie breck credit card comes all the way back to edinburgh to jamie brecks bank in fact youve already checked fox handed back the list inglis was nodding weve already checked okay then so where do i come in as of right now his credit cards all weve got hes not posted the photos yet maybe hes not going to the sites still active were hoping they dont catch wind of us not until were good and ready members in over a dozen countries gilchrist broke in teachers youth leaders church ministers and none of them know youre on to them us and a dozen other forces across the globe one time inglis added the office in london arrested a ringleader and took over the running of his site it took the users ten days to start suspecting something by which time gilchrist interrupted again there was plenty of evidence against them fox nodded and turned his attention back to inglis what do you want psu to do normally we would let london do the work but this ones local so she paused fixing her gaze on fox we want you to paint us a picture we want to know more about jamie breck fox glanced at the image on the screen and it couldnt be a mistake when he turned his attention back to annie inglis she was giving a shrug chief inspector mcewan tells us youve just busted glen heaton breck works in the same station so so you can talk to him about heaton you make it look as though its about heaton then you tell us what you think fox shook his head im not a wellliked man around those parts i doubt breck would give me the time of day but if hes dirty yes we can look into it surveillance if necessary he had her attention now and even gilchrist had stopped what hed been doing we can look at what he gets up to on his computer we can scrutinise his personal life fox paused rubbing at his forehead the credit cards all youve got for now whats to stop him saying someone else mustve used it thats why we need more inglis had swivelled in her chair so that her knees were a millimetre from his she leaned forward elbows resting on her thighs hands clasped but he cant suspect anything if he does he warns all the others well lose them and the kids fox added quietly what its all about the kids right child protection right gilchrist said right annie inglis echoed fox was a few steps short of the complaints office when he stopped hed put his jacket back on and was running his fingers down the lapels just for something to do he was thinking about ds anthea inglis who preferred to be known as annie and her colleague gilchrist he didnt even know the mans rank or first name thinking too about the whole chop shop operation psu might be called the dark side but he got the feeling inglis and her colleague would daily peer into more darkness than he would ever know all the same they were a cocky bunch at psu you knew everybody hated you but ceop was different fellow cops didnt like the thought of what youd seen and wouldnt talk to you for fear of what you might open their eyes and minds to yes that was it the chop shop was feared properly feared in a way the complaints wasnt behind the locked door of lurked a lifetimes supply of nightmare and bogeyman malcolm the voice came from behind him he turned to see annie inglis standing there arms folded legs slightly parted she came towards him her eyes fixed on his here she said holding something out in front of her it was her business card its got my mobile and my email just in case you feel the need thanks he said pretending to study the printed lines i was just just standing there she guessed thinking about everything he took out his wallet sliding one of his own cards from it she accepted it with a little bow of the head turned and walked back along the corridor an elegant walk he decided a woman sure of her abilities confident in her own skin aware she was being scrutinised nice arse too the psu office was a lot noisier than it had been bob mcewan was at his desk busy with a phone call he saw fox coming towards him and made eye contact nodding to let him know it was okay mcewans desk was always tidy but fox knew this was because everything got tipped into its halfdozen drawers on a regular basis tony kaye had gone looking for paracetamol one day and had called fox and naysmith over to take a look its like archaeology joe naysmith had offered layer upon layer mcewan put the phone down and started making a note to himself his handwriting barely legible how did it go he asked quietly fox rested his knuckles against the desk and leaned in towards his boss fine he said it was fine you okay with me doing this depends what youre thinking of background check to start with surveillance afterwards as needed hack into his computer fox shrugged first things first they asked you to talk to him not sure thats such a good idea he might be mates with heaton thats what i thought mcewan said so i had a quiet word foxs eyes narrowed who with someone in the know sensing that fox was trying to decipher the handwritten note mcewan turned it over breck and heaton are rivals more than buddies that gives you your excuse but our work on heatons done and dusted for now it is but whos to know and youll back me up sign off on the paperwork whatever you need dcc is already in the loop meaning the deputy chief constable adam traynor whose authorisation was required for any of the smallscale covert stuff mcewans phone rang and he placed his hand on the receiver ready to pick it up gaze still locked on to fox ill leave it to your discretion foxy then as fox straightened up readying to leave did you enjoy your long weekend by the way managed two nights in monaco fox replied as he passed tony kayes desk he wondered how much the human radar had picked up kaye appeared to be busy at his keyboard typing in some notes anything interesting fox asked i could ask you the same kaye responded glancing in the direction of the bosss corner might be room for you to climb aboard fox decided there and then scratching at the underside of his chin just give me a shout foxy fox nodded distractedly and made it to the relative safety of his desk naysmith was brewing another pot of coffee three sugars kaye called to him naysmith gave a twitch of the mouth then noticed that he was being watched he waved an empty mug in foxs direction but fox shook his head the hr department were never happy to see someone from the complaints hr human resources used to be personnel a term fox preferred hr meantime would have preferred it if officers like him couldnt come swanning in as if they owned the place hr felt prickly and with good reason they had to provide open access access denied to practically anyone else mcewan had called ahead to let them know fox was on his way hed then typed and signed a letter verifying foxs need to see the records no names were mentioned and this was what riled some of the hr staff the assumption being that they couldnt be trusted with the information if they knew who the complaints had their eye on they might pass the information along crippling any inquiry at its very start it had happened once in the past over a decade back since when the rules had been changed so that the complaints had total privacy when they did their search to this end the head of hr had to vacate her private room so that fox could use it she had to log on to her computer then leave it available for his use she had to hand him the keys to the many filing cabinets in the main openplan office then she had to stand with arms folded fuming eyes averted as he went about his business fox had been through the procedure many times and had tried at the start to be cordial apologetic even but mrs stephens was not to be placated so hed given up she still took some pleasure in delaying him and his ilk reading the chief inspectors notification with the greatest care and attention sometimes even phoning mcewan back to doublecheck then she would ask for foxs warrant card and note his details on a form which he had to sign she would then check his signature against the one on his id exhale noisily and hand over the keys her computer her desk and her office thank you he would say usually his first and last words of the encounter hr was on the ground floor of police hq lothian and borders was not the largest force in scotland and fox often wondered how they filled their time they were civilian staff most of them women they stared at him from above their computer screens one might wink or blow him a kiss he knew some of their faces from the canteen but there was never any conversation no offer of coffee or tea mrs stephens saw to that fox made sure no one was watching as he lifted jamie brecks file from the cabinet he held it to his chest so the name couldnt be seen locked the drawer and headed back to mrs stephens office closed the door after him and sat down the chair was still warm which he minded only a little inside the slim file were the details of brecks police career along with earlier academic attainments he was twentyseven and had joined the force six years previously spending the first two in training and in uniform before transferring to cid his assessments were favourable bordering on glowing there was no mention of any of the cases hed worked on but also no indication of trouble or disciplinary concerns a model officer was one remark repeated a little later on one thing fox did learn was that breck lived in the same part of town as him his address was on the new estate close by the morrisons supermarket fox had driven around the estate when it had first been built wondering if he needed a bigger house small world he muttered to himself now the computer data added little there had been the occasional sick day but nothing stressrelated there had never been a need for counselling or referral brecks bosses at torphichen place his base these past three years couldnt get enough of him reading between the lines fox could see that breck was being fasttracked he was already young for a detective sergeant and di looked achievable before the age of thirty fox himself had been thirtyeight breck had been educated privately at george watsons college hed played rugby for the second fifteen a bsc from the university of edinburgh parents still alive both of them gps an older brother colin who had emigrated to the usa where he worked as an engineer fox pulled out his handkerchief found a dry bit and emptied his nose into it the noise was enough to have mrs stephens peering in at him through the narrow window next to the door her face had stiffened further with distaste hed be leaving his germs all over her office defiling her private fiefdom though he didnt really need to he blew his nose again almost as noisily then he closed the online file mrs stephens knew what he would do next shut down her whole system yet another precaution he wanted his search to be erased as far as possible but before he did that he typed in another name anthea inglis definitely against procedure but he did it anyway it only took a couple of minutes for him to learn that she wasnt married and had never been married that shed grown up on a farm in fife that shed attended the local college before moving to edinburgh that shed had a variety of jobs before joining the force that her full name was florence anthea inglis if one of her names had come from the generation game he wondered if the other might have originated with the magic roundabout fox had to stifle a smile as he began closing everything down he emerged from the office leaving the door ajar and replaced the file in its cabinet making sure it couldnt be differentiated from any of the others when he was satisfied he closed and locked the drawer and made to hand the key to mrs stephens she was resting her weight against the edge of a colleagues desk arms still folded so he placed the key down next to her instead till next time he said turning away one of the women glanced up at him as he passed and he managed a wink of his own when he got back to the complaints office naysmith told him there was a message waiting and would i find it on my desk or under it fox asked but there it was lying next to his telephone just a name and number he looked at it then up at naysmith alison pettifer naysmith just shrugged so fox lifted the receiver and punched the number in when it was answered he identified himself as inspector fox oh right the woman on the other end said she sounded hesitant you called me fox persisted youre judes brother fox was silent for a moment whats happened i live next door the woman stumbled on she happened to mention once that you were in the police thats how i got your number whats happened fox repeated aware that both naysmith and kaye were now listening judes had a bit of an accident she tried to close the door in his face but he pushed against it and her resistance evaporated instead she marched back into her living room it was a midterraced house in saughtonhall he didnt know which side alison pettifer lived neither set of net curtains had twitched each and every house on the street boasted a satellite dish and judes tv was tuned to some daytime chatandcookery show she turned it off as he walked into the room well now was all he said her eyes were redrimmed from crying there was some faint bruising on her left cheek and her left arm was in plaster a sling cradling it those stairs again id had a drink im sure he was looking around the room it smelt of alcohol and cigarettes there was an empty vodka bottle on the floor next to the sofa two ashtrays both full a couple of crushed cigarette packets a breakfast bar separated the living area from the small kitchen plates stacked up next to discarded fastfood cartons more empty bottles lager cider cheap white wine the carpet needed vacuuming there was a layer of dust on the coffee table one of the legs had been snapped off replaced by a stack of four building bricks figured vince worked in the building trade mind if i sit down fox asked she tried to shrug it wasnt easy he decided his safest bet was the arm of the sofa he still had his hands in the pockets of his overcoat there didnt seem to be any heating in the room his sister was wearing a shortsleeved tshirt and a baggy pair of denims her feet were bare you look a right state he told her thanks i mean it youre not exactly a poster boy yourself dont i know it hed lifted the handkerchief from his pocket so he could blow into it you still havent got rid of that cold she commented you still havent got rid of that bastard of yours he replied where is he working i didnt know anyone was building anything thereve been layoffs hes hanging in fox nodded slowly jude was still standing up shifting slightly from the hips he recognised the movement shed done it as a kid whenever shed been caught out paraded in front of their father for a tellingoff you not got a job yet she shook her head the estate agent had laid her off just before christmas who told you she asked eventually was it next door i hear things was all he said it wasnt anything to do with vince she stated were not in a bloody police station jude this is just the two of us it wasnt him she persisted who then i was in the kitchen saturday he made show of peering over the breakfast bar wouldnt have thought there was room to fall over caught my arm on the corner of the washing machine as i went down that the story you gave them at a and e is that who told you does it matter he was staring towards the fireplace there were shelves either side filled with videos and dvds looked like every single episode of sex and the city and friends plus mamma mia and other films he gave a sigh and rubbed his hands down his face either side of his nose and mouth you know what im going to say it wasnt vinces fault you provoked him we provoke each other malc he knew as much couldve told her that the neighbour often heard slanging matches but then jude would have known whod called him if we charged him just one time it might put a stop to it wed make it a requirement he got some counselling oh vince would love that she managed a smile it wiped years from her face youre my sister jude she looked at him blinking but not about to cry i know she said then indicating the cast on her arm think i should still go see dad maybe leave it you wont tell him he shook his head then looked around the room again want me to tidy up wash some dishes maybe ill be fine has he said sorry she nodded keeping eye contact fox didnt know whether to believe her and what did it matter anyway he rose to his feet towering over her then leaned down to peck her on the cheek why does someone else have to do it he whispered into her ear do what phone me he answered outside it was snowing again he sat in his car wondering if vince faulkners working day would be curtailed faulkner was from enfield just north of london supported arsenal and hadnt a good word to say for football north of the border this had been his opening gambit when the two men had been introduced he hadnt been keen on the move to scotland but she keeps bending me bleedin ear he was hoping shed get bored and want to head south again she malcolm had seldom heard him use her name she her indoors the other half the bird he drummed his fingers against the steering wheel wondering what to do for the best faulkner could be working on any one of three or four dozen projects around the city the recession had probably put the brakes on the new flats in granton and he reckoned quartermile was dormant too caltongate wasnt up and running yet and the developer was in trouble according to the local paper wild goose chase he said to himself his phone vibrated letting him know he had a text it was from tony kaye we r at minters it was gone four mcewan had obviously clocked off for the day giving the others no reason to loiter fox closed his phone and turned the key in the ignition minters was a new town bar with old town prices tucked away where only the cognoscenti could find it never easy to find a parking space but he knew what kaye would have done stuck a great big police placard on the inside of the windscreen sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt depended on the mood of the warden fox tried to work out a way back into the city centre that would avoid the tram works at haymarket then gave up anyone who could solve that they should give them the nobel prize before driving off he looked to his right but there was no sign of jude at her livingroom window and still nobody visible in the homes on either side if vince faulkner were to turn into the street right now what would he do he couldnt remember the name of the character in the godfather the one whod chased the brotherinlaw and thumped him with a bin lid sonny sonny wasnt it thats what hed like to think he would do bin lid connecting with face and dont you touch my sister what hed like to think he would do minters was quiet but then it had been quiet for several years the landlord first blaming the smoking ban and now muttering about the downturn maybe he had a point plenty of banking types lived in the new town and theyd be wise to keep their heads down other than bankers tony kaye said placing foxs glass of iced cola on the corner table who else can afford a house here naysmith was drinking lager kaye guinness the landlord sleeves rolled up was intent on a tv quiz show two further customers had gone outside with their cigarettes there was a woman seated in another corner with a friend kaye had taken her over a brandy and soda then explained to fox and naysmith that she was a pal of his does the missus know joe naysmith had asked kaye had wagged a finger at him then pointed it towards the woman her names margaret sime and if youre ever in here and im not id better hear that youve sent a drink over did you get parked naysmith was now asking malcolm fox halfway up the bloody hill fox complained then to kaye i see you didnt have any trouble kayes nissan xtrail was outside the pubs front door on a double yellow line and with the police notice wedged in between dashboard and windscreen kaye just shrugged and gave a smirk making himself comfortable and attacking what remained of his pint wiping a line of foam from his top lip he fixed his gaze on fox vince has been a naughty boy again he said fox just stared at him but it was naysmith who provided the explanation soon as youd left tony phoned the callers number she told me about judes accident kaye confirmed leave it will you fox cautioned but kaye was shaking his head again it was naysmith who spoke tony looked up vince faulkner looked up foxs eyes narrowed on the pnc naysmith said slurping at his drink police national computers only for south of the border fox stated tony kaye gave another shrug i know a cop in england all i did was give him faulkners name and place of birth enfield right i remember you telling me you know a cop in england i thought you hated the english not individually kaye corrected him look do you want to know or dont you i doubt i could stop you telling me tony fox said but kaye pursed his lips and folded his arms naysmith looked keen to bursting but kaye was warning him off with his eyes the two smokers were coming back into the bar the landlord slammed the palms of both hands against the bar top and yelled at the tv a schoolkid wouldve known that dont be so sure charlie one of the smokers said not these days hes got previous naysmith blurted out trying to keep his voice down kaye rolled his eyes and unfolded his arms reaching for his glass and draining it your shout kiddo he said naysmith gawped but then sprinted towards the bar with the empty glass previous fox echoed tony kaye leaned in towards him keeping his voice low a few petty thefts from nine or ten years back couple of street brawls nothing too serious but jude might not know about them hows she doing her arms in plaster did you have words with faulkner fox shook his head i didnt see him somethings got to be done malcolm will she file a complaint no we could do it for her shes not leaving him tony then its up to us to have a word with him naysmith was back at the table the landlord having taken his order exactly what we should do he confirmed youre forgetting something fox said were the complaints word gets out that were running around putting the fear on members of the great unwashed he shook his head again more firmly this time we dont get to do that then theres no fun left in life tony kaye decided throwing open his arms naysmith had marched off again and returned with kayes drink fox studied his two colleagues his two friends thanks all the same he said and then lowering his voice still further in the meantime maybe theres some fun we could have he checked that no one else in the bar was showing an interest mcewans put me on to a cop called breck jamie breck kaye guessed you know him i know people who know him who is he naysmith asked settling himself at the table only the top inch was missing from his lager cid based at torphichen kaye enlightened him then to fox hes dirty maybe thats why you were at the chop shop this morning nothing gets past you tony and hr this afternoon ditto fox leaned back in his seat he wasnt sure what he was doing not exactly no harm in kaye and naysmith being on board but did he have anything for them to do all he knew was he needed to show his appreciation and this was as good a way of doing it as any plus now they could talk about work rather than jude and that was another thing what did he do with the info about vince faulkner store it away he couldnt see himself confronting jude with it shed accuse him of snooping of interfering my life malcolm my business that was probably how she would put it of everything they had to do all the cases they had to work cops hated domestics the worst they hated them because there was seldom a happy outcome and precious little they could do to help or ease the situation and that was how jude would look to the majority of foxs colleagues hers was most definitely a domestic the smokers were standing at the bar one of them was drinking whisky fox could smell it and even felt the faintest of tangs at the back of his throat it was making his mouth water so tell us tony kaye was enquiring joe naysmith had leaned forward elbows on knees his sisters face was in his mind and the aroma of the single malt in his nostrils he told kaye and naysmith what he knew about jamie breck tuesday february next morning fox called jude but got no answer hed tried her the previous night too she probably had caller id she was almost certainly ignoring him after breakfast he drove to work kaye and naysmith wanted to know their plan of action foxs idea was that annie inglis should brief them but there was no one at home in he texted her mobile instead asking her to get back to him well wait he told his colleagues no rush they were heading back to their own desks when foxs phone rang he picked it up and heard a voice he didnt know asking him if he was malcolm fox whos this fox asked back my names detective sergeant breck foxs spine stiffened but he didnt say anything am i speaking to malcolm fox yes mr fox im calling on behalf of your sister is she there whats happened your sisters fine mr fox but im afraid were on our way to the mortuary i asked her if there was anyone and she the voice was professional without being cold tell me whats happened your sisters partner mr fox do you know how to find the city mortuary he knew all right it was on the cowgate an inconspicuous brick building youd drive past without guessing what went on there traffic was hellish slow there seemed to be roadworks and diversions everywhere it wasnt just the trams there were gas mains being replaced and resurfacing at the grassmarket it seemed to fox that he passed more traffic cones than pedestrians kaye had asked if he wanted company but hed shaken his head vince faulkner was dead and that was as much as jamie breck was going to tell him breck managing to sound concerned and thoughtful breck waiting at the mortuary with jude fox parked the volvo in one of the loading bays and headed inside he knew where theyd be waiting the viewing room was one floor up he flashed his id at any staff he passed not that they showed the slightest interest they wore foreshortened green rubber galoshes and threequarterlength smocks they had just washed their hands or were on their way to do so jude heard his footsteps on the stairs and was running towards him as he came into view she was bawling her head off body shuddering eyes bloodshot behind the tears he held her to him being careful of her arm after a moment he opened his eyes and looked over her shoulder to where ds jamie breck was standing you dont know his names jamie fox reminded himself on the phone he called himself ds breck breck was walking towards him now fox managed to push jude back a little but as gently as possible he held out a hand to the other detective breck was smiling almost sheepishly im sorry he said i should have known it was a fettes number he gestured towards jude your sister tells me youre a di just plain inspector fox corrected him in psu we drop the detective bit breck nodded psu means the complaints fox nodded back at him then turned his attention to jude im so sorry he said squeezing her hand are you all right she shivered in response and he asked breck if the identification had taken place two minutes breck said pretending to look at his watch fox knew what was happening behind the door they were making the corpse as presentable as possible only the face would be visible unless identification necessitated the revealing of a tattoo or distinguishing feature where was he found fox asked a building site by the canal where theyre knocking down the brewery he wasnt working there jude stated tremulously i dont know what he was doing there when was he found fox asked breck squeezing his sisters hand a little more tightly early this morning couple of joggers on the towpath one got a stitch so they stopped leaning against the fence doing stretches or whatever thats when they saw him and youre sure its couple of credit cards in the pocket i gave ms fox a description of the deceased and his clothing jamie breck had blonde hair tending towards the curly and a face speckled with freckles his eyes were a milky blue he stood an inch or so shorter than fox and was probably only two thirds his waist measurement he wore a dark brown suit with all three buttons done up fox was trying to dismiss from his mind everything he knew about him schooled at george watsons parents both doctors lives near the supermarket has yet to comply with the twentyfivepic minimum he found himself stroking judes hair they beat him up she was saying voice cracking they beat him up and left him for dead fox looked to breck for confirmation injuries consistent with was all the younger man said then the door of the room behind them slid open the body lay on a trolley swaddled except for the face even the hair and ears had been covered the face was pulpy but recognisable even from a distance fox caught sight of it before his sister jude he cautioned her i can do this if you dont want to i need to do it she answered i need to youll want to go home with her breck was telling fox both men held plastic beakers of tea they were standing in the family room a pile of childrens books had been placed on one of the chairs and someone had pinned up a poster of a sunflower jude was seated a few feet away head bowed holding a beaker of her own water was all shed asked for they were waiting for the forms the forms she would need to sign vince faulkners battered corpse was already on its way to the autopsy suite where a couple of the citys pathologists would get to work on it their assistants weighing and measuring bagging and tagging what time was he found fox asked quietly just after six its still dark at six there were streetlights was he attacked there or just dumped there look inspector fox this can all wait youll want to be with jude now fox stared at his sister theres a neighbour he found himself saying alison pettifer maybe she could take jude home and stay with her breck pulled back his shoulders due respect i know you outrank me but i just want to see the locus any harm in that ds breck breck seemed to consider this for a moment then let his shoulders relax call me jamie he said twentyfivepic minimum fox thought to himself it was another hour before the paperwork was finalised and alison pettifer was fetched from her home fox shook hands with her and thanked her again for calling him the previous day and now this was all she said she was tall and slim and in her fifties she took charge coaxing jude to her feet and telling her everything was going to be fine youre coming home with me judes eyes were still rawlooking as fox kissed her on both cheeks ill come as soon as i can he said a uniformed officer was waiting for the women his patrol car parked outside he looked almost bored and fox wanted to shake him he checked his mobile phone instead two messages from tony kaye which were actually the same message sent twice do u need me fox started to punch in no but lengthened it to not yet as he was sending it jamie breck reappeared not needed at the autopsy fox asked they cant get to it for another hour breck looked at his wristwatch means i can take you out there if you like ive got my car then you can drive us four minutes into the journey breck commented that theyd have been quicker walking it was a straight run cowgate to west port to fountainbridge but traffic had stalled again a contraflow controlled by two workmen in fluorescent jackets and toting signs saying stop and go it can drive men mad breck said suddenly having all that power fox just nodded mind if i ask something fox minded a lot but gave a shrug how did your sister break her arm she fell over in the kitchen breck pretended to mull this over mr faulkner worked as a builder yes didnt seem to be dressed for the job goodquality chinos polo shirt and leather jacket the jacket was a christmas present from ms fox was it were they getting married youd have to ask her the two of you arent close fox could feel his grip tightening on the steering wheel were close he said and mr faulkner what about him did you like him not especially why not no particular reason or too many to mention breck nodded to himself my brothers partner i dont get on too well with him either him my brothers gay i didnt know breck looked at fox no reason why you should thats right and no reason to know that that same brothers an engineer in america fox cleared his throat so whats your feeling about this he asked breck took his time answering theres a hole in the fence next to where the body was found little side road there too where a car or van could park the body was dumped breck shrugged and began working his neck muscles i asked ms fox when she last saw mr faulkner and she says saturday afternoon fox could hear the grinding of gristle in the younger mans neck and shoulders that cast looks pretty new happened saturday fox confirmed keeping his voice level concentrating on the road ahead two more sets of traffic lights and one roundabout and theyd be there so she heads to a and e and mr faulkner goes out on the town breck stopped exercising and leaned forward a little turning his head so he could make eye contact with fox fell over in the kitchen thats what she told me and you repeated it for my benefit but your face tightened just a little when you spoke are you supposed to be columbo or something just observant inspector fox you need to take the next left i know and theres that facial tightening again jamie breck said just loud enough for fox to hear the police cordon was still in place but the uniform on duty eased up the tape so they could pass beneath there was a couple of journalists from the local paper but both were old enough to know they would ask in vain for a quote a few people watched from the towpath not that there was much to see the scene of crime unit had already picked over the area photos showed the body in situ breck grabbed some from a soco and handed them to fox vince faulkner had been found face down arms thrown in front of him his skull had been crushed by something heavy the hair was matted with blood there were grazes to the palms and fingers consistent with someone trying to defend himself we wont know about internal injuries until after the autopsy breck commented fox nodded and looked around it was a bleak spot mounds of earth and rubble from where some of the old brewery had been demolished warehouses remained emptied of their contents and with windows pulverised on the other side of the road groundworks were under way for what would become a mixed social development according to the billboard shops office space and apartments no one seemed to call them flats these days cops in overalls were working in a line trying to locate the murder weapon there were tens of thousands of possibilities from halfbricks to rocks and concrete rubble could have been tossed into the canal fox mused weve got divers coming breck assured him not much blood on the ground fox was studying the photos again no which is why you think he was dumped here maybe in which case its not just a mugging gone wrong no comment breck looked to the skies and took a deep breath i know fox said intercepting the speech i cant get involved i shouldnt make it personal i mustnt get in the way pretty much breck had taken the photos from him so he could flick through them anything you want to tell me about your sisters partner no he broke her arm didnt he youll have to ask her that breck stared at him then nodded slowly and kicked at a small stone sending it rolling along the ground how long do you reckon thisll stay a building site who knows someone told me hbos were moving their corporate headquarters here that might not happen for a while i hope you didnt have shares fox gave a snort then stuck out a hand for the younger man to take thanks for letting me come here i appreciate it rest assured inspector well be doing all we can and not just because youre a fellow traveller breck gave a wink as he released foxs hand twentyfivepic minimum you like looking at young kids ds breck and its my job to hang you out to dry thanks again malcolm fox said can i drop you back at the mortuary im going to stay here a while breck paused as if deep in thought psu he eventually said just got through mangling one of my colleagues itd take more than the complaints to mangle glen heaton were you part of that team why do you ask no real reason youre not particularly a friend of his are you breck stared at him what makes you ask im the complaints ds breck i see everything and hear everything ill bear that in mind inspector jamie breck said fox called the office from his car and told tony kaye theyd have to hold fire on jamie breck kaye naturally asked why hes in charge of faulkner kaye was making a whistling sound as fox ended the call when his phone rang he answered without thinking look tony ill talk to you later there was silence for a moment then a female voice its annie inglis is this a bad time not a great time annie if im being honest anything i can do to help no but thanks for the offer i got your message the horn in the car behind fox started blaring as he headed down a street meant only for taxis and buses theres been a complication my sisters partners turned up dead im sorry dont be he was an evil little sod but ive just met the investigating officer hes a ds called jamie breck oh so the job you wanted me to do should probably go to someone else in fact a couple of my colleagues are already briefed right she paused so where are you now on my way to my sisters place how is she thats what im going to find out let me know will you fox glanced in his rearview mirror a patrol car was behind him blue rooflights flashing got to go he said ending the call it took him a whole five minutes to discuss his situation with the officers hed tried showing them his warrant card without letting them see he was complaints and conduct but they seemed to know anyway was he aware hed made an illegal manoeuvre and did he recall the law about driving while holding a conversation on a mobile phone he managed to sound apologetic managed not to explain where he was headed and why didnt see any reason the sods needed to know in the end they wrote him out a penalty ticket nobodys above the law the elder of the two cautioned him fox thanked the man and got back into his car they did what they always did tailed him a few hundred more yards before signalling right and heading elsewhere it was what happened when you were the complaints no favours from your colleagues in fact just the opposite which got fox thinking about jamie breck again he found a parking space along the street from judes house alison pettifer opened the door shed closed the curtains in the living room and kitchen out of respect fox surmised wheres jude he asked upstairs i made her some tea with plenty of sugar fox nodded looking around the living room it seemed to him that pettifer had started the process of tidying up he thanked her and signalled that he was going to go see his sister she pressed a hand to his arm didnt say anything but her eyes told a story go easy on her he patted the hand and went out into the hall the stairs were steep and narrow difficult to fall down them without becoming wedged halfway three doors led off the cramped landing bathroom and two bedrooms one bedroom had been turned into vince faulkners lair boxes of junk an old hifi and racks of rock cds plus a desk with a cheap computer the door was ajar so fox peered in the slatted blinds had been drawn closed a couple of mens magazines lay on the floor nuts and zoo their covers showed nearidentical blondes with their arms covering their breasts fox tapped on the next door along and turned the handle jude was lying on the bed with the duvet cocooned around her she wasnt asleep though the tea sat untouched on the bedside table beside an empty tumbler the room smelled faintly of vodka how you doing sis he sat down on the bed all he could see were her head and her bare feet he smoothed her hair back from her forehead she sniffled and started to sit up beneath the duvet she was fully dressed somebody killed him she said best thing that could have happened but what he said out loud was its hellish do they think what maybe i had something to do with it fox shook his head but theyll want to talk to you standard procedure so dont worry about it she nodded slowly and he stroked her hair again when did you last see him jude saturday the same day he fox gestured towards the plaster cast i came back from the hospital and he wasnt here did you hear from him she took a deep breath and exhaled then shook her head wasnt so unusual to tell the truth some nights i was lucky if i saw him for five minutes hed be out with his mates and come home next day with the story that hed bunked on a couch or a spare bed did you try phoning him over the weekend texted him a couple of times no answer she shook her head i expected him home on sunday but then she gazed at her broken arm maybe he was feeling more ashamed than usual and by last night fox coaxed another deep breath by last night maybe i was getting worried or anaesthetised fox gestured towards the empty glass she shrugged as best she could when i dropped in yesterday he went on why didnt you say anything i didnt want you to know i tried calling you last night there was no answer you said it yourself anaesthetised and again this morning she stared at him have they sent you here to interrogate me im just asking the questions theyll ask you never liked him she commented i cant deny it maybe youre even glad hes dead her voice was turning accusatory fox lifted her chin with one finger so she was facing him thats not true he lied but he was never the man you deserved he was what i got malcolm and that was plenty enough for me he met annie inglis for coffee at the fettes canteen apart from the staff the place was deserted inglis insisted on fetching the drinks while he sat at a table near the window im not an invalid he told her with a smile as she pushed the mug towards him sugar she tipped half a dozen sachets on to the table he shook his head and watched her draw her chair in shed chosen hot chocolate for herself she fidgeted a little dabbed a finger against the surface of the liquid and sucked on it then she made eye contact so she said so he agreed any idea what happened building site by the canal someone did a job on him hows your sister doing her names jude short for judith im not sure how shes doing you went to see her she was tucked up in bed with a bottle of vodka cant begrudge her that jude has a history with alcohol he stared down at his coffee it was meant to be a cappuccino but the foam was nonexistent inglis gave a twitch of the mouth and allowed the silence to linger so she asked at last you got to meet ds breck wondered how long it would take you he muttered she ignored this how did he strike you id say hes good at his job the conversation never really got round to his predilection for kiddiefiddling she bristled but only for a moment malcolm she said quietly im only asking sorry and the reason im asking is because gilchrist and me have been talking is he your boss by the way gilchrist she widened her eyes a little hes my dc hes older than you so your immediate thought was that he had to outrank me fox was saved from answering by the sound of her phone she lifted it from the table and checked the screen ive got to take this she said its my son she held the phone to her ear hey duncan she listened for the best part of a minute eyes fixed on the world outside the window okay but i want you home by seven understood bye then she placed the phone back on the table her fingers resting against it i didnt think you were married fox said im not she thought for a moment but what made you he swallowed before answering there was stuff about her he wasnt supposed to know no wedding ring he eventually said then a little too quickly how old is duncan fifteen you mustve been young my last year at school mum and dad were furious but they looked after him fox nodded slowly thered been no mention of a son in ingliss personnel file an oversight he took a sip of his drink hes headed to a friends annie inglis explained cant be easy single mum teenage boy its fine she stated her tone telling him things could be left at that fox held the mug to his mouth and blew across it you were telling me he said that youd been talking with gilchrist thats right were thinking that this could work out for us me and breck you mean she nodded youre not involved in the inquiry so its not really a conflict of interest what youre saying is while breck investigates the murder i busy myself keeping an eye on him the two of you have already met and youve got the perfect excuse for keeping in touch with him and its not a conflict of interest were only asking you for background malcolm gen we can pass on to london nothing you do is going to come to court how can we be sure she thought for a moment and shrugged gilchrists checking with your boss and the deputy chief shouldnt that be your job she shrugged and made eye contact i wanted to see you instead im touched are you up to the task malcolm thats what i need to know fox thought back to the piece of waste ground well be doing all we can im up to it malcolm fox said back upstairs the complaints office was empty he sat at his desk for a good five minutes gnawing on a cheap ballpoint pen thinking of vince faulkner and jude and jamie breck the door already ajar was pushed all the way open by bob mcewan he was wearing a trenchcoat and carrying a briefcase you all right foxy he asked standing in front of the desk feet planted almost a yard apart im fine heard about your brotherinlaw compassionate leave if you want it he wasnt a relation fox corrected his boss just a guy my sister fell in with all the same ill look in on her when i can the words as they emerged from his mouth made him think of his father mitch needed to be told and about the chop shop mcewan began reckon you can still help them out you dont think theres a problem traynor doesnt see one adam traynor deputy chief constable ive just been speaking with him then thats that fox said placing the pen back on the desk at works end he headed over to lauder lodge one of the staff told him hed find his father in mrs sandersons room fox stood in front of her door and couldnt hear anything he knocked and waited until the womans voice invited him in mitch was seated facing mrs sanderson the two chairs were positioned either side of the rooms fireplace this fireplace was for show only a vase of dried flowers sat in the unused grate hed been in mrs sandersons room once before when his father had introduced him to his new dear friend the old boy was doing the same thing again this is my son audrey mrs sanderson gave a tinkling laugh i know mitch ive met malcolm before mitch foxs brow furrowed as he tried to remember fox leaned down over mrs sanderson and placed a kiss against her cheek she smelled faintly of talcum powder and her face was like parchment her hands and arms too shed probably always been thin but now the skin on her face matched the exact contours of the skull beneath yet for all that she was a handsome woman youre feeling better fox asked much better dear she gave his hand a pat before releasing it twice in a few days foxs father was saying am i supposed to feel flattered and whens that sister of yours going to put in an appearance there was nowhere for fox to sit except the bed so he stayed standing it seemed to him that he towered over the two seated figures mrs sanderson was arranging the tartan travel rug that lay spread across her lower body judes had some bad news dad fox said oh its vince hes been killed mrs sanderson stared up at him mouth opening in an o killed mitch fox echoed do you want me to mrs sanderson was trying to rise to her feet you sit back down mitch ordered this is your room audrey looks like he got himself into a spot of bother fox was trying to explain and ended up taking a beating no more than he deserved now really mitch mrs sanderson protested then to fox hows jude taking it malcolm shes bearing up shell need all the help you can give her she turned to mitch you should go see her what good would that do it would show her that you cared malcolm will take you she looked at fox for confirmation he managed something between a nod and a shrug her voice softened a little malcolm will take you she repeated leaning forward and stretching out an arm after a moment mitch fox copied her their hands met and clasped maybe not just yet though fox cautioned remembering the plaster cast shes not really up to visitors shes sleeping a fair bit tomorrow then mrs sanderson decided tomorrow fox eventually conceded on the drive home he thought about visiting jude but decided he would phone her instead just before bedtime shed given alison pettifer the details of a couple of her closest friends and the neighbour had promised fox she would call them and get them to take turns with jude she wont be alone had been pettifers closing words to him he wondered too what annie inglis would be doing shed told her son to be home by seven it was seven now fox had memorised her address from the hr file he could drive there in ten or fifteen minutes but to what purpose he was curious about the kid tried to imagine what it had been like for the schoolgirl to confront her farming father with the news mum and dad were furious but they looked after him yes because thats what families did they rallied round they dug in but duncan s not on your file annie at the next set of traffic lights he stared at an offlicences window display little halogen spotlights threw each bottle into sharp relief he wondered if judes friends were drinkers would they turn up with carrier bags and a collection of memories tragic stories for the telling and retelling cup of tea for you foxy he told himself as the queue of traffic began its crawl across the junction the mail waiting for him on the hall carpet was the usual stuff bills and junk and a bank statement at least the royal bank of scotland was still in business there was nothing in the envelope with the statement no letter of grovelling apology for getting above itself and letting down its customers lauder lodges monthly payment had gone out the rest seemed to be petrol and groceries he looked in the fridge seeking inspiration for a quick dinner denied he tried the cupboards and emerged with a tin of chilli and a small jar of jalapenos there was longgrain rice in a jar on the worktop the radio was tuned to classic fm but he changed the channel to something hed come across recently the station was just called birdsong and birdsong was precisely what it delivered he went back to the fridge and pulled out a bottle of appletiser sat with his drink at the table and rubbed a hand across his face and forehead kneading his temples and the bridge of his nose he wondered who would pay for his nursing home when the time came he hoped thered be someone like mrs sanderson waiting for him there when the food was ready he took it through to the living room and switched on the tv there was birdsong still audible from the kitchen sometimes he left it on all night he flicked through the freeview channels until he found dave it was all repeats but still watchable fifth gear followed by top gear followed by another top gear can i stand the pace hed left his mobile to recharge on the worktop in the kitchen when it started ringing he considered not answering a scoop of dinner a halfgroan and he placed the tray on the carpet the phone had gone dead by the time he reached it but the readout showed two capitalised letters tk meaning tony kaye fox unplugged the phone from its charger punched in his colleagues number and retreated to the sofa where are you kaye asked im not pubbing tonight fox warned him he could hear the background hubbub minters or some place like it yes you are kaye informed him weve got trouble how soon can you get here what sort of trouble your friend brecks been on the blower get him to call me at home it wasnt you he wanted it was me fox had dug his fork back into the chilli but now left it there what do you mean youre going to have to square this foxy brecks going to be here at the top of the hour fox lifted the phone from his ear long enough to check its clock seventeen minutes i can be there in twenty he said rising from the sofa and switching off the tv what does he want with you hes keen to know why i had a mate look up vince faulkner on the pnc fox cursed under his breath twenty he repeated as he grabbed his coat and car keys dont say anything till i get there minters right right fox cursed again and ended the call slamming the front door on his way out the same two customers were at the bar conferring with the landlord on a question from yet another tv quiz show jamie breck recognised fox and nodded a greeting he was seated at tony kayes regular table kaye himself seated opposite his face stern what can i get you breck asked fox shook his head and sat down he noted that kaye was drinking tomato juice breck a halfpint of orange and lemonade hows your sister doing fox just nodded and rolled his shoulders lets get this sorted eh breck looked at him i hope you appreciate he began that im trying to do you a favour here a favour tony kaye didnt sound convinced a headsup were not idiots sergeant kaye first thing we did was a background check pnc keeps a record of recent searches and thats what led us to your pal in hull cid some pal kaye muttered folding his arms he was slow enough giving us your name if thats any consolation took his boss to do a bit of the strongarm how did the autopsy go fox interrupted breck turned his attention to him blunt trauma internal injuries were pretty sure he was dead when they dumped him dead how long day day and a half breck paused rotating his glass on its coaster the pnc search was yesterday is that the same day you found out about judes broken arm yes fox admitted you went looking for faulkner no breck raised an eyebrow though his stare remained focused on the glass in front of him the man whod just broken your sisters arm you didnt want a word with him i wanted a word but i didnt go looking and how about you sergeant kaye kaye opened his mouth to answer but fox held up a hand to stop him this has nothing to do with sergeant kaye he stated i asked him for a background check on faulkner why ammunition if there was anything there i was hoping maybe jude would see sense leave him you mean fox nodded you told her never got the chance faulkner was already dead wasnt he breck didnt bother answering fox made eye contact with tony kaye giving the slightest of nods to let him know this was how he wanted it if there was going to be flak it was foxs to take remember when i asked you if there was anything you wanted to tell me about the victim breck was fixing malcolm fox with a stare how come you didnt mention his previous i dont really know fox answered with a shrug what else did you find nothing but you knew he was a naughty boy seems to have toed the line since coming north well it takes time doesnt it hed want to be sure of the new terrain how long had he been in town a year year and a half fox answered the aroma was in his nostrils again two fresh malts had just been poured at the bar how did your sister meet him youll have to ask her well definitely do that breck glanced at his watch i said i was giving you a headsup but times nearly up how do you mean breck locked eyes with malcolm fox im not your problem here just remember that all three turned as the door to the pub was pushed open with enough force to rattle it on its hinges the man who lumbered in was almost as wide as he was tall despite the plummeting temperature outside he wore only a checked sports jacket over his opennecked shirt fox recognised him and with good reason he was detective chief inspector william giles bad billy giles judging from the welllined face the black wavy hair had to be a dye job not that anyone was about to point this out to the owner the eyes were a cold crystalline blue pint of eighty giles ordered approaching the table breck rose to his feet but hesitated long enough to start making introductions i know who they are giles growled back at him three hours they spent grilling me three hours of my life ill never get back glen heaton didnt deserve the effort you put in fox commented you can knock a man down as often as you like giles spat the measure is when he keeps getting up and glen heatons a long way from being counted out by the likes of you the chair brecks chair creaked as giles lowered himself on to it his eyes flitted between tony kaye and malcolm fox but now youre mine he stated with grim satisfaction billy giles wasnt just the cid head honcho at torphichen not just jamie brecks boss and glen heatons come to that he was also heatons oldest friend fox was thinking back to that threehour interview thinking too of all the obstacles giles had placed in the way of the psu investigation now youre mine giles echoed with quiet satisfaction from the bar breck made eye contact with malcolm fox im not your problem here fox acknowledged as much with the same slight nod hed earlier given to tony kaye then he turned his attention to giles not quite yet he said giving equal weight to each individual word he rose to his feet indicating that kaye should do the same you want us you know where to find us nows as good a time as any but fox was shaking his head as he buttoned his coat you know where to find us he repeated just be sure to make an appointment were always busy in the complaints youre maggots the pair of you even standing fox wasnt much taller than the seated giles but he leaned down a little towards the man were not maggots he stated you said so yourself were the ones in the ring the ones who floored your pal heaton and last time i looked he was still on the canvas then he straightened up turned and walked out it was a few seconds before tony kaye joined him kaye was knotting his tartan scarf as he emerged from the pub what the hell do we do he asked we dont need to do anything itll happen the way it happens we should at least tell mcewan fox nodded his agreement giles will want us interviewed at torphichen we stick to my story i might get a reprimand but i doubt itll amount to much kaye considered this then shook his head slowly giles wont let it go at that far as hes concerned this is payback time all hell get is small change tony kaye thought for a further moment that bastard in hull we ought to have realised everyone leaves traces even on a computer kaye breathed out noisily through his nose so what now fox shrugged do you need a lift i dont see your nissan i parked it legally for a change its a couple of streets away you didnt want torphichen nabbing you for that too kaye shook his head how come youre always so calm foxy no point being anything else like i say what happens happens kaye was staring at the door of minters we should leg it before he comes out hes got that pint to drink and maybe another one after it by the way what did you think of jamie breck kaye needed only a second to deliver his verdict good guy seems like malcolm fox nodded his agreement seems like wednesday february wednesday morning fox was brushing his teeth when the home phone started ringing the upstairs handset needed recharging and he knew the caller would have hung up before he could reach the living room so he stayed where he was hed woken early tony kayes words in his head good guy seems like kaye had meant that breck was the sort to help out a colleague didnt mean he couldnt be other things too just as fox was wiping his mouth his mobile let out its little chirrup it was on the dresser in the bedroom and he walked through tossing the towel on to the justmade bed fox he said pressing the phone to his ear mr fox its alison pettifer foxs stomach tightened is jude all right theyve taken her who but already knowing the answer some policemen c division they said meaning torphichen fox looked at his watch half seven its just routine he started to explain thats what they said routine questions all the same i thought youd want to know thats kind of you should i stay here do you think fox wasnt sure what she meant was she suggesting she head to torphichen herself to keep an eye on them i mean fox lifted the phone from his ear and read the display she was calling from judes home phone theyre still there he asked some of them yes with a search warrant they did get jude to sign something the neighbour confirmed where are you now mrs pettifer the foot of the stairs he heard her apologise as someone pushed past her heavy footsteps making for the upstairs landing they dont seem to like me sticking around what happened to judes other friends the ones who were going to look after her joyce stayed the night but she had to leave for work at six thirty the police started arriving just after so i got dressed and thanks for everything mrs pettifer you can go home now a couple of reporters came to the door yesterday evening but i gave them short shrift thanks again well i might just nip home then if you think thats for the best fox ended the call fetched a fresh shirt from its hanger and decided yesterdays tie would suffice he was halfway down the stairs when the landline started ringing again he lifted the receiver from the sofa and pressed it to his ear fox he said its mcewan morning sir you sound harassed no sir just getting ready to leave so ill see you here in half an hour actually i need to stop off somewhere first i dont think thats advisable malcolm sir torphichen have told me whats happening i got the call half an hour ago that stunt you pulled with the pnc is going to take a bit of work to defuse i was going to tell you sir fox paused truth is theyve taken my sister in for questioning she needs someone with her not you malcolm you need to be here they know shes my sister bob they dont like what ive done to their pal heaton i know people at torphichen malcolm ill see to it everythings squared yes sir half an hour then you me and tony kaye are going to have a fine wee natter the phone went dead in foxs hand in fact the journey took him longer than expected his excuse tram works really hed detoured to judes street in saughtonhall her front door was open a scene of crime van stood kerbside someone had been dispatched to the corner shop the crew were drinking from polystyrene cups and munching on pastries and crisps he saw just a couple of plainclothes cops faces he recognised dimly from visits to torphichen no sign of either billy giles or jamie breck a neighbour on the opposite side of the road stood watching from her window arms folded fox let his engine idle knowing there was nothing to be gained from going in eventually he signalled back out into the traffic the drivers were all being polite didnt mind braking on his behalf it gave them more time to gawp my dabs will be all over the place fox told mcewan they werent in the office mcewan had found an empty meetingroom an elliptical table and eight or nine chairs there was a marker board on a tripod three words written there visibility viability versatility tony kaye had found the only chair in the room with castors he was rolling himself backwards from the table then forward again thats annoying me mcewan warned him what are we going to do about bad billy kaye asked still moving hes dci giles to you sergeant kaye and were going to let him do his job he turned his head in foxs direction isnt that right malcolm fox nodded only thing we can do theyll feel better once theyve given us a kicking mcewan gave a sigh how many times have i told you psu has to be above reproach like i say sir searching the database for vince faulkner was my idea mcewan glared at fox thats a load of balls and you know it tony here is the kind whod decide a protocol could be bent isnt that right sergeant yes sir kaye admitted last night we told giles something different fox cautioned then you better stick to that mcewan snapped back if he catches you in one lie hell go looking for others he paused are there any others no sir both men said in unison mcewan was thoughtful for a moment billy giles is all bile and bluster scratch the surface and theres a lot less of him to be scared of he held up a finger doesnt mean you should underestimate him malcolm fox took out his handkerchief and blew his nose are they treating judes house as a crime scene possible crime scene they wont find anything i thought you just said theyd find your prints i was there on monday and then again yesterday best make sure they know that fox nodded slowly while mcewans attention shifted back to kaye tony i swear to god if you dont stop swivelling on that damned chair kaye leapt to his feet so suddenly the chair rolled all the way back to the marker board he strode over to the window and peered down at the car park this doesnt feel right he muttered with a shake of the head foxy starts looking at jamie breck next thing we know c divisions sniffing at our balls what if bad billy got wind of it and decided hed lost enough rotten apples for one season and did what mcewan reasoned killed a man in cold blood is that seriously what youre suggesting im not saying he but kaye couldnt finish what hed started it turned into an elongated snarl instead do i put myself forward for questioning fox calmly asked of his boss theyve already requested the pleasure of your company when do they want me soon as this meetings done mcewan said fox stared at him so so youre idiots the pair of you nobody accesses the pnc without good reason we had good reason kaye insisted you had a good personal reason tony and thats far from being the same thing hed been involved in a domestic kaye ploughed on we were looking for evidence of priors keep telling yourself that mcewan offered with a tiredlooking smile sir fox interrupted needing to hear the word go bob mcewan obliged is my sister all right you want to see her giles asked he was dressed in the same clothes as the previous night but with the addition of a tie his neck had outgrown the collar of his shirt and the top button was undone visible behind the ties loose knot where is she shes not far they were in one of the interview rooms at torphichen the place had a precinct feel to it crumbling and circumferenced by dereliction and roadworks there wasnt much for the tourists once you got west of princes street and lothian road the oneway system dragged buses cabs and lorries around it but it was a thankless spot for pedestrians inside the building there were the usual smells of mildew and desperation the interview room bore battle scars scratched walls chipped desk graffiti on the back of the door theyd kept fox waiting a good long time in the reception area giving uniforms and plainclothes officers alike the chance to come and glare at him when hed eventually followed giles down the corridor towards the interview room there had been plenty of hissing and cursing from office doorways is she all right though fox persisted giles made eye contact with him for the first time since coming in weve not started the waterboarding yet if thats what youre asking tea and biccies and a female officer for company last time i looked in giles leaned forward so his elbows rested against the table its a bad business he stated fox just nodded when did you last see mr faulkner before christmas november maybe you didnt have much time for him no dont blame you you knew he was using your sister as a punchbag though fox stared at him but didnt answer see if thatd been my kith and kin idve been on the bastard like a ton of shit id spoken to her about it she told me her arm was an accident no way you believed her giles leaned back again bunching his hands into his jacket pockets so how come you didnt face up to him i never got the chance or you were yellow giles let the accusation float in the air between them when fox didnt rise to it he bared his teeth her arm was broken saturday wasnt it so she says when did you find out about it there was a noise in the corridor outside a young male by the sound of it not exactly cooperating as he was led to or from his cell thatll be mollison giles explained wee wankers a oneman crime wave soon as im done here ill be having words with him is he anything to do with giles shook his head mollisonll break into your home or car but its unlikely hed bludgeon you to death takes rage that sort of attack the sort of rage that comes from a grudge i hadnt seen faulkner since before christmas did you know back then know what that he was a wifebeater jude wasnt his wife did you though giless small eyes staring out from his fleshy face were drilling into fox though he fought against it fox wriggled in his chair i knew their relationship was tempestuous giles offered a snort youre not here to write a mills and fucking boon jude always said she gave as good as she got didnt make it right inspector seems to me you shied away from saying anything you never pulled faulkner aside for a quiet word after the arm i wouldve done if thered been the chance so were back to my original question when did you find out a neighbour called me on monday afternoon giles nodded slowly mrs pettifer he stated yes stood to reason shed have been questioned by the inquiry team im assuming you then went looking for him no fox was peering down at his hands clasped across his lap no giles sounded unconvinced what difference would it have made he was already dead wasnt he come on fox you know time of deaths always open to debate a few hours this way or that did he turn up for work monday morning giles paused a moment before answering weighing up what he did and didnt want fox to know eventually he shook his head so what was he doing where was he hiding himself from saturday night onwards someone must have seen him whoever killed him saw him you cant think it was jude giles pursed his lips and removed his hands from their pockets cupping them behind his head as his shirt stretched gaps appeared between the buttons revealing a white string vest beneath the room felt warm to fox he knew they probably kept it stuffy didnt want suspects getting too comfortable his scalp felt itchy perspiration cloying there but if he scratched or wiped giles would think the interview was getting to him ive seen faulkner on the slab the detective was saying plenty of muscle on him not sure a onearmed alcoholic girlie weighing all of eight stone could have outpointed him giles was watching for a reaction someone couldve helped her though youre not going to find anything in the house in the distance a door slammed a truck or bus was idling outside causing the frosted window pane to shiver noisily in its frame plenty of evidence of a chaotic lifestyle giles went on even when someones had a go at tidying up that was the neighbour she did it out of kindness im not suggesting anyone was trying to cover their tracks giles gave a cold smile and by the way hows your case against glen heaton shaping up wondered how long it would take you hes loving it you know full pay feet up at home while we shiver and scrape ice off the windscreen of a morning giless meaty hands came to rest on the table he leaned over them and exonerated at the end of it i go easy on heaton and you lay off my sister giles tried for a look of mock outrage did i say that i dont think i said that he paused but i cant help feeling a sense of what irony poetic justice a mans dead in case youd forgotten ive not forgotten inspector you can be absolutely sure of that every detail of faulkners life is going to be pored over by my men your sisters going to have to get used to questions and more questions the media are showing an interest too so she might want to stop answering her door and her phone dont take this out on her fox said quietly or youll make a complaint giles smiled now wouldnt that be the cherry on the top are we finished fox was starting to get to his feet for now unless theres anything you want to tell me fox could think of a few things but all he did was shake his head out in the hallway he tried a few of the doors but jude wasnt in any of the other interview rooms at the far end was the door leading to the stations cramped reception area and beyond that the outside world a familiar face was loitering on the steps when fox emerged can we take a walk jamie breck asked cutting short the phone call hed been making on his mobile my cars right here fox nodded towards it all the same breck gestured and started moving up the slope towards the traffic lights how did it go with dci giles how do you think it went breck gave a slow nod i reckoned youd want to know how things are shaping up is that how it works giles gives me a doing and then you start in with the good cop routine hed kill me if he knew i was talking to you breck looked over his shoulder as they rounded the corner into morrison street then why are you i dont like the politics us on our side you on yours breck was walking briskly it was a young mans gait purposeful and strong as if the future held a clear destination fox struggling to keep up could feel the sweat growing chill at his hairline wheres my sister he asked on her way home i think off the record whats your view of glen heaton brecks nose wrinkled i could see that he cut a few corners he drove on every pavement he saw thats his style pretty effective too i think your boss just tried to do a deal with me what sort of deal heaton for my sister breck gave a little whistle but since my sister hasnt done anything you turned him down breck guessed you dont seem surprised he made the offer breck shrugged all im wondering is why youre telling me when we nail heaton therell be a vacancy at di i suppose so youre not ambitious of course im ambitious isnt everyone arent you not especially the two men walked in silence for a few paces so how did it go with bad billy breck eventually asked he sees the investigation as a way of getting at me and that may colour his judgement take him down any number of wrong roads breck was nodding did he tell you about the cctv fox looked at the younger man what about it ill assume he didnt breck took a deep breath theres a pub in gorgie faulkner wasnt exactly a regular but he went in occasionally theyve got cctv inside and out and breck stopped suddenly and turned to face malcolm fox studying him im not sure how much of this i should be telling you whats the pub called marooned do you know it breck watched the older man shake his head its only been open a year or so vince faulkner was caught on camera fox prompted saturday night a few rugby fans were in welsh guys words were exchanged and they took it outside they beat him up breck shook his head from the footage ive seen he pushed one of them and they gave his head a slap three against one faulkner weighed it up and sloped off with a few final insults they didnt go after him doesnt mean he didnt bump into them again later no fox was thoughtful your sister says he doesnt have any family left down south is that right fox shrugged shed know better than me he paused this doesnt have anything to do with her you know breck nodded slowly all the same its the way the games played will her house be a mess i asked the socos to go easy they wont have found anything the two men had started walking again when they turned left into dewar place fox realised they were doing a circuit another left into the lane and theyd be back at the police station and foxs car you live quite close to me breck was saying fox opened his mouth to reply then made a swallowing motion instead hed been about to say i know is that right was what he eventually answered it came up breck explained with a shrug im on the estate behind morrisons you married girlfriend how serious only a couple of months shes not moved in yet how about you i used to be married fox replied family lifes tough when youre a cop breck decided yes it is fox agreed he was thinking about the girlfriend plenty of abusers and offenders had partners it made for good cover the quiet family man only a tiny part of their everyday life was given over to their secret self on the other hand there were probably lots of men out there whod stumbled upon websites they wished they hadnt then had lingered not altogether sure why drawn in by something how many though ended up handing over their credit card is that what youve got so far fox asked marooned and some welsh rugby fans thats about it no sightings sunday or monday its early days inspector fox nodded and thought of something where did he work you dont know i know he was a labourer he was on a shortterm contract at salamander point i thought it had gone bust not quite they had almost reached the end of dewar place lane breck touched fox on the shoulder best if we split up here fox nodded thanks for the chat breck smiled and stuck out his hand the two men shook fox called lauder lodge from the car they asked if he wanted to speak to his father but he told them just to pass on the message he couldnt take mitch to judes today maybe tomorrow marooned was about halfway between torphichen place and saughtonhall it was down a side street not far from the heart of midlothian stadium fox didnt get out of the car just sat there long enough to get an idea of the place the singlestorey brick building dated back to the seventies must have been a gap site at one time maybe a garage or builders yard before that fourstorey tenements flanked it with another across the street a chalkboard to the left of the main door promised quiz nights karaoke and hot food there was a doublemeasuresingleprice deal on spirits just the one cctv camera bolted high up on the wall and protected by a wire cage fox knew he could go inside and flash his warrant card ask to see the footage but what good would it do and if word got back to billy giles that hed been there instead he executed a threepoint turn and got back on to the road to saughtonhall the door was answered by a woman he didnt know he introduced himself as judes brother im sandra the woman said sandra hendry she was around judes age with dark tired eyes and a blotchy face the outfit artfully ripped and patched denims top trimmed to show her midriff would have suited someone half her age and forty pounds lighter her hair resembled candyfloss beginning to darken at its roots gold hoop earrings dangled from her lobes her nose and tongue were pierced and studded judes in bed she said leading him inside do you want to go up in a minute they were in the living room by now the place looked relatively tidy the woman called sandra had retreated to the armchair and was crossing one leg over the other the tv was on but with the sound just audible a tanned man seemed to be trying to train an unruly dog love this sandra commented fox noticed that one of her ankles sported a tattoo of a scorpion hows she doing fox asked commencing a circuit of the room just got back from the gestapo she broke off and stared at him eyes widening as she remembered what judes brother did for a living ive heard worse he reassured her she was shattered reckoned a nap might help fox nodded his understanding flipping open the lid of the kitchen bin he saw that its inner bag had been removed forensics would be busy at their howdenhall hq poring over its contents i appreciate you looking after her sandra shrugged my shift doesnt start till four where do you work the asda on chesser avenue she offered him a stick of gum but he shook his head the empty bottles and cans had gone ashtrays had been cleaned the breakfast bar now boasted only a couple of dirty mugs and a pizza carton did you ever meet vince fox asked four of us used to go out you and your partner he works with vince she paused stopped chewing past tense i suppose hes in construction then she nodded foreman vinces boss i suppose so was it your partner who took vince on she shrugged husband not partner sixteen years youd get less for murdering someone thats what ronnie says hes probably right you and ronnie knew vince pretty well then suppose so ever end up at a place called marooned that shithole not if we could help it in the better weather the boys liked the golf tavern meant they could play pitch n putt on bruntsfield links you and jude didnt play dinner and a few games of roulette or blackjack thats more my thing which casino the oliver at ocean terminal hed finished looking around and was standing in the middle of the room facing her as she stared at the tv thats the one not far from salamander point then within staggering distance fox nodded to himself what did you make of him sandra at mention of her name she peered up at him vince you mean she considered his question he was all right bit of a laugh when you got him in the right mood meaning he sometimes wasnt i knew he had a temper but judes not exactly lacking in that department either what do you think about him breaking her arm she says she fell but we both know she didnt my motto is dont get involved just leads to more grief her interest in him had waned onscreen the doghandler was making obvious progress but youre her friend you mustve fox broke off thinking to himself youre her brother and you didnt im going to go upstairs he said instead sandra nodded distractedly id offer to make you a cuppa but were all out the door to vinces den was wide open and fox saw that his computer had been removed by the investigators judes bedroom door was ajar he knocked and pushed it all the way open his sister was sitting on the bed surrounded by piles of clothes the fitted wardrobe had been half emptied along with the chest of drawers it was all faulkners stuff his jeans and tshirts socks and pants jude was holding a shortsleeved shirt in her good hand working at the cloth with her fingers she was sniffing back tears i can still smell him on the sheets the pillows part of hims still here she paused for a moment and gave her brother a look know what they told me malcolm they said we cant have the funeral they need to hold on to his body might take weeks they said nobody knows how long there was a corner of the bed going spare so fox rested his weight there but stayed silent sandra says we need to start cancelling stuff and telling the proper authorities but whats left of him after that she sniffed again and rubbed her forearm across her eyes they kept asking me all these questions they think i did it they dont fox assured her reaching out to give her shoulder a squeeze that man giles his name was he kept on at me about vince being an abuser thats the word he used abuser he said vince had past convictions he said they were for violence told me no one would blame me for getting my own back but thats not what happened malcolm giles knows that jude they all do then why did he keep saying it hes a prick sis she managed a fleeting smile at this fox wasnt letting go of her shoulder just yet but she turned to look at his hand that hurts she explained and he realised the shoulder belonged to her broken arm christ sorry another halfsmile there was a nicer detective breck i think yes because we read that book one holiday when we were kids kidnapped fox reminded her the heros called alan breck you wanted me to read it to you at bedtime she nodded remembering every night for two weeks and now look at us she turned to him tears running down her cheeks i loved him malcolm i know she started wiping her tears on the shirt she was holding im not going to cope without him yes you are trust me can i get you anything how about a time machine might take a while to build sandra says youre out of tea and coffee i could go to the shop and fetch some she shook her head shes going to bring some back from asda says theres a discount for staff she was telling me the four of you used to go to the casino i never knew you liked a flutter jude took a deep breath and exhaled it wasnt me so much as the other three i liked the meal and a few drinks they were always good nights she paused they had people here you know rifling through all our stuff i had to sign for some things they took its why she gestured towards the clothes surrounding her drawers were already open so i thought i might as well fox nodded ill leave you to it if youre sure theres nothing i does mitch know yes ive put him off visiting ill go see him that would be easier wouldnt it i can take you how about later three oclock four shouldnt you be at work fox just shrugged okay then jude said her brother started to get to his feet he was at the door when she thought of something monday night someone came to the house fox paused with his hand on the handle said he was looking for vince jude went on i told him i didnt know where he was closed the door on him and that was that you didnt know him jude shook her head tall guy dark hair i went to the window and watched him leave but all i saw was his back did he get into a car maybe you told giles this she shook her head again mad as it seems i wasnt in the mood maybe you could tell him instead sure one thing though jude what was vince in any sort of trouble maybe hed been on a shorter fuse than usual she considered this holding the shirt up to her nose he was just vince she told fox always will be but malcolm yes did you know about the convictions she watched him as he gave a slow nod of the head you never told me by the time i found out he was already dead you could still have told me better to hear it from you than that vile man yes fox agreed sorry sis but how about you did you really not know it was judes turn to shake her head doesnt matter now she said her attention drifting back to her dead lovers shirt nothing matters now at fettes there was a message that ds inglis wanted to see him she delivered it herself tony kaye teased as fox read the note tidy body on her wheres the boss fox asked knocked off early says hes got a speech to write when fox looked at him kaye just shrugged some conference in glasgow methods of policing an expected surge in civil unrest joe naysmith recited all down to the credit crunch apparently kaye tutted theyll be lynching bankers next whats that got to do with the complaints fox asked if our lads go in a bit too hard at the protesters kaye explained might end up coming to us he had risen from his desk and was moving towards foxs good to see you escaped unscathed kept you there long enough bad billy giles was doing his torquemada impression only to be expected hows your sister bearing up fine so far i went to see her after torphichen did you learn anything faulker had a runin with some rugby fans saturday night oh seemed to peter out all the same is that the last sighting kaye watched his colleague nod and judes been interviewed by both giles and jamie breck did she have anything to tell them i dont think so fox was pinching the bridge of his nose he wished the head cold would either explode into life or else burn itself out at the moment all it was doing was shadowing him like a stalker are you going to go see the talent what fox looked up at kaye the chop shop glamour puss kaye gestured towards the note i can always nip along on your behalf pass on a message its fine fox said getting back to his feet kaye shrugged and turned away hey starbuck he called to joe naysmith get the coffee on fox walked the short distance to the ceop office and pressed the buzzer annie inglis herself opened the door just an inch at first checking it was him she beamed a smile and ushered him inside dc gilchrist nodded a greeting the blinds were drawn against the low midafternoon sun i havent got long fox warned inglis just wondered how things were she held her hand out towards the same chair hed taken on his first visit he sat down opposite her their knees brushing for a moment she was dressed in a skirt and black tights and an opennecked white blouse with a string of pearls around her neck the pearls looked old maybe some sort of heirloom things are fine he said gilchrist his back to them was lifting the casing from a hard drive peering inside for anything of interest our opposite numbers in melbourne are readying to jump the gun inglis said how do you mean the cop down there the one i showed you she indicated her desk monitor theyre worried he has friends on the force meaning hell find out were on to him theyre getting ready to question him inglis nodded we might lose any number of his uk clients the ones whove coughed up the cash gilchrist added without looking up but not the rest of the joining fee theyll have to be let off with a caution breck still hasnt sent any pictures inglis shook her head hasnt posted anything on the groups message board either she paused this has happened before information gets leaked leaving plenty of time for evidence to disappear or be tampered with but youve got the evidence it was foxs turn to gesture towards the monitor weve just scratched the surface malcolm tip of the iceberg gilchrist agreed as he started to dismantle the drive unit what we could really do with he seemed to be talking to himself is access to the suspects home computer fox looked at inglis she was staring back at him thing is she said wed have to apply for a searchandseize brecks bound to have a friend somewhere in the system who might be tempted to alert him you on the other hand gilchrist added still seemingly intent on his task can do a bit of breaking and entering and all of it above board the complaints have got powers beyond us mere mortals i thought it was general background you wanted a bit of evidence would be nice inglis mused wed get a gold star from london her colleague continued is that what this is about fox asked impressing the big kids you want them to think were all amateurs north of the border inglis waited for a response which didnt come hell have a store of images at home either on his hard drive or a memory stick she continued quietly but determinedly even if hes transferred them theyll have left traces traces fox echoed she nodded slowly its like forensics malcolm everyone leaves a bit of a trail or a trail of bits gilchrist added in what fox assumed was a private joke inglis certainly offered her colleague a smile fox leaned back in his chair thinking of the trail tony kaye had left on the pnc nice line of patter the two of you have got all for my benefit or is it a tried and tested routine whatever it takes inglis said thing is though he told her we dont just go breaking into peoples homes without okaying it first but permission can be granted retrospectively inglis stated it has to be justified to the surveillance commissioner fox cautioned eventually inglis agreed as far as i understand it in emergencies youre allowed to act first and consult later but this isnt my case fox said quietly im not the one investigating jamie breck in point of fact he could argue that hes investigating me and hows that going to look there was silence in the room for a moment not great inglis eventually conceded the glimmer of hope had vanished from her eyes she looked to gilchrist and received a shrug in reply we had to try she told fox we hate to lose one gilchrist added tossing a small screwdriver on to the desk maybe theres some other way fox offered for b and e we need the surveillance commissioners okay but if brecks using his home computer we could set up the van outside zero in on his keystrokes and find out what hes doing you dont need judicial approval for the van inglis asked her spirits lifting fox shook his head dcc can give the goahead and even then it can be retrospective well the dccs on our side inglis commented she had nudged the mouse on the desk next to her the computer screen sprang back into life showing the same photograph as before the melbourne cop with the asian kid you know what their defence is she asked they call it a victimless crime they share photos in most cases thats all they say they do theyre not the ones doing the actual abusing doesnt mean its not abuse gilchrist stated look fox said with a sigh i appreciate the job youre trying to do with one arm tied behind our backs inglis interrupted let me see if i can help fox went on the surveillance vans a real option if he is what you say he is if gilchrists voice had risen he was staring hard at fox but inglis calmed him with a wave of her hand thanks malcolm she said to fox anything at all would be appreciated okay then fox said rising to his feet leave it with me her hand touched his forearm they locked eyes and he nodded she mouthed three words as he readied to leave anything at all back in the complaints he crooked a forefinger at tony kaye kaye approached foxs desk arms folded how would you feel fox asked him about a nighttime stint in the van kaye gave a snort and a grin whats she giving you in return fox shook his head but how would you feel he persisted id feel grumpy and tired is this in the hope that we catch breck drooling over internet porn yes hes not our customer foxy he could be if hes doing what the chop shop say he is a joint operation i think ds inglis or her colleague would need to be in the van is her colleague as tasty as she is not quite fox looked over towards the coffee machine youd need naysmith too of course kaye seemed to deflate sadly thats true naysmith was the one who knew how to get the best out of the technology but while hes breaking sweat fox added youll have plenty of time to work your charm on ds inglis also true kaye agreed perking up again but where would you be i cant get involved tony kaye nodded his acceptance of this tonight he asked sooner the better the vans not on other duties kaye shook his head cold night for it might need to snuggle up for warmth im sure ds inglis would like that go tell naysmith and ill let the chop shop know fox watched kaye retreat then picked up the telephone and punched in the number for ceop inglis answered and he cupped his hand to his mouth so kaye wouldnt overhear we can do a surveillance tonight itll be two of my men kaye and naysmith nights are fox knew what she was about to say difficult yes with your son and everything but as it happens sergeant kaye would be a lot more comfortable with a male officer gilchrist would be up for it annie inglis stated then prickling whys kaye uncomfortable working with a woman officer its women in general annie fox explained in an undertone oh she said kaye and naysmith were approaching his desk so fox ended the call thats sorted then he told them tony kaye just rubbed his hands together and smiled on his way home that evening fox stopped off at a chinese restaurant hed half a mind to take a table but the place was empty it would just have been him and the staff so instead he ordered some food to eat at home fifteen minutes later he was in the car the carrier bag on the passenger seat chicken with fresh ginger and spring onion soft noodles chinese greens the owner had offered him a helping of prawn crackers on the house but fox had declined once home he emptied the whole lot on to a plate then decided it was too much and scooped half the noodles back into their container he ate at the dining table a dishtowel tucked into his shirt collar there had been no messages on his phone and no mail waiting for him a couple of dogs were having an argument a street or two away a motorbike passed the house being driven too quickly fox turned the radio on to the birdsong channel poured himself a glass of appletiser and thought back to the visit to lauder lodge hed picked jude up at four as agreed the two of them not saying much on the drive the staff at the care home had tried not to look too interested in jude it wasnt just the cast on her arm theyd been reading their papers and watching the local tv news they knew who she was and what had happened i forgot to wear my mourning veil jude muttered to her brother as they headed down the corridor to their fathers room mitch was waiting for them he insisted on getting to his feet so he could offer jude a consoling embrace as they all sat down two staff members arrived to ask if they wanted a cup of tea mitch decided this would be acceptable but after the tea had been fetched another staffer stuck her head round the door to see if they might like a biscuit malcolm fox decided enough was enough and closed the door but almost immediately there was a knock this time they wanted mr fox to know that it was whist night starting straight after supper yes i know he said now bugger off and leave us in peace he turned his attention back to his daughter how are you jude im okay you dont look it its hellish about that man of yours his names vince dad hellish mitch fox repeated staring at her arm sorry dad fox apologised i should have told you what happened i fell in the kitchen jude blurted out im sure you did her father muttered the visit hadnt been a complete disaster mitch had managed not to say anything like i told you so or he was never right for you jude had managed to say nothing to offend her father youre quiet malcolms father had chided him at one point fox had just shrugged making show of concentrating on the cup of tea he was holding afterwards hed driven jude home asking her if she wanted any company shed shaken her head told him alison was going to look in then shed pecked him on the cheek before exiting the car sitting at his dining table reflecting back on that moment fox wasnt sure why hed been so startled by judes gesture maybe it was because like many another family they so seldom showed affection there might be a kiss or a hug at christmas or at funerals of course but he hadnt seen jude this past christmas and the last family funeral had been an aunt the previous summer thanks jude had said closing the car door hed watched her all the way into her house she didnt pause to wave and after her front door was closed and the livingroom light came on she hadnt come to the window to offer a signal of goodbye back at lauder lodge mitch had asked if he should give audrey sanderson a buzz im sure shed like to see you but jude had asked him not to and fox got the feeling mrs sanderson herself was keeping well out of the way not wishing to interfere scraping the leftovers into the bin fox wondered what his father thought of him mitch could have been living here with him there was plenty of space the stairs might have been an issue the very argument fox had used to himself when deciding his fathers future besides at lauder lodge the old boy had made friends true that might have happened in oxgangs as well there was a daily gettogether of older people at the local church but no lauder lodge had been the best option and outcome lauder lodge had been the right thing to do he started to make himself some tea but stopped the taste of the cup hed drunk at lauder lodge was still at the back of his throat dissuading him from repeating the experience there was more appletiser in the fridge but he didnt fancy it he didnt know what he wanted through in the living room he tried all the tv channels without finding anything he was willing to waste time on he supposed he could have an early night catch up on some reading but it wasnt even nine oclock two hours until the breck surveillance was due to start joe naysmith had asked the obvious question is everything in order meaning paperwork meaning the green light from on high naysmith cautious and scrupulous fox had assured him it was in the post shorthand for to be dealt with at a later date kaye had told the younger man not to worry ruffling his hand through naysmiths hair their excuse mcewans absence plus the chop shops stipulation that it was an emergency well be fine fox had stated everything would be fine a dvd maybe he could watch a film but nothing jumped out at him as an obvious candidate he thought of the dvds in judes house none of them vince faulkners choices romantic comedies dreams of another less imperfect life he tried to remember what judes ambitions had been back when theyd both been kids but nothing came to mind what about him had he always wanted to be a detective yes pretty much the hearts first team had never come calling and vacancies for film stars seemed not to be advertised besides hed liked telling friends im going to be a cop relishing the words and the effect they had on some people cop copper filth pig hed been called worse too down the years and sometimes by his own kind colleagues whod crossed the line gone bad been found out he imagined jamie breck clean and shiny on the surface heading home and locking the door after him shutting the curtains all alone no prying eyes warming up his computer allowing his secret self to breathe and unaware of the van parked outside picking up every key he tapped every site he visited everything he viewed the people in the van viewed too fox had seen it in action hed felt a shiver up his spine as love affairs were revealed criminal connections confirmed frauds and frailties exposed that how you get your kicks peeping fucking tom yes hed been called worse twisted bastard shafting your own kind lower than slime lowest of the low but still better than you the only response possible still better than you he was about the try the words out aloud when his doorbell sounded he checked his watch it was half past nine he stood in the hall for a moment listening for clues when the bell rang again he opened the door an inch hiya jamie breck said fox opened the door all the way he glanced to right and left this is a surprise was all he managed to say breck gave a little laugh id be lying if i said i was just passing but in a way its true i sometimes take a walk at night just clearing my head when i saw the sign for your street it dawned on me where i was maybe id planned to end up here all along he offered a shrug the subconscious is a wonderful thing is it fox was weighing up his options well you better come in only if im not disturbing you fox led breck into the living room do you want something to drink are you having anything i dont drink i dont think i knew that well now you can add it to my profile cant you breck smiled at this no alcohol in the house not even for visitors he watched fox shake his head meaning you dont trust yourself with the stuff am i right what can i do for you ds breck this isnt an official visit malcolm call me jamie what can i do for you jamie breck was seated on the sofa fox in the armchair to his right breck had twisted himself round so he was facing the older man he had changed his clothes since leaving work a denim jacket black cords purple polo neck nice place he said studying the room bigger than mine but then mines newer they tend to build smaller these days yes fox agreed waiting to hear what breck really wanted to say weve done what we can with the footage from outside the pub breck duly obliged i dont think were going to get anything useful by way of an id might let the police in wales take a look anyway just on the offchance thing is only a few minutes after the spat the rugby lads were back inside marooned laughing it off and ordering more drink says who a couple of regulars the welsh stood them a round even apologised for having a go at faulkner he paused plus there was cctv inside the bar as well as outside the story stacks up so unless they bumped into him again later on in the evening youre ruling them out were not ruling out anything malcolm why are you telling me thought youd want to know just between us you understand and what do i give you in return well seeing how this is a dry house im not too sure fox managed a smile and eased himself a little further back in his chair theres one thing he said at last jude didnt give it to billy giles because she didnt like his attitude yes breck prompted leaning forward monday night someone turned up at her door asking for faulkner if the pathologist is right faulkner was already growing cold by then fox nodded its probably nothing he agreed and all i got from her by way of description was that the caller was a man it was brecks turn to smile well thanks for that malcolm a man that certainly narrows things down the two sat in silence for a moment until breck started shaking his head slowly i dont know why they bother with cctv he declared deterrent value fox suggested or comfort blanket breck countered people are fitting it in their houses now did you know that to make them feel safer there was a housebreaking in merchiston a few months back glen heaton took me along for a look the footage was so grainy the guys responsible looked barely human they got half a million in antiques and jewellery know what heaton told the owners sell the cameras and buy a dog fox nodded his agreement preferably a big one breck continued and keep it half starved did you work with him often hardly at all im assuming thats why you never bothered to interview me we had everything we needed but you still gave billy giles a grilling just for a spot of fun i didnt think fun was in the dictionary so far as the complaints are concerned breck considered for a moment i dare say by now you know more about glen heaton than i do how long did you have him under surveillance months fox shifted in his chair less comfortable now should we even be discussing him breck asked seeming to take the hint probably not but now you know he was breaking every rule in the book how do you feel about him way billy giles tells it heaton only broke a rule if he stood to gain a result hed trade gen with criminals but the stuff he got in return put plenty of bad guys away and that makes it all right when breck shrugged fox gave a sigh change of subject any other news on vince faulkner we still dont have any sightings from sunday or monday and no pools of blood to report from the vicinity of that building site breck shook his head billy giles thinks he was maybe killed saturday night and kept somewhere by monday the killers nerve was starting to go and thats when the body got dumped fox nodded slowly staring down at the carpet one last thing breck added two youths were seen having a bit of a shouting match with a guy at a bus stop on dalry road not too far from marooned and about thirty or forty minutes after faulkner left the place meaning what sort of time around half past nine does the description fit there isnt much of a description a woman saw it from her tenement window she was two floors up and fifty yards across the other side of the street but shes a lawabiding busybody so she came forward to tell us what does she say happened couple of younger guys arguing with an older guy he seemed to be waiting for a bus as they were walking past words were exchanged a taxi came along and the man stuck his hand out got in and one of the kids gave the back of the cab a bit of a kick as it headed off which direction haymarket fox was thoughtful which buses go that route breck shook his head needle in a haystack malcolm they go all over west towards corstorphine and the gyle north to barnton east to the likes of ocean terminal vince used to go to a casino near ocean terminal fox mused him and his gaffer plus the gaffers wife and my sister is that the oliver breck asked sounding interested fox nodded why he asked no real reason you ever been there no me neither breck had something on his mind he was rubbing the underside of his jaw with the back of his hand are you trying to track down the taxi driver fox asked into the silence yes shouldnt be too hard if nothing else hell remember the kicking his cab got mmm breck seemed to make up his mind slapping his hands against his knees i really do fancy a drink malcolm are you allowed to join me i dont drink i meant can you come out to the pub sure fox said after a moments hesitation he checked his watch theyd have picked up the van by now checked its equipment theyd be discussing tactics before heading out but its getting pretty late breck looked at his own watch and raised an eyebrow its not even ten all i meant was just a quick one a quick one breck agreed is it all right if we take your car where did you have in mind the oliver im guessing itll have a bar foxs eyes narrowed he wasnt thinking about options now but consequences why there maybe we can ask if vince faulkner visited on saturday night thats not exactly going by the rules jamie your bossll have a fit if he finds out rules are there to be broken malcolm fox wagged a finger careful who you say that to breck just smiled and got to his feet are you game he asked long way to go for one drink breck was neither budging nor about to say anything with a sigh fox placed his hands on the arms of his chair and began to rise the area around ocean terminal was an odd amalgam of dockside wasteland warehouse conversions and new buildings ocean terminal itself was a shopping centre and cinema complex with the royal yacht britannia berthed permanently as a tourist attraction in a marina to the far side of the building nearby a vast shiny construction housed the citys army of civil servants or at least a few battalions of them a handful of lauded restaurants had opened up perhaps with one eye on the cruise ships that occasionally docked in leith the oliver was rotundashaped and liked to think that it had been the harbourmasters residence at some time fox wasnt even sure theyd be allowed inside breck was wearing trainers but breck had waved his objection aside and reached for his warrant card accepted nationwide hed said waving it in foxs face so theyd parked between a mercedes and a sporty toyota in the car park liveried doormen stood guard at the welllit entrance breck pointed out the cctv camera to fox though fox had already spotted it he was wondering if he should text kaye to let him know there was no point in tonights stakeout on the other hand if they did only stay for the one drink good evening one of the doormen said it sounded more warning than greeting how are you doing breck asked busy is it just starting to be the man looked him up and down eyes lingering on the denim jacket sightseeing trip is it breck patted his pocket ive got some cash burning a hole the other man was staring at fox this ones a cop he informed his colleague id bet my life on it are cops not allowed a night off fox asked him taking a step forward so he was in the mans face long as youre not looking for freebies the first doorman said we can pay our way breck assured him you better the man warned him and then they were in breck left his jacket at the cloakroom which helped him blend in a little at first glance the place offered glitz but it was fairly casual businessmen playing some tables their wives and girlfriends the others a few onlookers stood around sizing things up one of them looked to fox like the waiter whod taken his order earlier at the chinese restaurant confirmed when the man grinned and waved and gave him a little bow friend of yours breck asked there were slot machines as well as the tables for cards dice and roulette plus a welllit bar each croupier had someone from the house staff watching over them just to be on the safe side fox had heard stories of croupiers who were too regular in their actions meant the players could work out which quadrant of the wheel the roulette ball was most likely to stop cutting the odds down the years a few cops had got into trouble over gambling debts entering the orbit of the complaints as a result not everyone was good at reading cards and roulette wheels a curving staircase each step artfully illuminated led to the mezzanine level fox followed breck up there was another bar here and the casinos restaurant off to one side the restaurant itself was just half a dozen booths and three or four extra tables doing no business at all tonight all the stools at the bar were taken and other drinkers were watching the action beneath from the relative safety of the balcony what can i get you breck asked tomato juice fox said breck nodded and squeezed between two of the bar stools the barman was pouring a cocktail into an oldfashioned champagne glass fox joined the other drinkers and peered down towards the floor below the added attraction seemed to be that you could occasionally catch a glimpse down the front of a womans dress but the tables had been angled and lit so that it was impossible to make out the contents of any hand of cards the man nearest fox nodded a halfgreeting he looked to be in his early sixties his face deeply lined eyes rheumy table threes the lucky one tonight he offered in an undertone fox puckered his mouth as if considering this thanks he said he had three twentypound notes in his pocket and knew he would have to offer to break one of them to buy breck back a drink hopefully breck wouldnt accept and theyd go home instead fox certainly had no intention of handing any of the cash to the tables even lucky number three virgin mary breck said handing him his drink fox thanked him and took a sip it was spiced to the hilt worcestershire sauce tabasco black pepper fox felt his lips go numb reckoned thats how youd like it cheers breck was holding a chunky glass filled with ice and a dark concoction rum and coke fox guessed receiving a nod of confirmation used to be my dads drink breck said used to be hes like you off the booze being a doctor hes seen more than his fair share of damaged livers the man next to them had been listening in what doesnt kill you he said offering it up as a toast the iced remains rattling in his whisky glass as he tipped it to his mouth gentleman here fox informed breck thinks table threes the good one that right breck peered over the balcony table three was hosting blackjack and breck turned back towards fox what do you think im enjoying my drink fox replied taking another fiery sip but dont let me stop you it was after fox bought them their second and final round that breck decided he might have a flutter over the course of the next fifteen minutes he lost the best part of thirty quid while fox watched from the wings ouch was all breck said as he ended the experiment ouch indeed fox agreed they retreated to a spot near the machines why did we come here jamie fox asked breck studied his surroundings not exactly sure he appeared to admit then spotting that foxs glass was empty one for the road but fox shook his head home was all he said on the drive back breck started talking about chance and how he didnt really believe in it i think we decide how things are going to be and we make those things happen you reckon you dont agree fox shrugged far as im concerned stuff just happens and goes on happening and theres not a lot we can do about it breck studied him have you heard of a band called elbow theyve got a song about how when were drunk or just happy we can start to believe that weve created the whole world around us but thats an illusion not necessarily malcolm i think we shape each and every moment we choose the way our lives are going to go thats why i get such a buzz from games games online games rpgs theres one called quidnunc that i play a lot ive got an avatar who roams the galaxy having adventures how old are you breck just laughed i dont believe we have any control over the world fox went on my dads in a care home he has almost no control over his daily life people just come and do things around him making decisions for him same as politicians and even our bosses do for us theyre the ones who run our lives adverts tell us what to buy government tells us how to live technology tells us when weve done something wrong in demonstration fox undid his seat belt a warning light came on accompanied by the pingpingping of an alarm he slotted the buckle home again and glanced in brecks direction ever managed to use a computer without it asking if you need help breck was smiling broadly free will versus determinism he stated ill take your word for it im betting you dont have a facebook page or anything like that christ no friends reunited fox shook his head its getting hard enough to hold on to any sort of private life my girlfriend likes to twitter know what that is ive heard of it and it sounds like hell youre one of lifes spectators malcolm and thats the way i like it fox paused you didnt ask the staff about vince faulkner another time breck said with a shrug fox knew he had a decision to make ideally he would drop breck on the main road and let him walk the final few hundred yards home that way the three residents of the surveillance van wouldnt spot him but if he failed to take breck all the way home would breck himself become suspicious of his motives and once his suspicions had been aroused might he spot the van in the end it was breck who made the decision theyd just turned on to oxgangs road when he asked if fox could pull over and let him out you dont want me to drop you nearer home breck shook his head fox was already signalling to stop at the kerb i want to finish that walk i was taking breck explained when fox pulled on the handbrake he saw that breck had his hand outstretched for him to shake thanks breck said no jamie thank you breck smiled and opened the door but once outside he stuck his head back into the car again this stays strictly between us right wouldnt do either of us any good otherwise fox nodded slowly and watched as breck drew himself upright but then the head dipped back into the car again one thing you need to know the younger man said were not all like glen heaton or bad billy giles come to that plenty of us at torphichen were cheering when you nailed him so thanks for that malcolm the passenger door was pushed closed a hand slapped twice against the car roof fox signalled back out into the road and released the handbrake he drove home with his thoughts swirling and eddying refusing to coalesce thursday february fox had been in the office three hours when tony kaye arrived looking bleary well kaye said thats a chunk of my life im not getting back what happened fox paused in his typing he was making a record of a meeting hed just had with two lawyers from the procurator fiscals office theyd warned him that the case against glen heaton would take no little time to prepare the pair had been young one male one female they could almost have been brother and sister the way they dressed moved and spoke it was as if theyd spent their whole life together to the point where fox had asked if they were an item an item the female lawyer hadnt seemed to understand the term were not her colleague had stated blood colouring his neck what happened tony kaye was saying now mimicking foxs question as he sloughed off his overcoat nothing happened malcolm the sod didnt get home until midnight hed left a light on upstairs so we didnt know then when he finally arrives he logs on to the computer straight off thats when we think weve got him know what he does kaye had hung up his coat and placed his leather satchel on the floor next to his desk what he starts looking at some online rpg know what that is a roleplaying game kaye gave him a look surprised by his colleagues breadth of knowledge joe naysmith had to tell me kaye admitted playing his game takes him over an hour after which he catches up on emails really exciting stuff like one to his brother in the us and another to his niece and nephew i thought the brother was gay kaye looked at him again what makes you say that he told me fox thought to himself but he didnt want kaye to know how intimate some of his chats with breck had become so he shifted in his chair and explained that the info had been in brecks personnel file now thats what i call full disclosure the guy from the chop shop says maybe hes grooming them but thats just paranoia talking kaye paused and thats something else you and me will be having words about old friend kaye nodded in foxs direction to reinforce the point no sign of ds inglis shes got a son to tuck in so she swaps with the worlds most boring man and surprise surprise he gets on like a house on fire with naysmith take a guess why they like computer games they love computer games and gadgets new technology blah blah blah ten minutes in and theyre showing one another their mobiles another ten after that its modems and streaming and god knows what i had four hours of it kaye gave a sigh and stared in the direction of the lifeless coffee machine dont tell me naysmiths still in bed fox blew his nose havent seen him he admitted and mcewans still at his conference kaye added maybe ill just tuck a duvet around myself at my desk be my guest breck went to bed around two we waited to see if hed maybe taken his laptop with him but there was nothing so we left it at that does the chop shop want another try kaye shrugged wouldnt surprise me if only so gilchrist and naysmith can compare freeview boxes kaye sighed again he wasnt yet seated in fact had taken a couple of steps in the direction of foxs desk and was looking at him what fox prompted one other thing compadre he googled your name foxs eyebrows dipped he did what kaye shrugged by way of reply and that took him to some media websites he wasnt long so we reckon he was printing stuff off rather than reading it online he wont have found much except that he googled complaints and conduct too pretty much everything weve done in the media eye this past couple of years kaye paused including heaton of course why would he be doing that kaye shrugged again maybe he just likes you fox was considering telling his colleague about brecks unannounced visit to his home and their little jaunt to the oliver but kaye was speaking again on the other hand the guy who beat up your sister has just found himself deceased billy giles is on the hunt for suspects using breck as his bloodhound fox was thoughtful for a moment i got the feeling there wasnt much love between those two could be a front breck wanting you to think that fox nodded slowly have you seen him recently kaye asked who breck fox reached into his pocket for his handkerchief and started blowing his nose again playing for time the door swung open and joe naysmith walked in he was carrying his notebook in one hand and a newspaper in the other says here he began laying the paper on foxs desk that detectives are making progress the story was prominent on page three of the scotsman not so surprising edinburgh wasnt exactly a murder capital maybe one a month on average usually cleared up quickly when they did occur the local media were keen to react usually at length there was a large photo of the scene of crime with a grainy inset of a smiling vince faulkner and a smaller shot of billy giles looking no less fierce than in the flesh eyes like lasers naysmith commented where did the paper come from kaye was asking thought you were a guardian reader helen said she was finished with it helen in hr the desk nearest the door kaye rolled his eyes we just about merit the time of day and hes on firstname terms with them he wagged a finger at naysmith next youll be telling me mrs stephens shines your shoes while youve got your feet under her desk shes all right naysmith mumbled making for the coffee machine they all are three sugars kaye called out he knows that by now fox stated never makes it sweet enough kaye turned his attention to fox what does it say not much marooned gets a mention theyre asking for people to come forward if they saw the victim elsewhere that weekend memories are short kaye commented whats marooned a pub in gorgie vince got into an argument with some taffs fox scanned the story again they dont say anything about the bus stop he was talking to himself but loud enough for kaye to overhear what bus stop after the rugby fans vince headed for dalry road looks like he was going to catch a bus but he ended up in a shouting match with some kids kayes eyes narrowed he took a taxi instead fox finished and how have you come by this information inspector fox fox licked his lips i have my sources sergeant kaye breck fox couldnt deny it so kept quiet instead kaye rolled his eyes once more what have we just been talking about hes dangling worms in front of you so you cant see giles hiding behind him with the hook nicely put naysmith called out shut up joe kaye spat back he was pressing the palms of his hands against foxs desk leaning down over it tell me you get that tell me you can see right through him sure fox stated not really sure of very much any more he bit down on the pen he was holding felt the plastic casing crack there was a health club just in front of the asda on chesser avenue fox knew this because hed had a trial membership when it first opened hed never been inside the supermarket though and was surprised by its size he selected a hand basket and added a couple of items then headed for the checkout the woman in front of him in the queue pointed out that there was another checkout nearby where he wouldnt have to wait to be served she was emptying the extensive load from her trolley while her young son sucked a lollipop he was seated inside the trolley swinging his legs in repeated attempts to connect with foxs basket im not in a hurry fox told the woman she looked at him strangely then got on with the task of filling the conveyor belt transaction complete she paid not with a credit card but with handfuls of notes from her purse the checkout assistant counted these into the till and handed the woman a receipt like a length of ticker tape she then smiled towards fox and asked him how he was not too bad sandra he replied sandra hendry had already finished running his items through the scanner at mention of her name she looked him in the face for the first time its you she stated then cooking indian tonight fox considered the items hed bought basmati rice madras sauce yes he said hows jude there was no one behind fox so sandra reached under her till and for want of any other job started wiping down the conveyor belt with the cloth stored there shes okay fox said im looking in on her later shell appreciate that fox paused you know you said you sometimes went to the oliver i was just wondering if you and your husband were there on saturday saturday she considered this saturday i was at my sisters bunch of us had a night on the town but not at the oliver sandra hendry shook her head too far from the centre for maggie george streets what she likes was your husband with you ronnie on a girlie night she gave a snort joking arent you so he was at home then having finished wiping she fixed him with a stare whats this all about fox had his answer prepared we think vince may have gone to the oliver just wondering if he was on his own she considered this and nodded slowly accepting the explanation as being reasonable did he know anyone else who frequented the casino fox asked no idea the tone she used he knew he was losing her too many questions in her eyes hed stopped being judes brother and turned back into a cop times you went there with him he didnt bump into people he knew she shrugged straightening up as a new customer approached and started emptying his trolley the man was unkempt and unshaven eyes bloodshot he was buying enough booze to kickstart hogmanay sandra hendry wrinkled her nose as she made eye contact with fox her meaning was clear one of her regulars but by no means a favourite is ronnie at work just now fox asked her quickly unless theyve laid him off nobodys safe these days fox nodded his agreement picked up his shopping and thanked her for everything when fox had driven into the asda car park a black vauxhall astra had been thirty yards behind him now driving away he caught the same car in his rearview mirror it wasnt close enough for him to make out the licence plate he kept to a crawl of ten miles an hour as he headed towards the main road but the astra never came any closer his phone rang and he answered it where are you tony kaye asked keeping busy fox replied want to hear some news good or bad vince faulkner did indeed take a cab driver remembers interrupting the rammy and his cab taking a dunt in the process how did you find out youre not the only one with sources and there arent that many cab outfits in edinburgh giless boys got hold of the info about an hour before i did does the cabbie remember where he dropped vince the casino near ocean terminal driver got out to inspect the damage he saw vince go into the oliver you sound like you already know all this i had an inkling but the confirmation is greatly appreciated fox said his goodbyes and ended the call rewarding himself with a little smile he didnt know why hed come up with the oliver as vinces probable destination but hed been proved right hed never been the type to rely on gut instinct at every step he worked from the evidence presented he liked to think this was one reason the complaints had maintained their nearperfect record but maybe instinct had its place as he neared the city centre he lost sight of the astra could be it had turned off the area around haymarket was as bad as ever a sandwich board outside a newsagents informed him that the days evening news was leading with a dispute between the local council and the german company behind the construction of the tram system the germans wanted more money because of sterlings weakened exchange rate the best of british luck to you fox muttered awaiting his turn through the contraflow he was wondering if he should have taken another route cut straight across the south of the city maybe but then there were delays there too it really did feel as if the whole city with the blessing of those empowered to manage and nurture it was grinding to a halt for want of anything better to do he lifted his phone from the passenger seat and punched in the number for jamie brecks mobile listening to it ring he happened to glance in the rearview mirror again a familiarlooking black astra was three cars behind him hello jamie its malcolm fox morning malcolm thanks again for playing chauffeur last night no problem i was just wondering if there was any news taxi driver remembers vince faulkner dropped him outside the oliver so youll be talking to the staff somebody on the team will im a bit busy elsewhere just at the minute im interrupting you no but i cant talk for long was there anything else fox realised there probably wasnt all hed wanted to know was whether breck would share with him about the taxi and breck had passed that test besides traffic had eased and fox wasnt far from his destination the astra seemed to have taken a turning but now fox was wondering about the green ford ka it was a couple of cars back and how long had it been there nothing else fox said in answer to brecks question he ended the call and took a right turn at the next set of lights pulling over to the kerb and stopping he watched in his rearview as the ka went straight ahead at the junction instead of following him just because youre paranoid malcolm he muttered to himself not bothering to complete the sentence there were plenty of signposts showing potential buyers the way to salamander point a few blocks were already finished curtains and blinds in some of the windows plants sitting in pots on the corner balconies but it was a huge site and foundations were under way on a further four highrise constructions large billboards attached to the fence around the site showed an approximation of the finished city within the city by the sea there were capitalised buzzwords such as ease and quality and space drifting into the bluepainted sky below which the artist had depicted smiling people walking past a café outside which other shiny people sat at tables with their espressos and cappuccinos this was their lifestyle but the present reality was somewhat different the occupants of salamander point were living in the middle of a building site that resembled to foxs eye a world war one battlefield all mud and trenchdigging noise and diesel fumes a corner of the site had been turned into an encampment for the workforce ten or twelve portakabins were stacked at double height fronted by scaffolding and ladders men in highvisibility jackets and yellow hard hats scanned blueprints as they pointed with their fingers diggers were digging cranes lowering pipes and slabs of concrete into place the single extent of finished pavement led to the door of a temporary sales office behind the windows fox could see a young woman seated at her desk she had no customers to deal with and her phone didnt seem to require answering the glazed look on her face indicated to him that this had probably become her daily routine nobody was buying in a moment he would walk up the path and she would see him and there would be a momentary lifting of her spirits dashed when he introduced himself and asked to see the gaffer but first he locked his car leaving it by the kerb a truck rumbled past kicking up a mini dust storm fox held his hands over his eyes and mouth until everything had settled then headed up the path when his phone started ringing he answered it fox he stated anything you want to tell me malcolm it was brecks voice how do you mean jamie take a look to your left over by the portakabins with the phone still held to his ear fox turned his head knowing what he would see breck was standing on the scaffolding there was a hard hat on his head and another on the man standing next to him breck waved and spoke into his phone a split second later his words reached fox come on over then as he moved away fox caught sight of the saleswoman she had risen from her desk ready to greet him he offered a shrug and a sheepish smile and began picking his way across the treacherous terrain towards the site office at the top of the ladder breck introduced him to howard bailey this is mr baileys show breck explained stretching out an arm towards the expanse of the site then turning to bailey could you give me a minute with my colleague i should really fetch him a hard hat he wont be staying bailey nodded and headed for the door at the far end of the platform breck slid his hands into his pockets and stared at fox has that given you enough time to come up with a plausible story he asked you know why im here same reason you are not quite malcolm im here because im part of the inquiry team you on the other hand are here to stick your oar in i was just hoping for a quiet word with vinces friend ronnie thatll be ronnie hendry vinces foreman mr bailey was telling me the two of them were friends offsite as well as on youre going to speak to him breck nodded slowly and ask him the same questions you probably would after a moments pause breck gave a sigh and looked down at his muddied shoes what if it had been billy giles waiting here instead of me hed have had you on report not the sort of thing id imagine your boss would be thrilled with my sisters lost her partner im just after a word with that partners best friend could be i want to discuss the funeral arrangements ask ronnie to be a pallbearer you really think giles would fall for that fox shrugged im not really that worried about billy giles you should be and you know it fox turned and rested his hands against one of the scaffolding poles the warehouses across the street were going to be redeveloped too by the look of things their windows had been boarded up and a small tree was doing its best to grow from the edge of the mossy roof a car was driving past a black astra youre not having me tailed by any chance fox asked breck no could billy giles be doing it without you knowing i doubt weve got men to spare and why would he want you tailed a black vauxhall astra green ford ka breck shook his head odd thing though what after id walked home last night there was a van parked outside just after i got into bed i heard it leave so fox was still pretending to be taking in the view his grip on the pole had tightened breck had taken off his hard hat to rub a hand through his hair were all getting a bit twitchy he decided below them a man had come into sight he was dressed for work his spattered denims tucked into thick grey woollen socks and those socks emerging from steeltoed boots he wore his hard hat cocked high on his head and under his highvisibility jacket was a denim one not unlike brecks from the previous night fox knew it had to be ronnie hendry he turned to face breck let me sit in he said breck stared back at him hendry had reached the foot of the ladder and was starting to climb please fox said you dont say anything breck warned him not one word has he met you before fox shook his head youve said it yourself breck went on hell see you at the funeral if not before hell know then that hes seen you somewhere he rubbed a finger down his nose obviously in a quandary then as hendrys head appeared through the gap in the flooring he uttered the one word fox wanted to hear okay fox stood back as breck introduced himself to ronnie hendry and shook the mans hand hendry had been wearing leather workmens gloves but stuffed them into his pocket mr baileys letting us use this office here breck told hendry opening the door nearest them my colleagues going to sit in breck was leading them inside giving hendry no time to study malcolm fox it was a utilitarian space just a desk with a plan lying on it weighted down at all four corners with chunks of masonry there were three folding chairs a freestanding electric heater and not much else hendry held his hands to the heater and rubbed some warmth back into them not much of a job in this weather breck sympathised hendry gave a nod of agreement and removed his hard hat his first name had been feltpenned across the back of it and from what fox could see of the gloves theyd been nametagged too it was a building site after all things would tend to go for a walk hendrys hair was shortcropped and beginning to silver at the temples he would be in his late thirties fox guessed he was short and wiry a physique not unlike vince faulkners the face was lined and pitted hendrys eyebrows black and bushy he had now seated himself opposite breck at the table fox opting to stay standing at the far end of the room arms folded making himself as inconspicuous as possible i wanted to ask you about vince faulkner breck told hendry hellish thing the voice was gruffly local the two of you were friends thats right you didnt see him last saturday hendry shook his head got a text from him in the afternoon oh just a comment about the football halftimes you didnt speak to him no did you hear from him after that hendry shook his head again next thing i knew i was hearing he was dead mustve come as a shock too true pal hendry shifted in his chair the two of you worked together sometimes depends which gang you end up in vince was a solid worker so id always pitch for him did he specialise in anything he could lay bricks mix the cement hed trained as a brickie but he would turn his hand to pretty well anything you asked he was english breck stated casually was that ever a problem how do you mean did the guys ever give him stick if they had hedve given them pelters he was a bit hotheaded then im just saying he stood up for himself did you know he sometimes hit his partner jude hendry thought for a moment before answering sandra tells me shes got a broken arm and that doesnt exactly surprise you the pair of them liked a good rammy oftentimes it was jude who started it shed just keep having a go at him until he started to snap ive known women like that breck was nodding his apparent agreement they seem to get a buzz out of it fox shifted his weight a little and bit down on his bottom lip hes only doing his job he told himself getting the man to open up so you can imagine him getting into a fight on saturday night breck was asking i suppose so when he didnt turn up for work monday morning what did you think another shrug i was up to my eyes didnt really have time to think tried phoning him he paused or did i i know i texted him for definite breck nodded we checked his phone the text was there but no one had read it we took a look at all the messages he had stored there were a fair few to and from you oh aye and mention of the oliver its a casino just around the corner from here actually we sometimes took the wives there he liked gambling he didnt like losing hendry said with a thin smile we think maybe he went there saturday night would that have been like him going there without you if hed had an argybargy with jude gone out drinking yeah maybe what about you mr hendry what did you get up to on saturday hendry puffed out his cheeks and expelled a ball of air long liein the morning as per shopping at the gyle with sandra also as per football results and an evening kickoff on sky i fetched an indian he paused again remembering something hang on thats right sandra was out with her sister and some mates i ate enough curry for two and fell asleep in front of the telly and sunday not much different so theres no weekend overtime going on phase one there was but nobodys buying now were in phase two id say were a fortnight away from layoffs another fortnight after that the whole site could be mothballed not so nice for the people whore already living here we reckon if they tried selling up theyd get half to two thirds what they paid originally so there are bargains to be had if youre interested make helena in sales an offer shell probably throw in a lapdance ill bear that in mind breck managed a smile tell you whats really worrying the bosses though hendry went on they cant see an end in sight this whole development council sold the land for almost six million lucky if it would fetch a third of that ouch breck sympathised well thats one way of putting it the guys reckon the only reason well finish the next highrise is so the developer can top himself by jumping from it whats the developers name breck asked charlie brogan you going to put him on suicide watch reckon we should this got a bark of laughter from ronnie hendry not before his bills are paid he said breck offered another smile and decided on a change of direction did you know that vince faulkner has a criminal record plenty of guys in the building trade could say the same so you knew he never made it a secret it was there on his job application his partner doesnt seem to have known jude hendry gave a shrug and folded his arms thats between the two of them did he ask you not to mention it in front of her what does it matter if he did ancient historys what it was it was brecks turn to shrug okay so lets say hes had a fight with his partner her arm gets broken and she heads to a and e vince opts not to go with her and heads out on the lash instead ends up at the oliver and loses some money what do you think he would do next mr hendry no idea hendrys arms were still folded he was definitely on the defensive fox decided an interruption was in order his partner says he sometimes stayed out all night slept at friends houses yeah that happened once or twice so it could have happened that night breck asked not at mine hendry stated with a shake of the head where then you tell me you lot are supposed to be the ones with the brains jamie brecks car was parked on the site just next to the portakabins it was a red mazda rx lowslung and sporty breck leaned his elbows against its roof as he watched ronnie hendry go back to work anything i forgot to ask fox shook his head i dont think so what did you make of him i can see why faulkner liked him hes the sort whod back you up in a fight but at the same time hes probably canny enough to calm things down so the fight never quite happens he didnt seem exactly numb with shock did he isnt that the scottish way bottling it up for later breck guessed then he nodded slowly in agreement sorry for butting in like that it was a fair point though i didnt know he was prone to sleeping around jude never mentioned other women fox stipulated by the way have you done anything about judes mystery visitor its now a matter of record breck confirmed so where next fox asked the oliver breck looked at him and youll be wanting to tag along i presume might as well fox said last one theres a scabby dog but in fact by the time hed unlocked his volvo and executed a threepoint turn the mazda was a hundred yards ahead as he pulled into the casino car park breck was standing by the door of the building trying to look as if hed been there for hours hiya scabby breck said in greeting any suspiciouslooking astras to report no fox admitted then he pulled open the door after you he said although the casino was open for business no actual business was taking place there was nobody on duty at the cloakroom and only one croupier stationed at a blackjack table practising her skills in front of three empty stools a couple of tiny foreignlooking women in tabards were polishing the brass fittings and rails the downstairs barman looked to be doing a stock check ticking off items on a clipboard upstairs fox could hear a vacuum cleaner at work boss around breck asked the young croupier she had blonde hair tied back in a ponytail and was dressed in regulation black waistcoat with a white blouse and skyblue bowtie youll need to talk to simon she gestured towards the barman thanks breck said he started walking in that direction pulling his warrant card from his pocket need a word with you simon oh aye the barman hadnt bothered looking up from the task in hand but fox knew hed noticed the warrant card and recognised it for what it was you in charge here breck was asking boss is due back in quarter of an hour would you mind looking me in the eye when you speak breck was managing to sound polite yet there was steel just below the surface simon took a few moments before complying thank you breck said okay if i put my id away now youre satisfied youre talking to a detective and not some neighbourhood divvy the barman gave a halfsmirk but breck had his attention fox noticed that his colleague had roughened his natural voice and was bringing in more glottal stops if its anything to do with licences or that simon was saying its the boss you need to speak to but the boss isnt here so its your job to answer a few questions breck had put his warrant card away but was now producing a photograph from the same pocket it was a snap of vince faulkner fox reckoned it had been lifted from judes house this guys a regular breck was saying so im assuming you know him the barman looked at the photo and shrugged actually breck went on i shouldve stipulated that he was a regular poor sod got himself killed at the weekend after visiting this place which night saturday the barman didnt say anything for a moment breck decided to speak for him youre trying to work out the odds arent you do you lie or tell the truth which is going to work out best and that means just one thing simon you were here saturday night it was busy the barman admitted with another shrug but he was in here breck waved the photo to and fro and it was out of character because whenever youd seen him in the past hed always been with people so fox had been scanning the corners of the ceiling well need to see the recordings he commented from your security cameras breck stiffened a little hed had a flow going and fox had broken it my colleagues right he stated eventually talk to the boss we will breck confirmed but you do remember vince faulkner i never knew his name you saw in the papers that he was dead suppose so the admission was grudging at best simon was running a finger down the clipboard as though hoping they would take the hint and leave him to his task fat chance fox thought to himself you saw him in here saturday night cant remember he got here around ten place was heaving by then but mr faulkner was on his own and im betting that meant hed be sitting on one of these stools breck slapped the seat of the bar stool next to him theres another bar upstairs but all the same breck decided to let the silence linger he was half cut when he got here simon finally admitted doormen should never have let him in did he cause trouble the barman shook his head but he had the look of a loser and thats not good for the ambience breck nodded his understanding just sat slumped at the corner of the bar how many drinks did he have no idea what was he drinking shorts thats all i remember we had three staff working the bar that night did he meet anyone talk to them dunno the fingers were now drilling against the clipboard tapping out the sound of horses hooves at full gallop did you see him leave simon shook his head what about sunday or monday another shake of the head i was off both nights breck glanced at his watch your boss is running late bosses get to do that breck smiled and turned his head towards fox for the first time simon likes to think hes smart but every trace of humour had left brecks face by the time he turned back to the barman so do the smart thing simon get thinking of anything else you can tell us about saturday night or about vince faulkner in general where the snapshot had been there was now a business card take it breck commanded the barman did as he was told how old are you simon twentythree been in the trade long started bar work when i was at uni what did you study i didnt study much of anything that was the problem breck nodded his understanding ever see any trouble around here no not even once the punters get outside a good evening gone sour by the time ive closed the bar cleaned up and done a tally people are long gone do the management stand you to a cab home breck watched as the barman nodded well thats something at least then turning to leave jot a few thoughts down and give me a call plus pass the number on to your boss if i havent heard back by end of play today ill be round tonight with some squad cars and uniforms got that simon was studying the writing on the card yes mr breck he said it was strange to step out of the gloom the casino boasted no natural light at all and find that it was still daytime in edinburgh the sky overcast but boasting enough glare to have jamie breck slipping on a pair of raybans hed taken up the same position as after the meeting with ronnie hendry elbows resting against the roof of his mazda fox squeezed the bridge of his nose and squinted into the light it had been quite a performance breck was a natural just the right mix of authority and empathy too bullish and the barman would have blustered or clammed up i like you fox thought even though youve been checking up on me behind my back even though you may not be what you seem you really got into character there fox complimented him i liked what you did with your voice thats the thing about rpgs and avatars you get to pretend to be someone youre not handy training for cid and for other things fox thought to himself so what now nothing much ill head back to base write up what ive got might leave out a few salient details breck glanced in foxs direction sorry i butted in again fox apologised broke my promise id have got round to the cameras in my own time malcolm i know you would both men turned at the sound of a car approaching it was a baby bentley the gt glossy black bodywork and tinted windows the engine stopped and the driversside door opened fox caught a glimpse of burgundy leather upholstery the woman who stepped out was wearing high heels black tights and a black kneelength skirt the skirt clung to her white silk blouse open at the neck to show a pendant of some kind creamcoloured jacket with a little padding at the shoulders her hair was auburn thick and flowing she had to push some back from her face as a gust of wind caught her red lipstick and when she removed her oversized sunglasses dark eyeshadow and a hint of mascara she gave them an inquisitive look as she headed towards the door of the casino simon will tell you all about it breck called to her she ignored this and headed inside fox turned to breck shouldnt we talk to her shes going to call me remember but shes management right later dont you want to know who she is breck smiled i know who she is malcolm he pointed at a spot just above the casinos main door there was a plaque sited there announcing that the premises were licensed for the sale of alcohol the name of the licensee was j broughton whos j broughton fox asked breck opened the door of the mazda and started to get in stick to watching the detectives malcolm let us other cops do the real work does it mean anything to you fox was back in the complaints office standing in front of tony kayes desk kaye mouthed the name a few times as usual he had pitched his chair back and now swung slowly backwards and forwards wasnt there a villain called that he said at last well by villain obviously i mean an upstanding local businessman whose tangled web of dodgy dealings lothian and borders police could never unravel kaye paused but hed be in his seventies now havent heard his name in years will he be in the system somewhere fox nodded in the direction of kayes computer hard drive i can check just as soon as you give me the reason vince was at the oliver on saturday night licence is in the name of j broughton jack broughton that was your man kaye stared at his colleague but vince isnt really your territory foxy shouldnt you be busying yourself liaising with the fiscals office about glen heaton or readying a report on jamie breck to send to the chop shop just do it will you fox turned and walked over to the coffee machine brecks words were still niggling at him us other cops the real work he knew that a lot of cid felt that way the complaints was for the cold fish the oddities the cops who could never make it as bona fide detectives it was for voyeurs with chips on their shoulders joe naysmith was opening a fresh consignment of coffee and fox watched him at work naysmith didnt fit the description nor did tony kaye come to that i love that smell naysmith commented holding the bag to his nose tell me something joe why the complaints naysmith raised an eyebrow youve had six months to ask me that im asking now naysmith considered for a moment it suits me he eventually offered isnt that why were all here christ knows fox muttered pinching the bridge of his nose then he asked if naysmith was planning another evening in the van dc gilchrist thinks we should well i dont fox stated far as i can see youd be wasting your time so why dont you trot along the hall and tell him so im making the coffee fox snatched the bag from him not any more now hop it he gave a jerk of the head as added incentive and watched naysmith leave the room he poured the coffee into the filter slid it home and filled the water reservoir before placing the emptied glass jug on its hotplate i like it better when joe makes it kaye chided him hed risen from his chair and walked over to the rooms shared printer it was in the process of churning out a final sheet of paper youll see a note at the bottom he explained says theres a bit more in the dfw dfw the dead files warehouse every now and again the police stations in and around the city had a clearout files were dusted off their existence recorded for posterity and they were then sentenced to life imprisonment on a shelf in a vast warehouse on dumbryden industrial estate fox had had reason to visit the facility at times in the past by rights everything in the archives should have been transferred to digital format the process had been greenlighted by a previous chief constable but funding had become an issue when kaye handed fox the three a sheets the first thing fox did was study the foot of the final page there were several references to the dfw the references were dated the computer printout listed further brushes with the law in and one was for aiding and abetting a fugitive it never made it to trial the other was for receiving stolen goods again charges dropped jack broughtons year of birth was given as making him seventyone going on seventytwo over twenty years since he was in any trouble fox commented and now hes the same age as my dad kaye was reading the report over foxs shoulder i remember one of the older cops telling me about him when i was a probationary guy definitely had a reputation in those days at the casino there was a woman in her thirties i think shes frontofhouse youve been there fox glowered at him dont ask he started reading the next page jack broughton had two sons and a daughter but both sons had predeceased their father one dying in a car crash the other in a bar brawl gone wrong i wonder if its the daughter the licensing board will know kaye informed him want me to get on to them you know someone there might do kaye started to retreat to his desk bring me over a mug when its brewed will you three sugars fox asked with just a hint of sarcasm heaped tony kaye confirmed but joe naysmith was back before the machine had finished its business he seemed concerned that something terrible might have happened to the percolator in his absence how did it go with gilchrist fox asked him ds inglis wants a word with you naysmith was avoiding eye contact why what have i done she just said she wants a word better run along and see her foxy kaye said his hand pressed over the telephone receiver maybe a quick skoosh of lynx beforehand but when fox looked annie inglis was standing in the doorway arms folded she gave a twitch of the head signalling for him to meet her in the hall fox handed naysmith the empty mug hed been holding then he made his exit closing the door after him why she asked without preamble why what why pull the surveillance on breck it didnt get us anywhere last night her eyes narrowed youve had meetings with him havent you you having me followed ds inglis just answer the question answer mine first no im not having you followed hes investigating a murder pretty close to home unless youd forgotten im keeping tabs on it so yes ive talked to him from what i hear he puts up a good front conscientious likeable generous so they all do malcolm its how they win the trust of children and sometimes even the kids parents its why we dont catch them nearly often enough theyre good at this theyre good at acting as if theyre just like you and me hes not like me fox stated is that whats getting to you nothings getting to me there was irritation in his voice inglis looked down towards the floor and gave a sigh he spent an hour last night on an online roleplaying game called quidnunc he has an avatar you know what that is yes its someone he creates so he can hide his true self it lets him become someone else him and a few million other players she looked up at fox he told you about it yes inglis was thoughtful for a moment she pushed the hair back from her forehead taking her time is there any possibility he knows were on to him fox thought back to what breck had told him the van outside his home driving away soon after hed gone to bed i dont think so he said because if he does hell start getting rid of the evidence i dont think he does fox repeated she considered this for a few moments more it fits with offender profiling she said at last her voice softening these men theyll join online communities pretend to be fourteen or fifteen ask others in the group to send them photos i get it fox told her theyre good at roleplaying they hone their skills by playing online games sometimes they even get to meet other players along the way you want gilchrist and naysmith to go out again tonight theyre keen fox nodded slowly can they park further away same spot two nights running and theres more likelihood of them standing out inglis nodded back at him and reached out to touch his arm thank you she said turning to go but then she paused your sisters boyfriend is there any news fox shook his head and watched her retreat then he took out his phone and called jude guilty that he hadnt done so earlier but there was no answer so he left a message and went back into the office youre out in the wagon again tonight he told naysmith tell me im not needed kaye pleaded he had just put down his receiver and was holding a slip of paper that for me fox asked the very name you wanted kaye waved the slip all right fox told him youre exempt from holding joes hand tonight youve got gilchrist for that havent you joe kaye teased folding the piece of paper into a glider and sending it flying towards foxs desk it landed on the floor and fox stooped to retrieve it a name was printed there the j in j broughton didnt stand for jack it was joanna the daughter fox thought back to the woman whod pulled up outside the oliver pulled up in her bentley and sauntered inside she hadnt stopped to ask them what they were doing in her car park because shed had a bit of training at her fathers knee she could smell a cop a mile off joanna broughton fox called jamie breck on his mobile the j is for joanna right he asked without introduction there was a smile in brecks voice as he answered fast work and im assuming you know who she is jack broughtons daughter breck pretended to guess so is she fronting the place for him or what youre assuming the woman we saw earlier today is ms broughton im not assuming anything fox corrected him but i think you know it was what is it about the oliver and her something youre holding back on me jamie im working on a murder inquiry malcolm there may be times when i cant open my heart to you is this one of them maybe ill tell you later for now i need to get back to work breck ended the call and fox placed his mobile phone on his desk and settled himself in his chair his braces were cutting into his shoulders and he adjusted both straps ingliss words were bouncing around his head conscientious likeable generous is that whats getting to you when his mobile rang he picked it up and studied the number on the screen jude hey sis thanks for getting back to me there was silence on the line but for a muffled sound very like someone sobbing jude he prompted malcolm her voice cracked halfway through his name whats going on theyre digging in the garden what the police your lot theyre she gulped down another sob im on my way fox told her ending the call he shrugged his arms back into his jacket kaye asked him what was happening got to go was all fox said out in the car park the interior of his car still retained a trace of warmth some of judes neighbours were at their windows again three patrol cars two white vans judes front door was open there was no sign of any disruption in the front garden the back could be accessed only from a door in the kitchen it wasnt much of a garden either maybe sixty feet by twenty most of it paving slabs and weeds there was a uniformed officer on duty at the front door but fox was waved inside when he showed his warrant card the interior of the house was ice cold both front and rear doors open defeating anything the radiators could do who let you in dci billy giles roared he was standing in the kitchen holding a mug of tea in one hand and a halfeaten mars bar in the other wheres my sister nextdoor neighbours giles stated chewing on the snack fox had advanced far enough into the room to be able to see out of the rear window there was a team hard at work with shovels and pickaxes they were digging in some spots lifting the paving slabs in others muck had been trailed into the house so recently cleaned by alison pettifer someone from forensics was running a handheld scanner down the walls in the living room seeking any microscopic bloodstains you still here giles growled tossing the empty chocolate wrapper on to the floor what are you playing at giles im not playing at anything im being a cop he glowered at fox something your lot dont seem to like im beginning to think its jealousy i cant decide what this smacks of more intimidation or desperation we got a call from a concerned neighbour giles said his voice was coarse his breathing ragged as he bore down on fox heard digging in the garden sunday night horticulture at midnight is that something your family makes a habit of did this neighbour give a name giles didnt say anything to that and fox barked out a laugh are you really going to lend an ear to every nutter who phones you did you bother trying to track them down fox paused im assuming you noted their number pub in corstorphine giles stated then snapping his head round as one of his team walked in from the garden anything a few bones been there for years phil says a pet cat or maybe a puppy what is it you think youre going to find fox asked into the silence you know damned well this isnt about cats or puppies its about the wild goose youve been sent to chase giles pointed a stubby finger at him this mans contaminating my crime scene and i want him out of here a hand grabbed foxs arm from behind he made to shrug it off but turned and saw that it was jamie breck come on you breck said sternly leading fox towards the front door outside on the path both men kept their voices low this is horseshit fox hissed maybe so but were dutybound to follow any and all leads you know that malcolm giles is trying to get at me and mine jamie thats what this boils down to youve got to tighten his leash brecks eyebrows went up me who else is going to stand up to him you looked to be doing a pretty good job there was a tapping sound fingers against the window of the house next door youre wanted was all breck said fox turned to look saw alison pettifer gesturing for him to join her fox held up his hand signalling that he was on his way but then turned back to face jamie breck tighten his leash he repeated making for the door of the neighbouring house hed stayed for the best part of an hour downing two mugs of tea while both women sat on the sofa pettifer occasionally taking judes hand and patting or stroking it hed asked the neighbour if he could unlock her back door take a look over the fence as another flagstone was lifted giles had glowered at him but there was nothing he could do cant you stop them jude had asked her brother more than once surely you can make it stop im not sure i can hed answered defensively knowing how weak it made him sound he could have added that it was precisely his fault it was happening giles couldnt get to him so he was getting at his loved ones instead fox knew he could make a complaint to mcewan but he knew too that the complaint would make him look foolish it was simplicity itself for giles to defend the charge theres been a murder we have to pursue every avenue i cant believe a fellow officer wouldnt appreciate that no he couldnt take it to mcewan hed considered telling jude to get a lawyer but he knew how that would look and all cops the complaints included had a deepseated mistrust of lawyers the truth was he couldnt take it anywhere and giles knew as much so instead fox had said goodbye pecking jude on the cheek and shaking pettifers hand then hed sat in his car for five minutes trying to decide whether to go back to fettes or not mind made up hed driven to the supermarket in oxgangs lugging the bags into his house and spending half an hour putting away the food checking the sellby dates of everything so he could arrange what needed eating when stuff for later to the back of the fridge and stuff for sooner to the front fresh pasta with pesto sauce for his evening meal at the supermarket hed found himself in the drinks section wondering about buying a couple of bottles of alcoholfree beer then had walked past the wines and spirits noting that some whiskies were actually cheaper than when hed last bought any of them the pricier bottles had little neckband alarms to deter shoplifters back at one of the chill cabinets hed picked up a litre carton of mango and pear juice better for you by far boy hed told himself after the meal he tried watching tv but there was nothing to grab his attention he kept swimming back through the days events when his phone bleeped with a message he sprang towards it tony kaye was inviting him to minters it took fox all of five seconds to make up his mind its almost as if we have nothing better to do with ourselves fox said as he made for the usual table there was a different barman on duty much younger but still glued to a quiz show on tv two clients standing at the bar fox recognised neither of them margaret sime kayes friend was at her own table she nodded a greeting on the way back into town fox had taken the slightest of detours past jamie brecks house no sign of life and no van parked in the vicinity cheers kaye said taking delivery of the fresh pint and placing it beside the one he was halfway to finishing fox placed his own tomato juice on a coaster and slipped out of his sports jacket he had left his tie at home but was still wearing the same shirt braces and trousers so what was happening at judes kaye asked bad billy had his men digging up the garden anonymous caller said they heard some activity on sunday night thats billys excuse anyway kaye sympathised with a shake of the head hope you didnt leave any prints at the locus foxy if he sees an opening hes going to come at you with teeth bared and claws out i know bastard put a lot of trust in glen heaton defended him to the hilt fox stared at his colleague you dont think giles knew what heaton was like kaye shrugged we cant know for sure one way or the other all im saying is i can appreciate the man is hurting if he goes on tormenting my sister hell really get to know that feeling kaye chuckled into his glass fox knew what he was thinking youve no ammo foxy no stomach for that kind of fight maybe maybe not he sipped at his own drink would it kill you to put a dash of vodka in there kaye chided him it makes me feel like the town drunk when im sitting with you you asked me to come i know i did im just saying the first one wouldnt kill me fox said after a moments thought but it would be a start somebody like me tony a starts all they need kaye wrinkled his nose youre not an alky malcolm ive seen alkies used to hose their cells down when i was a probationary drink doesnt like me tony besides he picked up the tomato juice again this gives me the moral high ground both men drank in silence a group of three new faces had arrived fox his back to the door watched kaye make a quick appraisal that was what you did when you were a cop you watched the door for trouble trouble was the guy youd once arrested the guy whose uncle or cousin you once gave evidence against the guy youd persuaded to turn informer one time so hed save his own skin city the size of edinburgh it was difficult sometimes to escape your own history things youd done people youd used but kaye was back to concentrating on his drink no reason to fret fox gave the men a quick glance anyway suits and ties businessmen at days end maybe with a curryhouse appointment later when the door opened again fox watched kaye saw an eyebrow rise and turned round to look it was joe naysmith he was dressed for a long cold night in the van lumberjack shirt beneath shetland sweater sweater beneath jerkin jerkin beneath duffel coat he was shedding these layers as he approached the table boiling in here he complained he unbuttoned the shirt to show a plain black tshirt had a tiff with the boyfriend kaye asked slyly naysmith ignored him and asked them what they were drinking usual for me kaye was quick to say while fox shook his head his eyes met the younger mans so what did happen he asked we were doing a final check on the van gilchrist gets a call and tells me we dont need to go out naysmith shrugged and started to head for the bar who was the call from fox persisted naysmith just shrugged again and went to fetch the drinks you think somethings happened kaye asked fox im not a soothsayer tony nice excuse to call ds inglis at home invite her out for a latenight powwow with beverages supplied shes got a kid then invite yourself round there take a bottle kaye broke off and rolled his eyes except you dont drink thats right so its soft drinks for you and a few hefty bacardis for the lady naysmith was coming back a pint in either hand id packed sandwiches and everything he went on complaining loaded some videos on to my phone to show him and he didnt say who the call was from or what was said fox watched naysmith shake his head you couldnt hear any of it not even what he was saying i was in the back of the van he was out front this was in the garage at fettes naysmith nodded and gulped down the first inch and a half of beer exhaling with satisfaction and wiping thumb and forefinger across his lips inglis seemed keen enough earlier fox stated maybe she came round to your point of view naysmith suggested maybe fox conceded so wheres gilchrist now he said he didnt fancy a drink the three men sat in silence and when the conversation resumed they were soon discussing other cases past and present moving on from there to mcewans current jolly itll be an hour of discussion over tea and biscuits then four hours on the golf course tony kaye proposed does mcewan even play golf fox asked rising to get the next round in he was debating whether to stay maybe hed get a pint apiece for kaye and naysmith then tell them he had to be leaving but as he waited to be served he glanced up at the tv the quiz show had finished and the local news was on a dapperlooking man was giving some sort of statement in what looked like his office reporters held microphones to his face then a still photograph appeared onscreen a man and woman standing on the deck of a yacht dressed to the nines and grinning for the camera arms around one another fox thought he recognised the woman turn that up he ordered the barman but by the time the remote control had been located the news had moved to another story fox gestured to be given the remote and used it to switch from tv to text running down the list of options until he found regional news he clicked on scotland and waited for the items to appear on the screen third story down he saw what he was looking for property tycoon missing at sea fox hit the button again and scrolled down the story charles brogan millionaire property developer took his boat out from its edinburgh mooring boat found deserted and drifting at the mouth of the firth of forth what is it kaye asked he was standing by foxs shoulder studying the tv screen the guy behind salamander point i heard his company was in trouble and now hes missing from his boat harakiri kaye guessed fox laid the remote on the bar and paid for the round without having been asked the barman had poured him another tomato juice they took the drinks to the table something on the news naysmith prompted nothing for you to worry your pretty little head about kaye replied tousling naysmiths hair hadnt you better get a trim before jack nicklaus gets back i had it cut last month fox was rising from his chair again i need to make a phone call he explained back in a tick he went outside and the cold hit him thought about retreating indoors for his jacket but resisted the urge another urge was taking precedence he punched jamie brecks number into his mobile wondered how long it would take you breck answered i just saw it on the news me too you didnt know looks like the wifes first call was to her pr guy thats who was giving the statement his names gordon lovatt as in lovatt meikle meldrum never heard of them big pr firm they do lobbying too youve done your research theyve strayed into my orbit on occasion brecks voice drifted off fox could hear a siren he lowered the phone from his ear to confirm that it was coming from the earpiece youre out somewhere he stated im headed to torphichen why no real reason is it because of joanna broughton did she ever get back to you about the cctv fox moved aside as two of the drinkers emerged from the bar to smoke a cigarette they coughed a few times and continued the conversation theyd been having which pub breck asked minters i was asking about joanna broughton how come i just saw her on tv shes married to charlie brogan didnt change her name but theyve been together three or four years has his body washed ashore yet its dark out if you hadnt noticed coastguard have called off the search until daybreak but youre still going into the station it was a statement rather than a question yes jamie breck answered will you let me know if you find out anything if its pertinent to the case i dont doubt ill be talking to you sometime tomorrow whether i like it or not meantime inspector take the rest of the evening off thanks ill do that or at least try breck said ending the call fox headed back indoors rubbing some heat back into himself good news is he told naysmith youd have been wasting your time anyway brecks not at home kaye guessed the office fox confirmed is that why gilchrist cried off naysmith asked could he have known doubtful fox answered after a moments thought friday february next morning he was in the office early but no one was at home in room fox went downstairs to the canteen and found annie inglis there slumped over a black coffee with a halfeaten scrambledegg roll pushed to one side you look rough he offered as he pulled out a chair and sat down opposite her duncan was all she said whats he done she rubbed her hands down her face nothing really hes just at that age rebelling against mum she offered a tired smile he stays out late later than i like he always comes home eventually but you wait up for him she nodded and if its a school night next mornings like trying to raise the dead is he running with the wrong crowd she managed another smile this time at his wording when youre a mother everyones the wrong crowd right i think they drink a little take drugs a little not skunk she shook her head duncan just seems a bit she sought the right description tipsy she eventually decided on occasion plus the school say hes falling behind not handing in homework hes got o grades next year standard grades they call them these days she tried shaking some life back into herself and picked up the coffee third one of these ive had want a fourth but having drained the cup she shook her head does he see his dad fox asked but she wasnt about to answer was there something you wanted inspector she asked instead yes but it can wait tell me might help get this brain of mine started you know the surveillance got pulled last night she looked at him no she said its just that you were so keen for it to go ahead i was wondering what had changed ive not seen gilchrist this morning they were getting the van ready gilchrist took a call and told my guy it wasnt happening ill ask him when i see him maybe something else came up maybe fox conceded ill ask him annie inglis repeated okay fox got back to his feet sure about that coffee we actually make better stuff upstairs fourstar leaded we can smell it every time we walk past feel free to drop in she thanked him malcolm what i was saying about duncan my lips are sealed fox assured her turning to leave in the complaints office mcewan was back did you bring us a souvenir fox asked him mcewan snorted then asked if things had been quiet in his absence as the grave fox stated moving towards the coffee machine but there was hardly any coffee left in the tin he considered heading downstairs again to the canteen but decided against it there were tea bags and he could boil some water no milk though he checked his watch naysmith could have no excuses this morning no surveillance to explain away a late start hed be here inside the quarterhour rbs headquarters has its own starbucks mcewan commented as though reading his mind were not the rbs fox replied thank christ for small mercies how was the conference boring are riots likely this summer couple of the pundits seem to think so rising unemployment unrest people fearful of the future tension needing to be broken somehow and plenty of extremists ready to make it happen an edinburgh riot would be something to see fox was back at his desk plenty of them in times past malcolm the mob was a thing to be feared fox was shaking his head not these days even when theyre protesting outside the rbs bosss house they use placards for the graffiti so as not to damage anything thats your edinburgh mob bob i hope to god youre right mcewan sneezed three times then picked up his phone on top of everything ive caught that cold of yours happy to share sir malcolm fox told him mines actually a little better he watched as joe naysmith walked into the room naysmith held up the plastic bag he was carrying coffee and milk fox offered him the thumbsup and received a gesture in return naysmiths palm held out as if for money it was friday accounts day as far as the coffee was concerned fox ignored naysmith and got down to the first of the days chores copies of testimony in the heaton case were beginning to arrive from the lawyers in the fiscals office queries and comments attached to most of the pages fox would pass some off to naysmith and some to kaye keeping the juiciest ones for himself half an hour later kaye sauntered in rolling his eyes as he saw mcewan was back what time do you call this mcewan complained sorry sir kaye replied reaching for the coffee naysmith had poured him then he drew a newspaper from his coat pocket and tossed it on to foxs desk page three he said no topless shots though it was the mornings scotsman the story took up the whole page there were photos of brogan his boat joanna broughton and her father jack none of the pictures looked particularly recent except for one of gordon lovatt at the press conference the story itself was long on background and short on substance brogans company owned swathes of commercial land and property in the city debt had become an issue brogan was a keen weekend sailor who kept his millionpound yacht moored at south queensferry his wife was owner of the successful oliver casino and his fatherinlaw a wealthy and retired local businessman known for his cavalier approach fox had a little smile to himself at that when he looked up kaye was watching him doesnt add much fox commented maybe because theres not much to add did you check the tv this morning fox nodded bodys still out there somewhere empty bottle of posh wine left on the deck plus a smattering of sleeping tablets as prescribed to the wife kaye paused angling his head towards the newspaper shes a looker though wonder what first attracted her to the potbellied balding tycoon says here they live in the penthouse of one of his developments top three storeys of a newbuild by inverleith park kaye confirmed it was in the papers at the time priciest flat in scotland but that was before the slump i doubt she needs to sell daddys on hand to bail her out begs the question why he hasnt done the same for his soninlaw you two naysmith broke in are like a couple of checkout girls with the latest copy of heat the phone on foxs desk rang and he picked it up hallway in two annie inglis said before the line went dead fox put the phone back down and patted the stacks of paperwork in front of him which is mine kaye asked fox tapped the relevant pile and mine naysmith added another tap meaning yours is the smallest malcolm kaye said with his usual frown as per naysmith agreed tough malcolm fox told them getting to his feet outside in the corridor annie inglis was already waiting she was leaning with her back to the wall one foot crossed over the other hands behind her its been pulled she said that much i knew we wont be pursuing a case against ds breck her face was as stony as her voice why orders says who malcolm her eyes fixed on his all you need to know is we no longer require the assistance of complaints and conduct is that how you were told to phrase it malcolm he took a step towards her but she was already on her way back to her office as his eyes followed her he saw her head go down she knew he was watching knew hed take it as a sign a woman whod just done something she wasnt happy about and wanted him to know at lunchtime he told the office he was going out he took a detour into the canteen hoping inglis might be there but she wasnt as he drove out of the compound he offered up a prayer that his parking space would still be vacant on his return while knowing from experience that there was maybe a catinhells chance as had become his custom he kept a regular watch on any traffic behind him but there were no black astras or green kas within ten minutes he was parking outside the oliver simon was again behind the bar chatting up one of the female croupiers while another eked out a shift at the blackjack table for the two hunched punters who were providing the casinos only custom i already told you youd need to talk to the boss simon said recognising fox actually it was my colleague you told that to and we did consult with ms broughton fox paused thought you might have been closed today as a mark of respect nuclear war thats about all we close for lucky for me fox pressed his palms against the bar counter simon stared at him she said you could watch the tapes he guessed of saturday night fox confirmed then go call her shell tell you but they both knew simon wasnt about to pick up the phone to joanna broughton for one thing she had other things on her mind for another simon didnt have the clout not that he would want the slim blonde croupier across the bar from him to suspect as much which was why he told fox it was fine and that he could use the office fox nodded his thanks inwardly congratulating himself on having read the young man correctly and explained that he would be out of their way in no time at all the office was cramped simon sat at the desk while he set up the playback the recording could be viewed directly on the screen belonging to the desktop computer harddrive recorders simon explained fox nodded as he studied the room a couple of chairs three filing cabinets and a bank of cctv screens alternating between a dozen different cameras do you depend on this to catch the cheats fox asked we have staff watching the floor sometimes well put someone on a table pretending to be just another punter everyones trained to be on the lookout have any scams actually worked one or two simon admitted using the mouse to navigate the screen eventually he was happy and swapped places with fox he started asking if there was any news about mr brogan did you know him fox asked back he came by pretty regularly didnt gamble much but liked to see joanna simon looked as if he might hang about so fox told him he could get back to work the young man hesitated but then seemed to remember the blonde croupier he nodded and left fox leaned in towards the screen and hit play there was a time code at top right showing him that it was nine oclock saturday evening he fastforwarded to ten at times the camera would zoom in to pick out one particular player or even that players hand movements as they studied their cards the place was busy but the tape being silent there was a surreal quality to the footage and the colour had a washedout look the cameras seemed to be focusing on the tables little attention was being paid to the doormen or the lobby or either of the bars fox couldnt see vince faulkner anywhere simon had told breck hed been drunk seated on a stool by the corner of the downstairs bar but fox was damned if he could find him when a tapping came at the door he let out a hiss of air look he called out im not halfway finished here the door opened slowly oh but you are a voice crooned dci billy giles was standing there filling the whole doorway gotcha he said torphichen police station not the same room as before one of the proper interview rooms and set up for a proper interview too video camera pointing down at the table from the ceiling once it was operational a red light would blink to indicate that recording was in progress a tape deck plugged into the wall socket two tapes one for each party one microphone on its stand in the centre of the table the walls whitewashed decorated with nothing but a reminder that smoking was punishable by a fine as if any of the rooms usual inmates would worry about that a foetid smell the place had only recently been vacated theyd left malcolm fox there to stew in his own juices no offer of tea or even water giles had asked him for his mobile fox had told him to get stuffed how do i know you wont go calling chat lines on my tab was his reasoning there was a uniform in the room with him standing to one side of the door doubtless this man would have been chosen for his gift of recall every station had one so fox pretended to be texting instead of making calls thing was who was he supposed to tell who could help him clamber out of the midden hed nosedived into so he just pushed buttons at random hoping he was getting on the uniforms nerves it was a further ten minutes before the door opened giles was followed into the room by two other detectives one of them was a woman in her thirties fox seemed to remember seeing her around the place when hed been working on heaton but couldnt recall if he was supposed to know her name the male detective was jamie breck it was the womans job to make sure the tapes were spooling the recorder picking up their voices she also checked that the cameras little red light was flashing then gave giles the nod he had seated himself opposite fox he placed a folder and a large envelope on the table between them fox resisted looking interested in either ds breck giles said with a nod of the head the nod was directed towards the empty chair next to fox breck seated himself slowly avoiding eye contact and fox realised that the pair of them were in the selfsame mess they sat side by side with giles across the desk from them like a headmaster with a pair of truants and the woman officer replacing the uniform by the door where do i start giles muttered almost to himself he was running his fingers over the folder and the envelope then he looked up as though hed just had an idea how about the pictures camera never lies and all that he tipped the contents of the envelope on to the table there were dozens of photos theyd come from a desktop printer and werent of the best quality but good enough all the same youll see the time and date on each one giles was saying turning them around so fox and breck could view them more clearly that ones you ds breck youre visiting inspector fox at his home the two of you then took a little trip to a casino giles paused for effect happens to be the same one vince faulkner visited the night he disappeared he held up the appropriate photo it was grainy shot with a telephoto lens from some distance fox and breck were depicted having their little word with the two doormen prior to entering the oliver what else have we got here giles made show of sifting through the photos again the pair of you at salamander point ds breck was there to gather information on our murder victim another pause not sure why you were there inspector fox hardly part of your remit as a member of complaints and conduct giles gave a little sniff the man was loving every second playing up to the camera and the microphone both fox thought back to the car the two cars he had his answer now even if youre paranoid he said to himself it doesnt mean theyre not after you trying to influence the investigation inspector fox giles was asking barging in on the locus at your sisters house her house isnt a crime scene fox snapped back until i say otherwise thats exactly what it is the huge mans voice was so calm he could have been inhaling prozac rather than oxygen thats because youre an arrogant prick fox decided a pause of his own was in order for the record he concluded giles took a few moments to shepherd his emotions back into the pen what were you doing when you were apprehended inspector i was being a cop you were in the office of the oliver casino viewing that venues cctv footage for the night vince faulkner went missing fox could sense jamie brecks disquiet at this news on whose authority did you go there nobodys did ds breck tell you it would be all right the pair of you had already been to that establishment not once but twice giles sifted out another photo breck and fox in daylight standing beside brecks car just seconds before joanna broughton turned up this has nothing to do with ds breck fox argued i went to salamander point on my own it was coincidence he was there at the same time giles had turned his attention to breck but you let the inspector sit in on your interview with mr ronald hendry yes breck admitted i outrank him fox began to explain i ordered him whether you did or you didnt heres the thing giles opened the folder and produced a typed sheet ds breck left that particular detail out of his account of the interview giles let the piece of paper fall on to the table and the night he came to your home had you ordered him to put in an appearance giles allowed the silence to run its course seems to me the two of you have become a bit too pally he glared at breck while his finger stabbed in foxs direction hes a suspect you knew that since when do we get cosy with suspects glen heaton did it often enough fox commented in an undertone giless eyes were full of fire his voice just about under control listen to the hypocrisy of the man he growled then he leaned back in his chair rolling his shoulders and neck none of this looks good time was maybe the force would have dealt with it in its own way he pretended a rueful sigh but with all the checks and balances these days the need to be whiter than white he was staring straight at fox well you of all people inspector you know how it is and he offered a shrug almost on cue there was a knock at the door the woman officer opened it and two men entered one was chief inspector bob mcewan the other was in uniform carrying his peaked hat tucked beneath one arm a bloody disgrace were the mans opening words giles had risen to his feet as had breck and fox it was what you did when the deputy chief constable announced his presence and he did have presence hed stuck it out at lothian and borders while rejecting the advances of other forces stuck it out while several chief constables had been promoted over him or drafted in from outside his name was adam traynor and he was ruddycheeked steelyeyed tall and barrelchested a coppers copper was the consensus admired by the lower ranks as well as the higherups fox had met the man several times minor cases of misconduct could be dealt with by the dcc only the more serious cases had to go to the procurator fiscal disgrace traynor was repeating to himself while mcewan had eyes only for his errant employee fox remembered their conversation of that morning have things been quiet in my absence mcewan had asked as the grave fox had answered now traynors attention turned to mcewan and giles your men he was telling them will have to be suspended pending the outcome of the inquiry yes sir mcewan muttered sir giles agreed dont fret traynor went on half turning his head in the direction of fox and breck youll be on full pay giless eyes were on fox too and fox knew what his nemesis was thinking just like glen heaton excuse me the woman officer interrupted were still taping then switch it off traynor roared she did so having first informed the microphone that the interview was ending at two fiftyseven pm internal inquiry sir bob mcewan was asking bit late for that bob grampian have had your man under surveillance these past four days traynor was sifting through the photographs on the table theyll be the ones sorting it all out same as wed do for them if the tables were turned mcewan was frowning my officer has been under surveillance the deputy chief constable silenced him with a glare your mans been misbehaving chief inspector and no one saw fit to inform me mcewan stated a topic for later discussion traynor was glaring at mcewan but mcewans attention was concentrated on malcolm fox and there was an unspoken question there what the hell is going on here right traynor said straightening up and running a thumb along the brim of his cap is that all clear enough for you ive got paperwork i could do with finishing breck said not a chance traynor barked back at him dont want you trying to cook the books the blood rose up jamie brecks neck with all due respect sir but the deputy chief constable was already in the process of leaving well need your warrant cards and any pass keys billy giles was stating hand held out in preparation you walk out of here and you dont go near either of your offices even to pick up a jacket or bag you go home and you stay home grampian police will doubtless be in touch youll know the protocol off by heart inspector fox mcewan had followed traynor out of the room as if keen to collar the man and without so much as a backward glance but fox trusted his boss hed be arguing foxs case fighting his corner warrant cards giles repeated fingers twitching after which youll be escorted from the premises the federation has lawyers the woman officer piped up giles gave her a hard stare thanks annabel jamie breck said throwing his warrant card down well short of billy giless hand there was a pool hall on the corner and that was their first stop if only because they needed a place to sit and take it all in breck seemed to be known to the proprietor a table by the window was wiped down for their use and coffees arrived on the house no well pay for them breck insisted producing a handful of coins from his pocket one mans gift is another mans bung his eyes met foxs and the two men managed wary smiles not exactly the most pressing of our worries fox offered annabel was right though there are lawyers we could be consulting breck shrugged at least you were right when you said you were being tailed might explain that van outside my house yes fox commented feeling suddenly awkward so what happens now id say youre the resident expert here fox didnt answer immediately he listened to the sounds around him pool balls clacking against each other mild cursing from the players the low rumble of traffic outside now were in the same boat he thought what was the last you heard about brogans yacht he asked breck stared at him were not interested in any of that malcolm were suspended from our jobs sure fox shrugged but youve got friends right annabel shes one of them that means you can keep tabs on whats happening and if it gets back to billy giles whats the worst he can do were grampians problem from now on fox picked up the cup and blew across its surface he knew it was going to be the cheapest brand of powdered instant knew the cup wasnt as clean as it could be but he would remember the smell and the taste and the pattern on the saucer for the rest of his life were civilians now jamie he went on that gives us more room to manoeuvre not less im not sure what youre saying fox proffered a huge shrug i thought you were the risktaker jamie the one who reckons we all make our own luck affect the way our lives are going to turn out and youre the one who thinks the opposite fox just shrugged again a couple of players had come in they carried their twopiece cues in little travel cases one of the men had a rolledup copy of the days evening news in his pocket when he slipped out of his jacket and made to hang it up fox sauntered over mind if i take a look he asked the man shook his head so fox retreated to his table with the paper charlie brogan had made it to the front page not that there was much to report remember what you said jamie joanna broughtons first phone call seems to have been to this pr agency the media knew about the boat before we did what does that say to you that the lady has skewed priorities breck paused what do you make of it im not sure not yet youre not just going to go home and put your feet up are you probably not whos to say theyll stop tailing you thats another thing i want to know precisely how long its been going on why because timing is everything jamie fox stared at breck you really didnt know i was under surveillance breck shook his head determinedly traynor said four days that takes it back to monday vinces body wasnt found till tuesday fox nodded i still want to know whats on the cctv footage from the oliver i doubt itll be useful fox leaned back in his seat maybe its time for you to tell me why you seem to know so much about the place breck considered for a moment weighing up how much to say it was a few months back he began just someone we were trying to build a case against who a councillor suspected of being a naughty boy there were rumours of a meeting at the oliver so we asked joanna broughton for any recordings and and there werent any not by the time we went looking theyd been wiped story we got was thered been a glitch of some kind but ive seen the tapes from saturday night i know theyre there doesnt mean there wont be another glitch the oliver is broughtons pride and joy her way of saying she can make it on her own without father jack you mean breck nodded she doesnt want the place getting a rep dodgy meetings last known sightings of murder victims thats why she uses the pr company lovatt meikle meldrum breck recited fox thought for a moment the night we went to the oliver you told me youd never been to the oliver in your life i lied why empathy breck suggested hed taken the paper from fox skimming the front page and then flipping to the leader column seen this he asked then he started to quote from the piece the value of the various development sites along the edinburgh waterfront has dropped by million over the past year land in the city has fallen from a high of million an acre to less than a quarter of that fountain brewery project in trouble ditto caltongate and the projected new town at shawfair eighty per cent of the land holdings in edinburgh now have no development value at all he placed the newspaper on the table in front of them no development value at all he repeated seems to me charlie brogan had every reason to walk the plank hard to disagree fox was scanning the piece for himself fountain brewery he mused thats where vince was found breck nodded would brogan have been one of the developers its possible breck conceded hundreds of millions of pounds that have just vanished into thin air fox commented the lands still there breck argued only thing thats gone is the confidence banks stop lending everyone gets the jitters he thought for a moment so what are you going to do malcolm maybe go see jude check how shes doing what about you been a while since i could dedicate a whole day to quidnunc breck broke off staring down at the table im not sorry i did what i did dont worry about it this is all my fault not yours tell it just the way it happened i railroaded you pulled rank maybe even lied he was on the verge of saying it by the way im not the only one whos been under surveillance but he swallowed the words back and gave a sigh instead you could have told me about the casino and the councillor breck just shrugged giles was right though i never should have allowed you within a million miles of the case hes probably more furious with me than he is you youre the enemy he knew about but me turns out im judas im sure judas had his good points they shared a halfhearted laugh as they got to their feet coffees unfinished stood facing one another and shook hands fox replaced the newspaper in the poolplayers jacket and offered a wave of thanks when he turned towards the door jamie breck had already left tony kaye exited police hq with a scuffed briefcase swinging from one hand he was whistling through his teeth scanning the car park when a horn sounded he headed in that direction the volvos passengerside door was already open so he got in and closed it after him handing the briefcase to its owner what happened he asked they wouldnt let me past the front desk malcolm fox explained word must already have gone out that im radioactive mcewan has a face like fury whats he been saying not a cheep he had some meeting in the dccs office and theres another scheduled for later kaye paused im hearing a lot of strange accents about the place grampian police fox explained from the complaints i suppose theyve got me under investigation kaye puckered his lips to give a proper whistle grampian complaints whats going on foxy ive walked right into it tony nobody to blame but myself did breck grass you up fox thought for a moment then shook his head they were looking at me before id even met him lookings one thing but did they have any ammo until he came along and why were they looking at you in the first place anything i should know about fox didnt have even the beginnings of an answer he unlocked his briefcase and peered in where are the queries from the fiscals office it was kayes turn to shake his head mcewan has already divvied them up hes bringing someone else in only temporary till youre back on your feet who said i wasnt on my feet fox snapped then who is it gilchrist fox stared at him chop shop gilchrist kaye nodded slowly so now ill have him in one ear naysmith in the other the pair of them vying to outgeek each other and you know what that means what means youve got to get his thing quashed pronto before i go postal fox managed a tired smile thanks for the vote of confidence its me im thinking of foxy they sat in silence for a moment staring through the windscreen then kaye gave an elongated sigh you going to be all right he asked dont know anything i can do to help keep your ear to the ground call me once a day so i know whats happening he paused whose idea was it to bring in gilchrist no doubt naysmith put in a good word but from what ive seen the chop shops shorthanded as it is with gilchrist elsewhere that only leaves inglis kaye offered a shrug not your problem foxy he was opening the car door minters later friday night remember i doubt ill be in the mood kaye was halfway out of the car when he paused and stuck his head back in by the way joe wanted me to remind you youre three weeks behind with the coffee kitty tell him the debts transferred to the new boy i like your style inspector fox kaye said with a grin always have instead of going straight home fox stopped outside judes house there was no sign of any activity no vans or officers he rang her bell and she answered with a shout from the other side of the door who is it your brother she opened the door and let him in had reporters round he guessed they wanted to know why your lot had been excavating my garden she accepted his peck on the cheek and led him into the living room shed been smoking a stub was still smouldering in the ashtray but there was no evidence that shed had a drink other than coffee a fresh jar of instant sat on the breakfast bar alongside the kettle and a mug and spoon want one she asked but he shook his head that cast looks different he commented she lifted her arm a fraction brand new this lunchtime bit less cumbersome and at least i got to have a good scratch when they took off the old one he smiled at this didnt you break your other arm once wrist she corrected him i wondered if youd remember mum took me along when you went to the hospital to have the cast removed jude was nodding she had returned to her favoured armchair and was preparing to light a fresh cigarette youve just put one out fox reminded her meaning it must be time for another didnt you used to smoke not since leaving school he settled himself on the sofa across from her the tv was playing with the sound turned down looked like a nature documentary seems a lifetime ago jude was saying it was a lifetime ago she nodded growing solemn and fox knew she was thinking of vince they still cant tell me when theyll release the body she said in an undertone i was wondering something fox began leaning forward a little im not sure youve ever told me how the two of you met she stared at him i didnt think you were interested i am now jude drew on her cigarette screwing shut her eyes against the smoke she had slid around in the armchair so that her legs hung over one of its arms fox was reminded that his sister had a good figure the jeans she was wearing were tight showing the lines of her slender thighs and hips just the beginnings of a roll of fat around her waist no bra discernible beneath the tshirt which was baggy at the sleeves allowing glimpses of the flesh either side of her breasts shed been bright at school a bit of a swot the rebel in her had only come to light later with her first tattoo a red rose on her left shoulder complete with a thorny stem fox recalled that sandra hendry too boasted a tattoo a scorpion on her ankle and vince faulkners arms had been scarred by the amateur needleandink methods of his youth vince jude was saying drawing the name out beyond its natural length vince was drinking with some of his friends in the west end it was a sunday night and i was out with this girl melissa from the office it was her birthday and tell the truth she was called the frumpster behind her back shed asked half a dozen of us to go out that night and id said yes before realising that everybody else had made some excuse jude sighed so there were just the two of us and that had its compensations how so being out with the frumpster meant i got all the attention beauty and the beast she wasnt that bad malcolm but the putdown was halfhearted at best anyway we ended up in a pub on st martins lane or somewhere you dont know london do you she watched fox shake his head youd hate it too big too full of itself she seemed to be drifting away but managed to stop herself vince was in a crowd of half a dozen thered been a football game that lunchtime and it looked like theyd been celebrating ever since they insisted on buying us drinks she paused again lost in thought vince was the same as them but different he didnt seem to have put as much away as his pals he was quieter almost shy he wrote his mobile number on the back of my hand said hed leave the rest to me it was up to you to take the initiative i suppose and it turns out you did but jude was shaking her head i had a shower the next morning and the number was gone far as i was concerned he was just a fella in a sundaynight boozer but melissa had hooked up with one of the guys week later he turned up to fetch her from the office vince was with him she smiled wanted to know why i hadnt called the four of you went out together the four of us went out together she confirmed melissa broke up with gareth after about a fortnight her eyes were glassy with tears but she blinked them back i never expected us to last fox watched his sister rub her eyes against either shoulder of her tshirt there was writing on the front of the shirt along with an illustration it was from a rock tour and fox remembered that vince faulkner had often taken jude to concerts theyd travelled as far afield as paris and amsterdam for certain bands you never really knew him jude was saying you never made the effort all fox could do was nod his agreement he wasnt all candyfloss and ice cream jude because hed been in trouble with the law her eyes were fixing on his thats the thing though people like you cant see past that it was ancient history yet that man giles kept harping on about it and the papers keep saying it and he kept it from you jude he didnt want you to know because it wasnt him any more her voice was rising and dont start saying he was beating me up i dont want to hear it the papers have got hold of that too and who is its been feeding them all this crap if not your lot theyre not my lot fox said under his breath not any more he spent much of the evening lifting books from the bookshelves in his living room and placing them on the coffee table his intention was to put them in alphabetical order maybe with a split into two categories ones hed read ones he hadnt but then he wondered if maybe some of them couldnt go to a charity shop and of the ones left for reshelving should he initiate a further subdivision into fiction and nonfiction hed eaten chicken curry for his supper using up the ingredients bought from asda when hed gone there to talk to sandra hendry the chicken had come from a coop on the way back from judes he was now suffering from discomfort having eaten too much maybe they could all go he told himself staring at the piles of books that would mean he could dispense with the shelving creating more space but space for what exactly a bigger tv one of those home cinema systems he would just end up watching more rubbish than ever when his mobile trilled he was happy to answer it it was a text message from annie inglis inviting him to lunch on sunday she provided her address and ended her message with the simplest of questions ok fox ran his fingers through his hair and found that he was sweating from his work with the books never the worlds most expert texter it took him three trial runs before he decided he was happy with his reply only then did he press the send button his message had been a succinct ok no question mark required saturday february saturday fox slept late but then he hadnt fallen asleep until two by eleven he was seated at the kitchen table with three newspapers scotsman herald and the very earliest printing of the evening news he was looking for background on charlie brogan and scottish journalism was happy to oblige workingclass roots raised and schooled in falkirk his father had been a joiner charlie picking up some skills even before school had kicked him out his cv was copious and wideranging taking in everything from carpetfitting to doortodoor selling the two had combined eventually brogan setting up a company that sold floor coverings to factories and businesses by twentythree he had enough money going spare that he could afford a punt buying flats and either letting them out or refurbishing them for resale the economy was buoyant and brogan prospered further moving into fullscale land development and rubbing shoulders with the rich and influential he enjoyed the hospitality of bankers and other businessmen dated some of scotlands most eligible young women and eventually met and married joanna broughton the papers carried several snapshots of joanna shed always been a looker but there was a hardness to her features and her stare even smiling she let the photographer know she was the boss the interior of the inverleith penthouse featured in one picture its walls festooned with art a sidebar had been contributed by a professional psychologist who warned that more tragedies involving onetime highflyers might be the inevitable outcome of the credit crunch the sole public failure in brogans long career had come when his attempt to join the board of celtic fc was rebuffed one of his friends reminisced for the herald about the incident charlie never got used to people saying no to him it festered to the extent that he discussed switching his allegiance to ibrox thats the kind of guy he was the hotheaded kind fox thought to himself not the kind to rationalise a snub if he could stew about it instead a man who would see the economys doldrums as a personal affront but that phrase about ibrox about not giving in but getting even it didnt hint that brogan was the sort to just give up he would want to fight back the psychologist had focused on the economy without bothering to debate the most important question could charlie brogan have been classed as a suicide risk there was no mention that any note had been left no evidence that he had tidied up his affairs before taking the plunge but then maybe that was fair enough hed taken his boat out drifting further and further from his troubles tranquillising himself with pills and alcohol he could have gone on deck stumbled and fallen overboard or that impetuous streak might have suggested to him suddenly that he should finish things properly not a planned suicide but absolutely of the moment there had been no comment from the family apart from the original statement issued through gordon lovatt fox stared at joanna broughtons photograph you made sure you had a media angle he told her before you let anyone else in on it was that cold was it calculating or just a smart woman being smart fox stared and stared and couldnt decide he took a break stretching his spine and loosening his shoulders through in the living room he saw that the coffee table was covered in books there were more on the floor in front of the shelves the shelves themselves denuded dust hung in the air so far hed found only half a dozen titles that he felt no further use for heavily outnumbered by those he wanted to read again when his phone rang he had to hunt for the handset it was hidden between two of the piles malcolm fox he said by way of greeting it was lauder lodge mitch wanted to know if hed be visiting today or tomorrow he wanted to see him fox was about to suggest sunday until he remembered lunch with annie inglis he glanced at his watch then asked the caller to tell his father he was on his way he took the city bypass to the sheriffhall roundabout and headed for the wisp cutting through niddrie and reaching the care home in under twenty minutes mitch was seated in reception dressed in coat scarf and hat i want to go out he told his son sure fox agreed i can bring the car round my legs havent seized up entirely so they walked around the corner to where fox had found a parking space he had to help his father with his seat belt and they took the short drive to portobello parking on a side road by the promenade we should have invited mrs sanderson audreys spending the day in her bed mitch explained shes got a cold coming then as malcolm unclipped his seat belt for him i asked them to phone jude for me but she wasnt answering shes been getting a lot of calls from journalists or it could be shes next door with a neighbour how is she bearing up are you any nearer catching whoever did it its not my case dad id hope youd be keeping a bloody eye on it though fox nodded slowly i dont think theres been much progress the sun was shining and the seafront was busy there were dogwalkers and children down on the beach itself kids with inline skates were being guided along the concrete walkway by their parents a sharp wind was whipping across the firth of forth fox wondered if charlie brogans boat would have been visible from here according to the papers it had been towed to north queensferry which meant that fife constabulary were vying with lothian and borders for jurisdiction the respective chief constables would sort it out with edinburgh the likely winner much as the fife cops might fancy a few days or weeks stationed in the capital what are you thinking foxs father asked him they were standing by the sea wall staring out at the view weekends arent for thinking malcolm stated meaning you had your mind on work fox couldnt deny it things have been a bit rough he admitted you need a holiday i had a decent break at christmas and did what exactly i mean a proper holiday with sunshine and a hotel swimming pool and meals served on the terrace mitch fox paused you could well afford it if you didnt have my bills hanging over you fox looked at his father lauder lodge was a godsend dad i dont begrudge a penny of it im betting your sister doesnt chip in she doesnt need to i can afford it but it leaves things tight doesnt it i know damned well how much my room costs and i can guess how much you make fox gave a short laugh but said nothing what if you meet a nice girl and want to take her away somewhere his father continued whats brought this on fox asked with a smile im not going to be here much longer malcolm we both know that i just want to be sure in my mind that my son and daughter are all right were fine fox touched the sleeve of his fathers coat and you shouldnt be talking like that i think ive earned the privilege maybe so but all the same fox blew his nose and looked up and down the promenade lets get something to eat he said they ate fish and chips from the paper seated by the sea wall sure youre not too cold fox asked his father the old man shook his head the smell of vinegar fox confided always takes me back to holidays and high days a treat on saturday night mitch fox agreed except your mother was never so keen on the fish had to be chicken or steak pie for her what was the name of the chippie near us fox was frowning in concentration but his father thought for a moment and shook his head cant help maybe i should ask lauder lodge if theres a room there for me youll get it eventually the room or the name of the chippie mitch fox smiled at this hed had enough to eat so offered the remainder to malcolm who shook his head they rose to their feet and started walking mitch was stiff at first but tried not to show it people they passed either nodded a greeting or said hello there were plenty of gulls around but fox dumped the remains of the food in a bin instead are hearts home or away mitch asked couldnt even tell you who theyre playing you loved going to a game when you were a kid i think it was the swearing i liked and ive not been to a match all season foxs father had paused again leaning against the sea wall are things really okay son he asked no not really do you want to tell your old man about it but all malcolm fox could do was shake his head they found a pub and went inside mitch selecting their table while malcolm fetched the drinks a sparkling water and a half of ipa his father asked him how long it was since hed had a real drink and confessed that audrey sanderson kept a supply of brandy in her bedside cabinet fox sat in silence for a minute then took a deep breath do you really want to know why i stopped drinking because you realised it was going to end up killing you his father guessed but fox shook his head after elaine left i took to it hard kept pestering her to the point where i could probably have been done as a stalker i went round to see her one night id had a skinful and i ended up punching her he went quiet but his father wasnt about to interrupt she could have had me prosecuted my career would have been in tatters when i phoned her to apologise well it took some persuading before shed even talk to me and then all she said was stop drinking and i knew she was right why are you telling me this mitch asked quietly why now because of what happened to vince his son explained ive always hated him hated the way he treated jude but now that hes dead mitch waited for fox to make eye contact youre not like him he stated dont go thinking you are they settled back to watch the football on tv staying for the results it was five oclock and nearly dark when they emerged fox drove his father back to lauder lodge in silence receiving a firm look from one of the staff members mr fox it transpired was late for supper lucky weve kept it for you the woman advised thats debatable mitch muttered stretching a hand out towards his son the two men shook on his way home fox thought about stopping and buying some flowers for annie inglis she had texted him her address unaware that he already knew it he wondered too if he should buy something for her son but what and might flowers not start to wilt overnight straight home then to dinner from the fridge and more sorting of books he thought back to the pub youre not like him dont go thinking you are when he unlocked his door there was a note inside his letter box it was from jamie breck call me when you get in fox took out his phone but then paused tapping it against his teeth he locked the door after him and got back into his car five minutes later he was parking on the street outside brecks home the houses had their own driveways and garages meaning there was plenty of space kerbside it struck him though that the surveillance van really must have stood out because of this as he pressed the remotelocking button he noticed that a young woman was just coming out of brecks shrugging her arms into her coat and wrapping a scarf around her neck she was heading towards brecks mazda but saw him and managed to place him she gave a wave and a smile just nipping out for pizza do you want any fox halfway down the path by now shook his head its annabel isnt it she nodded and got into the driving seat theres a bottle of wine open she informed him giving another wave before driving off fox rang the doorbell and waited forgotten something jamie breck was asking as he opened the door then his eyes widened oh its you he was dressed in tshirt and denims his feet bare there was music playing it sounded vaguely brazilian to fox didnt mean to interrupt fox began annabels just gone for pizza breck broke off how did you know where i live yes malcolm good question i thought i knew the street he explained then i just got lucky saw annabel coming out and recognised her from torphichen so now my guilty little secret is out shes your girlfriend fox deduced yes does giles know i reckon he suspects not that its a state secret or anything its just that well both take a ribbing when it gets out what rank is she detective constable her surnames cartwright if you want to keep things nice and formal breck broke off again come in wont you fox followed him inside the place had a very modern feel well decorated and laid out the music was coming from an mp system and there was a flatscreen tv attached to one wall the lights had been dimmed but breck powered them up again on the floor by the sofa sat a wine bottle two glasses and brecks shoes and socks look i dont want to interrupt anything fox said not a problem malcolm i think im still in shock from yesterday how about you fox nodded and slipped his hands into his coat pockets you had something to tell me he prompted breck had collapsed on to the sofa he stretched out a hand towards his wine glass and lifted it to his mouth its your friend kaye he said before drinking what about him annabel told me this afternoon i was going to phone you but i thought maybe it was best done in person we were heading out for a drive so we dropped by and when you werent home i put that note through your door you were saying about tony kaye breck sloshed the wine around in his glass remember you told me about your sisters mystery visitor on the monday night he stared at fox above the rim of the glass kaye fox guessed seems that a concerned citizen called to let police know of a car parked illegally in judes street one front and one back tyre up on the pavement breck managed the faintest of smiles youve got to love edinburghs army of nosy parkers he lifted a remote control from the sofa and used it to turn down the music anyway they called it in and eventually someone noticed it turns out our concerned citizen had made a note of the make and model of car plus a partial registration nissan xtrail thats what tony kaye drives and his registration matches partially fox stressed partially breck conceded but its enough to satisfy billy giles fox thought for a moment it doesnt mean anything he said maybe not breck took another mouthful of wine anyway i thought youd want to know since kaye doesnt seem to have mentioned it to you himself fox didnt know how to answer so nodded slowly instead does he know hes been rumbled his presence at torphichen has been requested first thing tomorrow giles has the team working a sunday he reckons the budget will stretch to it will you stay and have some pizza i cant listen thanks for letting me know i wouldnt want annabel to get into trouble annabels cleverer than you and me combined and wilier too breck had risen to his feet sorry again to burst in on you breck waved the apology aside he opened the front door for his guest and stood there as fox made his way back along the path towards the pavement malcolm breck called out causing fox to stop and turn towards him how did you know my street the night you dropped me off i dont remember mentioning it but instead of waiting for a reply breck just closed the door a few seconds later the music had been turned up again malcolm fox was still rooted to the spot shit he said reaching into his pocket for his phone tony kaye was in a restaurant with his wife he seemed to have excused himself from the table and was dodging waiters and other diners as he talked fox was back at his car by this time seated behind the steering wheel but with the key not yet in the ignition just exactly what did you think you were doing he asked and when were you going to tell me ive got a more interesting question for you foxy who the hell told you doesnt matter is it true is what true you went round to judes monday night what if i did why in gods name did you do that fox was massaging the bridge of his nose with his fingers christ foxy youd just told me hed broken your sisters arm my problem not yours but we both know dont we we know you werent planning on doing anything about it and what were you going to do tony take a swing at him why not mightve stopped him doing it again and both of them would think id put you up to it what does it matter kayes voice was rising he wasnt at home fox gave an elongated sigh why didnt you say something your sister was paralytic i reckoned shed have forgotten about it by morning instead of which youre now going to have billy giles crushing your nuts in a vice make a change from the wife dont go thinking this is funny it isnt giles is going to want to know everything you did on monday evening if there are gaps suddenly youre a suspect mcewans already lost one man tony yeah yeah giles would love to blow our whole show to smithereens received and understood fox paused for a moment which restaurant cento tre on george street special occasion were celebrating not killing each other so far this weekend mind you that makes it like every other weekend did you catch the hearts game be careful tomorrow you mean at torphichen its a sunday away from home far as im concerned thats a holiday and a lotto win rolled into one the background noises had changed kaye had obviously stepped outside there were shrieks of drunken female laughter and the sound of a car horn youd think people would have the decency to stop having fun kaye commented does nobody realise this is credit crunch ground zero be careful tomorrow malcolm fox repeated watching the woman detective called annabel returning with the pizzas in jamie brecks mazda and let me know how it goes sunday february annie inglis lived on the top floor of a victorian tenement in merchiston her name was on the intercom and when fox pressed the buzzer a male voice answered who is it is that duncan my names malcolm fox okay fox pushed open the door and found himself in a tiled stairwell with two bicycles parked just inside the entrance he climbed the stairs slowly peering up towards the glass cupola through which the lunchtime sun was streaming his morning had comprised coffee shopping and more newspapers he carried a bag within which lay a bottle of wine and a bunch of early daffodils for his hostess along with an itunes token for her son duncan was waiting for him at the top loitering just outside the door to the flat fox tried to make light of the climb must keep you fit he offered duncan just grunted he had lank brown hair falling into his eyes and was tall and gangly his chosen outfit of denims and tshirt would have fitted someone twice his girth he headed indoors and crooked a finger to let fox know he should follow the flats main hallway was long and narrow with half a dozen doors off the original flooring had been sanded and varnished there was a cycle helmet next to the phone on the only table above which was fixed a row of hooks with keys dangling from them mums duncan pointed vaguely before disappearing into his bedroom there was a legalise cannabis sticker on the door and fox could hear the low hum of a computers cooling fan at the far end of the hall was an open door leading to the drawing room it looked spacious with a bay window allowing views across the chimneypots north to the city centre and beyond but just before fox reached it he heard sounds from the room to his immediate right the door was open an inch allowing him a glimpse into the kitchen annie inglis was stirring a pot her face was red and she seemed flustered he decided to leave her be and walked into the drawing room a table had been set next to the window laid for three fox placed his carrier bag on it and took a look around sofa and chairs tv and hifi shelves filled with books dvds and cds there were framed photos too annie and duncan an elderly couple presumably her parents but no indication that duncans father played any role in the familys life youre here she was standing in the doorway carrying three wine glasses duncan let me in i didnt hear you she placed the glasses on the table then noticed the bag for you he said and something for duncan too she peered inside and smiled thats kind of you if youre busy in the kitchen dont worry i can entertain myself or i can come and help she shook her head nearly done she said grabbing the bag just give me two minutes sure i can fetch you a drink im not really a drinker cranberry juice its just about the only source of vitamins duncan gets cranberry juice is fine two minutes she repeated making her exit fox recommenced his tour of the room her preferred sunday paper was the observer she liked the novels of ian mcewan and films with subtitles her taste in music stretched from alan stivell to eric bibb all of which left fox not much the wiser he returned to the view envying her this sweep of the city and of the firth to its north mum says to say thanks it was duncan in the doorway this time he was waving the creditcardsized token i wasnt even sure if you used downloads fox said duncan nodded to let him know he did then he waved the token a final time and was gone again fifteen years old fox tried to think back to himself at that age thered been rows with jude and plenty of them he could always wind her up until she was at screaming point throwing things at him even fifteen hed started drinking by that stage bottles of cider in the park with his pals screwtop wine and quarterbottles of whisky here you go it was annie inglis again bringing him his tall glass of cranberry juice she looked around i told duncan to he did seems a nice kid she handed him the glass why dont you sit down ill just fetch my drink it was white wine in a tumbler she decanted it into one of the proper wine glasses on the table then brought it over and sat next to him on the sofa cheers she said chinking glasses cheers and thanks for the invite we dont normally do sunday lunch her eyes widened a little youre not vegetarian are you perish the thought ive got pork and apple sauce plus a burger for duncan he wont eat pork hed pick at it she took a mouthful of wine and exhaled thats better she smiled at him not that i need it you understand your secrets safe with me did you hear about gilchrist fox nodded i was going to ask if you knew i dont know what it is the complaints have got that ceop hasnt its only temporary though he was quick enough to accept you think they should have offered it to you id have turned it down she said quickly and not just because its your job were talking about she trained her eyes on him how are you feeling im fine you know that sign on the ceop door the one that says two people have to be present when you look at anything working solo is going to present problems she agreed i dont know how you can do the job you do he stated with a slow shake of the head the secret is you never focus on whats happening in the photo you look for the clues in the background anything that can identify where the abuse took place but it must get to you youve got a kid of your own we limit our time on the computer to a couple of hours a day plus three times a year we get counselling mandatory counselling when i come home the office doesnt come with me it still sounds tough its a job she said taking another gulp of wine then what about you malcolm whats going to happen he shrugged and lifted his own drink to his mouth what are you going to do about breck what can i do can you at least talk about it she shook her head why not when she just stared at him he lifted his hands in a show of surrender ill check on the meat she said getting back to her feet she was wearing tight black cords and a creamcoloured woollen sweater fox couldnt help enjoying his view of her as she left the room lunch itself was fine duncan said almost nothing hiding behind his curtain of hair the pork was tender and accompanied by mountains of veg duncan partaking of two boiled potatoes and one roast to accompany his burger there was trifle for dessert which the teenager asked if he could take to his room after a theatrical sigh his mother relented with dessert finished fox helped her clear the table the kitchen was a mess but she insisted shed clean up later duncan will help trust me so they settled back on the sofa with coffee and little cubes of homemade tablet shed put his flowers in a vase of water youve been married right she asked right no kids though we werent together long enough what happened we hooked up for all the wrong reasons oh im not about to bore you with the details he crossed one leg over the other how does duncan feel about your job he knows not to ask questions fair enough but he knows what you do and he has to tell his mates something weve never talked about it much she tucked her legs beneath her having kicked off her shoes fox could hear some sort of brass instrument being practised nearby is that duncan she shook her head one of the kids downstairs tuba his mum tells me and theres a drummer through that wall she nodded in the direction of the shelving unit how about duncan an electric guitar for his birthday last year but he wont take lessons i was like that when my parents bought me a set of golf clubs reckoned id teach myself teenage boys can be stubborn are your parents still alive my dad is and hows your sister doing therell be the funeral to plan i suppose might take a while for them to release the body and theres still no news it was his turn to shake his head so you started making your own enquiries as a result of which i get a nice paid holiday are you thinking of going somewhere i might just stay close to home he paused is there any point in me asking gilchrist a few questions she looked at him i wouldnt think so malcolm you do understand what the word suspension means of course a smile spread across her face i wouldnt have taken you for a rebel thats because i wear braces with my suit now she laughed maybe duncan stuck his head around the door im just going out where his mother asked princes street meeting up with anyone he shrugged okay then say goodbye to malcolm bye duncan said thanks again for the maybe see you again fox replied he sat in silence with inglis until the front door had closed i thought he was going to help you in the kitchen fox said hell do it when he comes back must be hard fox paused not having his dad around i mean do your parents still help out we see them some weekends are they still in fife she gave him a look i never told you i grew up in fife you must have but she was shaking her head slowly never taking her eyes off him you saw it in my file didnt you i like you annie so you had a trawl through my personnel file find out anything interesting inspector only that you never bothered to mention duncan her voice was steely i didnt want anyone seeing me as a single parent first and a cop second i can understand that i cant believe you checked up on me its what i do he paused what i used to do he corrected himself it was still out of order malcolm he was trying to shape an explanation but annie inglis had risen to her feet time for you to leave i think annie i just wanted to know a little more about you thanks again for the wine and the flowers and she looked about her avoiding eye contact then turned towards the door i need to get started in the kitchen he watched her go he was standing by this time still holding his coffee cup he placed it on the table and put his jacket back on she had closed the kitchen door he could hear her moving stuff around his fingers brushed the door handle without enough force to open it he stayed there a further minute willing her to come out but she had switched the radio on classic fm same station he sometimes listened to out of order malcolm he could open the door and apologise but instead he padded down the hall and let himself out on the pavement outside he craned his neck there was no one watching from the bay window or from the next window along the car next to foxs was being washed by its owner nice day for a change the man said fox drove away without responding he was halfway home when his phone rang he answered it hoping to hear annies voice but it was tony kaye what do you want fox asked you were the one who told me to ring kaye complained and it went okay thanks for asking fox remembered then torphichen sorry tony i was lost for a minute there bad billy wants me in the frame for faulkners demise he wants it a lot but he knows its not going to happen and thats driving him nuts good fox said other scenario hes got is you thumping faulkner and me acting the messenger he said maybe it wasnt my idea or even yours maybe jude got you to do it kaye paused she didnt did she look tony ive just had lunch round at annie ingliss flat nice one it ended badly she worked out that id taken a look at her personnel file christ when did that happen i was down at hr for background on jamie breck and thought youd take a peek at annie while you were at it seems fair enough to me she didnt see it that way sounds like an overreaction fox thought so too but he still had a favour to ask i need you to have a word with her what let her know im not some sort of stalker well ive only got your word for that itll give you something to do tomorrow while naysmith and the new boy are getting cosy kaye let out a hiss of air id forgotten we were getting lumbered with gilchrist while the techie twins are chatting you can be at the chop shop interceding on your behalf idve thought annie inglis was the least of your worries cant afford any more enemies right now tony good point consider it done but if she starts falling for my charms in place of yours ill be sure to let your wife of twelve years know you miserable sod kaye gave a laugh i bet you would too are you all done with torphichen i dare say giles will drag me in again plus grampian will want a word apparently the complaints giles was quick to tell them about me turning up at your sisters no chance of them investigating your misdemeanours without dragging me into it too things just get better and better dont they look on the bright side the restaurant last night forgot to charge me for our second bottle of wine fox managed the beginnings of a smile then reminded kaye to talk to annie inglis relax kaye told him so what are you doing the rest of the day want to meet up at minters ive got stuff to do such as alphabetising my bookshelves fox ended the call and drove home in silence the rest of the day he couldnt really concentrate on anything the piles of books sat untouched there were sections of the various papers still unbrowsed the tv proved little comfort and he had no view from his window other than the house identical to his across the street then at eight oclock someone rang his doorbell he ticked off possible visitors jamie tony kaye annie inglis it was jude the taxi that had just dropped her was leaving her arm was still in a sling so shed only managed to drape her threequarterlength coat around her shoulders good to see you he said pecking her cheek and ushering her inside are you moving out she asked when she saw the state of the living room fox shook his head been a while since you were last here he commented we never seemed to get invited she had shrugged off her coat fox walked into the kitchen and started filling the kettle dci giles phoned me she explained from the doorway he says the man who came to my door on monday night was a friend of yours he works with me giles thinks you sent him i didnt sent him to do your dirty work she continued his names kaye i think youve mentioned him to me before how did he know where i live malcolm fox turned towards her jude this man giles is trying every trick he knows in an effort to fuck things up for me you told kaye where i live at some point i must have but i didnt know he was going to come to your house he was looking for vince only reason hed be doing that is if you told him what happened told him about my arm so she was blinking back tears dci giles thinks maybe you had vince killed i didnt then why send your friend round i didnt send him he was looking for vince remember but vince was already dead jude and that means tony kaye didnt know pain was thrumming in foxs temples he opened a drawer and took out a packet of paracetamol tablets popping two of them from the blister pack and washing them down with water from the tap jude waited until she had his full attention again before she spoke giles says vince could have been killed monday night he says the tests always have a margin of error hes lying pathology has vince dying on the saturday or the sunday a single tear was running down judes left cheek i just want this to be over she said her voice cracking fox stepped forward and placed his hands gently on her shoulders i know he said as she buried her face in his chest they spent the next hour and a half talking quietly in the living room she drank the tea he prepared for her but didnt feel like eating she promised him she had eaten something at lunchtime she promised him she would have breakfast he brought out a packet of weetabix from the kitchen and said shed be taking it home with her when he offered milk she gave a little laugh and told him to stop making such a fuss but he got the feeling she liked it really he called a taxi for her and pressed a tenpound note into her hand then he pecked her on the cheek again and closed the door of the cab for her waving as she was driven away shed asked him if hed seen their father and he had lied because he hadnt wanted her to feel left out next time he was visiting mitch he would take her along she belonged there just as much as he did she was family malcolm fox made himself a last mug of tea and headed for bed it wasnt yet ten but he couldnt think of anything else to do monday february malcolm foxs alarm woke him at seven as usual he was in the shower before he realised there was no necessity to be up this early nor did he have to wear a clean shirt and a fresh tie or his suit and braces but that didnt stop him putting all of them on as he was eating breakfast there was a phone call it was a woman called stoddart from grampian police psu she was inviting him to a meeting at fettes hq shall we say three pm threes fine fox informed her the day was cold and overcast snowdrops were starting to appear in his front garden and he reckoned thered be some brave crocuses already sticking their heads above the parapet in the meadows and the citys other parks he tried to work out a route that would take him through the meadows on his way to leith it would be circuitous but with the added bonus of a drive through holyrood park besides he wasnt exactly in a hurry a few years back fox and his team had investigated an officer based at leith police station hed been taking backhanders and turning a blind eye one of his own men had come to them but only with a promise of anonymity meetings had taken place at a greasy spoon near the docks and this was foxs destination today the café was called the marina its paintwork peeling interior walls shiny with grease there were half a dozen formicatopped tables and a ledge by the window where you could stand and eat if you preferred the owner was a large redfaced woman who did much of the cooking while an eastern european girl worked the till and the tables fox had been seated for fifteen minutes nursing a mug of industrialstrength tea when max dearborn walked in dearborn saw him and his whole body seemed to sag hed put on half a stone or more since theyd last met and had developed jowls there was still acne around his mouth and his dark hair was slicklooking combed straight down more than ever he resembled oliver hardys scottish nephew hiya max fox said dearborns breathing was hoarse as he wedged himself into the seat opposite fox is this just some horrific coincidence the young man pretended to guess fox was shaking his head the waitress had arrived and he ordered a bacon roll usual for you max she asked dearborn who nodded a reply keeping his eyes on fox when she moved away fox spoke in an undertone i hear youre a ds these days congratulations dearborn responded with a twitch of the mouth fox remembered him the way hed been a detective constable with ideals and principles still intact yet fearful of alienating his colleagues serpico tony kaye had called him what do you want dearborn was asking hed taken a good look around the café seeking out enemies and sharp ears are you working the charlie brogan drowning fox could feel sweat forming on his back his heart was beating far too fast the tea had enough tannin in it to fell an ox so he pushed the mug to one side its not a drowning yet dearborn corrected him and whats it to you anyway im just interested reckon maybe you owe me a favour a favour for keeping your name under wraps is that some sort of threat fox shook his head dearborns coffee had arrived and he shovelled two spoonfuls of sugar into it stirring noisily like i say im just interested im hoping someone can keep me up to date and thats me is it dearborn stared at him why the interest fox shrugged brogan might tie in to another case to do with the complaints dearborn was suddenly less hostile and more interested maybe its all hushhush but if anything did come to light id be willing to share the credit fox paused you know my boss had a say in your promotion thought he might have it can happen again max fox let his voice drift away dearborn took a slurp of coffee and then another and started to do some thinking fox just sat there hands in his lap not wanting to rest any part of his suit against the surface of the table the waitress was returning with their food foxs filled roll dearborns fryup the young mans plate was heaped and he turned towards the cook and gave her a nod and a smile she smiled back fox had peeled open his roll the bacon looked pale and stringy he closed it again and left it on the plate dearborn was squeezing brown sauce across the array of bacon fried egg sausage beans and mushrooms looks good fox commented dearborn just nodded and took his first mouthful eyes on fox as he chewed bodys still not surfaced dearborn said is that unusual not according to those in the know currents are irregular in the channel he could have been swept out into the north sea a container ships propeller could have snagged him and turned him to mush coastguard were out again at first light weve got patrols working both seashores north and south i heard fife constabulary was claiming jurisdiction dearborn shook his head there were already traces of egg yolk either side of his mouth thatll never wash weve asked for their cooperation but this is d division territory fair and square so wheres the boat dalgety bay last time i looked that was in fife its going to be towed to leith later today im assuming youve already given it a onceover forensics have dearborn confirmed evidence of alcohol and pills fox stated youre well informed no suicide note but im told thats not so unusual hed contacted his solicitor a few days back to check some of the details of his will foxs eyes narrowed when exactly tuesday afternoon did he want to change anything dearborn shook his head im assuming everything will go to the widow that depends on us finding a body if we dont then shes got a wait on her hands its a legal thing dearborn concentrated on his food then decided to share something with fox his shoes have been found deck shoes theyre called bobbing in the water off inchcolm island he paused supposing this does tie in to whatever youre working on how do i get my share of the spoils without anyone on my side knowing ive been talking to you there are ways malcolm fox said trust me when the meal was finished their waitress asked if something was wrong with the bacon roll just not hungry fox reassured her then to dearborn let me get this your moneys no good in here how come dearborn offered a shrug there was a breakin a few months back i made sure we put in an extra bit of effort you sure you should be telling this to someone from the complaints max dearborn winked and with a certain amount of effort got back to his feet he insisted on leaving first fox watched him go and speculated as to a future of high blood pressure and diabetes maybe even the odd coronary about a year back his own doctor had foretold much the same for him since when hed dropped a stone while feeling little better for it he stood outside the café listening to the screaming of gulls on the nearby roofs then he started walking d division hq was on queen charlotte street as with torphichen it boasted a solid if drab victorian exterior but unlike torphichen its interior still held traces of a certain faded grandeur marble floors carved wooden balustrades ornate pillars dearborn would be inside by now his last words to fox had consisted of a promise to keep him posted fox had given him a card with his mobile number your best bet for catching me hed said last thing he wanted was dearborn calling his fettes office and being told that inspector malcolm fox was out of the game word would spread fast enough billy giles would see to that but meantime dearborn might prove useful hed already given fox something to think about tuesday morning vince faulkners body is found tuesday afternoon charlie brogan contacts his solicitor thursday his boat is found drifting its owner missing missing presumed dead without really meaning to fox found that hed strolled the quartermile to leith police station he walked as far as the corner of constitution street then turned he was just passing the buildings public entrance when a woman came out sliding her oversized sunglasses back on to her face she was dressed not in black but coordinated brown she reached into her leopardprint handbag for cigarettes and lighter but the breeze kept foiling her attempts let me fox said opening his suit jacket so it provided a windbreak she got the cigarette lit and gave him a nod of thanks fox nodded a response and then moved off once back at his car he made a uturn and headed in the direction of the police station she was still standing there looking up and down the street fox pulled to a halt next to her and slid down the passengerside window its ms broughton isnt it she took a moment to recognise him as her nicotine saviour then leaned down a little towards the open window i take it youve just been talking to my colleagues he asked her yes she said her voice less husky than hed imagined it would be looking for a taxi she was peering up and down the street again im headed in your direction if youre interested how do you know fox offered a shrug casino or inverleith theyre both on my route she studied him for a moment can i smoke in the car she asked sure he said with a smile hop in they drove in silence for the first couple of sets of traffic lights as they stopped at the third she noticed that he had wound his window halfway down you didnt mean it about the smoking she said flicking the remains of her cigarette out of her own window where do you want dropped he asked im going home by inverleith park she nodded seebee house fox worked it out your husbands initials she nodded again i suddenly realise something she began twisting in her seat so she was facing him ive only got your word for it that youre a police officer i should ask to see some id im an inspector what did my colleagues want with you more questions she answered with a sigh why it cant be done over the phone its because the face says a lot about us we give things away when we talk im assuming it wasnt ds dearborn you saw no thats because i had a meeting with him at the same time she nodded as though accepting that he had proved his credentials her phone trilled and she plucked it from her handbag it was a text message which she responded to with quick sure movements of her thumbs long nails help fox commented my fingers are too pudgy for texting she said nothing until shed sent the message then just as she was opening her mouth her phone trilled again fox realised that it was mimicking the sound of an oldfashioned bell on a hotel reception desk broughton busied herself punching buttons again messages from friends and creditors she muttered charlie seems to have had more of the latter you know his shoes have surfaced he saw her give him a hard look sorry he apologised not the best turn of phrase they told me at the station she was back to her texting again but then another phone sounded from inside her handbag she rummaged until she found it fox recognised the ringtone it was the theme from an old western sorry about this broughton said to him as she answered then into the phone i cant talk now simon just tell me everythings all right she listened for a moment i should be there by six or seven if you cant cope till then start writing out your resignation she ended the call and dropped the phone back into her bag staff problems fox asked my own fault for not having a proper deputy you dont like to delegate she looked at him again have we met somewhere before no you look familiar she had slid her sunglasses down her nose and was peering at him when shed applied the makeup around her eyes this morning her hand hadnt been too steady close up her hair was clearly a dye job the tan probably fake there was some crêping of the skin around her neck i get that a lot fox decided to reply then i was sorry to hear about your husband and im not just saying that guy i know used to work for him only had good things to say whats your friends name vince faulkner i say he worked for your husband but really he worked on the site at salamander point joanna broughton didnt say anything for a moment a lot of people liked charlie she eventually affirmed he was easy to like its when you get into trouble though that you find out who your real friends are so they say she had twisted towards him again i never caught your name it took fox a second to decide not to lie inspector malcolm fox well then inspector malcolm fox are you trying to get me to say something how do you mean fox tried for a hurt tone i didnt know charlie was going to do it i certainly didnt aid and abet and despite appearances im torn to shreds inside all of which ive repeated time and again to you and your kind she looked out of the window maybe you should drop me off here its only another five minutes i can walk that far in those heels fox exhaled noisily im sorry and i suppose youre right once youre a cop its hard to switch off the mechanism no more questions okay but at least let me drive you the rest of the way she pondered this all right she said at last actually thats ideal your colleagues want to see charlies business diary you can take it back and save me the trouble sure fox agreed happy to seebee house was a fivestorey apartment building comprising mainly steel and glass it sat within a compound of brick walls and metal security gates broughton had her own little remotecontrol box which she pressed initiating the mechanism on the gates there was an underground car park but she told fox to stop at the main door he turned off the ignition and followed her towards the building the foyer was almost as big as the ground floor of his house there were two lifts against one wall but broughton was marching over to the opposite wall where a single narrower lift stood penthouse has its own she explained as they got in sure enough when the lift doors opened again they stepped directly into a small carpeted lobby with just the one door off broughton unlocked it and fox followed her inside they call it a triplex she informed him shrugging off her coat and pushing her sunglasses up on to the crown of her head but thats a cheat one floor has nothing but a couple of terraces its still incredible fox said there was glass on three sides floor to doubleheight ceiling and views across the botanic gardens towards the castle turning to his left he could make out leith and the coastline to his right he could see as far as corstorphine hill great for entertaining joanna broughton agreed place looks brand new one of the benefits of having no children true enough and a sort of blessing too i suppose how do you mean not having to explain things to them fox watched her begin to nod her understanding the worker who died didnt have any children either what worker my friend the one i was telling you about did your husband not mention him she ignored the question and instead told him to wait while she fetched the diary fox watched her as she started climbing the glass staircase to the next floor then turned his attention to the room he was standing in it was much as he remembered it from the newspaper photo an lshaped openplan with pale stone flooring and modern furniture the kitchen area was just around the corner when he looked up he could see a landing probably with bedrooms and office off the living areas back wall the only wall made of something more substantial than glass seemed to have been stripped of its art there were still a few hooks plus holes where hooks had been removed fox remembered the newspaper article it had described brogan as a collector he took a step back and watched as joanna broughton descended the stairs taking her time holding on to the handrail she was keeping her high heels on even at home they added over an inch to her height and he wondered if that was the reason here you go she said handing over the large leatherbound diary any idea why they want it fox asked youre the detective she said you tell me he could only shrug just being thorough he guessed see if there was any unusual activity prior to your husbands he swallowed back the end of the sentence youre wondering at his state of mind i dont mind saying it again he was absolutely fine when he left here i hadnt the slightest inkling look i said i wasnt going to ask anything but but im wondering if it hurt you him not leaving a note she considered this for a moment id like to know why of course i would money worries yes but all the same we could have worked it out if hed asked im sure we could have put our heads together maybe he was too proud to ask for help she nodded slowly arms hanging loosely by her sides did he sell all his paintings fox asked into the silence she nodded again then started as the intercom sounded she walked over to it yes she demanded joanna its gordon ive got jack with me her face relaxed a little come on up she said then turning to fox thanks again for the lift id probably still be waiting there my pleasure she held out her hand and he shook it the diary was too big for any of his pockets so he carried it with him into the lobby when the lift doors opened gordon lovatt emerged momentarily surprised to find someone facing him lovatt was dressed to the nines in what looked like a bespoke threepiece pinstripe suit a gold watch chain dangled from the pockets of the waistcoat his silk tie boasted an extravagant knot and his hair looked freshly barbered he nodded a greeting but then decided more was needed gordon lovatt he said holding out his hand the two men shook i know who you are fox told him not bothering to reciprocate with an introduction the man next to lovatt was much older but dressed in what looked like an even more expensive suit he too held out his hand jack broughton he announced fox just nodded and squeezed past both men turning to face them once he was inside the lift he pressed the button for the ground floor and waited for the doors to close jack broughton seemed already to have dismissed him and was entering the penthouse greeting his only surviving child with a kiss lovatt on the other hand had stayed in the lobby to stare at fox the same enquiring look on his face going down the lifts automated female voice said the doors slid shut and fox let go of the breath hed been holding there was no sign of the pr mans car outside so hed either left it in the car park or come by taxi if the car park then he had to have some way of accessing the compound but then the same was true if hed been dropped off from a cab he still had to get past the gates so then maybe joanna had gifted her father one of the small black remotecontrol boxes fox got into his own car and placed charlie brogans diary on the passenger seat then he stared at it wondering what the grampian complaints would make of his recent activities hed been very careful all morning watching for cars tailing him for people loitering or following him it had been easy for them to keep tabs on him the previous week hed not been alerted to the probability but now he knew hed been under surveillance that made things a great deal harder for any team trying to track him then again if he was going to keep pulling stunts like this one it took him a further three or four minutes to decide but at last he picked up the diary and flipped it open he started with the monday of the previous week but found nothing immediately of interest it wasnt that brogan used a code but like most people he used initials and abbreviations the j in pm j kitchin fox assumed was joanna broughton the kitchin was a fancy restaurant in leith run by a chef with the surname kitchin there were notes of meetings but it hadnt exactly been an actionpacked week flipping back to january fox found that brogan had been far busier by february hed been reduced to noting tv shows he was planning to watch after quarter of an hour fox closed the book and turned the ignition on his way back to leith police station he made two stops one was at a stationers where he bought a padded envelope big enough to take the diary the other was at a phone shop where he bought a payasyougo mobile using his credit card if he was still under surveillance this new phone wouldnt keep him off the radar for long but maybe long enough and it was certain to annoy any complaints team when they eventually worked out what hed done he parked his car outside the police station just long enough to drop the envelope off at reception hed written max dearborns name on the front it would puzzle max perhaps but fox didnt mind that in the least back in the car his old mobile started ringing fox checked the caller id but made no attempt to answer when the ringing stopped he used his new phone and called tony kaye back whos this kaye asked not recognising the number its malcolm this is how to get me from now on youve changed phones in case theyre tracking me youre paranoid kaye paused good thinking though reckon i should do the same have they spoken to you again they grampian complaints no how about you later today so why were you calling i just wanted a moan hang on a sec fox listened as kaye moved from the complaints office to the hallway those two are driving me nuts he said its like theyve known one another since the playground other than that hows gilchrist settling in i dont like that hes sitting at your desk then offer to swap hes not having my desk then were stuck with it has mcewan been in hes not speaking to me weve piled his plate high with shit fox conceded and not even tied a bib around his neck kaye added is your afternoon grilling to be courtesy of a woman called stoddart any tips for handling her asbestos gloves malcolm great thanks fox thought for a moment can you get naysmith for me what i want a word with him but out of gilchrists earshot ill fetch him it was kayes turn to pause are you playing it cool or has it actually slipped your mind fox realised immediately what he meant have you had a chance to talk to her she hasnt been in this morning gilchrist had to fetch something from his desk at the chop shop so i went along with him and took a look i asked him if she had any meetings but he didnt know well thanks for trying im not giving up yet joe fox realised that kaye was calling from the doorway here he comes kaye said the phone was handed to naysmith its foxy fox heard kaye explain malcolm naysmith said morning joe i hear you and gilchrist are getting on famously i suppose so theres no reason why you shouldnt invite him out for a drink after work no naysmith drew the word out way past its natural length youd probably suggest minters and youd be there by five thirty right again the word took on elasticated form in naysmiths mouth no need to tell him it was my idea whats going on malcolm nothings going on joe just take him for that drink fox ended the call he had plenty of time to kill before his meeting at fettes at a newsagents he bought the evening news a salad roll and a bottle of water then headed in the general direction of inverleith parking by the north entrance to the botanics he located classic fm on the radio and ate his roll while flicking through the paper charlie brogan was no longer news and neither was vince faulkner people were foaming at the mouth about the former rbs bosss pension and perks the tram dispute had entered its eleventh hour with the council telling the contractors there was no more cash to put on the table and now the dunfermline building society was in trouble fox seemed to remember the prime minister was from dunfermline no kirkcaldy but dunfermline was in his constituency foxs parents had held an account with the dunfermline he wondered if mitch still had money there foxs own money was in the coop it was the one bank he hadnt heard anything about he wasnt sure if that was reassuring or not the piece of music finished and the announcer declared that it had been by bach fox had recognised it he recognised a lot of the tunes on classic fm without being able to name them or their composer he looked at his watch again checking that it hadnt stopped hell with it he said closing the newspaper and turning the ignition key hed just have to turn up early to his crucifixion the officer on duty at the reception desk a man fox had known for a couple of years had the good grace to apologise that he would have to take a seat fox nodded his understanding youre just following orders frank he said so fox sat down on one of the chairs and pretended an interest in his newspaper while other officers came and went most of them gave him a glance or an outright stare word had gotten around and one or two paused to offer a word of sympathy when stoddart made her entrance she was flanked by two heavyset men stoddart herself was tall and elegant with long fair hair if someone had told fox she sat on the board of a bank or corporation he wouldnt have been surprised she had a visitors pass around her neck and ordered frank to get one for fox fox took his time getting to his feet he closed his paper folded it slipped it into his pocket stoddart didnt offer to shake hands didnt even bother to introduce herself or her henchmen she handed the pass to fox and turned on her heels this way she said it wasnt a long walk fox didnt know whose office they had commandeered the bulletin board and desk gave few clues there was space for a circular coffee table and several chairs which looked to have been borrowed from the canteen on the desk sat a laptop and some cardboard folders there was another laptop on the coffee table a video camera had been fixed to a tripod and aimed at the desk sit stoddart commanded walking around to the far side of the desk one of her goons had seated himself at the coffee table the other was peering into the camera making sure it didnt need adjusting he came forward and handed fox a tiny microphone can you clip that to your lapel he asked fox did so a wire ran from the mic to the camera the officer had slipped a pair of headphones on and was checking the apparatus again testing testing fox said into the mic the man gave him the thumbsup before we get started stoddart began youll appreciate how awkward this is we dont like finding out a complaint has been made against one of our own who made the complaint fox interrupted she ignored him her eyes on the laptops screen as she spoke but these things have to be done properly so dont expect any favours inspector fox she nodded towards the cameraman who pressed a button and announced that they were rolling stoddart sat in silence for a moment as if collecting her thoughts then she announced the date and time preliminary interview she went on i am inspector caroline stoddart and i am accompanied by sergeant mark wilson and constable andrew mason which is which fox interrupted again stoddart gave him a stare constable mason is operating the camera she informed him now if youll identify yourself im inspector malcolm fox and you work for the complaints and conduct department of lothian and borders police thats right specifically the professional standards unit yes how long have you been based there four and a half years and before that i was at st leonards for three years and livingston before that this was in your drinking days ive been sober for five years didnt realise my tippling was a matter of record youve never looked at your personnel file she sounded unconvinced no he told her crossing one leg over the other in doing so he dislodged the newspaper which fell from his pocket on to the floor he stooped to pick it up stretching the microphone cord so that it came unplugged from the camera hang on mason said removing his headphones fox apologised and straightened himself his eyes on caroline stoddart having fun she asked are we speaking on the record or off her mouth twitched and she went back to checking whatever was on her computer screen your sister likes a drink too doesnt she this isnt about my sister ready mason announced stoddart took a moment to collect her thoughts again lets talk about vincent faulkner she said yes lets he was found dead on tuesday morning of last week when did you get the word to put me under surveillance he was living with your sister stoddart asked ignoring his question thats right and youd recently discovered that there had been an argument between the two of them during which her arm was broken a week ago yes what were you working on at that time not much my team had just finished expending considerable effort putting together a case against di glen heaton of c division stoddart was scrolling down a page anything else in your intray id been asked to take a look at someone this would be detective sergeant jamie breck thats right also stationed at c division yes what were the circumstances of the request my boss chief inspector mcewan had been contacted by ceop ds breck had come on to their radar and they wanted him checked out stoddart reached over to the top folder and opened it there were surveillance photos inside the same ones giles had had at torphichen bit of a conflict of interest stoddart mused youre looking at breck while hes looking into your sisters partners murder i was aware of that you didnt attempt to distance yourself from the case which case either i suppose fox gave a shrug how are things in aberdeen he asked the change of direction didnt appear to have any effect on stoddart were not here to talk about me she drawled pushing her hair back behind her ears you seem to have become friendly with ds breck in a very short space of time the relationship was always professional thats why he came to your house on wednesday night you went to a casino together it was workrelated besides ceop had asked for my assessment of ds breck yes there was a complaints van parked outside his home did you advise them they were wasting their time he headed back there eventually but you told them about the trip to the casino no fox admitted so two of your colleagues were sitting in a surveillance van on a cold february night its what we do she looked at him then back to the screen again fox enjoyed a momentary fantasy of punching his fist through it when he peered over his shoulder wilson was busy studying his own laptop is it patience youre playing there or minesweeper fox asked him wilson didnt respond ds breck stoddart was saying was at the casino because vincent faulkner might have visited it the night he died he did visit it fox corrected her and that visit was on the saturday after hed broken your sisters arm fox nodded and i didnt find out about her arm until monday mr faulkners body was found on tuesday morning thats right your sister was visited on monday evening by one of your colleagues sergeant kaye did you know that was happening no youd told him about her arm yes a phone started to ring stoddart realised it was hers she signalled for mason to pause the recording then reached into her jacket pocket one moment she advised the room getting to her feet and making for the door after shed gone fox stretched his spine feeling the vertebrae click this is interesting he commented being on the receiving end for a change so how are things in aberdeen got anything on the go the two grampian officers shared a look it was wilson who spoke grampians pretty clean these days he offered must be a nice change then visiting gomorrah have they given you a decent hotel not bad well then youll want to string this out as long as possible mason managed a smile but only for a second stoddart was coming back into the room she returned her phone to her pocket and settled back down behind the desk ready mason advised stoddart stared at fox as she began forming her next question what she asked were you just doing at the home of a woman called joanna broughton fox took a moment to collect himself i gave her a lift she was standing outside leith police station and i happened to be passing and recognised her shes just lost her husband and seemed a bit upset so i offered to drop her somewhere the room was silent until stoddart asked you expect me to believe that fox just shrugged while inwardly uttering a stream of curses she employs a public relations company stoddart went on and they got straight on the telephone screaming harassment i can assure you i did anything but harass her ask her if you like besides which its got nothing to do with any of this he knew what stoddart would say to that same thing hed have said if hed been her side of the desk and she duly obliged ill be the judge of that inspector then you say you were just passing leith police station isnt it rather a long way from anywhere not particularly so if i go asking none of the officers there will tell me they spoke with you this morning she watched fox shake his head and went back to looking at her computer again it was another three quarters of an hour before she decided theyd take a break for the rest of the day youre not thinking of heading off somewhere she asked closing the lid of her laptop a holiday or anything i wont be leaving the country he assured her as mason unclipped the microphone same time tomorrow well let you know fox nodded then thanked them and made for the door he paused with his hand on its handle one last thing he said ds breck has no inkling that hes being investigated if news leaks to him all three of you will be suspects he opened the door and closed it after him since he was in the building he climbed to the next floor removing his visitors pass and stuffing it in his pocket he walked past the door of the complaints office and headed for but there was still no one home so he returned to his old haunt peering around the door to make sure bob mcewan wasnt on the premises then he rapped against the frame with his knuckles announcing his arrival gilchrist was seated next to naysmith at the latters desk while naysmith showed him something on his computer kaye was tipped back in his chair hands behind his head fox managed not to stare at his own desk though he couldnt help catching a glimpse of gilchrists stuff scattered across it kaye got to his feet you been to the headmasters office he asked yep got a sore bottom nope kaye smiled shrugging himself back into his jacket lets go to the canteen he said out in the hallway he gripped fox by the sleeve gilchrist could bore for scotland he rolled his eyes and shook his head in exasperation then so how did it really go they didnt come up with much i wasnt expecting seemed to know about my relationship with the demon drink must be in your files somewhere meaning one of my previous bosses must have noticed but never said anything kaye made a clucking sound just hoping the problem would go away well it did they trying to say youre an alkie im not sure maybe they were told to ask what did you think of stoddart shes the ice queen wouldnt mind trying to thaw her out they had reached the canteen half a dozen people were dotted around the tables mostly staring into space as they chewed their snacks you sure you want to be seen with me fox asked maybe some of that rebel glamour will rub off on me kaye placed two mugs on a tray still havent seen hide or hair of ds inglis he admitted what did you do to her fox ignored this his old phone was buzzing so he held up a finger to let kaye know he was taking it turning away and walking towards the windows he pressed the receive button malcolm fox he said its dearborn max can i assume youve got something for me my boss is apoplectic he gets a call from gordon lovatt complaining about a d division cop called fox the only fox anyone has heard of is you and when lovatt is given the description he says its spoton after wed had our little chat fox explained i saw joanna broughton looking up and down the street for a nonexistent taxi she seemed a bit distraught so i offered her a lift she must have assumed i was stationed in leith so it was you she gave her husbands diary to happy to help max fox listened as dearborn expelled some air kaye had taken the tray to one of the tables having added two chocolate bars to his purchases he was already unwrapping one of them is there anything else fox asked into the phone any news of charlie brogan give me a break dearborn muttered hanging up fox called him straight back one last thing he said by way of warning grampian complaints may come sniffing around best if you dont tell them we shared breakfast youre bad news fox tell me about it fox managed to end the call before dearborn could then went over to the table and seated himself opposite kaye he tried to work out if hed been bought tea or coffee the look and aroma werent giving much away kaye had stopped chewing he was looking over foxs shoulder when fox turned his head he saw why mason and wilson had just entered the canteen bugger kaye said through a mouthful of chocolate fox however waved the two men over they seemed to discuss it for a moment then shook their heads and took a table as far away from foxs as possible each man had opted for a bottle of still water and a piece of fresh fruit theyre bound to tell stoddart kaye commented nobodys banned us from seeing one another tony its not like we have asbos or anything you can say you were already here the whole thing just a chance meeting she wont believe it but shell have to accept it same as we would if we were doing her job im a bollockhair away from joining you on the subs bench you havent done anything wrong tony but im like you foxy guilty until proven otherwise and all because everybody hates us do you want this fox was offering kaye the spare chocolate bar kaye took it and put it in his pocket and answer me something what the hell is it were drinking kaye stared down at his mug i thought it was tea but youre not sure maybe i asked for coffee having handed his pass back to frank at the front desk fox went out to the car park he passed his own volvo and kept walking there were spaces at the furthest corner of the compound next to the playing fields they were marked for the use of visitors and that was where he found the black astra and the green ka parked side by side the stickers on their back windows identified them as having been bought at garages in aberdeen there was a freshlooking graze to the metallic paintwork on the ka and fox hoped that local traffic was to blame he returned to his own car exited the car park and crawled up the long steep slope back into town until he reached queen street an auction house had its headquarters there and fox seemed to remember they specialised in paintings he didnt have any trouble finding a parking bay drivers were either counting the pennies or else had been dissuaded from coming into town by the tram works fox put a pound coin in the parking meter attached the sticker to his windscreen and headed inside there was a long counter in the main reception area and at the end of it a couple of windows resembling the tellers positions in a bank a customer was standing at one of the windows writing out a cheque for a recent purchase can i help the woman behind the counter asked i hope so fox said im a police officer in lieu of a warrant card he offered her one of his printed business cards they were about three years out of date but looked nice and official ive got a problem im hoping one of your experts can help me with the woman having studied his card asked him to wait while she fetched someone the man who eventually appeared was younger than fox had been expecting he wore a pinstriped shirt and pale yellow tie and shook hands vigorously introducing himself as alfie rennison his voice was educated scots he too was pleased to receive one of foxs business cards what is it i can do for you rennison asked its about some paintings modern or classical modern i think rennison lowered his voice fakes he hissed nothing like that fox assured him the young man looked relieved it happens you know he said keeping his voice low people try to offload all kinds of stuff on us follow me will you he led fox towards the back of the premises until they reached a stairwell a red rope provided the sole deterrent to anyone wishing to descend to the next level and rennison unhooked it long enough for both men to pass through fox followed him down into the bowels of the building which proved far less grand than the public areas they squeezed past canvases stacked against walls and manoeuvred between busts and statues and grandfather clocks sale coming up rennison explained viewings next week they reached his office which consisted of two rooms knocked into one fox had believed them below ground but there were frosted windows albeit barred on the outside this was somebodys house at one time rennison was saying im guessing the kitchen laundry and servants quarters would have been down here four upper storeys of georgian elegance but with the engine room hidden below he smiled and gestured for fox to take a seat rennisons desk was disappointingly bland fox reckoned it was an ikea kitbuild on it sat a laptop computer hooked up to a laser printer there was only one painting in the whole room it measured about six inches by four and sat on the wall behind rennisons chair exquisite isnt it a french plage by peploe i can hardly bear to part with it fox knew next to nothing about art but he liked the thick swirls of paint they reminded him of melting ice cream is it going into the sale rennison nodded should fetch fifty to sixty thousand fox gazed at the work with new respect mixed with a stunned sense that this was a world he was going to have trouble comprehending rennison had clasped his hands together elbows on the desk so tell me about these paintings have you heard of a man called charles brogan alas yes the latest victim of our challenging times but you knew of him before he drowned rennison was nodding there are several auction houses in the city inspector we work hard to maintain a clients fidelity youre saying he bought from you and from some of the citys actual galleries rennison felt dutybound to add youve seen his collection much of it had he started selling it off rennison studied him resting his chin against the tips of his fingers might i ask why youre interested were looking into the reasons why he would kill himself you mentioned finances and its just that mr brogans decision to sell his paintings might chime with that theory rennison nodded to himself happy with this explanation some pieces he sent to london some he sold here three or four are actually consigned to our next auction naturally well hold them back until we know what his estate wants us to do how many are we talking about in total rennison did a quick calculation fourteen or fifteen worth fox prompted rennison puffed out his cheeks half a million maybe before the recession it would have been closer to seven fifty i hope he didnt buy at the height of the market unfortunately mostly he did he was selling at a loss meaning he was desperate i would say so fox thought for a moment have you ever met mr brogans wife she accompanied him to a sale once i dont think it was an experience she was keen to repeat not an artlover then not in so many words fox smiled and started getting to his feet thanks for taking the trouble to talk to me mr rennison my pleasure inspector as they shook hands fox took a final look at the peploe youre thinking of melted ice cream rennison guessed then seeing the look on foxs face youre by no means the first fifty grand buys a lot of cornettos fox told the man maybe so but what would their resale value be inspector rennison led the way back to the ground floor fox was parked fifty yards from minters when naysmith and gilchrist arrived theyd come by taxi obviously intending to have more than just the one drink no driving home for either of them fox gave it another twenty minutes by which time kaye too had arrived parking on a double yellow and slapping his police sign on the windscreen he was checking messages on his phone as he headed inside fox was listening to radio tapping his fingers on the steering wheel in time to the music but when a quiz was announced two listeners vying for the star prize he switched channels there was some local news so he listened to that without taking much of it in more economic grief more trams grief a spell of good weather imminent the travel report warned of long tailbacks on the forth road bridge and eastbound on the ring road and the city centre is its usual rushhour mayhem the report concluded fox felt snug in the parked car cosseted from chaos but the time came to turn off the radio and get out hed finally plucked up the courage to send annie inglis a text message hope u can forgive me wd like us b pals he wasnt sure now about the pals bit he was attracted to her but had never had much luck with women elaine excepted and even that had proved to be a mistake maybe it wasnt annie who intrigued him but rather the combination of the woman and the career she had chosen for the past halfhour hed been hoping she might send a return message or call him and as he pushed open the door to the pub his old phone started buzzing he plucked it from his pocket and pressed it to his ear hello its me the voice said annie thanks for getting back to me he had retreated to the pavement narrowly avoiding a pedestrian look i just wanted you to know how sorry i am about what happened yesterday i know i was stupid well im sorry i blew up at you maybe i wasnt thinking straight duncan had got me wound up as usual fox waited for more but she had come to a stop doesnt mean i wasnt in the wrong he said into the silence and i really enjoyed the meal and seeing you and everything maybe i can repay the favour cook for me you mean the word cook may be a bit strong when she laughed a weight fell from him but im an expert on the local carryouts okay she said well see any night this week is good for me ill let you know malcolm she paused thats duncan coming home i came looking for you to apologise in person fox told her at fettes i thought you were suspended grampian complaints had me in for a chat youve a lot you should be focusing on malcolm maybe we should give this week a miss youd be doing me a favour annie honestly okay then let me think about it ive got to go now say hello to duncan for me tell him i want to know what music he buys with that token trust me you wont want to hear any of it the phone went dead and fox managed a smile as he stared at its tiny glowing screen then the screen went dark and he took a deep breath adjusting his demeanour before walking into the pub tony kaye saw him first kaye wasnt at the usual table but the one next to it giving naysmith and gilchrist some space to themselves he had been reading the evening paper but with little apparent interest in it his eyebrows lifted when he saw fox but then he bounded to his feet and reached the bar before him let me get this one he stated delving into his trouser pocket for money glad to see me fox asked you better believe it i feel like the spare prick at an orgy he twitched his head in the direction of the corner table half the stuff they drone on about i cant understand and the other half bores the knackers off me he paused and stared at fox just passing by were you actually i wanted a word with gilchrist kaye thought about this thats why you spoke to naysmith hes baited the trap for you fox just shrugged and asked the landlord for a tomato juice the man nodded and brought a bottle from the glassfronted fridge shaking it vigorously before pouring did you see deal or no deal he asked not waiting for an answer dealt at seventeen and a half had the hundred grand he shook his head at the idiocy of some people i love it when they lose kaye commented handing over the money and asking for a halfpint for himself remember youre driving fox chided him pint and a half thats all im having all the office needs now is for you to fail a breathalyser mcewan would have a seizure besides which are you sure you can trust gilchrist not to clype kaye gave a snort but changed his order to orange and lemonade naysmith and gilchrist were watching them as they approached the table with their drinks kaye moved the newspaper and seated himself fox took the chair closest to gilchrist all right lads he asked noting that gilchrist was near to finishing his first gin and tonic of the evening settling in are you look i know its awkward fox cut gilchrist off with a wave of his hand im fine with it none of its your fault is it it sounded like a rhetorical question but foxs eyes told a different story gilchrist held the mans gaze then shook his head slowly no he eventually said no fox echoed so thats all right then makes things hard on ds inglis though he took a sip of tomato juice yes gilchrist agreed bit sudden too the way you were plucked from the chop shop they knew i was keen to try something different gilchrist paused its only temporary after all course it is kaye stressed while naysmith nodded along fox smiled at the show of support but his eyes were still on gilchrist whats happening about jamie breck he asked gilchrist gave a shrug has the aussie inquiry started crumbling far as i know they think theyve got enough so theyll be bringing the main suspect to trial fox nodded his understanding but what about his clients gilchrist gave another shrug i can do a bit of digging if you like fox reached over and patted gilchrist on his thigh dont worry about it youre in the complaints now youve got different fish to fry same again fox signalled to the glasses on the table thanks malcolm naysmith said but gilchrist was shaking his head i was only staying for the one he explained this seemed to come as news to naysmith but gilchrist was draining his glass meeting someone in town he was already rising to his feet see you all tomorrow eh not me fox reminded him no but good luck you think i need it gilchrist didnt answer this he was pulling on his thermal jacket fox reached out and grabbed him by the arm who was it pulled the surveillance on breck you got the call who was it on the other end of the line gilchrist wrestled the arm free his jaw clenched with a wave in naysmiths direction he was gone did you get what you wanted kaye asked fox im not sure naysmith was holding his empty pint glass kronenberg please he told fox buy your own you little quisling malcolm fox replied is it all right if i come in fox asked it was nine in the evening and he was standing on jamie brecks doorstep breck had just opened the door to him and was wearing an opennecked polo shirt and green chinos with socks but no shoes on his feet if its inconvenient fox continued his voice trailing off its fine breck eventually conceded annabels at her place tonight he turned and padded back down the short hallway into the living room by the time fox got there breck had switched on some of the lamps the tv was off and so was the stereo i was on the internet breck seemed to feel it necessary to explain bit bored to be honest with you playing quidnunc how did you guess four or five hours today breck paused maybe longer actually fox nodded and settled himself on the sofa hed been home and tried to eat a ready meal giving up halfway through i had a talk with the grampian complaints he said how did it go it went they want to see me in the morning a woman called stoddart youll be fine breck fell into one of the armchairs sure about that has annabel come up with anything you mean about vince faulkner breck gave a twitch of the mouth seems to be getting nowhere instead of ploughing on giles is going over old ground seeing if the teams missed something its a lazy strategy fox commented they got access to the footage from the casino and breck shrugged no sign of faulkner on any of it but guess what there were gaps in the recording someone had tampered with it a glitch according to the management just as you predicted was joanna broughton there to explain matters breck shook his head she was nowhere to be seen it was the guy behind the bar hes obviously had a promotion plus someone from lovatt meikle meldrum whats it got to do with them their client had asked them to be present i told you malcolm she doesnt want anything tarnishing the olivers rep breck broke off sorry i should have asked if you wanted a drink im fine fox assured him the two men sat in silence for a moment might as well spit it out breck said with the thinnest of smiles what somethings eating you fox looked at him how do i know i can trust you breck gave a shrug i get the feeling you need to trust someone fox rubbed a finger across his forehead hed spent the past hour and a half thinking much the same thing maybe ill have that drink he said playing for time water will do breck was already on his feet and heading out of the room fox looked around barely taking his surroundings in it had been a long day dearborn and broughton stoddart and gilchrist breck was coming back with the tumbler fox accepted it with a nod his stomach felt full of acid his eyes stung when he blinked and there was a persistent throbbing at his temples do you need an aspirin or something breck was asking fox shook his head you look shattered im guessing not all of it courtesy of inspector stoddart theres something im going to tell you fox blurted out but im not sure how youre going to take it breck hadnt quite sat down instead he rested his weight against the arm of his chair in your own time he coaxed fox took another sip the water had a slightly sweet aftertaste reminding him of the way tap water had tasted in his childhood on a hot day after running around outside youve been under investigation he stated avoiding eye contact up to and including surveillance breck thought for a few seconds then nodded slowly that van he said yes i sort of knew about that and about you too of course the two men fixed eyes you seemed to know a bit too much about me malcolm remember when i told you my brother was gay you said you didnt know but that meant you knew i had a brother in the first place then when you came round here you couldnt really explain how you knew my street he paused i was hoping you might eventually get round to saying something and here i am i thought maybe you were trying to tie me to glen heaton we werent what then breck sounded genuinely curious your name appeared on a list jamie subscribers to a website what sort of website fox angled his head so he was staring at the ceiling i shouldnt be doing this he muttered bit late for that breck told him then what sort of website not the sort youd want annabel knowing about porn brecks voice had risen a little s and m snuff underage breck was silent for a moment until a laugh of incredulity exploded from his mouth you paid by credit card fox went on so ceop had us run a check when did all this start beginning of last week i started backing off once wed met face to face breck had slid from the arm of the chair into the seat itself my credit card he asked then he sprang up and left the room returning a minute later with a folder he held it over the coffee table and tipped out its contents crouching down to sift through everything there were bank statements receipts mortgage letters and credit card statements fox couldnt help noting that brecks savings account was well into five figures breck himself was plucking out the credit card statements australian dollars most likely fox explained theres nothing here breck was running a finger down the columns he used his card a lot supermarkets petrol stations restaurants clothing companies plus his internet and tv packages wait a second he said the tip of his finger was running along one entry us dollars not australian ten dollars translates as eight pounds fox looked at the description seil ents he read i never paid any attention breck was almost talking to himself sometimes i buy downloads from the states is this it do you think have you bought anything else in dollars recently this goes back five weeks i swear to god malcolm breck was wideeyed he broke off from staring at the sheet of paper and got back to his feet come on theres something i want to show you he left the room fox following him they entered what would have been the homes second bedroom this was brecks office the computer was switched on the screensaver active breck nudged the mouse his chosen wallpaper was a headandshoulders photo of annabel sit down he was commanding fox indicating the swivel chair take a look for yourself i doubt ive browsed online porn more than half a dozen times in my life and never anything i mean just the normal stuff look jamie breck spun around to face him i dont know anything about this he shouted i believe you fox said quietly breck stared at him right because you had that van parked outside he ran a hand through his hair you were tapped into my system somehow no not you not you personally you were with me at the oliver that night some of your guys right and someone from ceop too his names gilchrist hes got his feet under my desk at the complaints brecks eyes narrowed as he digested this weve got to talk to him find out how this could have happened fox nodded slowly i had a word with him earlier on but he wasnt exactly cooperating i need to talk to someone about this breck was saying then eyes boring into fox all the time weve been and i let you and you thought i was a paedophile fox couldnt think of anything to say to this breck had taken a couple of steps towards the window and was peering around the edge of the blind it was just the one night fox explained we were planning another but it got pulled ceops decision breck turned to look at him why i dont know they realised it was a mistake fox offered a shrug breck ran his hand through his hair again this is a fucking nightmare he said youve met annabel ive got a girlfriend sometimes they do paedophiles you mean fox could see that brecks mind was racing you had a van watching me its like the gestapo or something one thing the equipment in the van picked up breck looked at him what you did some online digging into me breck thought for a moment then nodded slowly thats true he said then he fell silent staring at the computer screen whats the site called he eventually asked weve got to contact them find out how it happened thats the last thing you want to do fox cautioned they got my credit card number how is that possible its possible fox argued youve said it yourself you buy stuff online do you pay a subscription to quidnunc because if you do your card details are out there this is a nightmare breck repeated staring blindly at the walls around him i need a drink he fled the room leaving fox standing there fox waited a moment then scrutinised the icons on the computer screen he saw nothing out of the ordinary quidnunc had been minimised and he put it back on to full screen brecks avatar seemed to be a muscular blond warrior toting a complicatedlooking handgun he was standing in a valley surrounded by mountains beyond which explosions were going off fighter jets or spaceships occasionally flying over his hair fluttered in the breeze but otherwise he would stand there until breck came back to the game fox hit the minimise icon again and left the room jamie breck was in his kitchen it was spotless but fox had the feeling the place got used there was a fruit bowl filled with oranges and plums and a breadboard with half a wholemeal loaf sitting on it breck had brought ice cubes from the freezer and was pouring whisky over them there are occasions he said voice trembling slightly when only local remedies will do he waved the bottle in foxs direction but fox shook his head it was highland park hed tried it plenty of times in the past soft peat and sea spray breck downed half the drink without pausing he squeezed shut his eyes and opened his mouth in a loud exhalation foxs nostrils flared yes that was the tang he remembered this isnt happening breck said im being fasttracked everybody knows it another year and ill be a di thats what your file seemed to say breck nodded and thats how you knew all about me youd seen it in my personnel file his eyes fixed on fox so why own up now malcolm fox poured himself another glass of tap water you said it yourself jamie i need somebody i can trust and you think thats me breck waited until fox had nodded well thanks for that at least or does it just mean im your very last hope thing is jamie theres a lot going on that im not even close to understanding i think maybe you can help what youre saying is me being a suspected paedophile is the least of your worries and my girlfriend could come in useful along the way fox managed a smile something like that yes breck gave a snort as he smiled into his drink well at least we know where we stand is there any point in me contacting my credit card company they must be able to trace the transaction back fox offered a shrug worth a try he said meantime i can run a check on seil ents a word of caution the guy behind the site is a cop in australia theyre on to him but they definitely dont want him to know that if he finds out and shuts everything down therell be some who might think id warned him off breck nodded slowly how near are they to nailing him i dont really know can you find out fox nodded and ill make sure annabel keeps in touch with billy giles and all his doings does that sound fair fox gave another nod and watched breck hold up a finger but i dont want annabel to know about this she wont hear it from me fox promised does stoddart know breck asked yes but i dont want to let her know that i know thats up to you jamie theyd realise it was you who told me and that would look even worse for us true breck had turned round so that the small of his back rested against the edge of the black marble work surface the glass was still in his hand half an inch of liquid left in it look at the pair of us he said with another tired smile and then raising his glass in a toast but thanks for taking me into your trust malcolm better late than never he tipped the glass to his mouth finishing the whisky and tossing the ice into the sink so he said smacking his lips do you have a particular plan of action in mind im the one who thinks stuff just happens to us remember its you that thinks we control our destinies seems to me youre in the process of changing speaking of changing fox lifted a card from his pocket and handed it over ive bought myself a new mobile phone you think i should do the same breck studied the card foxs old mobile number had been scored out and the new one written in biro he looked up at fox the complaints can tap my phone not easily but they can grab the records of any calls in or out you said they rather than we fox didnt say anything to this and breck was thoughtful for a further few seconds why am i being set up malcolm he asked quietly whod do something like that an australian porn site he shook his head slowly it doesnt make any sense it will fox stated straightening his shoulders we just need to work at it tuesday february tuesday morning fox was waiting for annie inglis outside her tenement duncan appeared first slouching his way to school under the weight of his backpack ten minutes later it was ingliss turn fox seated across the road in his car sounded his horn and waved her across traffic was busy people on their way to work or dropping their kids off at the school gates a warden had paused his scooter beside foxs car but had scuttled off again when he saw that the indicators were flashing and there was someone behind the steering wheel annie inglis stood her ground for a moment and when she did cross the road she didnt get into the car instead she leaned down so her face was at the passengerside window fox slid the window down what are you doing here she asked he handed her a business card on the back of which was written the number of his new mobile phone thats in case you need to reach me he explained but keep it to yourself then i need a favour annie look malcolm it would be easier to talk if you got in i can even give you a lift i dont need a lift when he made no answer to this she sighed and opened the door hed removed the sweetwrappers from the passenger seat there was a street map on the floor which she handed to him he tossed it into the back is it to do with jamie breck she asked gilchrists being obstructive youre suspended malcolm its not his job to help you out all the same she gave another heavy sigh what is it you want a contact at the australian end someone from the team there name phone number email anything at all really do i get to ask why not yet she looked at him her work face differed from the one she wore at home there was a little more makeup it hardened her features theyre going to know it was me she stated she didnt mean the cops in australia she meant fettes ill say it wasnt thats all right then after all theres no reason for them not to take you at your word is there no reason at all he said with a smile annie inglis opened her door and started to get out she was still holding his business card whats the matter with your old phone she asked then no on second thoughts i really dont want to know she closed the door after her and crossed the road again unlocking her own car it took fox five minutes to drive to the café on morningside road but another five to find a parking space he put enough coins in the meter for an hour and walked the short distance to his destination jamie breck was already there plugging his laptop into one of the power sockets next to the corner table hed secured just got here he told fox as the two men shook hands how are you feeling i didnt get much sleep thanks to your confession foxs mouth twitched at the word he shrugged off his coat and asked what breck wanted to drink americano with a spot of milk fox did the ordering adding a cappuccino for himself anything to eat he asked breck maybe a croissant make that two fox told the assistant by the time he got back to the table breck had angled the laptop so that the low sun wouldnt hit the screen fox drew a chair round to brecks side of the table this had been foxs idea and looking around at the other customers he felt vindicated even if someone was outside in a surveillance van and hed taken a good look spotting no obvious candidates there were half a dozen people in the café logged on to the internet courtesy of the free wifi most looked like students the others business people naysmith had told him once how hard it was to untangle one user from another in such a cluster so what is it were looking for breck asked he looked and sounded businesslike the shock of the previous night assimilated and squeezed into a compartment in his mind something you said a while back fox began leaning forward in his chair youve come across the pr company before breck nodded lovatt meikle meldrum have a lobbying arm he got online and searched the firms name coming up with the home page of their website a further couple of clicks later he was showing fox a photographic portrait the man was bald and bulletheaded and smiling paul meldrum lmms political mr fixit i was telling you about the local councillor paul here bent my ear about it he said he was representing the council who was the councillor ernie wishaw ive never heard of him he runs a lorry business out by the gyle whats he supposed to have done one of his drivers was delivering a few packages too many dope breck nodded drug enforcement got him and hes due to serve five years but they wondered how far up the ladder things went wishaw had a meeting at the oliver with the drivers brotherinlaw dea reckoned maybe it was hush money to be given to the wife if she was kept sweet the driver wouldnt go blabbing how come you got involved dea wanted local knowledge their boss was tight with billy giles so they got us fox frowned was glen heaton part of the team breck nodded up until then i hadnt really doubted him something changed your mind breck offered a shrug i think they were on to us from the start dont ask me why it was just a feeling i got so you werent surprised when there was nothing from the olivers cctv no breck agreed fox took a sip of coffee how long ago did you say this was best part of six months it never came up breck looked as if he didnt quite understand fox enlightened him wed been looking into glen heaton for nearly a year and this is the first ive heard of it breck shrugged again he didnt do anything wrong you could have voiced your suspicions seemed to me you were doing fine on your own and like i say id nothing to back them up breck reached for his own drink then changed his mind and bit into a croissant instead brushing crumbs from his trousers fox stared at the photo of paul meldrum the drugsmuggling had nothing to do with the council fox stated how come lmm got involved good question did you ask it at the time ernie wishaw had bought out a rival firm a few years earlier it all got a bit ugly and he used lmm to win round the media both men looked up as a new customer entered the café but she was pushing a baby buggy so they dismissed her when they made eye contact they shared a smile better safe than sorry so they might have been working for him personally rather than the council fox asked jamie breck could only shrug once more anyway the whole thing ended up going nowhere dea dropped it and thanked us for our help fox concentrated on his breakfast until he thought of something else to say youre not the only one who was under surveillance jamie the deputy chief constable let slip that id been watched all last week but vinces body wasnt found until tuesday morning it takes a bit of time to decide that a cop might be breaking the rules and you should put a watch on him how long did it take till you decided i merited the van not long fox conceded but thats beside the point i was being watched before i started misbehaving then theres something youre obviously hiding from everybody im honest as the day is long ds breck this is winter inspector fox the days are pretty short fox ignored this in the interview room at torphichen when traynor was spelling it all out and billy giles was trying hard not to do a little dance around the table there was a look my boss gave me mcewan fox nodded i dont think he knew i mean he knew but he hadnt been in the loop for long he was asking himself what was going on maybe he can find out for you maybe you dont trust him hard to know but heres the thing the tail on me coincides with the new assignment id been given by assignment you mean me yes the caffeine was getting to fox he could feel it pounding through him when his mobile started ringing he didnt recognise the tone it was the first time someone had called him on his new phone hello he answered ive got something for you annie inglis said she was speaking so softly he could hardly hear her he held the phone more firmly to his ear and pressed a finger into his other ear is there anybody else there he asked no then why are you whispering do you want this or not she asked sounding irritated then without waiting for his answer she reeled off a phone number hang on he said scrabbling for a pen and brushing flakes of croissant from the paper napkin on his plate while she repeated the number fox jotted it down her names dawlish cecilia dawlish inglis ended the call before fox could utter any form of thanks whats the code for australia he asked breck it took breck thirty seconds and a few keystrokes to come up with the answer zerozerosixone he said theyre eight to ten hours ahead of us fox looked at his watch meaning its evening there and hellish expensive he held up his new phone this is payasyougo he explained my treat breck responded handing over his own motorola they might be able to trace the number back to you fox warned him but breck just shrugged im not the one making the call though am i he countered it turned out that the number inglis had given fox was for a mobile dawlish was in her car when she answered its detective constable gilchrist here fox explained concentrating his attention on the world outside the café window yeah ceop edinburgh you had us looking into a local officer called breck yeah is this a bad time to talk im headed home dc gilchrist what is it you need ive been put in charge of the paperwork just bear in mind what we told you at the start the more who know about this the tougher it is to keep it quiet understood fox paused so youve not arrested him yet well let you know when that happens right fox said turning his attention to the listening breck so what is it you want us to do with breck just get us anything you can now tell me about these bloody forms youre filling in just wondered if it was okay to put you down as our main contact sure and this phone number seems to be the one youve got i suppose so yes fox thought of something we managed to gain entry to brecks home yeah his computer was clean but we took a look at his latest credit card bill seil ents thats the one what do the letters stand for the bastards initials simeon edward ian latham sim to his mates the payment was in us dollars hes got an account in the caribbean lathams been running this thing for years without us knowing hes learned all the old tricks and invented a few of his own dawlish paused this is a secure line right gilchrist absolutely fox assured her and thanks for your help paperworks killing this job dawlish commented ending the call fox stared at jamie breck far as the aussies are concerned youre still in the frame thanks for not setting the record straight thing is jamie we did one nights surveillance on you and the second night was pulled thinking seemed to be that the aussies didnt need you any more or had crossed your name off their list when i spoke to gilchrist last night he as good as said the same thing sim latham was headed for trial and hes not inquirys ongoing according to dawlish so why did gilchrist tell you different maybe we should ask him i can go solo on this breck said if youd rather keep out of it but fox shook his head before attacking the final chunk of croissant are we done here breck asked tapping the edge of his laptops screen fox glanced at his watch fifteen minutes left on the meter theres one final thing he said and that computer of yours could come in handy he wiped the pastry crumbs from his mouth something i asked you when we were at the pool hall yes i asked if charlie brogan could have been one of the developers we can take a look breck said busying himself at the keyboard within a couple of minutes he had found enough information to confirm that cbbj was indeed part of the consortium cb stands for charles brogan fox commented but what about bj broughton joanna breck guessed that makes sense i suppose fox was peering at the screen i got a look at his diary you know what breck was staring at him brogans diary joanna broughton asked me to drop it into leith police station fox paused its a long story breck folded his arms ive got time partner i recognised her when she was standing outside the station offered her a lift home to the penthouse fox nodded triplex actually you were inside she knew you were a cop fox kept nodding leith wanted to see brogans appointments diary she asked me if id take it breck was chuckling its always the quiet ones you have to watch out for i cant believe you got away with it i didnt on the way out i bumped into gordon lovatt she told him who i was and he got on to leith who got on to di stoddart and her merry men breck gave a low whistle then was thoughtful for a moment was the diary worth the effort he eventually asked not really work was drying up for charlie brogan he spent more time planning what tv shows to watch than scheduling meetings fox paused to collect his thoughts think it through though vince faulkner works on one of brogans projects hes last seen in a casino owned by brogans other half he winds up dead and his bodys dumped at yet another site owned by brogans company then just to put some icing on top brogan goes for a swim in the forth and doesnt bother coming up for air breck was rubbing the stubble on the underside of his chin you should take this to billy giles oh sure fox replied because im dead sure dci giles would take me seriously breck had opened his mouth but fox stilled him with a gesture of the hand and you can hardly go to him with it because youre his little judas so where exactly does that leave us when breck didnt answer fox glanced at his watch again i need to put more money in the meter he said lets finish up here and ill come with you breck had already started shutting down the laptop fox noticed that hed left most of his coffee untouched where are we going he asked back to salamander point they used the same portakabin as before breck had asked the site manager what would happen now that the developer was dead we keep working until were ordered to stop or the wages dry up the man had replied but malcolm fox had noticed some changes the sales office was locked shut no sign of life inside and once theyd climbed the ladder to the upper level of temporary offices he could see that over to one side of the site an impromptu game of football was in progress piles of bricks substituting for goalposts when ronnie hendry arrived he was sweating and breathing hard were waiting for a delivery of readymix he explained removing his hard hat and wiping a sleeve across his face breck gestured for him to sit at the table the three men were then positioned as before fox maintaining his silence just a couple of followup questions breck was telling hendry how have things been since charlie brogan jumped ship hendry stared at him wondering how to react to the pun but breck remained stonyfaced the men are worried about pay day your gaffer just said much the same thing hes got more at stake money he makes for standing around all day with his dick in his hand and not a clue in his head you sound aggrieved hendry wriggled in his chair not really but he folded his arms across his chest a defensive gesture in foxs eyes you any closer to finding out who killed vince we think the why might help answer that but meantime i wanted to ask about mr brogan whats he got to do with it well now that hes gone the same way as vince faulkner brecks voice drifted off but theres no connection hendry stated eyes shifting from one detective to the other is there we cant know that for sure im assuming mr brogan visited salamander point he was pretty handson hendry agreed how often did you see him maybe once a week twice a week sometimes gaffer would be able to say for sure but its you im asking did he just sit in here with a mug of tea and the plans spread out in front of him hendry shook his head he liked to give the whole site a good looksee so youd have met him then spoke to him a few times he always had a couple of questions seemed like a good guy not all developers are how do you mean hendry shifted in the chair again some jobs ive worked on they turn up wearing pinstripe suits and shiny brogues one or two from cbbj were that way inclined but mr brogan with him it was work boots and jeans and he always shook your hand without brushing the dirt off after hendry was nodding slowly at the memory like i say a good guy did vince faulkner think the same never said any different not to me he met brogan too hendry nodded again mr brogan knew most of the guys by name and he remembered who you were there was always some detail or other hed toss into the conversation gleaned from the personnel files fox interrupted hendry turned his head towards him maybe he said how often did the two of them meet breck asked drawing hendrys attention back to him it took the man a few seconds to answer dont know he eventually stated you see what were getting at breck persisted not really if the two of them knew one another well you add vince faulkners death to anything else happening in mr brogans life and he goes and tops himself hendry seemed to consider this he offered a shrug his arms still folded last time we spoke breck continued you said you sometimes went out for the evening a meal and some drinks at the oliver casino right you knew it was owned by mr brogans wife sure ever see him there probably you cant be sure hendry had unfolded his arms and was pressing his palms against his thighs preparing to stand up ive got to get back to work he said whats the rush theres nothing i can tell you about charlie brogan or why he decided to end it all he was on his feet now and readying to put his yellow hard hat back on breck got up from the table too maybe were not finished he said youre clutching at straws hendry stated youve hit a wall with vince so youre focusing on brogan instead but theres no connection between the two youre sure of that definitely what makes you such an expert mr hendry hendry glared at him he seemed to try half a dozen answers for size dismissing each of them in turn with a cold smile he opened the door and exited the portakabin fox closed the door and rested his weight against it eyes on breck well breck asked him about three quarters of the way through breck was nodding hed been cagey enough before that but he started holding back i wonder why might be different if we were talking to him at torphichen maybe having cautioned him first but we cant do that can we fox shrugged his agreement they moved out of the room and on to the wooden walkway hendry was clambering over foundations and lengths of pipe and ducting heading back to the football game the sun had come out and a few of the men were now topless makes you proud fox commented temperatures halfway to double figures but at the slightest glimmer of sunshine the scotsman in his prime breck agreed as he started back down the ladder they were leaving the site when a car pulled up two men climbing out breck cursed under his breath dickson and hall he muttered i know the faces fox confirmed they were torphichen cid bad billy giless men both were smiling without a trace of humour between them well well dickson said he was the older and heavier of the two his partner was as foxs father would have put it twa ply o reek but with a shaven head and raybans what brings you here breck asked hinting to fox at their strategy here namely brazen it out dickson managed a chuckle as he slid his hands into his trouser pockets thats more than a bit rich jamie but since you ask hall took his cue billy giles has got us retracing your steps hes worried you might have left gaps in the paperwork or maybe tweaked your reports he angled his head slightly to take in malcolm fox with a bit of help from inspector fox here youre wasting your time breck stated and yet here you are jamie the pair of you dickson said leaning forward a little from the waist and reminding fox of one of those toddlers toys that you could rock to and fro without them ever falling over and youll be reporting all of this back of course breck was saying you think we shouldnt hall asked feigning amazement last i heard you two were suspended from duty so so it begs the question what could you possibly be doing here im in the market for a flat fox interrupted and if you ever watch those property shows on tv youll know its advisable to bring a friend to the viewing they can spot things you might miss billy giles told us you were a smartarse dickson leaned a little further forward without shifting his stance remember me fox you had a few questions for me about glen heaton and you thought you were doing him a favour not answering any of them a grin spread across dicksons face thats right he said thing is though fox confided as soon as we sussed he had friends like you we knew he had to be dirty he turned towards breck were done here but as he made to move past dickson the man stuck a hand out into his chest fox grabbed the hand and yanked it sharply downwards the rest of the body following he watched as dickson dropped to the ground the mud was crusted on the surface but wet just beneath hall was helping his colleague to his feet dickson swearing and spluttering and wiping his face clean were done fox repeated without bothering to look at breck knowing hed be following he made his way to the waiting car they drove in silence for the first halfmile or so fox was behind the steering wheel breck in the passenger seat eventually breck found the right form of words for what he wanted to say what was that all about what back there you and dickson just wanted to check his centre of gravity jamie didnt think hed go down so easily fox made eye contact then gave a wink breck smiled but he was shaking his head its not the way to play dickson and hall thats two enemies for life right there it was worth it fox stated suddenly youre action man some of us dont have avatars to fall back on breck turned his attention to the world outside the car where are we going my sisters does she live in an underground bunker she lives in saughtonhall might not be protection enough billy giles is going to want to talk to us talk at us you mean okay but hes going to haul us in if we dont go to him first youre the guy who likes to take risks and show initiative and thats what you were doing back there was i being passive not really breck managed a shortlived laugh so why are we going to see your sister youll see but when they got there jude wasnt at home fox rang the bell next door and alison pettifer answered she had an apron tied around her and was wiping her hands on a towel sorry fox said is jude with you she went to the shops pettifer looked up and down the road here she comes now jude had seen them but couldnt wave with one arm still in plaster and the other holding a full shopping bag fox thanked pettifer and went to meet his sister taking the bag from her what have you got in here he asked coal just some food she smiled at him reckoned it was time i learned to fetch for myself fox thought of something how are you doing for money she gave him a look youre already paying for dads care home theres some to spare if you need it im fine for now but she leaned her head in towards his shoulder her way of saying thanks then i seem to know him they were walking up the path towards her front door where jamie breck was waiting ds breck fox explained he was on the inquiry team was long story breck greeted jude with a slight bow of the head as she unlocked the door lucky i got some coffee she told both men in you come then fox told her hed help put the shopping away but she shooed him off i can manage and she did filling the kettle and switching it on placing her purchases in the fridge or a cupboard then she spooned coffee into three mugs and poured on the boiling water adding milk when all three were seated in the tidied living room fox asked her how she was doing im managing malcolm as you can see fox nodded slowly he knew that people had ways of dealing with grief and loss but keeping busy could lead to problems later if all it meant was that you were in denial still the lack of mess and empty bottles perhaps boded well you dont mind talking a little about vince he asked her depends she answered starting to light a cigarette has there been any progress precious little breck admitted she turned her attention to him i remember you she said blowing smoke through her nostrils you were here the day they dug up the back garden breck gave another bow of his head acknowledging the fact fox cleared his throat until she focused on him again did you hear about charles brogan he asked it was in the paper fell from his yacht you know he was married to joanna broughton so the paper said did you know she owns the oliver jude nodded and removed a sliver of tobacco from her tongue they showed her picture i recognised her from your nights at the casino she was sometimes there always looked very glam how about her husband did you ever see him jude was nodding once or twice he sent us over a bottle of champagne charles brogan bought you champagne breck asked seeking verification didnt i just say that jude took a slurp of coffee casts coming off next week she informed her brother why he asked typical nhs ballsup turns out its a fracture less serious than a break i meant why did charles brogan send you over a bottle of champagne she looked at him well both vince and ronnie worked for him didnt they not exactly she pondered this okay she agreed not exactly but hed met them on the site he knew who they were was it good champagne breck had asked the question and jude turned her head towards him it was moët or something like that thirty quid or thereabouts in asda so sandra said more like a ton in a casino well its his wifes place isnt it i doubt he was paying full whack fox decided to step in it was a nice gesture all the same did he come over and say hello jude shook her head not that time another time though now she was nodding and vinces friend ronnie didnt want us to know fox thought he handed sandra and me twenty quids worth of chips each mind you she paused i think he was showing off is that what vince thought vince thought he had style when the champagne arrived vince had to go shake him by the hand brogan just patted him on the shoulder like it was no big deal she shrugged maybe it wasnt there was a phone ringing it was brecks he apologised as he lifted it from his pocket and checked the screen his glance towards fox confirmed what fox had already been thinking billy giles dont answer fox was saying but breck had already placed the phone to his ear afternoon sir he said then after listening for a moment yes hes with me and a few seconds later right yes understood yes i was there when it happened but it was really more of a misund breck broke off and listened some more fox couldnt hear what giles was saying but his tone was splenetic breck actually eased the phone away from his ear as the diatribe continued sounds narked jude whispered for her brothers benefit fox nodded back by the time the call ended blood had risen up brecks neck and into his cheeks well fox asked our presence is requested breck explained at torphichen any time within the next halfhour any later and therell be patrol cars out trawling for us jude stared at her brother what have you done is it to do with vince its nothing fox assured her while locking eyes with jamie breck you were always a terrible liar malcolm his sister remarked torphichen not an interview room this time but bad billy giless inner sanctum the office lacked any whiff of personality there were no framed family snaps on the desk no citations or certificates on the walls some people liked to brighten up their drab surroundings but giles was not among them you could tell nothing about the inhabitant of this space other than that he was behind with his filing there were boxes awaiting storage elsewhere and a threefoothigh pile of paperwork balanced precariously atop the only cabinet cosy fox said manoeuvring his way in the place was crowded giles was behind his desk swivelling slightly in his chair and with a pen gripped in his hand like a dagger bob mcewan was seated next to the filing cabinet hands clasped in his lap and with caroline stoddart alongside him she stood with arms folded then there were hall and dickson dickson had given himself a wash and changed into a spare set of clothes which looked like the result of a whipround of the other officers in the station the illfitting brown cords did not match the pink polo shirt which in turn clashed with the green blouson he was also wearing tennis shoes and his furious eyes never left fox for a second breck had managed to squeeze into the room behind fox but gave up on trying to close the door giles tossed his pen down on to the desk and looked towards mcewan with your permission bob permission was granted with the curtest of nods and giles turned his attention back to fox and breck one of my officers wants to make a complaint he told them seems he was manhandled to the ground that was a misunderstanding sir breck explained and were sorry about it well pay the drycleaning costs or any other reasonable expense shut up breck giles snapped youre not the one who needs to do the grovelling fox pulled his shoulders back dickson went for me first he stated im not sorry for what i did he paused for a beat i just didnt expect him to go down like a sack of spuds you prick dickson snarled taking half a step forward dickson giles cautioned my office my rules then to fox what i want to know is what you and the boy wonder were doing there in the first place i told dickson and hall at the time fox replied calmly id already paid one visit to salamander point and i liked what i saw theres a sales office and not having much else to do i decided to see if i could snag a bargain in these straitened times taking ds breck with you except hall interrupted thats not what happened youd asked to speak to mr ronald hendry he wasnt happy at being pulled away from his game of football and even less happy when i asked for him again not ten minutes later he offered fox a cold smile giles allowed the silence to linger then snatched up his pen and stabbed it in stoddarts direction i think maybe it would be wise she said on cue if i brought forward my interview with ds breck to when breck asked directly after this meeting he offered a shrug fine by me wouldnt matter if it wasnt giles snapped back and afterwards im ordering the pair of you to cease communication and how are you going to enforce that fox asked have us tagged maybe or kept under surveillance as he said this he glanced in mcewans direction ill use whatever methods i think necessary giles growled then for brecks benefit youre not doing your prospects much good son its high time you saw sense yes sir jamie breck replied thank you sir fox gave him a look but breck wasnt about to make eye contact he was standing with his hands behind his back feet slightly apart head bowed in a show of contrition and just to reiterate sir breck went on id be more than happy to pay whatever compensations warranted for ds dicksons distress he then leaned past fox hand stretched out towards dickson dickson stared at the hand as if it might be boobytrapped good man giles said by way of encouragement leading dickson to accept the handshake but with a baleful stare directed at fox well then giles was half rising to his feet unless chief inspector mcewan has anything to add but mcewan didnt and neither did stoddart she was telling breck she had a car waiting outside their little chat would take place at fettes giles had already ordered hall and dickson back to work weve a case to clear up he reminded them fox waited to see if thered be any further admonishment but giles was removing some paperwork from his desk drawer youre not important enough he seemed to be telling fox jamie breck offered him the briefest of nods as he left fox moved swiftly through the station not knowing if dickson and hall might be ready to spring out at him when he reached the pavement bob mcewan was standing there knotting his coffeecoloured scarf around his neck youre a bloody idiot mcewan told him its hard to deny it fox offered sliding his hands into his coat pockets but somethings behind all this dont tell me you dont feel it too mcewan looked at him then gave a single slow nod of the head that time in the interview room fox pressed on gesturing towards the police station there was a moment where we caught sight of it the deputy chief said id been under surveillance most of the week but that means it was in place before any of this other stuff so im asking you sir fox planted himself firmly in front of his boss how much do you know mcewan stared back at him not much he eventually conceded adjusting the knot in his scarf not too tight bob fox advised him if you end up strangling yourself theyre bound to find a way to pin it on me youve not done yourself any favours malcolm look at it from their point of view youve interfered in an inquiry and when ordered to stop you seemed to push your foot to the pedal that bit harder grampian complaints already had me in their sights fox stressed is there any way you can look into that he paused i know im asking a lot under the circumstances ive already set the ball rolling fox looked at him i forgot he said you have friends in grampian cid i seem to remember telling you that ive friends nowhere fox thought for a moment say that there is something rotten in aberdeen could they be trying for a preemptive strike its doubtful the job i mentioned up there has gone to strathclyde instead of us and besides why pick on you if i were them id have zeroed in on tony kaye hes the one with the history mcewan paused are you going to heed the warning and keep away from breck id rather not answer that sir fox watched his bosss face cloud over i think hes being set up bob theres not a shred of evidence that hes got inclinations that way then how did his name end up on the list someone got hold of his credit card fox said with a shrug maybe you could ask ds inglis if thats possible could someone have signed up in brecks name without his knowledge fox broke off and held up a cautionary hand best if gilchrist doesnt know though mcewans eyes narrowed why the fewer the better fox offered mcewan shuffled his feet give me a single good reason why i should go out on a limb for you fox considered this then gave another shrug to be honest sir i cant actually think of one mcewan nodded slowly thats the word i was looking for what word sir honest bob mcewan said as he marched towards his car home felt like a cage fox did everything but dismantle the landline to look for bugs thing was that was straight out of the ipcress file these days you eavesdropped in other ways a couple of months back the complaints had attended a series of seminars at tulliallan police college theyd been shown various bits of new technology a suspect might be making a phone call but it was software doing the listening and it would only start to record if certain preprogrammed keywords came up same went for computers the gadgets in the van could isolate an individual laptop or hard drive and withdraw information from it fox kept walking over to the windows and peering out if he heard a car engine hed be at the window again he held his new phone in his hand wondering who he could call hed made toast but the slices sat untouched on their plate when had he last eaten something breakfast he still couldnt summon up any appetite hed made a start at replacing the books on the livingroom shelves but had given up after the first few minutes even the birdsong channel had begun to annoy him and hed switched the radio off as night fell his lights remained off too there was a car parked across the street but it was just a parent picking up her son from a friends house the same thing had happened before so he decided he could dismiss it then again he tried to recall if any of the houses nearby had come on the market recently had any to let signs come and gone could a surveillance team be sitting in its own darkened living room surrounded by the same equipment hed been shown at tulliallan dont be so bloody stupid he admonished himself making a mug of tea in the unlit kitchen he poured in too much milk and ended up tipping the drink down the sink drink now there was a thing the supermarket was open late he could almost recite from memory the bottles in its malt whisky display bowmore talisker highland park macallan glenmorangie glenlivet laphroaig lagavulin glenfiddich at half past eight his phone gave a momentary chirrup he stared at it not a call but a text he tried to focus on the screen hunters tryst mins hunters tryst was a pub nearby fox checked the texters identity anonymous caller only a handful of people had his new number the pub was a tenminute walk but there was parking then again it might be good to arrive early reconnaissance and all that and why was he going anyway well what else was he going to do but when he eventually headed out to the volvo he looked up and down the street then once in the car made a circuit of his estate slowing at every corner and junction until he was confident no one was following a week night in february the tryst was quiet he walked in and took a good look around three drinkers in the whole place a middleaged couple who looked as if theyd fallen out a decade before each still waiting for the other to offer the first apology and an elderly man whose face was known to fox the guy had owned a dog used to walk it three times a day when hed stopped being visible fox had assumed hed croaked but now it looked as if the dog had been the victim rather than its master there was a young woman behind the bar she managed a smile for fox and asked him what he was having tomato juice he said his eyes lingered on the row of optics as she shook the bottle and prised off its top ice no thanks its a bit warm she warned him itll be fine he was reaching into his pocket for some coins when the door opened again the couple who entered had their arms around one anothers waist the middleaged couple gave a disapproving look look whos here the male half of this new couple said breck held out his hand for fox to shake this is a coincidence annabel cartwright added she wasnt much of an actress but then maybe she thought the charade unnecessary what are you having fox asked red wine for me white for annabel breck said the barmaid had perked up at the arrival of customers with a bit of life to them she poured what seemed to foxs eye generous measures lets grab a table breck said as though chairs were at a premium they headed for the furthest corner and got themselves settled removing coats and jackets cheers breck said chinking glasses how was it fox asked him without preamble breck knew what he was referring to and pretended to give it some thought di stoddarts a piece of work he told fox keeping his voice low but i didnt think much of those two blokes shes saddled with and i dont think she reckons them much cop either if youll pardon the pun fox nodded and took a sip of his drink the barmaid had been right it was like soup that had been left to cool for a few minutes whats with the text he asked you changed your number new phone breck explained waving the handset in his face rental believe it or not visitors from the states and suchlike use them all the time id no idea till i started looking what he means is he asked me and i told him annabel cartwright gave brecks arm a playful punch so whats with the powwow fox asked again that was annabels idea breck said she looked at him i wouldnt go that far breck turned to face her maybe not but youre the one with the news what news fox asked cartwright looked from fox to breck and back again i could get in so much trouble for this thats true fox said then to breck so why dont you tell me jamie that way we can say hand on heart that the only person annabel told was her boyfriend breck thought for a moment and then nodded he asked cartwright if she wanted to leave them to it but she shook her head and said shed just sit there and finish her drink breck leaned a little further over the table elbows resting either side of his glass to start with he said theres new information on vince another cabdrivers come forward this one had been waiting for fares outside the oliver he reckons he picked vince up around one in the morning hes sure it was vince breck nodded the team showed him photos plus he idd vinces clothes so where did he take him the cowgate where else are you going to go if you want to keep drinking at that time of night its a bit studenty breck guessed trendy but fox had thought of something else isnt the cowgate closed to traffic at night driver knew all the little short cuts and side streets dropped him outside a club called rondo do you know it do i look the type breck smiled annabel dragged me there once she jabbed him in the ribs by way of complaint and breck squirmed a little live music in the back room sticky carpets and plastic glasses in the front thats where he was headed driver wasnt sure but it was where he got out meaning he was still alive in the small hours of sunday morning breck nodded so now the inquiry teams going to be doing a sweep of the cowgate must be about a dozen pubs and clubs more if they widen the search to the grassmarket theyre printing up flyers to hand out to the clubbing fraternity doormen might remember him fox mused he probably wasnt typical of their clientele did the cabbie say what sort of state he was in slurring his words and a bit agitated plus he didnt tip why was he agitated maybe he was wondering what was waiting for him back home breck offered maybe he was just the type who gets that way after a skinful id like to listen to the interview with the cabbie i could probably get you a transcript cartwright offered fox nodded his thanks the first cab would have dropped him at the oliver around ten means he was in there three hours a fair amount of time breck agreed well its progress i suppose cheers annabel cartwright gave a shrug tell him the rest she commanded breck well this is just something annabel picked up when she was talking to a colleague based at d division meaning leith and charlie brogan fox guessed the inquiry teams beginning to wonder why no bodys been washed ashore theyre digging a bit deeper into the whys and wherefores and brogan had recently sold a large chunk of his art collection fox nodded again worth about half a million annabel cartwright took up the story nobody seems to know where that money is and joanna broughtons not exactly being cooperative shes got her lawyers setting up their wagons in a circle shes also got gordon lovatt reminding everyone involved that it wont look good if we start harassing a photogenic widow his very words leith think the suicide was staged as jamie says theyre definitely beginning to wonder has any other cash gone awol hard to know until the lawyers stop denying access wed need a judge to issue a warrant and that means convincing him its right and proper theres no way of knowing if any of brogans accounts or credit cards are still being used fox didnt expect an answer he lifted his glass but paused with it halfway to his mouth when i was in her flat i saw the spaces on the wall where those paintings had been youve been to her house cartwright asked there wasnt any paperwork lying around but then she had to fetch brogans diary from elsewhere must be a room he uses as an office he could always have siphoned some cash off from cbbj breck added weve got specialist accountants for that kind of digging but there still needs to be a judges signature cartwright cautioned fox shrugged if joanna broughtons being obstructive he argued id have thought that might be reason enough im sure theyll fight their corner breck said running his finger down the wine glass any more revelations foxs eyes were on annabel no she said i really do appreciate this fox got to his feet so much so that im going to buy you another drink this ones on us breck said but fox was having none of it when he placed the order the barmaid smiled and nodded towards the table nice when you bump into friends isnt it yes malcolm fox replied yes it really is at midnight he was standing at the foot of blair street staring towards the illuminated doorway of rondo there was just the one doorman they usually operated in pairs so the partner was either inside or on a break of some kind the street was almost deserted but wouldnt have been at the same sort of time on a saturday plus the welsh rugby fans had been in town the night vince died gearing up for sundays encounter some of them would have known that the cowgate was the latelicence district fox stood at the corner hands in pockets this was where vince had been dropped access to the main thoroughfare was curtailed between ten at night and five in the morning fox knew that this was because the cowgate boasted narrow pavements drunks kept stumbling from them into the path of oncoming traffic cars had been banned because people were stupid but then no one surely would pass this way sober at dead of night it was a dark dank conduit there were homeless hostels and rubbishstrewn alleys the place reeked of rat piss and puke but there were plenty of little oases like rondo lit by neon and radiating warmth thanks to the heaters above their doors they coaxed the unwary inside as fox crossed to the other side of the road the doorman sized him up loosening his shoulders under his threequarterlength black woollen coat evening mr fox the man said fox stared at him there was a smile playing at the edges of the mouth stubble on the scarred chin shaven head and piercing blue eyes pete scott the man eventually said having decided that fox needed help youve shaved your hair off fox replied scott ran a hand over his head i was beginning to lose it anyway long time no see he held out a hand for fox to shake how long have you been out pete fox remembered scott now six years ago in his precomplaints life hed helped put him away housebreaking a string of convictions stretching back to adolescence almost two years you served four took me a while to see the error of my ways you battered someone another con but youre doing okay now scott shuffled his feet and made show of looking up and down the street there was a bluetooth connected to his left ear keeping out of trouble he eventually offered youve a good memory for names and faces scott just nodded at this you having a night out he asked working fox corrected him there was a murder the weekend before last theyve been round already scott reached into his coat and pulled out a sheet of paper fox unfolded it and saw that it was a headandshoulders photo of vince faulkner with a few salient details and a phone number theyve left them on the tables inside with another stack on the bar wont do any good fox handed back the sheet why do you say that guy didnt come in here i was on the door that saturday id have known about it did you see him get out of the cab mightve done taxis drop people off all the time you saw somebody like him scott just shrugged the scrawny nineteenyearold fox had interviewed had bulked up but the eyes had definitely softened there was a guy wandered off in that direction scott was nodding towards the east wasnt too steady on his pins so i was glad he hadnt tried coming in youd have stopped him scott nodded but there was just something about him dont ask me what it made me think hed have relished it relished being turned away yeah why because it would have given him every excuse for a fight you mean the guy was wound tight mr fox i think thats what im trying to get at did you tell this to the other cops pete fox watched scott shake his head why not they never thought to ask scott was distracted by the arrival of two teenage girls they wore teetering high heels miniskirts and plenty of perfume one was tall and skinny the other short and plump fox could sense that they were cold but trying not to show it hiya pete the shorter one said any talent in tonight plenty thats what you always say she patted his cheek as he held open the door the job has its compensations mr fox pete scott told the detective as he walked eastwards along the cowgate fox wondered just how invisible hed become neither girl had paid him the slightest attention on the other hand it was good that scott didnt hold a grudge good too that he was holding down a job any kind of a job before fox had left the young man had confessed that he was now the father of an eighteenmonthold daughter called chloe he was still seeing chloes mum but living together hadnt worked out fox had nodded and the two had shaken hands again the meeting had made fox feel better though he couldnt say exactly why he knew that if he kept walking hed come to the st marys street junction past that and hed soon be at dynamic earth and the scottish parliament he was coming to the end of the short strip of bars and clubs there were shops but with their windows empty or boarded up the city mortuary was along here but hed no desire to pay a visit he assumed vinces body would still be in the fridge there across the road a church had decided that the best way to raise funds was to build a hotel in its grounds the hotel seemed to be doing reasonable business fox wasnt sure if the church could say the same thing he decided to turn and retrace his route there were too many paths vince could have taken narrow lanes and flights of steps he could have headed towards chambers street or the royal mile for all fox knew he could have checked into the hotel and slept things off he was trying to see the areas attraction for vince yes it was full of bars but then so was lothian road vince would have paid good money to have a cab bring him here from leith on the way he would have passed dozens of places still open at that hour he had to have had a destination in mind maybe fox could talk to the cabbie maybe annabel would find out the mans details for him maybe he muttered to himself the temperature was dipping still further he had pulled up the collar of his coat trying to protect his ears there was a chip shop at the grassmarket but that suddenly seemed like a long haul besides would it still be open the curfew was in place meaning all traffic had ceased his own car was parked near the top of blair street five more minutes and he would be snug there was nothing for him here but then he saw another neon light this one was down a narrow alley a dead end in fact he hadnt spotted it before but now that he looked there was a sign on the brick wall pointing towards the lit doorway just one word above the signs arrow sauna he wondered if any of the team had got round to leafleting this particular business he took a couple of steps deeper into the alley so he could better see the door it was solid wood painted gloss black with a tarnished brass handle and an assortment of graffiti tags there was a video intercom off to one side edinburghs sex industry liked to keep itself to itself which was fine by the police fox was readying to turn and head back to the car when a massive force detonated between his shoulders sending him flying his face hit the ground hed had just enough time to half turn his head so that his nose escaped the worst of the impact the weight bore down on him someone was kneeling on his back punching the air out of his lungs dazed fox tried to wrestle free but a foot had connected with his chin a black shoe nothing fancy or memorable about it it snapped his head back and he felt himself spiralling into the dark when his eyes blinked open the shoe was back it was jabbing at his side he lashed out a hand to grab it wake up a voice was saying you cant sleep here fox clambered to his knees and then his feet his spine ached so did his neck and his jaw the man standing in front of him was old and fox thought for a second that he knew him too much to drink the man was saying hed taken a step away from fox fox was checking himself for damage there was no blood and no teeth seemed to have been dislodged what happened he asked youd be better going home to your bed im not drunk i dont drink are you ill then fox was trying to blink away the pain the world sounded offkilter and he realised it was the blood surging in his ears his vision was blurred did you see him he asked who pushed me to the ground and swung a kick at me he rubbed his jaw again did they take anything fox checked his pockets when he shook his head he felt like he might throw up its a bad part of town fox tried to focus on the man he had to be in his seventies cropped silver hair liverspotted skin youre jack broughton the mans eyes narrowed do i know you no broughton stuffed his hands into his pockets and moved in until his face was a few inches from foxs best keep it that way he said then he turned to leave you might want to get yourself checked out was his parting nugget of advice fox rested for a moment then shuffled back towards the main road he angled his watch towards a street lamp twelve forty could only have been out cold for a matter of minutes he held on to some of the buildings for support as he made his way back along to rondo his back felt like fire whenever he inhaled pete scott saw him coming and stiffened his stance mistaking him for trouble fox held up a hand in greeting and scott moved towards him did you trip or something he asked have you seen anybody pete had to be a big guy thereve been a few scott conceded in the time since i saw you scott nodded some of them are inside fox gestured towards the door im going to take a look he said be my guest the bar was rammed with a sound system that could loosen fillings the queue was three deep for drinks young men in shortsleeved shirts women sipping cocktails through dayglo straws foxs head took a fresh pummelling from the bass speakers as he squeezed his way through in the back room the stage was lit but no band was playing more drinkers more noise and strobing fox didnt recognise anyone he found the gents toilets and headed inside gaining some respite from the din there were paper towels strewn across the floor and none at all in the dispenser he ran water over his hands and dabbed at his face staring at his reflection in the smeared mirror his chin was grazed and his cheek had swollen the bruising would come soon enough his palms stung where theyd connected with the ground and one of his lapels had been ripped at the seam he took off his coat and checked it for evidence of the force that had hurled itself at him but there was nothing his attacker hadnt taken anything credit cards cash both mobile phones all accounted for and once he was unconscious it didnt appear as if theyd continued the beating he took a good look at his teeth and then manipulated his jaw with his hand youre okay he told his reflection then he noticed that one button was missing from his waistband it would need replacing or his braces wouldnt sit right he took a few deep breaths ran the water over his hands again and dried himself off with his handkerchief one of the drinkers from the bar came weaving in paying him almost no attention as he headed for a urinal fox put his coat back on and left outside he nodded towards the doorman pete scott was busy talking to the same two women as before theyd stepped out for a cigarette and were complaining about the lack of hunks if fox had been invisible to them before he seemed more so now scott asked him if he was really okay and fox just nodded again heading across the road to where his car waited someone had left the remains of a kebab on the volvos bonnet he gave it a swipe on to the roadway unlocked the doors and got in the journey home was slow the lights against him at every junction taxis were touting for business but most people seemed content to walk fox tuned his radio to classic fm and decided that jack broughton had not recognised him why should he have they had met for approximately ten seconds at the triplex penthouse broughton hadnt known until some minutes later that the man waiting for the lift was a cop could broughton himself have been the attacker doubtful and why would he have hung around besides his shoes had been brown brogues not at all the same as the one fox had watched connect with his chin pete scott on the other handpetes shoes had been black doc martens and pete was strong enough but fox didnt think so would pete have deserted his post for a spot of smallminded revenge well maybe he would but fox had him down as a possible rather than a probable once home he stripped off his clothes and stood under a hot shower training the water on to his back for a good nine or ten minutes it hurt when he tried towelling himself dry and he was able to get a look at himself in the bathroom mirror no visible damage maybe it would be different in the morning slowly he pulled on a pair of pyjamas and went downstairs to the kitchen finding an unopened bag of garden peas in the freezer compartment wrapping a tea towel around it and holding it to his jaw while he boiled the kettle for tea there was a box of aspirin in one of the drawers and he swallowed three tablets with a glass of water from the tap it was nearly two oclock by the time he settled himself at the table after a few minutes of staring at the wall he got up and went through to the dining room his computer sat on a desk in the corner he got it working and started a search of three names joanna broughton charlie brogan and jack broughton there wasnt much on the last of these his heyday had been before the advent of the internet and the twentyfourhour news cycle fox hadnt thought to ask him what he was doing in the cowgate at that time of night but then jack broughton was no ordinary seventyoneyearold probably he still fancied his chances against the majority of the drunks and chancers fox couldnt get properly comfortable if he leaned forward he ached if he leaned back the pain was greater he was grateful for the lack of alcohol in the house it stopped him reaching for that quickest of fixes instead he held the bag of peas to his face and concentrated on charlie brogan finding several interviews culled from magazines and the business pages of newspapers one journalist had asked brogan why hed become a property developer youre creating monuments brogan had replied youre making a mark thats going to outlast you and thats important to you everybody wants to change the world dont they and yet most of us all we leave behind is an obituary and maybe a few kids you want people to remember you id rather they noticed me while im here im in the business of making an impression fox wondered to himself an impression on who joanna broughton or her successful dad maybe didnt men always want to prove themselves to their inlaws fox recalled that hed been nervous when hed met elaines parents even though hed known them when he was a schoolkid hed been to birthday parties at their house but flash forward two decades and he was greeting them as their daughters boyfriend elaine tells us youre in the police the mother had said id no idea you were that way inclined the tone of voice said it all our lovely talented daughter could have done so much better so much better fox could well imagine brogans first encounter with pa broughton both sons were dead meaning there was a lot for joanna to prove shed left it late to get married fox reckoned her doting and protective father would have chased off many a previous suitor but charlie brogan knew what he wanted he wanted joanna she was glamorous and her family had money more than that her father had about him the whiff of power when you got hitched to the daughter you kept her fathers name in your pocket like a number for the emergency services anybody tried to turn you over the name would be dropped into the conversation not that fox could imagine jack broughton liking that so when cbbj started hitting the skids there was no insurance policy maybe brogan had approached the old boy on the quiet definitely wouldnt want joanna knowing about it but if he had hed given jack the perfect opportunity to tell his soninlaw just how useless hed always reckoned him you say you lost all your money in the downturn well charlie i didnt know you were that way inclined and by the way my lovely talented daughter could have done so much better poor sod fox said to himself half an hour later he was done with the three of them he found a link to quidnunc but couldnt enter the game without the relevant software instead he stared at the websites home page with its colourful graphics some sort of monster was being dispatched by half a dozen musclemen the warrior is in you ran the strapline fox thought of jamie breck he hadnt been much of a warrior in billy giless office breck losing himself in this fiction while a real life with annabel was kept on pause fox wondered what sort of role he himself had played throughout his life had he used alcohol the same way breck used the online game sinking into a virtual world as an escape from the real thing he wondered too whether he really did trust jamie breck he thought he did but then again breck had said it himself does it just mean im your very last hope failing to come up with an answer he set the computer to sleep mode and headed for bed he lay on his side the only way he could rest without pain the curtains were illuminated by the sodium glare of a street lamp the peas were defrosting in their bag birdsong was playing on the radio wednesday february at seven next morning his mobile phone his old one rather than the payandgo chirruped to let him know he had a message it was from di caroline stoddart she wanted him at fettes at nine for another interview fox texted back unwell sorry can we postpone did unwell cover it though hed had colds and flu and earache and migraines but never anything like this had he just gone three rounds with a grizzly bear it took him over a minute to cross from his bed to the bathroom face nicely swollen and chin scabbed over but stinging when touched and from what he could see of his back bruising either side of his spine in the perfectly legible shape of two human paws after twenty minutes in the shower he found another text waiting for him in the bedroom it was from stoddart tomorrow then it said fox decided he would stay at home the rest of the day he had milk and bread enough food to see him through by nine he was lying along the sofa nursing his second mug of coffee and with the bbcs news channel on the television when his doorbell sounded he considered not answering maybe it was stoddart checking his story but curiosity got the better of him and he crossed to the window jamie breck had taken a couple of steps back from the door and was staring straight at him he lifted a grocery bag and gave a smile fox went to let him in i got croissants from the supermarket breck was saying but then he got his first closeup of foxs damaged face christ what happened to you fox led the way back into the house he was still in his pyjamas with his dressing gown wrapped around him somebody jumped me he explained last night between hunters tryst and here breck sounded incredulous the cowgate fox corrected him hed switched the kettle on and found a clean mug for his visitor coffee or tea he asked because vince took a taxi there breck was nodding to himself after hunters tryst you headed down for a recce so who was it gave you the doing they came at me from behind i didnt see anything but when i woke up jack broughton was standing over me say that again you heard the first time tea or coffee teas fine what was jack broughton doing there he didnt say was he the one who i dont think so the two men stood in silence for a minute or so as the kettle came to the boil when the tea was made they headed through to the living room fox brought a plate for each of them and they shared the croissants breck sat on the very edge of his chair leaning well forward i just thought wed have a quiet breakfast we still can you doing a spot of springcleaning breck gestured towards the piles of books anything takes your fancy its yours fox lifted his plate from the table trying not to hiss in pain as he stretched something i wanted to ask you he bit into the croissant fire away why dont you want annabel to know breck chewed thoughtfully then swallowed you mean about seil ents and my credit card im still weighing up the pros and cons if she finds out the hard way shes not going to be too happy fox said and we really need her on our team so youre not just thinking of my best interests perish the thought breck picked crumbs from the knees of his trousers she keeps asking though why ive not gone to the federation to ask them for a lawyer its a fair question why havent you breck decided not to answer instead he had a question of his own what in gods name did you hope to find in the cowgate torphichen had been along handing out flyers so at least you know theyre doing their job where were you when you got thumped theres an alley with a sauna down it fox noticed the change in jamie brecks face you know it he guessed theres a sign just says sauna narrow little lane spit it out but breck needed some tea first he placed his plate on top of some of the books on the coffee table half the croissant still untouched i went there once with glen heaton he admitted what not inside breck quickly corrected himself wed been out to jocks lodge talking to a witness on the way back heaton said to take the route through the cowgate then he sent a text and told me to pull up when we reached that lane he got out of the car and a woman came out of the building she was wearing a raincoat but i got the feeling there wasnt a whole lot underneath the two of them did some talking at the end she pecked him on the cheek i think he might even have given her some money brecks face was creased in concentration she was tiny had to stand on tiptoe to reach his face younger than him maybe late twenties anyway she headed back indoors and he got into the car he gave a shrug did he tell you her name no i asked him what it was all about and he just winked and hinted that she was a contact of some kind an informer breck gave another shrug there were things i knew it was best not to ask glen had a way of letting you know how long ago was this last autumn fox thought for a moment she was tiny you say under five foot curly blonde hair breck stared at him and fox decided to explain we had heaton under surveillance for months checked his emails taped his phone calls followed him there was a woman he was seeing behind his wifes back worked as a lapdancer on lothian road little slip of a thing called but fox couldnt summon up her name looks like shes holding down two jobs breck commented then fixing fox with a stare you dont think it was foxs turn to shrug whoever it was they just wanted to dole out a bit of punishment not a huge amount just enough glen heaton would have motive breck agreed fox was already punching tony kayes number into his phone wondered when id be hearing from you were kayes answering words give me a sec will you fox listened as kaye got up from behind his desk and moved into the corridor can i assume gilchrists hard at work mcewans got him busy on a few bits and pieces kaye acknowledged im assuming this is purely a social call i need you to look something up for me tony might mean a trip to the fiscals office if theyre the ones with the paperwork or i could just call them fewer people in the know the better ill like it fox countered fair enough so what do you need info on glen heatons squeeze the lapdancer do you recall her name we never bothered interviewing her she was going to be leverage remember if we needed heaton to fess up just get me what you can tony mind telling me why later fox ended the call and made to tap the phone against his chin before remembering that it would sting what was jack broughton doing there breck was asking himself customer maybe his wifes dead and the old bastards probably still got some juice fox paused or could he be the proprietor a pimp you mean fox shook his head might own the building though maybe hes the landlord or leaseholder he looked at breck could annabel do some digging under what pretext the inquiry teams not finished with the cowgate she could be looking for background breck puffed his cheeks and expelled some air i suppose so he said you want me to call her he had his own phone in his hand why not malcolm fox said breck started to make the call im just wondering what now that i think about it why did heaton do that why take me with him when he went to see his bit on the side he was showing off fox decided pure and simple breck considered this then nodded his call had been picked up hey annabel he said his face breaking into a smile youll never guess what im after by midafternoon fox knew several things courtesy of tony kaye he now knew that the lapdancers name was sonya michie and that she lived in a block of flats in sighthill she was a single mum with two kids at the local primary school there was no mention in her file of any employment in a sauna and she had no arrests to her name the information from annabel cartwright was more intriguing still the building in which the sauna was housed was owned by a dundeebased company called wauchope leisure holdings limited wauchope leisure owned all sorts of interesting properties in the city mostly saunas and strip clubs the list happened to include the lapdancing bar where sonya michie worked cartwright had sourced the register of directors including a certain j broughton just to be on the safe side jamie breck had asked her to verify the first name a further hour later had come confirmation john edward alan broughton better known as jack fox had commented so at least he had a reason to be there breck had added business rather than pleasure i mean at that time of night but cartwright hadnt been finished wauchope got its name from bruce wauchope who was currently serving fifteen years at her majestys pleasure for his role in a drugsmuggling scheme in the northeast fishing boats working out of the likes of aberdeen she explained shed arrived at foxs house with a sheaf of photocopied pages mostly newspaper articles about wauchope but also the transcript of the interview with the cabbie whod dropped vince off at the cowgate it hadnt added much took him the best part of a minute to decide he was getting out the cabdriver stated i thought he was going to change his mind cartwright had been offered a drink and decided on water breck had given her a kiss her cheeks were flushed and she appeared energised by completion of her tasks she had noted foxs injuries but hadnt asked anything knowing shed be told if necessary nor had she mentioned the piles of books which had been lifted from the coffee table and now sat on the floor threatening to fall over at any moment nobody noticed what you were up to fox thought to check receiving a shake of the head in answer the trawlers would meet with other boats out in the north sea she explained between sips of water the drugs would come ashore finding a ready market with fishermen and oil workers fox was studying a grainy photograph of a scowling bruce wauchope the man would be in his early fifties he looks like a right thug jamie breck offered wait till you see his son cartwright sifted through the paperwork the photo she found was small and accompanied a news report from bruce wauchopes trial his names bruce too bruce junior i suppose but he goes by the nickname bull fox and breck studied the article while cartwright added a few details hes got a fierce reputation in dundee kicked out of half a dozen schools by the time he was fifteen ran a local gang no doubt made his dad proud of him with wauchope senior out of action bulls the one in charge in charge of what exactly for that id probably need to chat up tayside cid either of you got a contact there i might know someone breck admitted does wauchope own anything else in edinburgh fox asked still intent on his reading again that would need a bit more work cartwright paused why is it so important the question had been asked of breck but he fixed his attention on fox who could only shrug the room remained quiet as fox continued to pore over the photocopies breck had walked over to the window i dont see your car he commented i left it round the corner cartwright explained didnt want anyone seeing it here probably wise fox glanced up from his reading she was checking her watch ive got to get back doesnt normally take me this long to buy a sandwich thanks for all this fox said i just hope it helps she slung her bag over her shoulder jamie had already left the room and opened the front door for her fox couldnt make out what was said but he heard a final wetsounding kiss before the door closed breck came back into the room and watched her from the window shes too good for you fox told him dont i know it breck turned and came back to his chair shed stand by you im sure of it fox went on if you told her i mean she wouldnt believe any of it ill do it in my own time if thats all right with you inspector fox took the hint and held up his hands in surrender breck rubbed his own hands together so he said perching himself on the arm of the chair what have we got exactly your guess is as good as mine fox paused have you contacted your credit card company about that debit breck stared at him what makes you ask all of a sudden just popped into my head ive been on to them the payment to seil was an online transaction so theres not much they can say anyone with your card details could have done it as long as they knew the security number plus maybe my address and postcode so were not really any further forward i cant prove it wasnt me if thats what youre suggesting breck got to his feet again still got a nagging doubt malcolm no try to sound a bit more convincing before he could answer foxs phone rang it was annie inglis hey annie fox said what can i do for you nothing really breck had gestured that he would leave the room without waiting he was already on his way fox leaned back in his chair with the phone to his ear then recoiled in pain his back throbbed a fresh complaint how are things at the chop shop he asked through gritted teeth have they given you a replacement for gilchrist yet still working solo that cant be good its not hows duncan hes fine how about you malcolm ive got my feet up really well sort of he listened to her laugh how soon will you be back at work thats up to grampian ive met di stoddart she seems very efficient was she asking you about me just in passing i was supposed to come in today for another session on the rack so she said i told her i was ill but youre all right really actually ive got a few aches and pains this time of year who hasnt a bit more sympathy wouldnt go amiss she laughed again do you want me to drop by after work bring you some grapes and lucozade fox was touching his fingers to his bruised and battered face its a tempting offer but no thanks dont say i didnt ask ill be fine in a few days annie listen theres something i wanted to ask you a while back you warned me that the australian police were getting ready to pounce on simeon latham when i talked to gilchrist about it he said much the same yes well the cop you put me on to in melbourne seems to have other ideas you know i cant talk about this malcolm ingliss voice had hardened im just wondering who it is thats lying to me annie breck had stuck his head round the door and was indicating that he was about to leave fox shook his head and listened as a beep in his ear told him inglis had hung up he snapped shut the device and waved breck back into the room di stoddart he said has been pumping annie inglis for information shes thorough if nothing else breck commented fox was thoughtful as he let his fingers drift across his swollen cheek you shouldnt be part of this jamie what you should be doing is clearing your name and how do i do that without them realising you must have tipped me off breck shook his head slowly got to clear your name before i can clear mine so whats next on the days agenda fox looked at the front of his phone three oclock had come and gone lunch he suggested another supermarket run breck guessed fox nodded reaching into his pocket for money my shout he said you paid for breakfast breck took the tenpound note but stood his ground and after dundees an option but again its something i can do for myself breck pointed at foxs face ive seen the results of your solo efforts so you wont mind if i tag along after breck had gone fox rose to his feet and walked to the window he stared out at the street his mind dazed then he went to the kitchen and helped himself to more painkillers annabels glass was waiting to be washed there was a pale smear of pink lipstick on the rim was her boyfriend too good to be true then again was she could she be feeding titbits back to the inquiry handing malcolm fox to billy giles on the understanding that giles would then go easy on her lover the list of people fox felt he could trust was short its margins filled with ifs and buts and question marks back at the coffee table he picked up a sheaf of photocopied sheets the transcript of the cabbies interview it struck him that vince might have had good reason for hesitating before leaving the taxi hed been agitated he had a location in mind but showed some reluctance at marooned hed tried picking a fight then at the bus stop there had been a second confrontation the doormen at the oliver shouldnt have let him in but did why was that jamie breck had said that joanna broughton didnt want the place getting a reputation yet vince faulkner was allowed to drink himself into a nearstupor two to three hours hed been there when vinces body had been found hed had only a few notes and coins in his pockets had he gone to the cowgate to borrow money or because hed suddenly come into some sifting through all the material it struck fox that here was another huge favour annabel cartwright had done him without even really knowing him she was helping because he was jamies friend i trust you annabel he said to himself then after a moment okay maybe eighty per cent he was back in the kitchen pouring more tap water into his glass when he realised his old mobile was ringing and headed through to the living room to find it but whoever was calling gave up before he got there fox checked the number another mobile and called back i just missed you he said when the phone was picked up at the other end its max dearborn how are things with you max nose to the grindstone any sign of the errant developer no but thats what hes become right errant rather than deceased its one possibility among many i can only think of five max hes dead and it was an accident or he topped himself or someone took care of him thats three and if hes alive he either faked his suicide or someone else did it for him meaning hes been snatched wouldnt the wife have had a ransom note by now maybe shes just not telling you max from what i know of joanna broughton shed want to deal with something like that in her own way thats a point dearborn conceded speaking of which her pr mans on the warpath again ive not been near her its a reporter hes got in his sights dearborn sounded tired fox reckoned he knew why hed called no hidden agenda but rather the need to talk to blow off a little steam to gossip with someone outside the circle of wagons fox imagined dearborn in a halfempty cid office everyone flagging after the first few days of toil waiting for a break in the case and made lethargic by too many sandwiches and chocolate bars maybe dearborn had his chair pushed back necktie undone feet up on the desk whats the reporter done not much shes got hold of a rumour that brogan was tied up in something yes trying to bribe a councillor its something to do with all these flats brogans been putting up suddenly nobodys buying he was hoping the council might what would the council want with them social housing citys short a few thousand homes or hadnt you noticed sounds as if brogan might have had the solution if the price was right and how was a solitary councillor going to sugar the deal helps if the councillor sits on the housing board ah fox said then after a pause i still dont see much thats wrong with it to be frank me neither so who told you all this not gordon lovatt the reporter and why are you telling me because youve got form when it comes to getting up peoples noses next time you see joanna broughton or gordon lovatt you might drop it into the conversation in the hope that theyll do what exactly maybe nothing maybe something seems to me you owe this reporter a favour but cant stick your own head above the parapet mine on the other hand it was just a thought the reporters name is linda dearborn by the way thats quite a coincidence max it would be if she wasnt my baby sister let me give you her number he did so and fox jotted it down he could hear another phone ringing somewhere in max dearborns vicinity got to go any news about brogan youll let me know fox reminded him but dearborn had already ended the call fox scratched his head and tried to order his thoughts there was something he should have asked so he sent dearborn a text name of councillor it was five minutes before he received a reply ernie wishaw fox was still staring at the name when breck returned with the food breck didnt appear to have noticed any change in him he unloaded packets of sandwiches and crisps on to the coffee table along with a couple of bottles of lemonade he was halfway through asking fox if he preferred prawn salad or ham and mustard when he broke off did someone die he asked fox shook his head slowly your councillor which one with the lorry business what about him brecks face showed puzzlement he might connect to charlie brogan breck thought for a moment because of the casino theres a journalist looking to prove that brogan was giving a backhander to ernie wishaw breck slowly unwrapped his sandwich sliding it on to the same plate that had earlier held his croissant brogan fox continued to explain wanted to offload some of his white elephants on to the council wishaw was going to make sure the council didnt get too much of a bargain breck shrugged sounds feasible whos the journalist max dearborns sister and whos max dearborn a ds at leith hes on the team investigating brogans little disappearing act breck looked at fox not suicide fox just shrugged if the reporters right you could get your hands on ernie wishaw after all fox paused if you were brogan and you wanted to twist his arm maybe youd show him a good time first at the wifes casino give him a pile of chips to play with im not sure wishaws that gullible depends on the deal brogan was offering breck was still looking at him there was a sandwich in his hand but hed forgotten about it prawns were falling loose and landing back on the plate this is a rumour right so far thats all it is fox shrugged again hed peeled open the ham sandwich staring at the filling but his appetite was gone he reached for the lemonade instead when he unscrewed it it fizzed out of the neck and made a puddle around itself on the table he got up and fetched a cloth from the kitchen breck still had to make a start on his own sandwich cant be many prawns left in there fox warned him breck noticed what had happened and started replacing the prawns between the two triangles of brown bread linda dearborn he said at last thats her name you know her fox asked busy wiping up the spillage i remember her now when wishaws drugrunning driver was arrested she came sniffing around i think her general argument was wishaw had to have known i seem to recall that was your general argument too breck smiled at this i only spoke to her that one time his voice drifted off seems shes kept the councillor on her radar it does doesnt it reckon shes worth talking to if we can keep our names out of the story problem is if she gets a quote from us wed be her unnamed police sources whats wrong with that her brothers part of the brogan inquiry breck nodded his understanding everyone would assume it was him so i doubt shed let us stay unnamed then why did dearborn tell you in the first place i think he wants me to take it to joanna broughton why in the hope that she blows a fuse and maybe lets something slip that wont happen what about ernie wishaw hes hardly going to incriminate himself is he you watched him for a while wheres he most vulnerable id have to think about that in the meantime how about this we tell him well forget about the bung he sent to the drivers wife so long as he fills us in on the deal charlie brogan was offering are you serious we dont even have warrant cards youre right silence filled the room for a few moments until jamie breck broke it youre going to do it anyway he stated probably fox conceded why because brogans the key to everything are you sure of that fox thought for a second no he decided im not really sure of that at all that evening fox found himself back at the cowgate he stayed in his car watching passersby on the lookout for faces he knew there were just the two annabel cartwright and billy giles fox slid far down into his seat even though it sent spasms of pain down his spine cartwright was first talking to another member of the inquiry team the man seemed to be following her orders he had a fresh bunch of flyers with him they moved along the street and he lost sight of them then ten minutes later it was the turn of billy giles sauntering along as if he owned the place he was chewing on a stubby cigar and had his hands stuffed deep into his pockets the night was overcast and mild with hardly any breeze when giles headed off in the same direction as cartwright and her colleague fox pushed himself back up out of his hiding place three quarters of an hour later a car drove past the driver had picked up all three detectives giles was talking animatedly gesturing with his arms the others listening tiredly fox waited a further thirty minutes then got out of his own car and locked it pete scott was not on duty outside rondo there were two doormen tonight one black and one white they paid fox not the slightest attention one of them was showing the other something amusing on the screen of his phone thats terrible fox heard one of them say but in a tone that suggested the opposite he kept walking it wasnt even ten oclock and he didnt know why he was bothering if hed wanted to do this right a reenactment scenario he would have come here after midnight the lane was deserted the neon sign still said sauna fox studied the territory around him and decided he was safe from attack nevertheless he kept his head half turned as he walked down the alley stopping at the door he pressed the buzzer and stared into the camera lens when nothing happened he pressed again he couldnt hear anything from inside there was no glass nothing but the glinting eye of the camera he waved his fingers in front of it leaned down close to it even gave it an exploratory tap then he tried the door handle but it wouldnt budge he bunched up a fist and rapped three times then three more still nothing eventually he turned to go pausing next to where hed lain unconscious not twentyfour hours before he crouched down and lifted a circular object from the ground it was the missing button from his trouser waistband he pocketed it got back to his feet and headed for home there was a detour to take first however and it was a long one in daylight the a out of the city was a meandering coastal road with eyecatching views fox remembered that it had been a weekend favourite with his exwife they would stop at aberlady for lunch or gullane for a stroll along the edges of the golf course there were car parks leading to the seashore and for the adventurous there was the mass of berwick law to climb tantallon castle just the other side of north berwick was as far as they ever got before heading across country there might be a bacon roll at the museum of flight or fish and chips in haddington but north berwick was elaines favourite she would peer through one of the sea life centres telescopes or wander along the beach coaxing him to catch up with her he was always the ambler she the strider north berwick was foxs destination tonight he knew the route but took it slowly the road was twisty and unpredictable cars sped past him their modified exhausts roaring the drivers overtaking on blind bends and flashing their lights these drivers were young the other seats crammed with whooping friends maybe they were from the city but fox thought them more likely to be locals this time of night what else was there to do in east lothian when he reached north berwick he headed for a particular narrow street not far from the shore there was a house there hed parked outside before though never in his own car the house was singlestorey but had been extended into the roof space a balcony allowing views towards several islands and outcrops fidra craigleith bass rock not that any were visible tonight the wind had risen but the temperature remained a few degrees the right side of zero elaine had always wanted to live on the coast foxs objection had been purely selfish he hadnt fancied the commute but that same commute did not seem to worry glen heaton heaton had lived in this town for eight years the complaints had looked into his purchase of the house these days it was probably worth half a million plus no way should he have been able to afford it a point put to him more than once during their several interviews heaton had told them to look at the paperwork nothing dodgy hed stated and you lot are just jealous and it eats you up that someones done better than you this was the house where fox parked now turning off his engine in the realisation that an idling motor might cause curtains to twitch the next house along was a bed and breakfast its front garden converted into a driveway where three cars sat this time of year fox doubted any of them belonged to tourists heatons own car an alfa would be stowed in its garage to the rear of the property the car was two years old and had cost its owner just under twenty grand heaton had spent almost the same amount on holidays in the twelve months leading up to the conclusion of the inquiry jaunts to barbados miami and the seychelles one of those trips he and his wife had opted for business class while the others had been economy plus four and fivestar resort hotels waiting for them sadly the complaints budget had not stretched to surveillance of these breaks on the drive here tonight fox had caught some news headlines on his radio questions were being asked about mps allowances it wasnt that anyone was being corrupt apparently but they were playing the system for all it was worth fox reckoned this tied in to the furore about bankers bonuses and pensions people wanted to scream that it was unfair but there being little they could do about it attention had turned to politicians with their snouts in the trough instead just jealous heatons accusation had rankled because it was accurate tony kaye in particular had seethed and spat as he listed the outgoings and purchases hows he doing it on his salary he kept asking anyone who would listen the answer was he wasnt many of the transactions were paid in cash and heaton couldnt explain why fox stared at the house and imagined glen heaton in bed with his wife then he considered the son she didnt yet know about not unless heaton had confessed the son was eighteen and lived in glasgow with his mother added to which there was sonya michie again kept secret from the wife but then in foxs experience often the wives didnt want to know they suspected they sort of knew anyway but they were happy to feign ignorance and get on with their lives what are you doing here malcolm fox muttered to himself he was half hoping heaton might appear on the doorstep in his dressing gown he would walk to the car and get in then they could talk fox had told breck that charlie brogan was at the centre of everything but something had been niggling him even as hed said it glen heaton was more than unfinished business there was a poison in the man that to foxs mind had infected more carriers than had come to light as yet they were still walking around some of them only dimly aware of the contagion sonya michie was one of them for sure but now fox was wondering about jack broughton and bull wauchope too he had wound his window down he could smell and hear the sea there wasnt another soul about he wondered did it bother him that the world wasnt entirely fair that justice was seldom sufficient there would always be people ready to pocket a wad of banknotes in exchange for a favour there would always be people who played the system and wrung out every penny some people lots of people would keep getting away with it but youre not one of them he told himself and then he saw something movement at the door of heatons bungalow the door itself was opening a man standing silhouetted against the lit hallway he was wearing pyjamas and yes tying the belt of his white towelling robe glen heaton was peering into the darkness his focus directed at foxs volvo fox cursed beneath his breath and turned the ignition the parking space wasnt huge and it took a bit of manoeuvring not to hit the vehicles in front and behind as he eased his own car out not that it mattered heaton seemed content to stand there hands in pockets fox stared straight ahead as he drove off headlights on full beam in an attempt to dazzle the man in the robe right then right again and he was on his way back towards edinburgh the image staying with him throughout glen heaton standing there as if delivered to him and he malcolm fox had bottled it thursday february thursday morning fox woke up to a text from caroline stoddart feeling better as a matter of fact he was the swelling was starting to go down and his palms only stung a little when he rubbed them together his chin was okay so long as he didnt touch it he reckoned he might postpone shaving that particular spot for another day or two as for his back it hurt when he twisted or leaned too far in one direction but it was manageable so he texted her back yes her next and final text told him to be at fettes at ten fox sent a message of his own to jamie breck letting him know hed be tied up until lunchtime breck called back immediately is it stoddart the one and only do you know what youre going to say im going to reiterate that i had nothing to do with vinces death and that none of this is your fault its a plan i suppose what about afterwards thought i might go speak to ernie wishaw why hes a councillor isnt he maybe ive got a problem i want him to help me with fox paused no point you being there jamie breck gave a snort try and stop me havent you got a game of quidnunc to be playing im the one who knows about wishaw or had you forgotten but youve never met him no its risky jamie if word gets back to stoddart or giles if youre going im going breck stated end of story but first there was the little matter of fettes and the grampian complaints the three officers stoddart wilson and mason assumed positions as before when stoddart saw the state of foxs face she stopped what she was doing what happened to you i fell down the stairs her eyes narrowed isnt that usually your sisters excuse at least it means i wasnt shitting you yesterday fox accepted the clipon microphone from mason and fixed it to his shirt before sitting down i suppose not stoddart was saying in reply to foxs remark but i was just about to congratulate you on what not getting into any more trouble in the interim she paused now im not so sure fox leaned forward a little in his chair though the effort cost him a twang of pain you calling me a liar inspector stoddart he asked accusingly no she answered sifting through her paperwork fox ran his fingers down the laminated visitors pass that hung around his neck any news from the faulkner inquiry he asked innocently i wouldnt know she glanced up from her work why did you attack ds dickson i was emotionally fragile would you mind repeating that my sister had just lost her partner he was happy to explain that had an effect on me which i hadnt reckoned with it was only afterwards that i realised the force had made a mistake the force in not cancelling my duties and making me take a few days compassionate leave stoddart sat back in her chair youre shifting the blame fox shrugged im just saying but how come you were watching me inspector who was it ordered the surveillance and what story did they use stoddart gave a cold smile thats confidential information im glad to hear it too many leaks around here for my liking he sat back mimicking her posture shall we get started she asked ready when you are fox told her an hour and a half later he was handing his pass back to frank on the front desk grateful not to have bumped into anyone he knew it would only have meant lying about his bumps and bruises on the other hand tony kaye annie inglis and the others would probably find out anyway fettes was like that on his way to his car fox took a call on his old mobile it was jude just wanting a chat how you doing sis he asked her im okay are your pals still rallying round everybodys been great thats good to hear how about dad have you seen him im probably in his bad books as well i didnt say you were in my bad books she chided him ill try to visit at the weekend maybe we could take dad out somewhere fox was behind the steering wheel by now any news of them releasing the body nobodys told me anything could you maybe put in a word i dont see why not everybody on the team loves me to bits are you being sarcastic malcolm maybe just a little he started the ignition you sure youre okay i think i sound better than you do actually youre probably right ill ring you tomorrow if i can he ended the call and put the car into first he was just easing his foot off the clutch when his new phone rang he exhaled loudly and answered where are you the voice sounded breathless tony is that you where the hell are you tony kaye growled im on lothian road the car was exiting its parking bay youre rubbish at this game foxy ive been lying to my wife since the morning after the honeymoon im not sure what youre getting at fox almost dropped the phone when a body flung itself against the front of the volvo he slammed on the brakes stupid bastard tony kaye had righted himself and stood with his hands cupped to his chest trying to get his breathing back under control his mobile was clutched in his right hand his tongue lolling from his mouth fox left the car running and got out cant remember when i last ran that far his friend was spluttering eggandspoon race probably last year of primary school kaye tried to spit but the long thread of saliva just hung there until he wiped it away with a handkerchief he took a few more gulps of air i cheated mind used chewing gum to fix the egg to the spoon you couldnt have heard already fox was saying wildfire kaye was able to gasp so who did it and why didnt you tell me first explain to me how you know bumped into stoddarts boys in the toilet kaye paused and fox knew what he wanted i was jumped fox duly obliged when was this night before last thanks for the headsup kaye sounded genuinely slighted where did all this happen outside a sauna on the cowgate the inquiry got word that a cab dropped vince faulkner nearby i was retracing his steps kaye was studying foxs injuries whoever it was let you off lightly fox gave a twitch of the head in acknowledgement anyway im touched by your show of concern i was hoping for something a bit more gruesome kaye tried to sound peeved you know something i could post on youtube youre all heart sergeant kaye anything happening i should know about kaye gave a shrug mcewan seemed to think there might be a job for us in the northeast he mentioned it to me a couple of weeks back its been given to strathclyde right kaye stared at him how do you know that mcewan told me shame too id have liked some ammo to tease stoddart and her boys with fox broke off kaye could see he was thinking of something what he asked nothing fox assured him dont give me that why are you miffed about strathclyde getting it because theyre rubbish foxy everybody knows that last time i looked our success rate was twice what theirs is fox nodded slowly thats true he said the two men stood in silence for a moment kaye leaned his backside against the front wheel arch of the volvo was it just a coincidence he asked the attack fox watched as kaye nodded his head it wasnt a mugging nothing got taken someone could have interrupted fox gnawed at his bottom lip he was remembering jack broughton broughton hadnt said much of anything at all about what hed seen or not seen these things happen he eventually offered remember that night we were in a bar and some arsehole went for us with pepper spray kaye chuckled quietly did you ever track him down kayes face tightened a little you dont want to know is that what youd have done to vince faulkner kicked the crap out of him would the world have lost anything in the process fox knew how he wanted to reply he wanted to say yes but then kaye would have asked what exactly and fox didnt have an answer for that ive got to get going he said instead anything else i should know about fox shook his head but then thought of a question you said you lied to your wife the morning after the honeymoon yes what was the lie i told her she was really something in the sack the gyle hadnt really existed when malcolm fox had been growing up in the city the land must have been there of course but with nothing on it and no roads leading to it he remembered walking to the airport one day with friends so they could go planespotting and he would take his bike along the canal reaching wester hailes and beyond maybe the gyle had been fields or wasteland meriting no place in his memory these days it was more a city within a city with its own railway station and vast corporate buildings and a shopping complex ernie wishaws haulage business had its hq in an industrial estate next door to a parcel delivery company lorry cabs sat in a row on the pale concrete apron empty trailers had been unhitched and lined up in similar fashion there were also stacked pallets and a couple of fuel pumps and bundles of rubbish awaiting collection the perimeter fencing unlike neighbouring properties lacked any windblown shreds of plastic and polythene there was a wellequipped garage where a couple of mechanics wrestled with what sounded to fox like an airbrake problem they had a radio playing and one of them was singing along jamie breck had arrived first content to wait in his car outside the compound until fox trundled up they entered the open gates as a convoy of two and parked in front of the garage there was a door to the right with a sign on it saying office the two men greeted one another with a nod how do you want to run this breck asked stretching his neck muscles how about i play the bad cop fox suggested and you play the bad cop too then he offered a smile and a wink lets just see what he has to say he pushed open the door expecting the room beyond to be cramped but it was long and light and airy there were four women and two men working telephones and computers from their individual desks a photocopier was humming a laser printer printing and a fax machine halfway through sending a document there were two smaller offices off to one side one of these was empty in the other sat a woman who removed her glasses as fox and breck walked in the better to scrutinise these new arrivals she rose to her feet smoothing her skirt before leaving the office to greet them im inspector fox fox said handing over one of his business cards is there any chance of a word with mr wishaw the womans glasses hung around her neck on a cord she slipped them back on so she could study the writing on the card what seems to be the problem she asked just something we need to talk to mr wishaw about im mrs wishaw whatever it is im sure i can help you really cant fox informed her looking around the room my colleague called not fifteen minutes ago and was told mr wishaw was here the woman turned her attention to breck isnt that his maserati outside breck decided to ask mrs wishaw looked from one detective to the other hes very busy she countered you probably know that hes a councillor as well as running a successful business we only need five minutes fox said holding up his right hand fingers splayed mrs wishaw had noticed that the desks were quiet the staff were holding their phones to their faces but they were no longer talking fingers had ceased clattering against keyboards hes next door you mean the garage mrs wishaw nodded she meant the garage as they left the office breck added some information for foxs benefit shes his second wife used to be one of the deskjockeys right fox said the two mechanics were finishing off the job one was tall and brawny and young he was gathering together all the tools theyd used the other was much older with wavy silver hair receding at the temples he was below five and a half feet and the waistband of his blue overalls was bulging he was concentrating on wiping his oily hands on an even oilier rag mr wishaw breck said having recognised him at last you two look like cops wishaw stated thats because we are fox told him wishaw glowered at him from under a set of dark bushy eyebrows then turned towards the mechanic aly off you go and get a coffee or something the three men waited until aly had done as hed been told wishaw stuffed the rag into the pocket of his overalls and wandered over towards a workbench there was a concertinastyle toolbox there and he hauled it open notice anything he asked everythings in the right place fox stated after a few seconds thats right know why that is because youre anal breck offered wishaw tried him with the glower but he had decided that fox was the man worth talking to business is all about confidence reason the banks have started teetering is because people are losing confidence someone wants to work with me maybe offer me a contract i always bring them here they see two things a boss whos not afraid of hard work and a boss who makes sure everything runs like clockwork thats why all the lorries are lined up outside and why theyve been given a good wash too same goes for my drivers do you hand them the soap personally breck couldnt help asking wishaw ignored him if theyre going to be late on a pickup or delivery they call ahead and explain why and the explanation better be twentytwo carat because im the very next person they call know what i do then you phone the customer and apologise fox guessed wishaw gave a brusque nod its the way things get done it tends not to be how councils work fox argued wishaw threw his head back and hooted i know that amount of red tape ive tried getting rid of nights ive sat in that chamber and argued till im blue in the face you sit on the housing committee fox said is that right wishaw was quiet for a moment what is it you want he asked we want to ask you about a man called charles brogan charlie wishaw bowed his head and shook it slowly hell of a thing how well did you know him i met him a number of times council business and suchlike we got invites to the same sorts of parties and functions you knew him pretty well then i knew him to talk to when was the last time you spoke to him wishaws eyes met foxs youve probably been through his phone records you tell me fox swallowed and tried to sound nonchalant id rather you did the talking sir wishaw considered this couple of days before he died he finally admitted only for five minutes or so i meant to ask did your firm ever do any work for cbbj fox watched wishaw shake his head so you werent owed money thankfully wishaw had taken the rag from his pocket and was wiping his fingers more thoroughly making little or no difference but the call was business fox persisted calmly i suppose so was he offering you another bung breck interrupted probably begging you by then what did you say the rush of blood to wishaws face was impressive in its immediacy would you be happy to repeat that in front of a lawyer all my colleague meant was fox had his hands held up in supplication i know damned well what he meant the mans face was the colour of cooked beetroot flecks of white were appearing at the corners of his mouth come clean on brogan breck was saying and we might forget all about the bung you handed to your drivers family remember him with the dope stashed in the fuel tank fox turned away from the spluttering wishaw and propelled jamie breck backwards towards the garage opening when they were out of earshot breck gave fox the most fleeting of winks that felt good he whispered slight change of plan fox whispered back you stay here im going to be good cop he removed his hand from brecks chest and turned back towards wishaw reaching him in a few short strides sorry about that he apologised younger officers dont always have the he sought the right word decorum he decided wishaw was rubbing hard at his palms with the rag outrageous he said such an accusation totally unfounded ah but its not is it fox said gently you did give the mans family a sum of money what it comes down to after that is interpretation thats the mistake my colleague made isnt it wishaws silence seemed to concede as much outrageous he echoed but with only half as much force as before its charles brogan we were talking about fox reminded him wishaw gave a sigh thing about men like charlie his whole generation but he broke off and fox knew a bit more effort was required he pretended to be studying the garage youre a lucky man mr wishaw except we both know luck has little or nothing to do with it that fleet of lorries the maserati theyre the result of hard work rather than luck youve as good as said so yourself yes wishaw agreed this was a subject he could talk about sheer bloody hard work i would say graft but youd probably take it the wrong way fox decided this was worth a fullthroated chuckle thats what so many people dont realise wishaw went on buoyed by the effect of his words on the detective ive worked my arse off and i do the same thing in the council chamber to try to make a difference but these days people just want to sit back and let the money and all that goes with it find them thats not the way it works there are businessmen out there wishaw made a stabbing motion with one finger who think money should come easy money from nothing fox guessed as good as wishaw agreed buy a parcel of land sit on it for a year and then sell at a profit or a house or a bunch of flats or whatever it might be if youve got cash in a bank you want a doubledigit rate of interest doesnt matter to you how the bank finances it money from thin air thats what it seems like and nobody asks any questions because that might break the spell your own companys surviving though its hard going i wont deny it but youll work your way through it wishaw nodded vigorously which is why i resent it when when he was wagging a finger towards jamie breck he didnt mean anything sir were just trying to build up a picture of why charles brogan did what he did charlie wishaw calmed again his eyes losing focus as he remembered the man hed known charlie was incredibly likeable genial company all of that but he was a product of his time in a nutshell he got greedy thats what it boils down to he thought that money should come easy and for the first few years it really did but that can make you soft and complacent and gullible wishaw paused and stupid above all it can make you incredibly stupid yet for a while youre still making money he raised a hand im not saying charlie was the worst not even in the bottom fifty or hundred at least he created things he caused buildings to rise fox seemed to recall that brogan had said much the same thing in one of his newspaper interviews but that becomes a problem when nobody wants those buildings he suggested wishaws mouth twitched its when your investors want to be paid back empty buildings might be an investment if you wait long enough same goes for land whats worthless one year can turn to gold the next but none of thats relevant if youve promised a quick return to your investors fox was giving wishaw his full attention who were mr brogans investors it took wishaw fully fifteen seconds to answer that he didnt know im just thankful im not one of the ones waiting for salamander point to turn a profit he was trying for levity and that told malcolm fox something told him hed just been lied to that last time you spoke with him did he call you or did you call him wishaw blinked a couple of times and fixed the detective with a look you must know that from the logs i just want confirmation but there was a change taking place behind wishaws eyes should my lawyer be here he asked i dont think thats necessary im beginning to wonder the man had money troubles and he took his own life end of story not for the police mr wishaw as far as were concerned when someone disappears or dies thats the story just beginning i suppose thats true wishaw offered but ive told you all i can except for the details of that final phone call wishaw considered his response for a further ten or fifteen seconds it was nothing he decided nothing at all he looked down at his overalls i need to get changed theres council business this afternoon another dispute with the tram contractor he offered a curt nod and made to move past fox youre sure you never had any business dealings with mr brogan fox asked not even a tender for some work no and he wasnt trying to persuade you to help him lay some of his tower blocks off on the council wishaw just glared bringing a smile to foxs lips you know a man called paul meldrum mr wishaw the change of tack took wishaw by surprise yes he admitted he works for a firm called lovatt meikle meldrum fox went on theyre in pr but meldrums area of expertise is lobbying im not entirely sure where this is going i was just wondering if it was maybe charles brogan who put you on to the firm in the first place might have been wishaw conceded is it important not really sir thanks again for your time fox paused for a few beats then leaned in towards wishaw and maybe next time well have that lawyer present he added in an undertone libel comes with a hefty price tag wishaw was about to add foxs name but realised he didnt know it im sorry he said i dont think you introduced yourself i gave my card to your daughter fox answered my realisation dawned on wishaw that was my wife then you should be ashamed fox said deciding this was as good a parting shot as any something i should maybe have told you jamie breck said they had dropped foxs car back at the house and were now heading north out of the city fox was a nervous passenger at the best of times and he wasnt liking the rx he felt too low to the ground and the sports seat restricted his movement breck a vital couple of inches shorter and probably half the girth fitted in well but not fox cars like this were not built for people his size and certainly not ones with injured backs what fox asked another thing sometimes it felt as if the mazda was about to mount the kerb other times as if it were straying out into the opposite lane breck always seemed to wait until the final moment before making the correction its about ernie wishaw i didnt let his case drop exactly fox was in two minds about whether to let the conversation continue or suggest that breck should shut up and concentrate on driving curiosity got the better of him how do you mean i mean ive been doing some digging strictly in my own time im one hundred per cent sure he was taking a cut from the trafficking his lorries head over to europe on a weekly basis always tempting to jack up the profit by bringing back some contraband that usually means booze and cigarettes breck nodded there was a sudden vibration in the car as the driversside tyres once more connected with the cats eyes down the middle of the carriageway breck made the adjustment and started talking booze and cigarettes for sure plus porn and anything else that might turn a profit once you know youre not getting caught you might decide to up the stakes a little he paused or it could be that someone just comes along and makes you the right offer fox considered this bruce wauchopes in jail for drugdealing indeed he is you think his sons i cant prove anything as yet but if he was he might turn to ernie wishaw for advice wishaws had the equivalent of a neardeath experience one of his guys is doing time and he was the thickness of a rizla paper away from joining him so wishaw wouldnt smuggle dope on bull wauchopes behalf actually i think he would breck said quietly all it needs is for someone to scare him enough fox thought about it yes the threat of violence against his precious wife or his even more precious fleet of lorries think we might find an answer in dundee isnt it lucky were already headed there and so they were theyd already passed through barnton and were sweeping out into the countryside the road broadening into a proper dual carriageway passing dalmeny and south queensferry on their right in a moment the forth bridges would be visible why are you just telling me this now fox asked maybe i have a problem with trust malcolm have you forgotten how long it took you to tell me i was a suspected paedophile thats different you were under investigation and you my friend were a suspect in the killing of vince faulkner didnt take me long to see that billy giles was wrong in his assumption fox took a moment to digest this so how did you go about your own little inquiry into ernie wishaw i spoke to the drivers wife and her brother i did some digging to see if there was any sudden cash swilling around new tv or car that sort of thing and breck just shrugged i even went to saughton as a visitor you spoke with the lorrydriver he wasnt giving anything away but he knew who you were fox watched breck nod so it could have got back to wishaw or anyone else for that matter i suppose fox was thoughtful could wishaws driver have been working for bull wauchope wauchope seniors doing time for bringing dope in by sea maybe intercontinental lorries started to look a better bet to his son maybe breck conceded youll have heard the stories as often as me port officials sometimes oiling the wheels they take a bung and dont check the cargo too thoroughly breck was nodding fox reached into his pocket for his phone and a slip of paper the one with the number of max dearborns sister who are you calling breck asked a friend maybe he had the ringing tone and a moment later the call was answered by a female voice is that linda dearborn fox asked speaking my names malcolm fox im a colleague of maxs yes hes mentioned you word is youre on suspension funny ive not read about it in the paper plenty time yet malcolm her voice had a teasing quality to it this was probably her method fox reasoned be chatty gossipy maybe your new best friend and then repeat any confidences for the paying public max tells me youre looking into charles brogans disappearance not exactly she corrected him its brogans method of doing business im interested in in particular whether he was trying to bribe a city councillor yes and as a result joanna broughtons set gordon lovatt on you mmm theyre an intriguing couple brogan and broughton joanna you mean there was a momentary silence on the line youre right to add father jack to the mix she eventually said you reckon brogan has done a reggie perrin on us or hes crossed the painlaw in some way and what way would that be malcolm she almost sang his name youre the detective not me my jobs to vacuum up the crumbs think of me as a housemaid that wont be easy when i know your true identity linda and whats that a hardnosed investigative reporter which is what i need you to be for me right now youve got me intrigued big boy it would be useful to know how brogans company is organised maybe its a case of companies plural we dont know the extent of his empire hell have shareholders people he owed money to who exactly are they companies house is the place to start ive already got quite a lot of info including the details of his accountants i suppose i could talk to them but im not sure how helpful theyd be to a journalist i mean on the other hand theyd have to talk to the police sadly as youve already noted im suspended from duty which begs the question whats all this in aid of its in aid of whatever the opposite of suspension is fox told her they were just arriving at the road bridge it was as ever magnificent to the right sat the complex intertwined geometry of the forth rail bridge there was talk of a new bridge being built to relieve the strain on the present road bridge some of the cables were showing their age but where was the money to come from linda dearborn was saying that shed see what she could do one other thing that might be fun for both of us fox added do tell you could look up lovatts firm at the same time get an idea of just how far their tentacles stretch fox ended the call and breck turned the radio back up a little think we can trust her he asked im not that stupid jamie glad to hear it forty minutes later they were on the outskirts of dundee the trip had been brecks idea he hadnt been to the city on business before but a cop hed gone through training with had ended up in tayside cid one phone call later the friend had agreed to meet with them on the quiet how many roundabouts can one city have breck complained as he followed the signs towards the waterfront hed been told to park next to the train station and cross the road to where the discovery was docked fox asked why the boat was moored there i think it was built in dundee fox nodded shackleton took it to the arctic right arctic antarctic who knows whoever had the answer it wasnt mark kelly he was a ds same rank as breck and he was waiting for them by the metal fence in front of the ship fox pretended an interest in the mast and rigging while the two friends shared a brief hug and exchanged comments about hair loss and body mass when breck asked about the boat kelly said hed no idea we going on board or what breck asked its just a landmark jamie i seem to remember navigations not your strong point and dundees a tough gig for the firsttimer come on he led them back across the road and past another roundabout their destination was a café whose clientele seemed to be biding their time until they could be elsewhere once seated with their coffees the real conversation began i took a look at bulls file kelly said keeping his voice low the file didnt come with you breck commented couldnt do it jamie alarm bells would have sounded then lets hope your memorys better than it used to be kelly accepted this with a smile bull keeps being lucky bullets bounce off him metaphorically speaking has anyone tried the other kind fox interrupted there are stories but it seems bulls been taking a few tips from his old man he used to be quite a physical sort if you get my meaning and now now hes building bridges rather than knocking them down this all sounds like code to me jamie breck complained can we go somewhere a bit more private so you can just spit it out kelly leaned across the table towards him bulls been driving up and down scotland with his trusted lieutenant meeting some of the other players the ones that count aberdeen one day lanarkshire the next has this been going on a while fox asked a few months maybe a bit longer it took time for us to notice what was happening you thought maybe he was writing a guidebook breck asked kelly just glowered at him weve no idea what he was doing but you can hazard a guess fox said kelly took a deep breath maybe hes playing peacemaker on his dads behalf or could be hes scared that with the old man inside a competitor will try muscling in then he could be trying to extend his own reach fox added tentacles again kelly nodded at this on the surface of course hes a legitimate businessman of course but not too many of those need muscle like terry vass his lieutenant fox guessed with a criminal record the approximate length of war and peace im assuming drugs play a part in all of this breck interrupted im sure they do kelly snorted but youve got no proof kelly shrugged any help you can give he looked from one man to the other actually you were pretty vague on the phone jamie maybe i should be asking what this is all about its complicated breck replied but it might fox interrupted have to do with a murder and a missing person the missing person being charlie brogan breck added never heard of him kelly said stirring his spoon in his cup hes a developer in edinburgh dont you watch the news mark kelly gave another shrug bad time to be a developer we had one top himself a couple of months back he paused hang on is this the guy with the boat what did you just say fox asked i asked if it was the guy who went missing from his boat fox was shaking his head before that youve got your own dead developer kelly nodded again he was still stirring his coffee and it was driving fox demented another minute or two and hed be snatching the spoon and tossing it the length of the café dont recall the name kelly was saying theres a bunch of highrises theyre demolishing he jumped from one of the upper floors kelly noticed that fox and breck were staring fixedly at one another you dont think theres a connection now the two men were staring at him jamie brecks study darkness had fallen food had been fetched from a chinese takeaway but half of it sat congealing on the worktop in the kitchen breck had opened a bottle of lager for himself while the takeaway had sold fox a couple of cans of irnbru breck had shifted over a little to make room for foxs chair in front of the computer screen and there we were accusing dundee of being parochial fox said as breck found the news item there was a photograph of the tragic suicide he was smiling at somebodys wedding there was a big bold carnation pinned to his jacket lapel the story put his age at sixty but the photo showed a man of thirtyfive or forty his name was philip norquay and hed lived in the city all his life local high school local university local businessman hed come to property developing almost by accident his parents had owned a shop making their home in the flat above on their death there had been lots of interest in the property leading the son to do some detective work turned out there were plans for a new housing estate nearby norquay hung on to his parents place until he could contact a supermarket group who were glad of the chance to knock it down and rebuild paying over the odds for the privilege that had given norquay a taste and by the time he was forty hed built up a fairsized portfolio of rental premises moving on to fullscale development opportunities when his chance came hed made a name for himself by spearheading an attempt to buy the stadiums belonging to both the citys football clubs a new jointshare stadium would be built outside dundee as part of the deal but negotiations collapsed charlie brogan wanted to buy into celtic at one time fox told breck he had plans to pave paradise still norquay was vocal in his support for the regeneration of the city pitching in when the council put forward a proposal to regenerate the waterfront just like brogan breck commented they were going to get rid of that roundabout we walked past fox was tapping his finger against the computer screen and reroute the roadway makes sense breck agreed read further down though the next few paragraphs explained norquays fall from grace he had overstretched himself financially buying up one of the ugliest pieces of real estate around a hotchpotch of s highrise blocks on the citys periphery his plan was to knock the whole thing down and start again but difficulties had presented themselves almost immediately the buildings were stuffed with asbestos which made them expensive to demolish then old mineworkings were discovered meaning half the land was unsuitable for construction without spending a fortune on underpinning in his enthusiasm for the project norquay had paid over the odds as it was when the market tumbled south so did confidence still his suicide had come as a shock to all who knew him he had been at a formal dinner that evening and had seemed relaxed and jovial his wife had sensed no change in him that might indicate growing despair philip was a fighter she had told one reporter remind you of anyone fox asked breck maybe breck conceded but norquays dead for certain not just awol he didnt leave a note didnt visit his lawyer to make sure his will was up to date breck scrolled a little further down the page then clicked on a link to an associated story it didnt add anything to their knowledge according to the search engine there were more than matches still to go but fox had risen to his feet there wasnt much to see from the window but he looked anyway reckon theyre watching us breck asked him no not really fox sipped from his can there was a slight tremor running through him and he didnt know whether to blame the sugar the caffeine or brecks driving on the trip back from dundee you dont think he killed himself breck asked do you breck considered for a moment guy was haemorrhaging money probably about to lose everything and here was this white elephant just sitting there mocking him he climbs to the top and decides to end it except everyone says he wasnt the type maybe they just didnt know him breck leaned back with his hands behind his head okay then whats the alternative he could have been pushed fox gnawed at his bottom lip he was at a dinner told everyone he was headed straight home instead he jumps into his bmw and makes for the asbestos jungle hes just bought i can think of better ways to die jamie me too breck paused could he have been meeting someone either that or they followed him can you get your pal on the phone mark breck picked up his rented mobile what am i asking him mind if i do the talking no breck punched in the number and handed over the phone fox pressed it to his ear that you jamie mark kelly answered mark its malcolm fox jamies here next to me whats got you so excited malcolm we were just looking at some of the stuff on the internet about philip norquay i hope youre on overtime we do this as a hobby mark listen one thing you could help us with fire away did anyone think to check norquays phone records kelly considered for a moment i dont suppose it ever came up the guy killed himself there wasnt anything youd describe as an investigation whats your thinking malcolm just wondering what took him to the block of flats the straw that broke the camels back i suppose i could ask the widow or give us her details and well do it fox suggested there was silence on the line mark you there you dont think he jumped kelly stated chances are thats exactly what he did but with this thing in edinburgh how are the two connected again im not sure they are but they might be it was statement rather than question kelly exhaled noisily causing static on the line you think we might have missed something im not trying to score points here okay look if i get the info to you and you do find anything we come to you first thats not a problem mark how long till you get back to us depends how merry the widow is talk to you soon the phone went dead and fox handed it back to breck he thinks well try to throw some custard in taysides face it might come to that breck said fox nodded but if so he wants to be the one to break the news wouldnt do his career any harm did he say how long wed have to wait fox shook his head so what do we do now i think im going to go home i can run you fox shook his head again the walk will do me good im sure youll want an hour or two on your game he wafted his hand over the top of the computer funny thing is breck told him its lost some of its appeal now the real worlds turned more interesting friday february next morning at eleven am fox had a meeting with linda dearborn there was no resemblance to her brother she was petite and fizzing with energy and her outfit would have had church ministers walking into lamp posts the miniskirt was pleated the bare tanned legs reaching all the way down to palebrown cowboy boots beneath her suede jacket she wore a blouse with the first four buttons undone showing ample bronzed cleavage just a hint of makeup and strawblonde shoulderlength hair she had picked the rendezvous a café called teatree tea on bread street there was a bearded guy behind the counter and he tutted audibly when fox ordered coffee fox had arrived twenty minutes early giving him time to scan the newspaper hed added a cheese scone to his order and settled himself at a table by the window the sun outside had some warmth to it hinting that spring was maybe finally on its way linda dearborn arrived for the meeting ten minutes early she smiled as if in recognition linda he asked anyway i hate to say it she laughed but you do look like a cop i think its the posture or the way your eyes flit around all the time max is just the same she had placed her heavylooking satchel on the chair next to fox well im not sure you look like a newshound fox responded its my day off youve chosen a brave getup she didnt seem to understand bare legs in winter she looked down at them with what this tan cost i cant afford to hide them some of us suffer for our art and my legs are a work of art dont you think what can i get you but she was already bounding towards the counter the proprietor had perked up and knew her order before she got the chance to tell him lapsang souchong with a slice of lemon fox pretended to read his paper while the two of them chatted dearborn stood on tiptoes with her elbows on the counter she twirled a hank of hair while she talked fox tried not to think how attractive she was she was max dearborns sister she was a journalist the proprietor insisted on carrying the tea to the table for her she thanked him with a crinkling of her nose then sat down next to fox rather than across the table from him having removed her satchel from the chair she crossed one leg over the other while he assumed an interest in the art on the walls around them nice place he said its handy my flats on gardner s crescent fox nodded and turned his attention to the window there were two shops across the street one was a hairdressers the other a vets linda dearborn had leaned down to find something in her bag when she placed the laptop on the table she peered down the front of her own blouse almost a wardrobe malfunction there she pretended to apologise does the act always work fox asked fixing his eyes on hers mostly she eventually conceded well its not that i dont appreciate the effort but maybe we could he tapped the laptop dearborn gave a little pout but lifted the screen anyway and switched the machine on fox looked away as she typed in her password twenty seconds and a couple of clicks later and she was angling the screen towards him companies house is all well and good she began but it helps that my newspaper hasnt yet scaled down its business desk the accountants arent even halfway through dealing with everything mr brogan left behind but what seems clear is that cbbj was buoyed in the early days by large injections of cash as far as anyone can tell these werent always accompanied by effective paperwork meaning we dont know where the money came from but there are plenty of other actual shareholders would one of them happen to be called wauchope leisure dearborn ran one longnailed finger down the mouse pad the names and numbers on the screen scrolling with her not quite she said placing the cursor over a name and highlighting it scotfuture wauchope would that company be dundeebased by any chance fox asked dearborn just nodded remember you asked me to look at lovatt meikle meldrums client base they just happen to represent a company called wauchope leisure as far as i can ascertain lmms job was to disguise the sleaze factor in a series of adverts for lapdancing clubs up and down the country meantime wauchopes managing director has been put in jail fancy that fox mused when the journalist saw she wasnt going to get anything more out of him she turned her attention back to the screen there are a lot of small companies listed here private companies meaning they dont have to file much in the way of information about themselves the lads on the business desk were intrigued charles brogan seems to have had friends all over the country inverness aberdeen glasgow kilmarnock motherwell paisley and further afield too newcastle liverpool dublin i dont suppose these friendships survived the financial meltdown fox mused no i dont suppose they did anyone who bought into salamander point for example well nobody seems to think theyll get back more than five pence in the pound ouch and our benighted banks take yet another hit brogan had loans totalling just over eighteen million and he was behind on his payments could they go after his widow unlikely thats the beauty of a limited company is joanna broughtons name on none of the paperwork she wasnt company secretary or anything dearborn was shaking her head she didnt hold a single share yet her initials are right there in the companys name thats why i dug back a little further she was a partner at one time but her husband bought her out around the same time she started her casino does cbbj happen to own a slice of the oliver i dont think so she cupped her chin in her hand and neither does wauchope leisure so wheres this all leading malcolm you tell me you think some of the money in cbbj was dirty is that just an inspired guess she smiled its what my business editor thinks problem is the paper trail is almost impossible to follow maybe if you gave it a bit longer she stared at him her eyes were almost violet he wondered if they were tinted lenses maybe she said then by the way hows suspension treating you cant complain thats funny sort of because im in the complaints you mean he watched her nod story is you were trampling all over your brotherinlaws murder he wasnt my brotherinlaw fox paused and its not a story oh but it might be if you let it the tip of her tongue protruded from between her lips grieving cop errs on the side of zeal thats about as much as you could do with it but now all that zeal seems aimed at charles brogan do you reckon your own zeal will get you anywhere my editor describes me as tenacious but so far you cant prove a link between brogan and ernie wishaw i know they met several times but nobody saw any money change hands fox guessed dearborn angled her head to one side strange isnt it she asked the way he went missing just after your friend vince died took me about fifteen minutes to make the connection vince worked at salamander point she looked like a schoolgirl with a gold star on her latest essay im right arent i and when he didnt say anything see malcolm im not just a pretty face i never thought you were hot water a voice from behind them called it was the proprietor standing with a fresh pot in his hand fox had parked his car on a yellow line outside a warden was hovering as he emerged from the café the man was wondering whether to honour the police sign fox had left on the inside of the windscreen when fox scowled at him the warden decided there might be easier pickings elsewhere fox had offered linda dearborn a lift but shed said she was happy walking her destination was george street for a little window shopping fox could bet that she liked walking knowing male heads were turning as she passed them knowing eyes were fixed on her from cars and vans and office windows he was turning the key in the ignition when his phone his new phone sounded the number belonged to jamie breck morning fox said answering ive just had a call from mark kelly whats he got for us he visited norquays widow she didnt seem fazed by his request she showed him hubbys phone bills mark says the whole house is a shrine shes bought a job lot of photo frames there are hundreds of family pics strewn across the livingroom floor as she sorts them all out she took him into her husbands den the paperwork was immaculate shes got it all boxed in chronological order bank statements bills and receipts credit card stuff and phone bills fox prompted right fox listened as breck picked up a sheet of paper luckily he opted to have everything itemised calls in as well as calls out towards the end of that dinner he was at he got a call from a local number its a payphone in a bar called lowthers mark tells me its pretty grim but slapbang in the centre of town okay call lasted two minutes and forty seconds and do we know his state of mind immediately afterwards mark hadnt thought to go that particular extra mile but youve asked him now hes going to talk to the friends who were with norquay at the dinner i dont suppose itll get us much further no breck drew the word out and fox knew there was something else in your own time jamie he prompted well mark knows lowthers by repute theres often a bit of trouble there on a saturday night except actually the trouble always seems to happen a hundred yards or so from the pub itself out on the street you mean if an argument starts its always taken outside and why would that be fox asked already with an inkling of the answer nobody wants to get on the wrong side of the owners wauchope leisure holdings who else jamie breck said in a way thats a bit of a shame means none of the punters are going to tell us who made the call probably not breck agreed but its certainly got mark interested he needs to ca canny dont worry about him how did your meeting with linda dearborn go was she asking after me your name didnt quite come up shes a little stunner isnt she shes also pretty good at her job theres a link between wauchope and brogans company do you think we could tie wauchope to norquays outfit too we can try or rather mark can its a tayside shout wauchopes company also employs a pr firm let me guess lmm they ran an advertising campaign for lapbars on the sides of buses i remember that do we need to talk to them about it their hqs slapbang next to the parliament maybe for later fox advised get back on the phone to your friend in tayside and see if he can find anything else to tie wauchope to our dundee developer will do whats next on your own list malcolm family fox said signalling out into traffic jude opened the door when she saw it was him she turned and headed back to the living room knowing he would follow her hair and clothes looked like they could do with a wash and she was sunkencheeked there was a cigarette waiting for her in the ashtray on the arm of her chair i thought you werent coming round till the weekend she said this isnt a good day for me to go see dad fox noted the two empty wine bottles on the breakfast bar and the remains of the bottle of cheap vodka on the coffee table jude was seated and pretending an interest in the television but her eyes were heavylidded you okay sis he asked why shouldnt i be she looked up at him and her eyes widened what happened to you fox rubbed his face with his fingers i fell down some stairs her look hardened but then she turned away lifting the cigarette and sucking on it fox wandered into the kitchen and filled the kettle he couldnt see any tea or coffee and there was no milk in the fridge plenty of food though it didnt look as though shed eaten anything since her shopping trip has your pal sandra not been in fox called to his sister not for a few days shes phoned me a couple of times just to check how about mrs pettifer next door visiting her brother in hull hes had a stroke or something so youre having to manage on your own im not an invalid youre not exactly taking care of yourself either fuck off malcolm she slung her legs over the arm of the chair almost knocking the ashtray to the floor fox allowed her a few moments to calm down when i was round here the other day you seemed to be coping opening cupboards he found a fresh jar of instant coffee he rinsed two mugs and decided to add two spoonfuls to judes you okay with black he asked she didnt answer what are you doing for money theres some in the account but probably not much when im reduced to begging on the street ill let you know he picked up some of the mail from the breakfast bar there was a letter explaining that the mortgage repayments were being reduced in line with the recent cut in interest rates did vince have life insurance he asked yes have you done anything about it sandra did phoned them and then got me to sign a letter well thats something fox was sifting through the rest of the mail some of which had yet to be opened there was an o bill addressed to mr v faulkner fox peeled it open eyes on his sisters back he gave a little twitch of the mouth when he saw that it wasnt itemised a hundred and twelve pounds was owing the kettle came to the boil and fox took judes mug through to her you could do with some milk he said handing it over she stubbed out her cigarette and took the drink from him and maybe not so much wine and spirits youre not my dad im the next best thing he reached into his jacket pocket for his wallet when she saw what he was doing she flew from her chair and headed into the kitchen pulling open one of the drawers and coming back into the living room brandishing a wad of banknotes which she flung up into the air in front of him see she said i dont need any of your bloody charity fox stared down at the notes strewn across the carpet jude was back in her chair staring at the tv knowing he was awaiting an explanation i found it she obliged about two grand in total found it where hidden in vinces room upstairs lucky i got to it before your lot turned the place over they mightve pocketed it where did it come from jude managed a shrug winnings from the casino she guessed maybe thats where he was on all those nights he didnt bother coming home he was there on the saturday fox said quietly crouching down and beginning to gather up the cash when he left he took a taxi to the cowgate she wasnt really listening to him the sod kept it from me malcolm hid it away in that bloody room of his with his porn mags and dvds i didnt want anyone to know he was like that thats why i didnt say anything she looked at him again what happened to your face i got into a fight he placed the money on the coffee table did you win not yet this produced a thin but palpable smile she picked up her drink and blew across its surface shouldnt be too hot he told her i added some cold from the tap she took a slurp and squirmed a bit strong he guessed she nodded but took another mouthful theres tinned soup in the cupboard im fine with this she told him but he went into the kitchen anyway and got out a pot the hob was spotless evidence that nothing had been cooked for a few days no dishes in the sink just mugs and glasses fox emptied the soup into the pot it was cream of chicken the same stuff their mum used to give them when they were sick jude he called the police gave you back vinces personal items right yes she said could i take a look at them envelope in the drawer she pointed towards a unit in the living room it had shelves above drawers and cupboards below he found the large padded envelope in the first drawer below it were several folded sheets of unused christmas paper fox reached into the envelope interested in only one thing faulkners mobile phone it had been dusted for prints and was also edged with dirt at some point it had been lying on the ground when fox tried switching it on nothing happened got the charger he asked his sister upstairs landing he gave the soup a stir then headed for the stairs and brought the charger down plugging it into the spare socket next to the kettle when he attached it to the phone a tiny pulsing green light came on fox left it while he poured the soup into a bowl and found a clean spoon there was bread in a bag but it had begun to go mouldy he cut away the green bits and laid what was left on the edge of the bowl youll have to sit at the table for this he said sliding the coffee table closer to judes chair she swung her legs on to the floor and put her mug on the table im not really hungry she warned him but youre going to eat anyway or what or im grounding you young lady it was a passable imitation of their father and jude smiled again before picking up her spoon whats so important about vinces phone just wondering if theres anyone weve not talked to yet the other ones giles and his lot they went through all that maybe i just dont think theyre as good as i am she took her first mouthful of soup savouring its aftertaste know what this reminds me of she said he nodded i was just thinking the same thing myself he went back to the kitchen and switched on the phone his pass numbers four zeros jude called to him figured vince was too lazy to change the default setting on the other hand maybe it also proved that he had little if anything to hide from jude fox punched in the numbers vinces screensaver was a photograph from it showed bobby moore hoisting the world cup it took fox a few moments to figure out how to navigate the phone but eventually he got the call log there were almost two hundred entries he reckoned that giless team would have been interested only in the most recent additions but fox went back further he got a notepad from his pocket and started jotting down the numbers that recurred adding date time and duration some were listed by name jude ronnie garage marooned oliver but many werent hows the soup he asked jude i ate it all up like a good girl she had risen from her chair bringing the empty bowl into the kitchen and depositing it in the sink then she leaned across and pecked him on the cheek whats that for i just felt like it she studied the numbers on his pad any of them look familiar he asked not really you think maybe the person who she broke off unable to finish the sentence she cleared her throat and found a different form of words you think it was someone he knew fox shrugged some of the numbers appeared only once he decided to try one at random and took out his own phone the call was answered by a woman wedgwood she said in a singsong voice sorry wedgwood restaurant fox ended the call and turned to jude wedgwood he prompted she nodded we had dinner there in december she smiled at the memory just the two of you or were the hendrys in tow just the two of us we did manage a social life without sandra and ronnie fox acknowledged this with a grunt there was one number that appeared eleven times between october and january he asked jude again if she recognised it and she shook her head so he made the call hello the voice was quiet hesitant it was a woman again but not a stranger ms broughton fox asked there was no answer this is inspector fox i gave you a lift from leith police station it was a few more moments before she spoke gordon lovatt wasnt very happy about that inspector did charlies diary reach its destination yes and did you take a peek fox took a deep breath ms broughton im calling you from vince faulkners phone yes you remember the name you mentioned him then you went to my casino to watch the cctv footage from the saturday night yes but what im wondering now is why does he have your number and why did the two of you speak on eleven separate occasions between october and january the silence at the other end stretched past twenty seconds fox gave jude a look to gauge her reaction she placed her hand on his arm as if to reassure him ms broughton fox prompted its not my phone he heard her state its charlies the two of them must have been discussing work fox stared at his sister again mr faulkner was pretty low down the food chain its the only explanation broughton said fox thought for a moment youre keeping your husbands phone switched on there was another lengthy pause on the line in case people call he had very many business contacts inspector theres a chance some of them dont know whats happened that makes sense i suppose you suppose but theres one thing that doesnt fox went on the silence stretched again and whats that broughton eventually asked why wasnt the phone on the boat it was on the boat she growled it was returned to me afterwards you understand that ill be telling gordon lovatt about this conversation hes bound to interpret it as further harassment tell him he can interpret it any way he likes and thanks for speaking to me ms broughton fox ended the call and placed the phone on the worktop so thats what youre like when youre working jude commented fox gave a shrug broughton as in joanna broughton she went on the one who owns the oliver thats her vince seems to have known her husband pretty well he sent over champagne one night yes he did did you ever see him talk to vince jude nodded they spoke that night and i think there was another time we bumped into him there she looked at her brother where do you think that money came from malcolm was vince mixed up in something fox gave judes good arm a squeeze offering a smile but no words she lingered a moment then headed back to the living room and the television fox was thinking of his meeting with joanna broughton the penthouse and its bare white walls meeting jack broughton and gordon lovatt at the lift sitting in the car with charlie brogans diary and did you take a peek maybe not thoroughly enough pretty much all that he remembered were the tv shows brogan kept tabs on jude was watching something on the television involving houses and warmer climes television tv for short tv oh christ fox said suddenly jude turned towards him are you all right hed placed a hand to his head and his knees were just about holding his other hand was grasping the edge of the worktop bloody idiot he muttered malcolm im an idiot jude thats all there is to it not better than giles and his team fox shook his head then wished he hadnt the room swam and he had to steady himself you look terrible jude was saying can i do anything when was the last time you ate but fox was making for the livingroom door ill call you he said but ive got to go now is it about vince tell me malcolm is it maybe was as much as fox could manage to say slow down jamie breck said he was dressed as if for jogging and his hair was wet from the shower you look like youve just bitten through a mains cable they had reached brecks living room there was ambient music on the hifi breck sat down and used a remote control to lessen the volume malcolm fox was pacing up and down how can you be so laidback fox asked accusingly what else am i supposed to do someones tried setting you up as a paedophile true and if i start complaining everyone knows you told me you should do it anyway but breck was shaking his head we find out why it happened after that everything falls into place fox paused in his walking you think you know breck folded his arms its both of us they brought us together knowing wed get along start to trust one another youd see it was a setup and maybe tell me meantime id be letting you walk all over the faulkner case once that was established we could both be kicked into touch its other cops then has to be fox had started pacing again whats on your mind malcolm vince and brogan kept phoning one another means they werent just boss and employee the day i took joanna broughton home she gave me brogans diary to hand in at leith there were a lot of mentions of programmes he wanted to watch tv tv that sort of thing fox stopped pacing again and stared at breck remember what mark kelly said bull wauchopes sidekick terry vass breck said quietly nodding to himself same initials they werent tv shows jamie brogan must have been meeting vass now why would that be why would wauchope keep sending his enforcer down to edinburgh brogan owed him money brogan owed him money fox echoed and heres another thing joanna broughton keeps her hubbys phone next to her even now i called and it took her about five seconds to answer so she says its because people might call who dont know whats happened seems plausible breck said with a shrug fox gnawed at his bottom lip then got out his phone and called max dearborn max its malcolm fox linda says you talked to her this morning im going to help her if i can but listen ive got a quick question was charlie brogans phone on the boat we had it checked then gave it back to the wife foxs shoulders slumped he placed his palm over the mouthpiece it was on the boat he told breck why do you want to know dearborn was asking its probably nothing max in fact it is nothing but breck was clicking his fingers trying to get foxs attention hang on a sec fox said placing his hand over the mouthpiece again wouldnt someone like brogan have more than one phone breck asked voice just above a whisper fox took a moment to digest this then spoke to dearborn again max do you happen to know the number of the phone itll take me a minute dearborn was obviously in the inquiry room there was a rustling sound as he cupped the phone between shoulder and chin then a clacking sound as he worked at a keyboard how are things anyway fox decided to ask still no trace of the sod one way or the other you keeping a watch on the widow were thinking about it shed know it was happening maybe okay heres the number dearborn reeled it off thanks max fox said ending the call and looking at breck good tip he said with a nod the numbers dont match breck guessed no so the phone shes keeping beside her isnt the one that was left on the boat no yet she told you it was she did might be the sort of thing better discussed in person if we can get to her fox mused breck suddenly sat bolt upright time is it he asked just gone one breck cursed under his breath im due at fettes at half past that might be a bit tight unless you dont bother changing breck had risen to his feet he studied himself thats an idea he said heres another one im coming with you breck stared at him why because we have no idea who we can trust on our own patch brecks eyes narrowed stoddart malcolm fox slipped his hands into his pockets and offered a shrug shes the complaints breck protested so am i remember lets fight about it on the way if youre not convinced i wont get out of the car fox didnt get out of the car it was his car and he sat in the drivers seat with the radio playing watching as breck marched into police hq he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel staring ahead of him but with his eyes focused on nothing after five minutes he heard a noise and turned his head breck was coming back and he was not alone inspector caroline stoddart looked less than enthusiastic her two colleagues wilson and mason watched from the doorway fox got out of the car not knowing quite what to say breck skipped forward and opened the passengerside door for stoddart she glared at fox you two were told to cease communication were bad boys breck seemed to concur stoddart stood her ground for a moment then ducked her head and got into the car breck offered fox a wink before climbing into the back fox stood for a further moment staring at wilson and mason they turned and headed back indoors lets get this little pantomime over with stoddart was saying fox sat back down and closed his door all right she went on youve got five minutes might take a bit longer breck warned her then to fox wed be better doing this elsewhere if walls have ears then windows definitely have eyes fox looked at the building realised breck had a point and switched the engine on am i being abducted stoddart complained you can leave any time you like breck assured her but what were about to tell you trust me this isnt exactly the best place do i just drive around fox asked eyes on the rearview mirror he was aware of stoddart next to him tugging at the hem of her skirt as long as you can drive and talk at the same time breck responded so malcolm fox drove their route took them around the periphery of the botanic gardens and uphill towards the city centre traffic became sluggish and fox said less concentrating his attention on the road breck filled in and soon they were crossing the top of leith walk royal terrace then abbeyhill and down past the parliament building and the palace of holyrood before entering holyrood park itself past st margarets loch and entering the oneway section that snaked around the immensity of arthurs seat it felt like the middle of nowhere there were stretches where no signs of habitation could be glimpsed just heath and hill the drive had lasted almost thirty minutes and stoddart was asking fox to pull over a bad place to leave us breck warned her taxis dont come by here she looked around her where is here fox had brought the car to a stop next to dunsapie loch a couple of joggers trotted past a young mother had paused with her baby buggy there was a nest in the middle of the loch in a few weeks a pair of swans would be setting up home another side of edinburgh breck was explaining to stoddart id be happy to act the tour guide some time she said nothing to this just opened her door and tried to get out she flinched perhaps thinking they were holding her down but it was only her seat belt she unlocked it and stepped from the car slamming the door behind her what now breck muttered fox met his eyes in the rearview breck had been sounding enthusiastic and confident but it had been a front inwardly he was all nerves give her a minute fox said stoddart was standing with arms folded legs slightly apart her eyes on the loch and the view beyond but say she walks say she goes straight to your boss or mine then thats what she does breck stared out at her she thinks were spinning her a line maybe conniving together ever since we were put on suspension and this is all we could come up with thats what shes thinking jamie you dont know what shes thinking fox muttered hands wringing the life out of the steering wheel shes corporate malcolm same as you used to be shes not about to break ranks she just did fox paused until he had brecks full attention she got into the car didnt she left her cronies back at the homestead thats not exactly company policy good point breck agreed then wheres she going the answer was she was heading towards an incline away from the road she had to clamber up it slipping a couple of times in her sensible shoes fox didnt think there was anything on the other side until you reached duddingston she paused at the top of the outcrop then turned her head towards the car lets go see the lady fox said drawing the key from the ignition she had found a dry mossfringed rock to sit on she was huddled over arms on her knees wind whipping at her hair the pose made her look younger she could have been a teenager mulling over some perceived injustice you asked a good question she told fox he had crouched down next to her breck standing off to one side with his hands stuffed into the front of his fleece its the timing thats the one thing that niggles in all this just the one breck gave a hoot of disbelief nothing else youve told me has any proof attached but inspector fox appeared on our radar several days before vince faulkners murder ive wondered at that myself good for you breck said while foxs eyes warned him to shut up someone must have given you a reason fox stated quietly stoddart shook her head it doesnt always work like that then after a pause you should know yes he knew someone higher up the command chain just had to give you the nod they were the ones taking care of the paperwork they were the ones who would take responsibility all you had to do was watch and record what you saw there had been a case a few years back a force down in england a chief constable who suspected a junior officer of an affair with his wife had put a surveillance on the man as far as the team was concerned the paperwork was in order and the boss could do as he pleased who did you get the order from fox asked quietly my boss she eventually answered but he got it from the dcc meaning the deputy chief constable grampian police so someone must have gone to the dcc breck was saying roles had been reversed breck had started pacing now while fox felt an almost unnatural calm theres something else stoddart broke off and raised her eyes to the heavens i could get in so much trouble for this meaning you believe us fox asked her maybe she replied see theres this she sought the right words theres been a rumour that something went badly wrong on a murder case a few months back the victim was a kid and cid went after his family turned out the killer had form and was living only a couple of streets away there was coverup after coverup trying to paper over the cracks you think thats what the complaints in edinburgh were going to be looking into fox asked stoddart shrugged its become strathclydes case instead she said but everyone knows strathclyde are secondraters yes they are stoddart agreed fox was thoughtful does that sound like a tradeoff to you the bosses in edinburgh saying that if aberdeen puts one of our men under surveillance well find an excuse not to come chasing you maybe she said again she had clasped her hands between her knees and one of her feet was pumping up and down are you cold do you want to go back to the car what do i tell wilson and mason depends how much you trust them breck said he was taking swipes with his trainers at the tufts of grass reason we came to you in the first place is we dont know who we can trust i can see that she looked from fox to breck and back again so what are you going to do we might try talking to terry vass fox said so if were found floating facedown in the tay breck went on at least youll know where to start stoddart managed the beginnings of a smile it is a bit chilly up here she said getting to her feet colder than aberdeen fox teased but she took the question seriously in a funny way yes the three of them started back towards the car i know ive not been here long but theres something about this city something lacking blame the trams breck joked its what everybody else does but fox stayed silent he thought he knew what she meant people in edinburgh might be quick to take offence but they were slow to do anything about it other than seethe and meantime on the outside they seemed reticent and unemotional it was as if there were some vast game of poker being played and no one wanted to give anything away he caught stoddarts eye and nodded slowly but she was retreating back into her own shell and didnt respond what would she say at fettes how would she frame her report might she begin to resent them for dragging her into their story a story she wanted no part of as they reached the car she stopped with her hand on the door handle maybe ill walk she said you sure breck asked but fox knew shed made up her mind its downhill from here he explained pointing youll come to holyrood park road and that leads out on to dalkeith road should be taxis there ill be fine she slid her hands into her pockets youve given me a lot to think about then she paused and fixed breck with a look but ill still need you to come in for interview ds breck say tomorrow at nine breck scowled tomorrows saturday we dont take weekends off ds breck not on the taxpayers tab she waved and headed down the footpath breck got into the passenger seat and shut the door whats the point of pulling me in for another q and a weve just filled her in on every sodding thing its for her colleagues benefit so they dont get more suspicious than they probably already are fox started the car and released the handbrake ten seconds later they were passing her she kept her eyes to the ground as if the car and its occupants were strangers to her have we just made a huge fucking mistake breck asked if so fox reassured him we can always blame the trams that evening breck was going for a meal with annabel cartwright fox had asked which restaurant tom kitchins place booked it before all this blew up breck had paused im sure we could squeeze in an extra chair but fox had shaken his head brogan used to take joanna there he commented how do you know it was in his diary afterwards thinking back on this exchange hed felt gratified that breck had asked him to come to the meal it was the act of a friend or at the very least the act of a man with little to hide fox had asked breck if he was any nearer to telling annabel about the website later was all breck had said fox had gone out to his car and driven to minters texting tony kaye to let him know he was on his way when he was five minutes from his destination a reply had arrived from kaye cant make it sorry tk another minute later there was a ps joe n gilchrist might be there fox wasnt sure that he wanted to see joe naysmith and his new best friend on the other hand he couldnt be bothered turning back and the deal was sealed when a car drew out of a parking bay just as fox was arriving he backed the volvo in and checked that he didnt need to pay for a ticket at this hour turned out hed beaten the system by a good five minutes he locked the car and crossed the road to minters there wasnt anyone standing at the bar and no quiz show on the tv the barmaid was young with tattooed arms and pink streaks in her hair fox looked around the woman kaye knew was chatting with a friend at a corner table recognising fox she gave him a wave fox dredged up her name margaret sime the drink in front of her looked like a brandy and soda her cigarettes and lighter sat at the ready fox nodded back a greeting and ordered a tomato juice do you want it spicy the barmaid asked her accent was eastern european thanks fox said and a round of drinks for the table over there then as she went about her business are you polish latvian she corrected him sorry she shrugged i get that a lot you scots are used to the poles invading your country i hear a lot of them are heading home she nodded at this the pound is not so strong and people are getting angry about the exchange rate she shook the bottle of tomato juice before opening it what i mean is jobs are becoming difficult to find you dont mind immigrants when theyre not stealing work from you is that what youre doing she was adding tabasco to the drink nobodys complained as yet not to my face what would you do if they did she made a claw of her free hand the nails were long and looked sharp i bite too she added then she rang up the drinks fox was trying to decide where to sit when the door opened and naysmith came in followed by gilchrist fox noticed that joes whole demeanour had changed he rolled his shoulders when he walked as if filled with new confidence his smile to fox was that of an equal rather than an understudy a couple of paces behind him gilchrist had his hands in his pockets seemingly pleased with the transformation and ready to take credit for it hiya foxy naysmith said voice louder than usual joe fox said what are you having pint of lager thanks gilchrist added that hed take a half of cider the barmaid had just returned from delivering the drinks to mrs sime and her friend she started pouring as fox dug into his pocket for more cash hows it going naysmith was asking he went so far as to place a hand on foxs shoulder as if to console him fox glared at the hand until it was removed gilchrist pursed his lips trying to suppress a grin still suspended fox answered naysmith whats keeping kaye from his usual skinful crisis at home naysmith explained mrs kaye says if he doesnt start spending some time there shes going to walk so now we know who wears the trousers gilchrist added from over naysmiths shoulder naysmith laughed and nodded fox didnt know whether to be impressed or outraged it had taken the interloper only a few days to turn joe naysmith around the notion of joe making jokes about tony kaye laughing at domestic troubles gossiping within hearing distance of a barmaid with fox out of the picture kaye was team leader and now his authority was being eroded from within malcolm fox didnt like it he didnt like the way joe had changed or had let himself be remoulded what happened to your face gilchrist was asking none of your business fox answered lets grab a seat naysmith was saying oblivious to foxs scowl of disapproval gilchrist had seen it though and understood perfectly the smile he gave was lopsided and humourless divide and conquer fox had seen it before in his career a team was seldom a team there would always be the naysayer the dissenting voice the stirrer you either gelded them or you moved them elsewhere one cop hed known had been offered a promotion to pastures new but had asked for it to be offered to a rival why to move the bastard on and leave the rest of the crew intact fox wasnt sure hed have done the same maybe now he would but not until recently until recently hed have taken the promotion and moved on leaving his old team to its troubles bloody quiet in the office naysmith was saying bobs talking about us taking on some of the meatandpotatoes stuff im not missed then fox asked of course you are but if i was still there you wouldnt be fox gestured towards gilchrist its not as cloakanddagger as i was expecting gilchrist complained joes told me about some of your previous work i wouldnt have minded a piece of that dont go getting too comfy fox warned him i could be back at my desk any day itll happen malcolm naysmith assured him but fox was staring at gilchrist and gilchrist didnt seem so sure fox got to his feet the legs of his chair scraping against the floor joe he said i need a word with your compadre then this time to gilchrist outside it sounded like an order because that was what it was gilchrist however was in no rush he took another sip of cider and slowly placed the glass on its beer mat that okay with you he asked naysmith joe naysmith nodded uncertainly fox had waited as long as he could and was now striding towards the door see you later the barmaid called to him for definite he answered her outside he took several deep breaths his heart was pumping and there was a hissing in his ears gilchrist didnt just annoy him it went well beyond that the door behind him swung open fox grabbed gilchrist by his lapels and drew him forwards then slammed him back against the stone wall gilchrist was staring at foxs bunched fists he could boast almost half his opponents body weight and none of his indignation there wasnt going to be a fight do what youve got to do was all he said turning his head so fox couldnt make eye contact youre a turd fox said his voice rasping whats worse youre the turd who got me into this so im going to ask you again who was it brought jamie breck to you why does it matter it just does you going to slap me about a bit we could compare bruises after fox pulled gilchrist forward then hurled him into the wall again mcewans going to love this when i tell him whatever you like fox said all i want to know is whose idea was it you already know i dont i think you do you just dont want to believe it she wanted me gone fox never ever liked me sure i was keen on a move but i didnt have anything to negotiate with she did fox had loosened his grip you mean annie inglis now gilchrist turned his eyes towards him who else youre lying fine doesnt matter you asked me the question and ive given you the only answer ive got inglis was the one who said we were going to ask the complaints for help and it was your name she had was it inglis who called you that night to cancel the surveillance gilchrist hesitated and fox knew that whatever came out of his mouth it wouldnt be the truth youre still a turd fox stated breaking the silence i want you to lay off joe lay off him i cant get away from him you and kaye must have treated him like shit fox released his grip completely his hands falling to his sides im coming back he said quietly and thats when they move me elsewhere anywhere annie inglis isnt gilchrist was straightening his jacket are we finished here fox shook his head whether it was annie inglis or you the order had to come from somebody upstairs so go ask inglis ill definitely do that fox paused remembering something do you recall me asking what was happening about simeon latham you told me the aussies were readying to go to trial but when i spoke to someone on the inquiry they contradicted that so so you lied gilchrist shook his head its what i was told how often do you want me to say it go ask your girlfriend he looked fox up and down except shes not is she not now shes got what she needed from you gilchrist gave a smirk there was that look of desperation about you first time you walked into the office wearing your braces and your red tie hoping theyd get you noticed annie inglis is good at her job fox shes good at pretending to be what shes not she does it each and every day online the door was opening fox expected to see naysmith but it was margaret sime cigarette at the ready she assessed the scene in an instant no nonsense lads she warned them we done gilchrist asked fox fox just nodded and gilchrist headed back inside since i first set eyes on that young man margaret sime commented as she lit her cigarette ive had just the one thought whats that fox felt compelled to ask hes got a face deserving of a good hard skelp sorry i let you down mrs sime fox apologised he spent an hour on the sofa with the tv playing sound turned down he was wondering what sort of conversation he could have with detective sergeant annie inglis she had invited him into her home made up with him after their fallingout was he really now going to accuse her of setting him up in the first place was he going to accept gilchrist at face value if so then inglis had set jamie breck up too fox thought about deputy chief constable adam traynor confronting him with bad billy giles in the interview room at torphichen then he spooled further back to the complaints office mcewan teasing him chief thinks theres the whiff of something septic up in aberdeen after the chat with stoddart foxs thinking was that a deal had been done but if all of this had been the chief constables idea why would he have hinted to mcewan that the team might have to investigate grampian police no it had to be traynor didnt it and that was when fox knew he had his question he swung his legs off the sofa and reached over to the coffee table for his phone punching in annie ingliss number when she answered he hesitated hello she said her voice taking on an edge hello its me fox eventually admitted he was gouging his thumb into the space between his eyebrows just above the bridge of his nose eyes screwed shut malcolm whats the matter you sound just a yes or no answer annie thats all i need and i wont bother you again there was silence on the line when she spoke it was with a tone of concern malcolm whats happened do you want me to come over one question annie he persisted im not sure i want to hear it youre in a bit of a state malcolm maybe wait till tomorrow annie he swallowed hard what did traynor promise you he listened to the silence if you brought me in on jamie breck hed move gilchrist out was that the deal was that all it took malcolm just answer im putting the phone down i deserve to be told annie this whole things a stitchup and it wouldnt have worked without you but he was talking to the dial tone shed hung up on him fox cursed and considered calling her again but he doubted she would answer he could drive to her flat keep his finger pressed to her buzzer but she wouldnt let him in she was too wise too wise and too calculating good at pretending to be what shes not fox paced the room he had half a mind to call jamie but jamie was wining and dining annabel and how come he was doing that why wasnt he pacing his own living room snarling at the unfairness of it all fox grabbed his phone again and made the call hang on a sec breck said upon answering im taking this outside then to annabel its malcolm sweetheart tell her im sorry for butting in fox said i will when i get back to the table nice dinner what is it that cant wait till morning malcolm fox listened to the sound of a door opening and closing the atmosphere changed breck had stepped out of the restaurant fox thought he could hear distant traffic the sounds of the city at night if it wasnt urgent jamie but obviously it is so lets hear it fox began to walk a diagonal of the room and explained as best he could breck didnt interrupt once except to posit the theory that gilchrist being so keen to take a beating might well be a masochist when fox finished there was silence for a good fifteen seconds yes breck eventually said well you mean youd already figured this out fox blurted out sinking down on to the sofa im a gamer malcolm roleplaying games and thats just what this has been there are roles someone knew wed end up playing id get to like you youd come to trust me and wed end up with our careers blown to smithereens because of it its down to our natures malcolm breck paused weve been played by one of our own our deputy chief constable im not sure that really matters whats more important is the why and have you come to any other conclusions ones youve seen fit to keep from me were back in the game malcolm we got blown up once but they misjudged us weve got a second life and thats down to our natures too im not sure i follow you dont need to all this work weve been doing breck paused to correct himself work youve been doing its leading to one thing and one thing only and whats that endgame breck paused once more theyre going to have to destroy us again and thats when well know the who and the why how can you sound so bloody calm because thats how i feel breck gave a laugh a tired laugh but a laugh all the same remember when we talked in the car on the way back from the casino i remember youre not a spectator any more is that necessarily a good thing i dont know what do you think i just want this done and dusted one way or the other that doesnt sound like the old cautious malcolm fox sorry i interrupted your dinner jamie im sure well talk tomorrow malcolm maybe ill call after my meeting with stoddart meantime ive got razorfish and carpaccio of scallop waiting for me rather you than me fox ended the call and went into the kitchen appletiser various fruit teas rooiboos decaf coffee none of it appealed he wanted something altogether edgier and more lifeaffirming he thought back to the spiced tomato juice in minters and imagined it with the added injection of a thirtyfivecentilitre shot of smirnoff in your dreams foxy he told himself but he could taste it all the same smooth at the back of his throat and then the burn as it trickled its way downwards into his belly vodka had been his childhood drink swigs stolen from the cupboard where the bottles were kept through his teenage years hed shifted to rum southern comfort glayva and whisky coming back to vodka again for a short second honeymoon before a dangerous liaison with gin then whisky again the good stuff this time round and always with beer and wine wine and beer lunches and dinners and inbetweeners kidding himself that a champagne breakfast with elaine didnt count kahlua hed never drunk kahlua nor had he got far with the huge variety of alcopops if he wanted lemonade in his vodka he would add it himself along with a few splashes of angostura as a fiveyearold for an experiment hed mixed a couple of spoonfuls of creamola foam into a glass of vodka his father had torn a strip off him for that and had moved the alcohol to a higher shelf in the pantry not high enough though fox went back through to the living room and decided to close the curtains there was a car parked across the street its lights were off but its engine was still running there was a figure in the drivers seat fox finished the job at hand then headed upstairs in darkness in the main bedroom he stuck close to the walls as he approached the window the car was a darkcoloured sleeklooking saloon the angle didnt allow him any view of the number plate fox thought he could hear music yes coming from the car nothing he recognised but growing in volume a neighbour across the street opened their own curtains to peer out but then closed them again and didnt come to the door a black cab stopped to let a couple out theyd obviously been to the latenight shopping in town the wife was toting a couple of expensivelooking carrier bags the husbands name was joe sillars fox had met him a few times to talk to theyd only been in the street a couple of months husband and wife stared at the loudly parked car as their cab rumbled away they had a quick word with one another and decided not to get involved the driver acknowledged this by sliding his front windows down and now fox recognised the song it was called the saints are coming it was by an old punk outfit called the skids fox had heard it at many a party in his youth but hed listened to it more recently too after glen heaton had mentioned it at one of their interviews bloody fantastic song a real rallying call fox had asked him if he thought of himself as one of the saints but heaton had just punched the air belting out the first couple of lines the music outside had stopped but then started again the bloody thing was on repeat a fist was emerging into the night from the driversside window glen heaton was singing his heart out fox walked downstairs on unsteady legs he stopped in the doorway outside the living room there were things he could do calls he could make he could hear bass and drums join the guitar as heaton cranked the volume up another notch fox grabbed his jacket and headed outside pausing for a moment on the doorstep then down the garden path breathing the night air opening the gate crossing the road heaton watching him all the time fist no longer visible but still singing along when fox was a couple of feet away the music died the silence was punctuated only by the alfas engine ticking over knew youd twig eventually heaton said what are you doing here youre not the only one who can sit around outside peoples houses is that what this is did you think i hadnt clocked you skulking in the dark scuttling away as soon as you saw me coming but im bigger than you fox i saw you coming and im still here what do you want heaton itll never come to trial you know that right youll be tried fairly in a court of law and then youll go to jail heaton puffed out his cheeks and exhaled theres no telling some people did your pal giles give you my address maybe you just wanted to check the bruises now that you mention it heaton angled his head not that you were much of a looker to start with still i must stand whoever did it a couple of drinks youre saying it wasnt you heaton gave a smirk trust me i wouldnt be slow to take the credit so you werent visiting your girlfriends sauna on tuesday night foxs spirits lifted when he saw the effect his words had sonya michie heaton we know all about her even if your wife doesnt then theres your son the driversside door flew open fox stood back putting some distance between himself and heaton it struck him that they were the same height and probably much the same weight there was more muscle on heaton the complaints had followed him to his gym a few times and almost certainly more aggression in him but they werent so dissimilar heaton seemed to think better about making a move instead he started to light a cigarette flicking the spent match on to the roadway so it fell just short of foxs shoes what sort of cop he drawled gets his kicks playing peeping tom raking through rubbish bins sneaking around behind peoples backs fox thought about folding his arms but didnt he needed to be ready in case heaton tried something how is it he asked back we never connected you to jack broughton heaton glared at him maybe because there is no connection sonya michies a connection fox watched heatons face muscles stiffen careful what you say heaton cautioned besides shes ancient history not so ancient a few months back you were still seeing her you stopped to have a chat with her outside the cowgate sauna heaton took a couple of seconds to work it out breck told you he said with a sneer jack broughtons a sleeping partner in the sauna fox went on bit more meat to add to your file something you might end up being asked about at the trial slowly heaton folded his arms meaning he wasnt about to attack fox allowed his shoulders to unknot a little ive already told you it wont come to that you ever been inside that sauna heaton is that where you met her maybe you bumped into jack broughton there or it could have been the lapdancing bar on lothian road the one owned by bull wauchope never been near the place the cigarette stayed in the corner of heatons mouth as he spoke youve been to the oliver though the casino heatons eyes narrowed it could just have been the smoke but fox didnt think so yeah ive lost the odd quid there so youll know broughtons daughter she runs the show shes wearing well heaton acknowledged with a nod of the head did she ever introduce you to her husband charlie brogan never had the pleasure what about bull wauchope heaton shook his head and the company that owns the sauna belongs to bulls old man rather than bull himself but bulls in charge for the foreseeable fox argued might be a short tenure i hear bruce seniors spending a small fortune on lawyers theyre picking the original case apart looking for anything that screams mistrial so bulls not got long to make his mark fox was thoughtful whats any of this got to do with you fox thats my business well lets see if i can guess heaton unfolded his arms and removed the cigarette from his mouth flicking ash on to the ground your sisters man gets himself killed he worked on a building project that project was about to doom charlie brogan to bankruptcy heaton paused and youre trying to connect brogan to bull wauchope the connections already there fox stated bulls not a stupid man some people think he is and that suits him means they underestimate him right up to the moment when he pulverises them did charlie brogan underestimate him heaton smiled to himself why should i tell you anything they say confessions good for the soul fox paused and maybe i could see to it that the stuff in your file about sonya michie gets lost in the system you think it bothers me that much heaton watched as fox shrugged youd have crossed a line fox hard to go back to the complaints after that i doubt im going back anyway heaton stared at him for a full quarterminute when it comes time for the fiscal to talk to you i could say mistakes were made i could suddenly remember that some procedure or other wasnt followed then theyd have to chuck the case out heaton said quietly ten minutes ago you said it was going to trial fox nodded slowly whats changed me fox stated ive changed see ive decided right of this minute that youre not important youll fuck up in future and someone will nab you then for now youre a low priority i want answers to other questions heaton managed a wry smile how do i know youll do it you dont case like this fiscal might take months or years getting it ready for trial and all that time im at home with my feet up and the salary going into my bank account but thats not you glen its not what you were made for youd go stircrazy heaton was thoughtful so the state of play is ive no guarantees i can trust you theres stuff you want from me and we still hate one anothers guts in a nutshell fox agreed do i get to come inside heaton nodded towards foxs house no in that case get in the car im freezing my balls off out here heaton didnt wait for fox to agree he got back in behind the steering wheel closed the door and slid the window shut fox stood his ground for a few seconds more watching heaton avoid eye contact then he walked around to the cars passenger side and got in the interior of the alfa smelt new leather and polish and carpets you dont smoke in the car he commented is that because your wife doesnt like it heaton gave a snort so say your piece fox prompted youre right about bull not having long to make his mark his plan was to act as a broker for all the other bosses he told them he could launder their dirty money by putting it into property and property development did jack broughton tell you this fox asked heaton turned his head towards him charlie brogan told me you said youd never met him i lied but heres the thing now you know this theres every chance youll end up the same way as him there was a developer in dundee fox was thinking aloud when he lost wauchope some money he turned up dead did terry vass kill him heatons eyebrows lifted a millimetre you seem to know a hell of a lot im getting there so brogan and the dundee developer suddenly had a bunch of negative equity and wauchope wanted his money out because it wasnt actually his whats vince faulkner got to do with any of this you ever see charlie brogan he never had much heft vince was like his bodyguard thats maybe too strong but when you go to a meeting you want someone at your back fox took a moment to mull this over remember a few months back one of ernie wishaws drivers was caught with a consignment of dope i remember rumour is you were feeding information back to wishaw breck again glen heaton spat youre a regular gun for hire arent you and that means you know a lot is that why they need to protect you what do you mean ever since i handed your case over to the fiscals office thereve been people following me trying to set me up and scare me off i dont know anything about that your good friend billy giles hasnt dropped any hints im finished talking fox just remember what i said way things are going you might not be around to see me stand trial not that thats going to happen exactly heaton paused now get out of my fucking car fox stayed put when people speak up for you they say you always got results youd do a favour for one villain and that villain would repay the debt with a titbit about a competitor is that whats happening here heaton someones told you to give me wauchope heaton stared at him get out of the car he repeated fox got out the music blared back into life as heaton revved the engine hard before setting off a neighbour peered from behind the curtains of her livingroom window fox didnt bother trying to apologise what was the point he stuffed his hands into his pockets and headed back indoors saturday february what makes you think you can trust him jamie breck asked you reckon he was lying fox and breck were discussing glen heaton they were seated in foxs volvo it was eight oclock in the morning daylight was definitely coming earlier as spring stopped cowering breck didnt respond to foxs question probably because he didnt have the answer he held a cardboard beaker of coffee in both hands it was from a bakers and was now lukewarm as well as weak fox had already emptied his out of the driversside window they were parked by a set of wroughtiron gates waiting for those gates to open twenty minutes breck muttered checking his watch kids dont wear watches any more have you noticed that what breck turned his head towards him they use their phones thats how they tell the time what are you talking about just making conversation how was the carpaccio last night fine toms a great chef did you apologise to annabel for my phone call she forgives you and i still dont think you can trust glen heaton who said i was going to trust him someones using him to send us a message what we do with it is up to us youve thought it through breck stared at fox but then something caught his attention hang on whats that noise it was the low humming of a motor accompanied by the rattle of a metal grille as it slowly opened fox turned the key in the ignition and waited seebee house boasted an underground car park and one of the residents was about to head out from his vantage point fox could only see the top few inches of the grille that protected the slope down into the car park but it was sliding upwards all right and now he could make out the purring of a car engine porsche breck drawled bet you any money you like yes a silver porsche driven by a man who didnt really need the sunglasses he was wearing it was light out but there was no sun as yet the gates seemed to shiver then opened inwards slowly the porsche had to bide its time though it sounded impatient as soon as the gap allowed it sped out of the compound and past foxs car fox drove inside and parked at the front door just as on his previous visit he was out of the car before the gates had started to close again did you recognise him breck asked you mean the driver fox nodded gordon lovatt bit early for a pr meeting isnt it fox agreed that it was he was standing by the intercom his finger pressed to the bell for the penthouse there was a little camera watching him and he stared into its lens what do you want a voice asked from the speaker just a quick word ms broughton what about mr brogan theres some news im not dressed yet i thought you were used to hosting meetings in your nightie what do you mean i could have sworn i just saw gordon lovatts porsche as the silence stretched fox locked eyes with jamie breck breck was whistling but without making any noise it really cant wait joanna broughtons voice crackled from the metal speaker it really cant fox confirmed the door buzzed as if in irritation fox pushed at it and it opened the foyer was deserted fox led the way to the triplexs private lift and pushed the button it arrived and they got in fox pressed the button and the p sign lit up the doors beginning to close he recalled meeting jack broughton and gordon lovatt on his previous visit they had gained access to the compound without needing anyone to open the gates for them at the time fox had reckoned jack broughton must own one of the little remoteopening boxes gifted to him by daddys little girl but now he was beginning to wonder when they reached joanna broughtons floor the door to her apartment was standing open in readiness joanna broughton was fully dressed her hair and makeup immaculate fast work fox commented what is it you want to tell me she asked she sounded in a hurry but that wasnt foxs problem you know ds breck he asked by way of introduction as breck busied himself closing the door breck waved a hand in greeting without making eye contact he was too busy examining the view nice he said very nice yours for three million she snapped folding her arms and placing one foot in front of the other ready for combat i imagine mr brogan would sell too fox said sliding his hands into his pockets but the markets against him and it would still be a drop in the ocean he paused locking his eyes on broughtons how much is he into them for joanna i dont know what you mean bull wauchope and his syndicate fox informed her weve been trying to work it out ds breck and me could be anywhere from ten to a hundred million cbbj owns a lot more real estate than either of us realised a journalists been doing some research hunting lodges in the highlands with thousands of acres attached a couple of islands land in dubai a few dozen flats on spec sites in london and bristol and cardiff all of it bought at the height of the boom a boom nobody thought was about to be punctured he was in the middle of setting up a company in bermuda wasnt he thats something else the journalist learned soon it would all have been offshore and a damned sight more secret but then everybody got twitchy and wanted their money back wanted it in the same cold hard cash theyd given him to launder in the first place during this speech joanna broughtons face had shown no emotion she hadnt so much as blinked but when fox paused she turned away and headed for one of the cream leather sofas settling herself there and making sure her kneelength skirt didnt reveal anything she didnt want it to you said you had news she said coolly im not hearing any what was gordon lovatt doing here she glared at him the police force is leaking like a sieve mostly to that reporter you mentioned gordon is preparing a response she paused i dare say youve been speaking to her too dripping poison into her ear thats from hamlet isnt it breck said hands behind his back pretending still to be interested in the panorama that time i dropped you home fox started to ask regaining her attention when i mentioned vince faulkners name it didnt seem to mean anything to you why should it your husband used him on occasions specifically occasions when he feared he might be in for a thumping i dont know what youre talking about how about the name terry vass she was shaking her head refusing to meet his eyes im guessing it was pretty late in the day before mr brogan told you what was going on im also betting youre furious with him about it wouldnt do for your father to find out what sort of numpty youve gone and got hitched to foxs voice softened a little but charlie needed your help joanna and youve been giving it furious or not that phone you keep beside you the one you said came from the boat you lied to us about that your storys holed at the waterline and i think the pair of you are sinking her eyes were growing glassy with tears but she angled her head skywards so as to trap them there we need to speak to him fox went on measuring out his words he hasnt fooled the investigators and i very much doubt hes had more luck with bull wauchope criminals the length and breadth of the country will be on the lookout for him theres a good chance theyll get to him before we do and i think you know what that means i dont suppose he had much time for planning he saw what happened to vince faulkner and knew he had to do something quick fox gestured towards the empty walls on the other hand he flogged off the family jewels im guessing some of the money was an attempt to stave off wauchope the restll be paying his way right now and for the foreseeable he paused again but there was no reaction from the figure on the sofa her whole body seemed frozen and she could have been posing for a portrait in oils is he even in the country fox asked her im guessing he is hard not to leave a trail otherwise he could even be in one of the flats on the floors below sneaking up here at night living like a hermit in the daytime i want you to leave if you care about him youll talk to him about this were not his friends joanna but were far and away his best bet what did you tell your father did you even think of asking him for help her eyes burned into his probably not he went on because you can look after yourself and jacks never had much faith in your husband anyway thats how it is with fathers and daughters fox offered a shrug get out she repeated with fresh venom fox was holding a business card by the tips of his thumb and forefinger my new numbers on the back he explained setting it on the arm of the sofa we figured it out he reminded her wauchope will figure it out and he will come asking joanna my dad would have something to say about that hell have something to say about you too fox shook his head slowly jacks tired you can see it in his eyes the way he walks i know you still respect him but thats because you remember him the way he was maybe you were even more than a little scared of him but thats all changed think about it if charlie had been scared of him hed never have got involved with wauchope and the others hed have run a mile for fear of offending the infamous jack broughton fox bent at the knees a little the better to sustain eye contact some of the stuff wauchope owns in edinburgh im guessing it used to be part of your fathers empire hes been letting wauchope buy into it because he knows the future when he sees it these days jacks not much more than a minority shareholder and wauchope knows weakness when he sees it bull wants your husband joanna and im not sure you can stop that happening on your own this time joanna broughton was unable to stop the tears she wiped them away with the arm of her blouse smearing mascara across both cheeks go she said her voice barely above a whisper youll talk to charlie just go will you she pushed her shoulders back and filled her lungs with oxygen get out she screamed i want you out of here my cards there when you need it fox reminded her out were going in the lift on the way down breck nodded in appreciation of his partners performance couldnt really fault it he commented fox shrugged away the compliment lets see if it gets us anywhere he cautioned outside a large black bmw with tinted windows was being parked next to the volvo when the driver emerged fox recognised him its mr broughton isnt it he asked jack broughton stared at the proffered hand but decided against shaking it you probably dont recognise me fox went on i was in a bit of a state last time we met youre that cop you were here once before fox nodded but i was also attacked one night in the cowgate broughtons eyes narrowed as he studied fox afresh i hope youve not been upsetting joanna perish the thought that sauna on the cowgate you used to own it didnt you i owned the building whatever happens inside is nobodys business so long as its legal with the wauchopes in charge theres not much hope of that it took jack broughton a few moments to decide not to respond im taking my daughter out for breakfast he said making to move past fox when the two men were side by side he paused ill let you in on a secret though i did see something that night there were two of them i only saw them from behind but well you get a feeling for these things after a while what sort of feeling they were cops and bloody good luck to them he used his own key to enter the building fox stared at the door two of them yes one to kneel on his back while one swung a foot at his jaw two cops hes just trying to rattle you jamie breck commented fox turned towards him you reckon fox wasnt so sure breck was checking his watch i need to be at fettes for my session with stoddart ill take you fox unlocked the volvo and started to get in fastening his seat belt but then just sitting there hands on the steering wheel in your own time breck prompted him sure fox started the engine and angled the car towards the gate which had already started opening inwards youre not taking the old bastard seriously breck asked of course not but do me a favour will you what call annabel and ask her a question breck dug into his pocket for his phone what is it you want to know the team handing out the vince faulkner flyers on tuesday night you are taking him seriously two cops jamie one of them dying for payback breck eventually got it dickson and hall he stated dickson and hall malcolm fox concurred it was afternoon when the text arrived on foxs mobile breck had gone to meet annabel for a coffee there was some apologising to be done theyd been planning to spend saturday night in amsterdam flying back sunday evening and now breck was cancelling fox had told him not to but breck had been adamant i need to be around for this hed explained what if there is no this fox had retorted but now here was a text waverley pm buy ticket dundee n wait wh smith there was no name and when fox called the number there was no reply but he knew all the same he paced his living room for a few minutes then called jamie breck you still with annabel he asked shes gone to the loo i think shes starting to hate me malcolm you can make it up to her later how did it go with stoddart as you suspected i think it was for the benefit of her colleagues more than anything else did either of them think to ask you about the little jaunt we took with their boss she didnt give them the chance escorted me on to and off the premises never left the room for a minute thats good breck could tell from his tone that something had happened tell me he prompted weve got a meet seven tonight at waverley station he wants us to buy tickets to dundee dundee am i missing something or is that the last place hed hide plenty of stops between here and there fox took brecks silence for agreement once weve got the tickets he wants us to wait by the newsagents why i dont know you didnt ask him it was a text message did you try calling back no ones answering we should give the number to someone get them to put a trace on it can we even be sure its from him did he give his name no so it might not be i dont know annabels coming back breck said you should take her out tonight you dont get rid of me that easily ill see you there at seven the phone went dead fox slipped it back into his pocket and rubbed at his temples he lifted a book from one of the piles and placed it on the halffilled shelf its a start he told himself he took a taxi to the station the drivers conversation revolved around tram works and traffic diversions see the council he would say at one moment and see the government the next and dont get me started about the banks fox had no intention of getting him started the real problem was getting him to stop fox was trying to imagine himself into a role he was a commuter on his way home from a tiring day maybe he worked saturdays maybe hed been shopping he would step from his taxi head into the booking office and pay for a ticket the driver had even asked him this you on your way home without seeming interested in any answer wouldnt blame you for emigrating pal whole countrys a bloody shambles the cab bumped its way down the slope into the station proper and pulled into a waiting bay fox paid the driver adding a tip the man was wishing him well for the rest of the weekend as fox closed the door it was six forty by the station clock plenty of time the postshopping rush had died back a bit though the concourse was still busy a train had obviously arrived from london there was a lengthy queue at the taxi rank he pitied whichever tourist or traveller ended up with the driver hed just waved off the booking office had another queue but there were selfserve machines fox used his bank card and bought two offpeak returns youre leaving a trail he warned himself but if things turned sour that might be a plus it would give the cops who came looking for him something to work with he wandered past the coffee stall and the bar and the burger king then headed towards the platforms there were people resting their backs against the window of the wh smith the place was doing a good trade and fox wasted a couple of minutes looking at the range of books and magazines even so it was still seven minutes shy of the hour hello copper a voice barked from behind fox swirled towards it jamie breck was grinning need to sharpen those spider senses malcolm he said ive been here a while breck held up a ticket got you this in reply fox held up his own snap he said then how long since you arrived half an hour decided to scope the place out and saw you doing the same im wondering if maybe he wants to meet us here its a bit public breck replied his voice full of doubt just that wee bit exposed he seemed to remember something you know what you were saying about him maybe living downstairs from the penthouse fox shook his head it would put joanna in the firing line isnt she there already when he scarpered why did she stick around shes got a casino to run jamie besides if theyd both done a midnight flit wauchope would have been on to them all the quicker breck nodded his agreement how come im the one being fasttracked when youre the better cop fox shrugged maybe you bribed someone breck gave a snort and checked his watch against the large digital clock above the departure and arrival boards theres a train to dundee leaves on the dot of seven if we miss that next ones half past what do you think maybe we get on the train were told to catch and he jumps on at a station down the line breck nodded slowly or or he meets us here but you said it yourself its risky or were being led a dance breck offered fox gave a twitch of the mouth was annabel okay in the end dinner midweek at prestonfield house and amsterdam the next window we get shes a tough negotiator i thought it best to cave in straight away you were right by the way dickson and hall breck nodded again handing out flyers the night you got jumped any plans for a revenge attack breck watched fox shake his head then checked the station clock again sevens been and gone yes and here we are standing outside wh smith i cant disagree and nothings happening breck shuffled his feet fox was studying the passing parade of travellers some had obviously enjoyed a drink maybe one or two of them had been to the football they were voluble as they chatted with their friends it was saturday night and people from outside the city were arriving with only one aim in mind fox had even heard the rondo mentioned as a probable destination for later breck was studying his watch just relax fox told him are you on medication breck asked dont tell me youre not fretting my insides are dancing fox admitted more people passed them some at a gallop in a bid to make this or that seven oclock departure there were delays on a few of the trains the announcer explained as much through the tannoy fox could make out the gist of what she was saying hes late he stated breck just nodded the phone in foxs hand started to ring he peered at the screen same number the text had come from but this time it was an actual call he pressed the phone to his ear and answered yes he said the voice was unnaturally deep had to be fake someone putting it on leave by the back exit wait by the lights on market street the phone went dead message received and understood fox muttered then to breck come on where are we going he wants us on market street fox crossed the concourse heading for the stairs why because hes watched too many bourne films did you recognise the voice ive never spoken to him so maybe its not him if this was quidnunc and not real life how would you play it id forge alliances fox looked at him not much time for that besides which whod want to side with us breck added good question when they reached the top of the footbridge fox had to pause to catch his breath imagine what id be like if i smoked he managed to say half a stone lighter breck replied then what are we supposed to do when we get there await further instructions breck stared at him tell me he didnt use those words fox shook his head and started moving again a further flight of steps and they emerged out on to the pavement there were traffic lights to their right fox looked around seeking their tormentor the city art centre was in darkness people scurried past heads down north bridge was overhead to their left buses nose to tail as they waited for the lights to change at princes street breck was staring at the train tickets i hope hes going to refund us he said i think were at the very rear of that particular queue jamie youre probably right foxs phone rang again he put it to his ear the voice had changed unable to sustain its previous tone cross the road and head for jeffrey street once youre past the bridge look for a church the caller hung up fox turned to breck i think were about to repent our sins he said readying to cross at the lights fox wasnt really expecting any church to be open to visitors on a saturday night so when they arrived at the doors to old st pauls he stood there looking to left and right he checked that he was still getting a signal on his phone edinburgh was full of dead zones what now breck asked more waiting more waiting fox agreed whatever else happens this guys getting a slap from me breck paused do you think hes watching us maybe breck looked up and down the street not too many candidates he concluded it was quieter here than on market street there was a singledecker bus parked outside the jurys inn but no sign of its passengers could he be staying there maybe breck swore beneath his breath while fox studied the wall of the church there was a couple of signs one indicating that old st pauls belonged to the scottish episcopal church the other giving a taste of its history the church had been founded in and was an eighteenthcentury refuge for jacobites it proclaimed itself a place for all who seek faith amen to that fox was muttering under his breath as his phone sounded again he put it to his ear and had already uttered a terse yes when he realised it was an incoming text there was just the one capitalised word inside he showed breck the screen and breck reached out to turn the door handle with the slightest of pushes the door opened inwards there was a flight of stone steps fox used the handrail as he climbed when he turned the corner at the top he was in a church much larger than its exterior had suggested there were modernlooking paintings at one end a pulpit and altar at the other with a chapel off a young man was sweeping between the pews he didnt pay them any attention even though breck was staring at him but foxs attention had shifted to the lit chapel a huge painting covered most of one wall some folding chairs had been placed in front of it he sat down on one and saw that the painting comprised four square canvases placed together to make up a vast swirl of white material was it meant to be a cloak or a shroud he couldnt tell but he was mesmerised by it is that him breck was whispering he meant the floorsweeper too young fox stated this is just stupid breck ran his fingers through his hair sit down fox suggested take the weight off breck didnt look convinced but he sat down anyway one of the paintings brogan sold fox said quietly looked a bit like this only smaller he was remembering the photo of the penthouses interior the one published in the newspaper is that why hes brought us here fox just shrugged and let his gaze move across the painting someone was coming up the stairs their footsteps sounded like busy sandpaper breck had turned to watch the footsteps were quieter as they entered the chapel breck had risen to his feet nudging fox but fox was continuing to study the painting the new arrival crossed in front of him and sat down on the next chair along the artists name is alison watt charles brogan said i know a bit about art inspector mustve been a wrench to sell it all fox turned his head and found himself looking at the drowned man brogan had removed a lumberjackstyle hat revealing that his already thinning hair had been shaved off did the missus do that fox asked brogan ran a hand across his skull he was wearing fingerless black woollen gloves he looked to have lost some weight and his skin was sallow he finished rubbing his head and dragged his fingers down around his jaw he hadnt shaved in a while the black workmans jacket could have been borrowed from one of his building sites the denims had seen better days as had the scuffed boots as disguises went it wasnt bad then again it wasnt great you werent followed brogan said and you didnt bring the cavalry with you how come we didnt spot you at waverley i was on the overhead walkway when i called on the phone and saw you answer i knew you were my guys except were not your guys breck corrected him brogan just shrugged fox turned his head a little and fixed him with a stare what happened to vince faulkner he asked brogan was quiet for a moment he turned his attention to the painting im sorry that happened he said at last you sent him to meet with terry vass didnt you brogan nodded slowly and vass decided to send you a message fox stated if id gone to the sauna brogans voice drifted off that was the deal was it vass was expecting to see you but vince turned up instead for the first time fox felt a pang of sorrow for faulkners fate brogan had found out about the mans history of violence and had thought him a useful soldier vince would have loved playing that role maybe hed goaded terry vass and maybe not but he had died horribly you knew from vinces personnel file that he had previous fox went on you could have gone to jack broughton to borrow some muscle but you had to be your own man which is why you opted for vince he came to you on saturday night hed just clobbered his girlfriend and was angry and ashamed drinking away the memory of it barman at the casino says he should never have got past the door makes me think youd primed the bouncers for his arrival fox paused but brogan wasnt taking his eyes off the painting you needed him to go meet vass so he could take a beating on your behalf suited you just fine that he was too drunk to refuse there was a bitter taste at the back of foxs throat he tried swallowing it down i was desperate brogan muttered the cabbie who dropped him near the sauna says he nearly changed his mind about going he was sobering up fast and he was scared then he shouldnt have played the tough guy brogan managed a quick glance in his tormentors direction fox was thinking again of vince faulkner with his hidden stash of money at home payment for past services rendered was he killed at the sauna breck interrupted maybe forensics could take a look but brogan shook his head they took him somewhere else kept him there how do you know fox was giving brogan his full attention he watched the man swallow before he answered they phoned me they put vince on he squeezed shut his eyes trying to block out the memory i never want to hear anything like that again you might fox said when they come for joanna brogan opened his eyes and glowered at fox id kill them he spat they know that maybe and if i didnt jack would jacks what all this is about isnt it fox asked you were doing something you thought might impress your fatherinlaw playing moneyman for the big boys im not saying jack broughton knew but you were thinking maybe it would get back to him some day and hed start to respect you just a little bit more brogans face tightened and fox knew hed struck a nerve but heres the thing charlie fox went on when they come for joanna and they will come for her jacks not going to go after them fox paused hes going to come gunning for you youre the one hell blame brogan seemed to consider this im in hell he said weakly eyes back on the painting thats why youre here fox said you know were your only chance what can you do brogan was bowing his head as if in prayer i dont know with head still bowed brogan turned his neck so he could watch foxs face i really dont fox stated with a shrug of the shoulders then to breck have you got any ideas one or two breck replied after a moments consideration thats all right then fox said but charlie youre going to have to tell us everything and its got to be done properly brogan considered this i really thought it would work he muttered to himself at last fox gave a snort vinces body was found tuesday afternoon a few hours later youre suddenly checking your will at your solicitors office and by thursday youre supposed to be dead he shook his head slowly no charlie it was never going to work the deck shoes were a nice touch though breck conceded left bobbing about on the water like that they were joannas idea and she helped you come ashore too fox guessed dinghy was it i swam brogan puffed out his chest a little time was i could have swum the whole estuary good for you breck said fox had thought of something else the money from the paintings it was to tide you over right did wauchope find out you were holding on to it is that what finally blew his fuse men like bull wauchope their fuses are long blown you know glen heaton dont you when i started sticking my oar in did you have joanna go see him did she tell him to fill me in on bull wauchope brogan gave a resigned smile you said it yourself inspector youre the one card left in this lousy hand ive been dealt there was the sound of someone clearing their throat nearby all three turned expecting trouble but it was only the cleaner sorry the man said but ive got to lock up now dont blame you for loitering though he nodded in the direction of the painting its a great thing isnt it so true to life true to life fox agreed but it was a shroud and it reminded him of vince faulkners icecold corpse lying in the darkness of a mortuary drawer all because of the shavenheaded fat man who was staring at the painting one final time all because charlie brogan had something to prove to the world it was annabel cartwright who met them at torphichen shed already checked that billy giles and his team had left for the night there was a desk sergeant on duty but he was on the telephone when they arrived cartwright ushered them through the door and along the corridor to the interview room shed brought a videotape for the camera and audiotape for the recorder once everything was set up fox mentioned that it would be best for all concerned if she left them to it she gave the curtest of nods and left the room she hadnt so much as acknowledged jamie brecks existence the debts are piling up breck commented to fox lets get on with this fox replied an hour later they had as much as they needed fox pocketed both sets of tapes and they left the station without seeing anyone there was a locked patrol car outside fox looked to left and right thinking back to the day hed taken that first walk with jamie breck what now brogan asked fixing his hat to his head is it safe wherever youre staying fox asked him yes does joanna know the address brogan gave him a look and fox rolled his eyes if she knows then its not safe shed never tell maybe so fox didnt bother with the rest of the sentence we keep in touch by phone right he waited until brogan had nodded his agreement okay then keep your head down for another day or two while i discuss options with ds breck brogan nodded again a taxi had swept around the corner its hire light illuminated brogan stuck out a hand and the driver signalled to stop brogan got in and closed the door after him whatever destination he gave the driver neither fox nor breck heard it they watched the cab as it headed for the morrison street junction what now breck asked i thought you were the one with the ideas you might not like them if theyre better than nothing theyre worth hearing they started walking uphill towards the traffic lights there was a pub just across the road what did you think of brogan breck asked i wanted to punch him in the face that would have looked good on the video breck said with the hint of a smile wouldnt it though fox agreed i should have done it when we were in that chapel in the sight of god brecks voice feigned outrage at the notion fox reached out and touched his shoulder these ideas of yours jamie to be honest theres only the one breck paused and youre really not going to like it because its risky fox guessed because its stupid breck corrected him sunday february dundee the following night and people were out to have one last good time before the working week began again fox and breck sat in foxs car back in edinburgh breck had suggested taking his mazda for a change but fox had declined explaining that he just couldnt get comfortable im not built for a sports car jamie so they had travelled to dundee in the volvo and were parked on the street outside lowthers bar breck had interrupted mark kellys weekend that afternoon with a request for recent photos of bull wauchope and terry vass the resulting printouts from dundee cid were in the glove compartment having been committed to memory so far no one entering or leaving lowthers had offered a precise match though some came close not exactly a cocktail clientele is it breck commented as they studied three men who had come outside to smoke cigarettes check texts on their phones and hawk gobbets of phlegm on to the pavement one man kept rearranging his crotch another offered graveltoned enticements to any young women who dared to pass within his orbit all three men wore tshirts stretched over distended stomachs all three sported tattooed forearms and gold chains around their necks and wrists what hair they had was gelled and spiky faces shiny and fat and pockmarked one was missing most of his front teeth so do we just walk in there or what breck was asking its your plan jamie you tell me we could sit here all night otherwise they had already been to the address they had for wauchope leisure holdings it was one of a row of shops on an estate to the north of the city centre the door had looked solid and the blinds in the unwashed window had been shut tight no answer to their knock lowthers was all they had left it was the pub owned by wauchope the pub with the payphone someone in there had lured one property developer to his death and harried another into faking his own suicide lowthers was all they had breck seemed to realise as much and pushed open the passengerside door fox pulled the key from the ignition and followed suit the three men still hadnt noticed them they were laughing about something a message or a photo on one of their phones breck found himself standing just behind them can anyone join in he asked the men turned as one fox had caught up with his partner by now but didnt fancy their chances the good humour had disappeared from all three faces thats some smell of bacon coming off you two one of the men stated while another spat on the pavement just missing brecks shoes need a word with bull breck went on folding his arms inside is he why would he want to waste his breath on a twat like you the first man went on away you go and take gene fucking hunt with you he nodded towards fox while his two friends grinned were not looking for trouble breck continued but were always happy to provide it when necessary three of you in the same holding cell gets a bit crowded on a weekend im shaking in my fucking boots is he inside or not thats all were asking fox had risen up on to his toes so he could peer in through the pub window the bottom half was frosted glass the top half clear a couple of drinkers glared back at him but hed already seen enough hes inside he stated answering brecks question he made to move past the men but they stood shoulder to shoulder blocking the door bull wont thank you for this he explained to the leader think about it for a second right now its just the two of us hes dealing with but if we have to round up a posse well be sure to bring him out with his hands cuffed behind his back itll be into the van and down to headquarters for the night if you think thats what hed want fair play to you but im guessing youre wrong and hell know whos to blame when the blues and twos come screeching to a halt fox took a step back raising his hands in a show of surrender just think it over thats all im saying maybe go talk to him see what he says he pointed across the road well wait by the car then he started walking breck following him nicely played breck commented in an undertone that remains to be seen but by the time they reached the volvo the ringleader had disappeared inside the door swinging behind him fox and breck bided their time a face neither of them knew appeared at the window of the pub you saw him breck asked holding court at the bar fox confirmed amount of jewellery hes toting im surprised he can lift a glass it was another couple of minutes before the door opened no one emerged but something was either said or signalled the two smokers flicked away their cigarettes and headed inside now what breck asked it was a fair question do we just stand here while they have a good laugh at us a few more faces had appeared at the window one man flicked the v sign maybe that posse of yours isnt such a bad idea its a terrible idea fox corrected him dont tell me you want us to walk in there without backup is that what youd do in quidnunc jamie wait for reinforcements before you make a move by this stage of the game id be mobhanded same as the person im fighting then well just have to be a mob of two fox paused but meantime wed be warmer in the car we make a better impression standing our ground is that from quidnunc again place probably wont close for another three or four hours it wont take that long sure enough after only a few minutes they started to hear the sound of an engine it was whining as it approached at speed and when it turned the nearest corner its tyres squealed there was no attempt to pull in kerbside the driver just slammed the brakes on with the car still in the middle of the road it was a ford sierra but with a modified engine and an oversized exhaust pipe the driver let it growl one last time before allowing it to idle the tyres had left marks on the road and there was a smell of burning rubber top gears got a lot to answer for fox commented the man who eventually emerged from the back seat was big and scowling hed worn the same face in the photo on the printout the sierra rose the best part of an inch on its shocks once relieved of its passenger he rolled from the waist as he walked he was wearing a shortsleeved shirt the size of a twoman tent baggy jeans and white trainers his hair was black slicked back from the forehead and over the ears falling to just past his neck he sported a gold tooth at the front of his mouth but no baubles or obvious bodyart his eyes seemed tiny but piercing at the same time what do you want he asked second thoughts dont answer that just get in the car and vamoose we cant do that terry fox said managing to sound apologetic we need to speak to bull first i dont want to hear another word from you terry vass said jabbing a finger in foxs direction just you and your bumchum hit the fucking road there was silence for a moment before jamie breck uttered a single word the word was interesting this caught vasss attention whats that breck offered a shrug its just that when people use homophobic insults its often a sign vasss face darkened further what sort of sign breck shrugged again and seemed to be searching for the right phrase subconscious leanings he offered vass lunged at him but breck was nimble he ducked beneath the huge mans outstretched arm and stepped past him he bounced on his toes ready for the next move terry fox said his voice a little louder than before demanding to be heard we dont need any of this bulls got you here so you can find out what we want it was meant to be for his ears only but heres the gist weve got charlie brogan vass had been glowering at breck readying for another assault but foxs words hit home his breathing steadied and his shoulders relaxed a fraction i dont mean hes in custody fox went on i mean weve got him and we want a trade vass turned towards fox a what a trade fox repeated go tell your boss that well be waiting in the car he was already opening the driversside door vass watched as he got in and closed it after him then he turned his attention back to breck who was still up on his toes halfway between the volvo and the sierra from the car interior fox had only a partial view he was hoping breck wouldnt rile the giant any further but vass seemed to dismiss his tormentor with a wave of the hand and trundled towards the door of lowthers breck waited a few seconds then returned to the volvo and got in scary bloke he commented didnt stop you poking him with a stick happens in online games all the time breck paused besides ive always had fast reflexes nice to test them now and then want some gum breck nodded and reached out towards the packet fox was holding the hand hardly trembled at all they sat in silence chewing and watching the world pass by some women were on a hen night they wore identical pink tshirts emblazoned with the words we are the four and twenty virgins a group of local men were tagging along behind trying out their various chatup lines half a dozen teenagers slouched past dressed in black hooded tops and baseball caps the sierra got a few stares it hadnt moved and traffic was having to negotiate it one or two cars sounded their horns the driver kept his hands glued to the steering wheel and the engine ticking over reckon thats a fulltime job breck asked fox went on chewing and watching when the pub door next swung open it was only a couple of smokers they seemed interested in fox and breck but stuck to their own side of the road the door opened again and this time it was one of the three men from earlier he almost jogged towards the volvo leaning down at the driversside window fox ignored him so the man tapped on the glass fox gave it a few more seconds then lowered the window bull says to come in the man said tell him he can go fuck himself fox slid the window back up the man stared through the glass as though he couldnt believe what hed just heard he tapped again but fox just shook his head the messenger stood up and slunk back the way hed come reckon hell find another way of phrasing it breck asked probably you didnt fancy going in then i like it better here me too breck leaned back a little in his seat more minutes passed and then vass appeared holding the door open for bull wauchope he was everything fox had expected there was a feral look to him he was never going to be half the man his father was and he knew it he carried weight but very little of it was muscle his arms were flabby and the belt around his jeans was straining at its last notch the short hair was greasy as was the complexion acne around the throat almost certainly exacerbated by the cheaplooking gold chains the ink tattoos on the backs of both hands looked selfinflicted probably dating to adolescence rings on most of his fingers dartplayer chic the young man looked brash and smug the result of having grown up untouchable thanks to a father feared by all vass was a couple of steps behind his boss fox slid his window down again you he said to wauchope can get in the back but i dont want your gorilla stinking up my car wauchope didnt pause for a second stay here he ordered vass then he hauled open the door and got in slamming it shut after him everyone seems to think youre cops he said and if youre not ill eat terrys cock that makes it very tempting to lie fox said got the car wired for sound no am i supposed to believe that heres what i want you to know fox began weve got charlie brogans location youll have worked out by now that his little disappearing act was just that an act the cops are thinking the same way and that means theyll have him in a day or two he paused which doesnt give you much time bull im listening thats good because what im doing right now is incriminating myself thats why i can guarantee you were not taping this keep talking we know where he is and we know you want him were willing to trade you want money fox shook his head its not glen heaton youre dealing with here he paused we want our lives back he stared at wauchope in the rearview mirror dont you know who we are not a clue my names malcolm fox this is jamie breck fox watched wauchopes reaction the man was looking at breck weve been set up and we think youre at the root of it tell us were wrong wauchope turned his attention back to the mirror im still listening he told foxs reflection we want everything cleared up clean slate that sort of thing but we also want glen heaton no way he gets to walk you seem to credit me with a lot of clout the clout might not be yours might belong to your dad but i get the feeling its there your pal doesnt say much only when theres something to add breck stated breaking his silence this must be the most halfarsed entrapment any of you spunkbags has ever tried to pull you decide the time and place fox went on and well be there but well have questions for you and you dont get to see brogan until were happy what sort of questions the sort we need answers to fox reached a hand over the back of his seat it was holding a scrap of paper with his mobile number on it remember youve got maybe one or two days at most when they arrest brogan theyll offer him a deal itll be you they really want and with him still alive what are you going to offer your investors fox paused allowing this to sink in wauchope had taken the slip of paper from him their fingers grazing momentarily are we done the man asked one last thing fox watched wauchope pause with his hand on the door handle youve got to give us vass too why wauchope sounded genuinely curious he killed vince faulkner vince was my sisters bloke fox kept watching wauchope in the mirror as comprehension started to set in this was family that explained a lot where family was involved the normal rules did not apply the man didnt say anything he still didnt trust the car not to be wired but he locked eyes with fox and nodded slowly then he started clambering out before pausing to stick his head back inside you ive never heard of he announced to fox he closed the door and headed back to lowthers vass walked alongside him and wauchope draped an arm over his shoulder you any good at reading signs fox asked jamie breck hes telling us vass might just be expendable breck answered quietly fox turned towards him do i get another well played what did he mean at the end fox had been wondering that too i suppose he meant what he said hes never heard of me he shifted in his seat why the slip of paper rather than a business card less info he has on me the better fox paused you ive never heard of he spat his gum out of the window all of a sudden im starving how about you i could go an indian breck looked around im just not sure wed be safe in dundee youre right when wauchope calls we want to be as far from here as possible so weve got time to set everything up breck nodded his agreement you warned everybody to be ready i warned them hows my crazy plan shaping up so far were still breathing fox answered starting the engine thats saying something i suppose he peered in his rearview mirror as he drove off the sierra was still parked in the middle of the road as if it owned the place which in a funny way malcolm fox reasoned it did monday february monday afternoon breck and fox were playing cards at brecks house when the call came theyd been drinking tea and coffee all day three newspapers had been read from cover to cover tv news had been watched music listened to and thered been phone calls to annabel and jude lunch had comprised supermarket sandwiches and chocolate eclairs the sun had been shining earlier bringing a little warmth with it but now the sky was a sheet of unbroken cloud the colour of old dishwater its him fox said glancing at the phones tiny screen how do you know i dont recognise the number fox waggled the phone at breck but didnt answer it dont tease the man breck chided him he was attempting levity but fox could see he was anxious fox pressed the answer button and placed the phone to his ear malcolm fox speaking he realised his own voice sounded higher than usual breck wasnt the only one suffering nerves its me bull wauchopes voice he probably thought he was being clever not identifying himself by name as if the latest technology couldnt match a voice to its owner as surely as fingerprints yes im still not sure i get it theres nothing to get we meet we ask you a few questions if were happy with what we hear you get your little reward just like that just like that so why dont we do it over the phone because a phone could be bugged couldnt it same as my car yesterday im just trying to put your mind at rest i choose where we meet somewhere you know youll be safe i like lowthers fine but i dont want too many people around could it be after closing time fox was looking at breck and breck winked back he had bet twenty quid wauchope would choose the pub ill make sure everybodys gone by eleven then well be there at quarter past but not with brogan not till weve had our little chat ill need proof you know where he is not a problem and i swear to god if you try anything ill have you nailed to the wall before your buddies can kick the door down understood but i want us to be clear on something heaton and vass are not negotiable give me brogan and theyre yours the line went dead fox held the phone in his hands for a moment well breck asked weve got more calls to make fox held the phone in front of him and found the number he was looking for five hours till we have to leave breck calculated is that enough time it better be malcolm fox said as the first of his calls was answered they parked the car outside lowthers at precisely one minute to eleven people were leaving not all of them happy at having their evening curtailed but the grumbling was muted and even then it only started once they were safely on the street at five past terry vass emerged he recognised the volvo but ignored it his job seemed to be reconnaissance he walked up and down the street looking for signs that fox and breck had brought company seemingly satisfied he headed inside again at ten past fox asked breck if he was ready few more minutes breck replied with a glance at his watch they sat in silence and saw the bar staff making to leave shrugging themselves into their jackets lighting cigarettes as they headed home vass came out of the pub again this time signalling for them that it was time fox looked at breck and nodded breck fetched the laptop from the back seat and they crossed the road there hadnt been time for anyone to do more than the most cursory amount of tidying up a few chairs had been placed upside down on tables and the top of the bar was lined with dirty glasses the fruit machines lights were flashing tempting players who no longer existed at a corner table sat bull wauchope his arms were draped along the edge of the bench behind him search them he ordered vass stood in front of the two detectives take off your jackets and undo your shirts as long as youre not after the full monty breck said placing the laptop on the nearest table they slid their jackets off and unbuttoned their shirts untucking them so vass could check for wires he patted down each jacket squeezing the pockets and reaching in to check they only had wallets and phones trousers terry wauchope barked so vass ran his hands down their legs too checking their ankles and socks nothing he said struggling to get back to his feet take their phones off them dont want anyone eavesdropping do we vass ended up with three phones this ones got two he told his boss nodding towards fox wauchope stared at fox and breck then pointed to the chairs on the other side of the table breck placed the laptop between them okay if i plug this in he asked looking down at the floor for the nearest socket whats it for wauchope demanded proof fox told him and since i dont have a phone ill need to borrow yours he had his hand held out give him his phone back wauchope ordered terry vass then but im warning you crucifixions not high on my wish list fox assured him breck had found a socket on the skirting board below the bench fox punched buttons on his phone and held it to his ear wauchopes eyes had narrowed they were flitting between the two men were ready tony fox said when the call was answered then he snapped the phone shut and tossed it towards vass breck had powered up the laptop and turned it so it was facing wauchope give it a minute he said leaning over so he could make a few adjustments mind if i fox nodded towards the bench wauchopes head twitched which fox took for agreement he sat down next to the man so he too could view the screen wauchopes body odour was almost overpowering what weve got fox explained trying to keep his breathing shallow is a webcam on the screen a threeinchsquare box had opened there was a face there charles brogans face whos tony wauchope asked just someone doing me a favour hes operating the camera didnt think brogan could be trusted to do it for himself wauchope leaned forward brogans head was moving from side to side as he stretched the muscles in his neck there was no sound whys the picture so small blame the laptop fox explained wages brecks on he cant always afford quality i could magnify it breck added but youd lose definition wauchope just grunted then a few seconds later youre telling me this is live instead of answering fox gestured for the phone again one way to prove it he offered vass looked to his boss for permission then handed the phone over fox waited until he was connected tony he said tell him we need a wave the face on the computer turned to one side as if listening to an instruction then charlie brogan gave a halfhearted wave of one hand fox snapped shut the phone again holding on to it this time wauchope kept staring at the screen so now you know weve got him fox said i know hes in police custody wauchope corrected him but fox shook his head youve got friends in lothian and borders bull you know hes not handed himself in wauchope turned to look at him what is it you want i want to know why my colleague here was targeted wauchope considered for a second then turned his attention back to the screen he cant hear me he asked no fox confirmed wauchope leaned his face right in against the screen going to get you you fucker he yelled flecks of saliva spattered brogans head and shoulders will that be enough to appease the gangs in lanarkshire and aberdeen fox asked wauchope turned to him again its a start he confirmed i told them hed die when he disappeared from the boat you couldve tried taking the credit fox saw wauchopes face change you did didnt you you told them youd had him executed thats why he cant turn up alive and kicking wauchope was staring at him again breck cleared his throat malcolm maybe were cheating ourselves here how do you mean fox asked were trading him for a few scraps of information seems to me hes worth a whole lot more now dont go getting greedy wauchope snarled then start talking fox said he had risen and shifted to the seat next to breck wauchopes eyes were on the screen again there was a sheen of sweat on his forehead he had an inch of lager left in his glass and he drained it wiping his mouth with the back of his hand he made a smacking sound with his lips then stared across the table i dont trust you he said the feelings mutual fox answered if it comes to it its us two against you and your gorilla im not entirely sure i fancy those odds wauchope almost smiled but didnt he glanced in vasss direction the manmountain was resting his weight against the top of the bar arms folded breathing noisily through his mouth fox knew what wauchope was thinking if he stuck to the deal he really was going to lose his lieutenant when wauchope turned his attention back to fox fox knew the decision had been made terry vass could be replaced but there was something else vass couldnt be handed over to the police he might start talking fox gave the briefest of nods letting wauchope know this was the gangsters problem and no one elses where is he wauchope asked jabbing a fat finger at the screen we need to hear the story first whats to tell wauchope said with a shrug you already know the way it happened your pal here was sniffing around a councillor called wishaw but brogan needed wishaw why he was the last lifebelt on the titanic brogans plan was to get the council to buy his unfinished flats and all that spare land he had on his books theyd then have a place to put all the dregs on their waiting lists wishaw was supposed to be made head of housing but it never happened still he sat on the committee there was a chance he could swing it but then he got panicky said the police were hassling him about some drug thing from way back wauchope was looking at breck so its all your fault really i had to be discredited breck asked wauchope nodded and leaned back against the bench it creaked under the strain you already knew ernie wishaw didnt you fox asked wauchope glen heaton had done you a favour made sure wishaw didnt get dragged into the case against his driver that meant wishaw owed you but at the same time you owed heaton and heaton wanted a favour if he went to trial stuff would start spilling out that couldnt happen your job was to set me up for vince faulkners murder i really dont know what youre talking about wauchope gave a slow shake of the head like i said before i only know about him he stabbed a finger in jamie brecks direction and it was breck who responded you had to have someone inside the force someone who knew what was happening in australia someone with access to my credit card think im going to tell you if you want brogan youre going to have to fox interrupted only problem is its not going to go down well with your dad is it wauchope glared at him you already know he said im the complaints bull other cops are an open book to me i just had to go back through the files far enough fox paused long before he became deputy chief constable adam traynor worked right here on tayside he had a couple of runins with your dad but nothing ever came to trial funny that the way those cases kept falling apart did you ask your dad to put you in touch wauchope kept glaring the silence lengthened when he eventually moved his head the signal was ambiguous is that a yes fox asked its a yes the gangster said traynor arranged all the details yes for old times sake he owed dad a few favours plenty of cops owe my dad favours fox probably explains why it took tayside so long to lock him up fox watched the scowl spread across the sons face so brogan needs ds breck kicked into touch and you arrange the details but then what happens he sets vince faulkner on you faulkner was amateur hour terry saw him as a living breathing insult you didnt give an order wauchope shook his head first i knew of it was when terry phoned me fox turned in his chair so he was half facing the man at the bar the argument got out of hand you whacked him a bit too hard see brogan has a different take he says faulkner was tortured and his screams fed down the phone to send him a message when vass said nothing fox turned back to wauchope did brogan lie to me what do you say terry the gangster called to his lieutenant then to fox like i said terry felt insulted maybe the phone call was to let brogan know wauchope gazed at the screen again hes still sitting there can you get your pal to punch him or something where was vince faulkner killed that sauna of yours in the cowgate wauchope turned his attention back to vass terry back of the van vass muttered i didnt catch that fox complained terry took one of the vans down to edinburgh wauchope explained you didnt really mean for him to die did you terry you just thought you were putting him in hospital fox didnt bother checking vasss reaction where do i come in he asked instead you dont wauchope said with a shrug not as far as im concerned i was under surveillance then i got put on to ds brecks case no coincidence nothing to do with me i need more than that fox said there isnt any more than that wauchope slapped his palm against the surface of the table then you need to ask another favour from traynor because if you really dont know maybe he does wauchope wagged a finger no more favours till ive got my hands on charlie brogan the two men stared at one another i hand him over fox guessed and you rip him to pieces in front of an invited audience thats the deal we had fox turned towards breck you were right he said we folded when we should have raised we can still raise breck commented not if you want to leave here without the help of paramedics wauchope growled funs over all i want from you now is the address fox drew a beer mat towards himself and took out a pen its quarter to twelve now he said its going to take you an hour and a bit to get to edinburgh at half past one my pal walks out of the house once hes gone you can go in whenever you like he had written down an address he pushed the mat in wauchopes direction and if this is all a ruse the gangster asked come and get us fox answered with a shrug wauchope slid a fingernail under the mat and lifted it to peer at the address is this a joke he asked no joke fox assured him tucking the pen back into his pocket there are dozens of finished properties still on the books at salamander point some of them are even furnished an enticement to buy i suppose wauchope was staring past fox towards terry vass first place we should have looked he rasped youre cleverer than breck and me then fox stated it was number three or four on our list he paused are we done here wauchope fixed him with another long cold stare breck was unplugging the laptop and shutting it down were done the gangster eventually said and then terry go fetch the van fox and breck drove back to edinburgh at speed and with breck on his phone for most of the way their destination was police hq at fettes tony kayes nissan was parked outside the main entrance fox pulled up next to him and got out breck following suit kaye came to meet them while charles brogan stayed in the nissans passenger seat he all right fox asked scared shitless kaye answered with a smile he heard the whole thing clear as a bell so hes convinced its us or nothing hes convinced doesnt mean hes happy about it he did well though jamie breck said if wauchope had screamed at me like that id have started running for the hills i kept the volume low kaye explained and there was a bit of prep beforehand breck had bent a little at the knees so he could give brogan a thumbsup sign while brogan resolutely ignored him have you tried playing it back fox was asking kaye its fine sound and vision and copied on to an external hard drive date and timestamped what would we have done if hed spotted the camera breck asked fox told him the truth fox replied its built into the laptop meaning theres nothing to be done about it hed have wanted it covered up wed still have the audio fox looked to kaye for confirmation kaye nodded back at him and fox patted his friends arm truth to tell hed harboured doubts about tony kaye had even wondered for a time if kaye might have been got at he felt a little bad about that but not too bad foxs phone rang and he answered it it was bob mcewan letting them know the squad was in position at salamander point the vans got to go to forensics fox reminded him could well be the same one they used with vince faulkner relax malcolm mcewan said ending the call he says we should relax fox informed breck and kaye want to go watch the fun breck asked fox checked his watch if they catch so much as a glimpse of us he warned theyll know somethings up what about our resident scaredycat kaye gestured towards brogan we keep him at hq for the interview id hate for him to have an accident youre saying leiths not safe is anywhere fox asked sounding deadly serious it was another five minutes before the surveillance vehicle arrived driven by joe naysmith and with gilchrist as his passenger fox hauled open the driversside door well he asked naysmith jumped down from the van and breck tossed him the threepin adaptor this rather than the laptops mains cable was what hed plugged into the wall socket at the pub the device only looked like an adaptor but was actually a bug with its own transmitter and a range of seventyfive metres terry vass had looked up and down the street but the van had been parked around the corner picked up every word naysmith said beaming a smile and duly recorded gilchrist was holding a freshly burned cd in his hand breck started counting off on his fingers brogans evidence plus the laptop plus the surveillance any evidence forensics can lift from the van fox added and the fact theyre about to be caught redhanded just about wraps it up breck concluded doesnt it just about fox seemed to agree the two men stared at one another all right then fox relented lets go it took them only a few minutes to reach salamander point helped by the fact that the roads were deserted they had borrowed kayes car to make them less recognisable to wauchope and vass fox was in the driving seat slowing only marginally for red lights and then going through them if there was no other traffic were not going to get much of a view if we stay in the car breck complained theres nowhere nearby to park so they left the nissan on a side street and walked around the perimeter of the site the temporary fencing had been removed from that part of salamander point boasting finished abodes grass had been laid and a few trees and shrubs planted the address handed to wauchope belonged to one of the few actual houses it was semidetached and stood in a row of six there was light coming from its upstairs window fox had plumped for it because there was less chance of neighbours getting in the way many of the flats were occupied but four of the six houses stood empty fox and breck kept their distance peering from behind a brick wall that sheltered the neighbours dustbins from general view there was no sign of life from any of the properties we cant have missed them breck whispered maybe the van wouldnt start or they got cold feet ssh fox advised listen the low rumble of an engine a scruffy white van slowly turning the corner into the culdesac each homeowner had a parking bay but these were grouped together at the rear of the row of houses the roadway was to be kept clear at all times and boasted an unbroken run of double yellow lines not that this bothered the van its headlights had been turned off and it pulled to a stop in the middle of the tarmac when the engine died fox realised he was holding his breath the burning bulb in the upstairs bedroom had been tony kayes idea a good one too the van doors creaked open and two men got out fox recognised both of them they padded over to the front door of the house wauchopes face illuminated by the screen of his phone fox realised he was checking the time when he nodded vass tried the door handle having opened it a fraction proof that it hadnt been locked they pulled it closed again and went to check through the downstairs window then bull wauchope took a couple of steps back and angled his head towards the lit window upstairs he seemed to whisper something to vass who nodded his agreement vass retreated to the van looking to left and right and returned carrying a length of clothes line and a roll of tape it was wauchope who pushed the door open but he let vass lead the way when both men were inside fox nodded towards breck they left their hiding place and started crossing the road they were halfway to the door when they heard the shouts suddenly the doors of the houses on either side flew open officers pouring out and following wauchope and vass inside there were figures in the upstairs window more officers they were dressed in black and protected by visors and stab vests they carried pepper spray and truncheons there were yelled commands and the sounds of a struggle fox and breck had no means of identifying themselves to their colleagues so stayed outside on the path moving aside when the team started pouring back out again wauchope and vass had been handcuffed and were led downstairs an officer behind them toting an evidence bag containing the clothes line and tape breck stayed to watch but fox had walked over to the van he used the sleeve of his jacket when he turned the handle opening its back doors and staring at the shadowy interior neighbours were finally coming out alerted to the commotion officers were reassuring them that there was nothing to be worried about fox kept staring he could make out terry vasss voice cursing the arresting officers police cars were arriving on the scene lights flashing bringing out more spectators fox flipped his mobile phone open using the light from its screen as a torch a sheet of plywood separated the rear compartment from the front seats wedged in against the furthest corner was a big uglylooking steel hammer it looked stained matted with something very like human hair the phones screen went dark again but fox only turned his head away from the scene when he felt jamie brecks hand land lightly on his shoulder you okay malcolm breck was asking im not sure fox admitted he saw that bob mcewan was standing in the doorway of the house hands in pockets mcewan spotted fox and breck but made no gesture of recognition instead he turned and wandered back indoors tuesday february four in the morning and fox was back home wauchope and vass would spend the night in separate cells though wauchopes lawyer the one working hard to spring bruce senior from jail was already on his way from dundee charlie brogan would be interviewed again in the morning at some point fox knew he had to explain it all to jude but that could wait he also needed to call linda dearborn she was owed an exclusive and fox knew he could offer her a choice of several he had assumed hed be feeling lighter but there was still the sense of a weight pressing down on him he placed a couple more books on one of the shelves then sat back down with a mug of tea when he heard a car come to a stop outside he turned his head towards the window the livingroom lights were off the curtains still open the car idled then its headlights were switched off followed by its engine a door opened and closed fox held the mug in both hands his elbows resting on his knees the caller didnt use the bell they knocked instead knowing hed be waiting it was another few seconds before he rose to his feet leaving the mug on the coffee table when he opened the door bob mcewan was standing there everything all right mcewan asked fox nodded slowly and ushered his boss inside hed spent a good part of sunday convincing mcewan to go along with jamie brecks plan back in the living room fox switched on the ceiling light tony kaye tells me you managed to record the whole lot the whole lot fox echoed then after a pause well not quite do you want a drink a whisky maybe no alcohol in the house not even for special occasions malcolm fox shook his head mcewan had spotted the mug tea then he decided the two men went through to the kitchen fox filled the kettle and switched it on did they give you any trouble he asked mcewan put his hands in his trouser pockets vass took a couple of swings but youd warned the lads he would he pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and blew his nose this cold of mines getting worse fox just nodded and reached into the cupboard for a mug it had a drawing of edinburgh castle on the side he hesitated then placed the mug on the worktop i cant do this he muttered pushing past mcewan do what mcewan asked fox was standing by the window when mcewan arrived in the living room a few moments later whats wrong mcewan asked fox kept his back to mcewan and started to speak remember what you said to me bob all those years back when i joined the complaints you said no favours what you meant was we had to treat everyone the same friend or stranger if they were bent we took them down i remember mcewan said quietly fox heard him take a seat adam traynor wanted a favour from you he wanted a cop put under surveillance you said it would be best if the chop shop did the asking that was the proper channel after all is that right malcolm i cant see any other way it could have happened fox took a deep breath this would have been the thursday or friday i was busy dotting the is and crossing the ts on glen heaton handing the whole thing over to the procurator fiscal but there was something you told me that friday you said there might be a case for us in aberdeen finally fox turned towards mcewan and that gave you an idea maybe you already knew a bit about jamie breck what kind of officer he was you reckoned me and him would get on id be intrigued by him begin to see in him lots of things im not you did a deal with grampian theyd start tailing me and youd do what you could to make sure the inquiry into them was as soft as it could be fox walked towards his chair and sat down opposite mcewan mcewan was staring at the piles of books on the floor next to him he would even pick one up from time to time and pretend to study it before putting it back you had that whole weekend to think it over fox went on to make sure it felt right id be set the task of watching jamie breck the more i found out about him the more id start to trust him rather than the evidence and from what youd come to know about me you were sure id put my foot in it somehow that was all you needed for me to make a mistake same sort of fall breck himself was being set up for and for exactly the same reasons fox paused which if true puts you in the selfsame class as bull wauchope and charlie brogan he let the accusation linger while mcewan riffled the pages of another book if true mcewan eventually echoed the only real coincidence was breck ended up on the faulkner inquiry gold dust as far as you were concerned it gave me a whole new set of ways of falling flat on my face fox paused again giving mcewan another opportunity to speak an opportunity mcewan found it easy to refuse when i was going through traynors file i took a look at yours too bob it reminded me of something youd said right back at the start of the heaton inquiry that you had to take a back seat and you were quite right youd worked in the same office as him after all only for a short time but these things can come back to haunt us once defence teams get hold of them but your file told a different story glen heaton was your partner way back in the day he was just starting out and you were the one teaching him the ropes you wanted my reputation tarnished so his lawyer could use it against us in court you wanted the complaints to fail your own team bob mcewan looked up for the first time and to your way of thinking this is the only way it plays out he asked remember when you told me breck and heaton werent the best of friends you said youd spoken to someone at torphichen but it was your old pal heaton you actually spoke to wasnt it we dont get to help our old pals fox continued leaning forward with the top half of his body were the complaints mcewan cleared his throat glen heaton gets the job done malcolm so i keep hearing but thats the excuse were always given fox waited for mcewan to say something more but he just tossed the book he was holding on to the coffee table and leaned back a little on the sofa i thought it was wauchope helping heaton fox admitted with a rueful smile bull wauchope and terry vass are bad men malcolm meaning youre not fox stared at his boss after a few moments of silence he gave a sigh in the morning he said youre going to take everything on wauchope and brogan and vince faulkner to the chief everything mcewan echoed youre going to have to tell him about traynor and youre going to make sure jamie breck gets reinstated without the hint of a slur or a stain on his character mcewan nodded slowly and what about us last thing you do before leaving the chiefs office is hand him your resignation that gives you a few hours to come up with any excuse you like i want di stoddart put back in her box and i want to be told im returned to duty but not with you running the show and if i refuse then its my turn to talk to the chief itd be my word against yours you really want to take that chance be my guest fox got to his feet i suppose ill find out in a few hours time mcewan stared at him and started reaching into his pocket pulling out a phone im thrilled at your high regard for me he said quietly pushing buttons when his call was answered he spoke only four words you better come in fox heard another car door open and close mcewan had exited the living room long enough to let in the new arrival there was a quick muttered conversation in the hall fox had risen to his feet surely mcewan hadnt brought glen heaton with him but if he had fox was ready the door opened and mcewan led a distinguishedlooking man into the room malcolm he said by way of introduction youve maybe not met the chief constable the chiefs name was jim byars and he held out a hand for fox to shake he was in his late fifties with thick silver hair combed straight back from the forehead sir fox said by way of greeting bob here tells me youve grabbed the wrong end of the stick byars said his eyes were deepset but probing maybe we should all sit down eh the chief constable waited until they were settled then turned towards fox you looked at adam traynors file didnt you yes sir notice anything fox nodded slowly some of your own comments were in there reading between the lines it looked to me as if you never really rated traynor as a possible successor byars turned his attention to mcewan hes a sharp one bob yes sir mcewan agreed on occasion byars was facing fox again as it happens youre quite right there had always been whispers about adam traynor dating back to his days in dundee fox guessed suspicions that hed kept the wrong company in the past bruce wauchope for one it was probably wauchope who introduced traynor to glen heaton bob mcewan interrupted fixing fox with a look youre right to say that me and heaton go back a long way but id never sell out one of my men malcolm fox swallowed blood had begun to colour his cheeks bob here the chief constable went on knew something was up no way traynor should have sanctioned a surveillance operation on you without bob being kept in the loop bob already knew i had some concerns about my deputy concerns he was now sharing di stoddart has had a word with her dcc up in grampian and hes admitted it was traynor who ordered your surveillance hes admitted it just like that the chief constable offered a shrug on the understanding that we keep a few details to ourselves in other words we dont go shouting from the rooftops that traynor offered him a deal if grampian kept tabs on me the complaints in edinburgh wouldnt take on the aberdeen inquiry something along those lines look i can appreciate youre upset not half as upset as me mcewan interrupted eyes on fox you really thought i was behind all this youre not the one who was left out there as cannonfodder fox muttered he slumped back in his chair and ran a hand through his hair he was remembering something his father had said to him youve got to be careful machinery its not to be trusted maybe the old boy hadnt been so confused after all the police force consisted of a series of connected mechanisms any one of which could be tampered with or become misaligned or need patching up why did traynor pull the breck surveillance he eventually asked it was mcewan who answered best guess is he already had enough on both of you to kick you out of the park the longer the breck thing went on the more suspicions it was bound to raise brecks credit card payment to seil went back five weeks fox commented mcewan nodded this whole thing had been a while in the planning probably they were waiting to see if hed notice it and query it or it could be that all they needed fox added was for wishaw to know jamie breck would be kicked out of the park at some time and so wouldnt keep on nipping at his heels he thought for a moment brecks credit card details he worked alongside glen heaton mcewan reminded him heaton likes to know everything there is to know no telling when itll come in handy he copied out the details mcewan offered a shrug best guess he offered the chief constable looked from one man to the other then pressed his hands to his knees readying to rise to his feet it was traynor fox asked mcewan nodded traynor he agreed heaton asked a favour and traynor saw a way to kill two birds but when i accused you just now before you hauled the chief in why didnt you say something cant a man have a bit of fun bob mcewan said but then his face darkened although you and me will be having words about those conclusions you jumped to yes sir fox managed to reply watching the chief constable head towards the door one thing sir he called out to him i think im owed jim byars paused owed owed fox repeated i want dickson and hall taken down a peg byars looked to mcewan for an explanation theyre billy giless men mcewan obliged they gave me a doing fox added indicating what remained of the damage to his face i see the chief constable said then after a moments thought there are channels you know fox made no answer and it was left to mcewan to step in i think malcolm knows that sir he told byars he is the complaints after all fox stopped for a double espresso at a starbucks near annie ingliss street he hadnt had any sleep at all the café seemed to comprise students with essay deadlines and mothers whod just dropped their children at daycare the background music was s electropop fox took a stool next to the door and watched cars queuing at the holy corner junction the caffeine didnt seem to be having any immediate effect but he decided against a refill besides it was time he drove his car the hundred yards to ingliss tenement and sat there waiting as before duncan was the first to leave fox watched him trudge sleepily schoolwards then got out of the volvo and made for the tenements main door he was about to press the buzzer marked inglis when he heard footsteps descending the stone stairwell he bided his time and when the door was opened from within annie inglis herself was standing there her eyebrows shot up when she saw him malcolm she gasped what in hells name have you heard he asked heard what she looked him up and down have you started sleeping rough he ignored this keeping his eyes fixed on hers traynors careers on its way to the knackers yard he stated you need to be careful he doesnt take you with him she stared at him saying nothing when gilchrist got that call fox went on repeating words hed rehearsed time and again in his head the call telling him to pull the breck surveillance it was you on the other end wasnt it malcolm you owe me this annie hed taken a step towards her so that their faces were only inches apart she played with her bags shoulder strap you really do he nudged her i didnt know it was a setup malcolm youve got to believe that would i have given you that contact in the melbourne police if i hadnt trusted you you were just following orders is that it but you were getting something in return annie gilchrist was going to be removed from the picture thats not the way it usually goes with orders fox was shaking his head if you didnt know you at least suspected and yet you still went along with it that day i told stoddart i was ill im betting you volunteered to call me and check i wasnt just pulling a fast one thats why you offered to come to the house just to make doubly sure it was foxs turn to look her up and down youre some piece of work i did as i was told her face showed that even to her own ears this sounded weak traynor specified that you should get the complaints to help you nail jamie breck he gave you my name he paused traynor rather than bob mcewan chief inspector mcewan ingliss eyebrows lifted a little he had nothing to do with it fox nodded slowly then angled his head towards the sky you helped set two innocent men up for a fall he told her he lowered his head to stare at her again i really didnt know inviting me to your flat wasnt that a bit of a risk did you just want to string me along keep me sweet couldnt it be that i just liked you maybe wanted to warn you but you didnt when i realised youd looked in my file yes how could i know adam hadnt pencilled something there or wouldnt in future adam foxs eyes narrowed you mean traynor theres a bit of history there she closed her eyes for a second the silence stretched history he eventually echoed but she just shook her head and you did all of this without questioning without traynor needing to explain any of it there was the evidence against breck im talking about me annie traynor insisted it had to be me and when i told you there might be a conflict he got you to reel me back in again his eyes narrowed you never thought to ask him my career starts hurtling down the hillside and you do absolutely nothing he told me you were a liability that your friends in the complaints were covering up for you did you ever bother asking for proof he watched her shake her head again something to bear in mind for next time then he went on as he turned away from her a little bit of proof never hurts unless its on the side of a bottle he returned home and managed a couple of hours on the sofa with his eyes closed hed bought a roll of bin bags and was going to fill them with the various piles of books the whole lot could go to a charity shop after a shower and change of clothes he felt at least half awake though still numb jamie breck had left messages on his mobile but he didnt feel like responding instead he drove to saughtonhall and picked up jude notice anything she asked as she got into the car new jeans he guessed theyve taken the cast off she corrected him waving her arm in his face should never have been on in the first place according to the doctor who removed it she looked at him some detective you are if only you knew sis on the way to lauder lodge he told her some of the story she listened intently tears leaking from her eyes when he apologised for upsetting her she told him it was all right she needed to hear it all of it he sat in reception while she visited the bathroom splashing cold water on her face the staff were going about their business just like any other day mitch fox was waiting for them in mrs sandersons room the two of them seated opposite one another as if theyd been friends all their lives jude kissed her father on his forehead got rid of that cast he commented approvingly youre quicker than your son fox squeezed his fathers shoulder by way of greeting and pecked audrey sanderson on her powdered cheek your colds cleared up she told him yours too he turned towards his father ive been meaning to ask have you still got money in the dunfermline building society looks a bit ropy from what i hear the lad worries too much mrs sanderson said with a chuckle you told me three fifteen mitch chided him tapping his wrist even though there was no watch there traffic fox explained they need to get those roadworks at portobello roundabout finished and someones taken it into their head that this would be a good time to start replacing gas mains as if the trams werent causing enough chaos theres a zebra crossing in the grassmarket seems to be taking them months to install it tourists will be in town soon and god knows what theyll make of it all bits of roof keep falling off buildings according to the evening news citys a deathtrap the whole of scotlands in meltdown and for all i know the rest of the worlds about to follow he broke off when he realised the other three people in the small room were looking at him stop complaining foxs father said into the silence speaking for all of them about the author
