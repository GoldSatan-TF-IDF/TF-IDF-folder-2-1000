the spectacles by edgar allan poe many years ago it was the fashion to ridicule the idea of love at first sight but those who think not less than those who feel deeply have always advocated its existence modern discoveries indeed in what may be termed ethical magnetism or magnetoesthetics render it probable that the most natural and consequently the truest and most intense of the human affections are those which arise in the heart as if by electric sympathyin a word that the brightest and most enduring of the psychal fetters are those which are riveted by a glance the confession i am about to make will add another to the already almost innumerable instances of the truth of the position my story requires that i should be somewhat minute i am still a very young mannot yet twentytwo years of age my name at present is a very usual and rather plebeian onesimpson i say at present for it is only lately that i have been so calledhaving legislatively adopted this surname within the last year in order to receive a large inheritance left me by a distant male relative adolphus simpson esq the bequest was conditioned upon my taking the name of the testatorthe family not the christian name my christian name is napoleon bonaparteor more properly these are my first and middle appellations i assumed the name simpson with some reluctance as in my true patronym froissart i felt a very pardonable pridebelieving that i could trace a descent from the immortal author of the chronicles while on the subject of names by the bye i may mention a singular coincidence of sound attending the names of some of my immediate predecessors my father was a monsieur froissart of paris his wifemy mother whom he married at fifteenwas a mademoiselle croissart eldest daughter of croissart the banker whose wife again being only sixteen when married was the eldest daughter of one victor voissart monsieur voissart very singularly had married a lady of similar namea mademoiselle moissart she too was quite a child when married and her mother also madame moissart was only fourteen when led to the altar these early marriages are usual in france here however are moissart voissart croissart and froissart all in the direct line of descent my own name though as i say became simpson by act of legislature and with so much repugnance on my part that at one period i actually hesitated about accepting the legacy with the useless and annoying proviso attached as to personal endowments i am by no means deficient on the contrary i believe that i am well made and possess what nine tenths of the world would call a handsome face in height i am five feet eleven my hair is black and curling my nose is sufficiently good my eyes are large and gray and although in fact they are weak a very inconvenient degree still no defect in this regard would be suspected from their appearance the weakness itself however has always much annoyed me and i have resorted to every remedyshort of wearing glasses being youthful and goodlooking i naturally dislike these and have resolutely refused to employ them i know nothing indeed which so disfigures the countenance of a young person or so impresses every feature with an air of demureness if not altogether of sanctimoniousness and of age an eyeglass on the other hand has a savor of downright foppery and affectation i have hitherto managed as well as i could without either but something too much of these merely personal details which after all are of little importance i will content myself with saying in addition that my temperament is sanguine rash ardent enthusiasticand that all my life i have been a devoted admirer of the women one night last winter i entered a box at the ptheatre in company with a friend mr talbot it was an opera night and the bills presented a very rare attraction so that the house was excessively crowded we were in time however to obtain the front seats which had been reserved for us and into which with some little difficulty we elbowed our way for two hours my companion who was a musical fanatico gave his undivided attention to the stage and in the meantime i amused myself by observing the audience which consisted in chief part of the very elite of the city having satisfied myself upon this point i was about turning my eyes to the prima donna when they were arrested and riveted by a figure in one of the private boxes which had escaped my observation if i live a thousand years i can never forget the intense emotion with which i regarded this figure it was that of a female the most exquisite i had ever beheld the face was so far turned toward the stage that for some minutes i could not obtain a view of itbut the form was divine no other word can sufficiently express its magnificent proportionand even the term divine seems ridiculously feeble as i write it the magic of a lovely form in womanthe necromancy of female gracefulnesswas always a power which i had found it impossible to resist but here was grace personified incarnate the beau ideal of my wildest and most enthusiastic visions the figure almost all of which the construction of the box permitted to be seen was somewhat above the medium height and nearly approached without positively reaching the majestic its perfect fullness and tournure were delicious the head of which only the back was visible rivalled in outline that of the greek psyche and was rather displayed than concealed by an elegant cap of gaze aerienne which put me in mind of the ventum textilem of apuleius the right arm hung over the balustrade of the box and thrilled every nerve of my frame with its exquisite symmetry its upper portion was draperied by one of the loose open sleeves now in fashion this extended but little below the elbow beneath it was worn an under one of some frail material closefitting and terminated by a cuff of rich lace which fell gracefully over the top of the hand revealing only the delicate fingers upon one of which sparkled a diamond ring which i at once saw was of extraordinary value the admirable roundness of the wrist was well set off by a bracelet which encircled it and which also was ornamented and clasped by a magnificent aigrette of jewelstelling in words that could not be mistaken at once of the wealth and fastidious taste of the wearer i gazed at this queenly apparition for at least half an hour as if i had been suddenly converted to stone and during this period i felt the full force and truth of all that has been said or sung concerning love at first sight my feelings were totally different from any which i had hitherto experienced in the presence of even the most celebrated specimens of female loveliness an unaccountable and what i am compelled to consider a magnetic sympathy of soul for soul seemed to rivet not only my vision but my whole powers of thought and feeling upon the admirable object before me i sawi felti knew that i was deeply madly irrevocably in loveand this even before seeing the face of the person beloved so intense indeed was the passion that consumed me that i really believe it would have received little if any abatement had the features yet unseen proved of merely ordinary character so anomalous is the nature of the only true loveof the love at first sightand so little really dependent is it upon the external conditions which only seem to create and control it while i was thus wrapped in admiration of this lovely vision a sudden disturbance among the audience caused her to turn her head partially toward me so that i beheld the entire profile of the face its beauty even exceeded my anticipationsand yet there was something about it which disappointed me without my being able to tell exactly what it was i said disappointed but this is not altogether the word my sentiments were at once quieted and exalted they partook less of transport and more of calm enthusiasm of enthusiastic repose this state of feeling arose perhaps from the madonnalike and matronly air of the face and yet i at once understood that it could not have arisen entirely from this there was something else some mystery which i could not developesome expression about the countenance which slightly disturbed me while it greatly heightened my interest in fact i was just in that condition of mind which prepares a young and susceptible man for any act of extravagance had the lady been alone i should undoubtedly have entered her box and accosted her at all hazards but fortunately she was attended by two companionsa gentleman and a strikingly beautiful woman to all appearance a few years younger than herself i revolved in my mind a thousand schemes by which i might obtain hereafter an introduction to the elder lady or for the present at all events a more distinct view of her beauty i would have removed my position to one nearer her own but the crowded state of the theatre rendered this impossible and the stern decrees of fashion had of late imperatively prohibited the use of the operaglass in a case such as this even had i been so fortunate as to have one with mebut i had notand was thus in despair at length i bethought me of applying to my companion talbot i said you have an operaglass let me have it an operaglassnowhat do you suppose i would be doing with an operaglass here he turned impatiently toward the stage but talbot i continued pulling him by the shoulder listen to me will you do you see the stageboxthereno the nextdid you ever behold as lovely a woman she is very beautiful no doubt he said i wonder who she can be why in the name of all that is angelic dont you know who she is not to know her argues yourself unknown she is the celebrated madame lalandethe beauty of the day par excellence and the talk of the whole town immensely wealthy tooa widow and a great matchhas just arrived from paris do you know her yes i have the honor will you introduce me assuredly with the greatest pleasure when shall it be tomorrow at one i will call upon you at bs very good and now do hold your tongue if you can in this latter respect i was forced to take talbots advice for he remained obstinately deaf to every further question or suggestion and occupied himself exclusively for the rest of the evening with what was transacting upon the stage in the meantime i kept my eyes riveted on madame lalande and at length had the good fortune to obtain a full front view of her face it was exquisitely lovelythis of course my heart had told me before even had not talbot fully satisfied me upon the pointbut still the unintelligible something disturbed me i finally concluded that my senses were impressed by a certain air of gravity sadness or still more properly of weariness which took something from the youth and freshness of the countenance only to endow it with a seraphic tenderness and majesty and thus of course to my enthusiastic and romantic temperment with an interest tenfold while i thus feasted my eyes i perceived at last to my great trepidation by an almost imperceptible start on the part of the lady that she had become suddenly aware of the intensity of my gaze still i was absolutely fascinated and could not withdraw it even for an instant she turned aside her face and again i saw only the chiselled contour of the back portion of the head after some minutes as if urged by curiosity to see if i was still looking she gradually brought her face again around and again encountered my burning gaze her large dark eyes fell instantly and a deep blush mantled her cheek but what was my astonishment at perceiving that she not only did not a second time avert her head but that she actually took from her girdle a double eyeglasselevated itadjusted itand then regarded me through it intently and deliberately for the space of several minutes had a thunderbolt fallen at my feet i could not have been more thoroughly astoundedastounded onlynot offended or disgusted in the slightest degree although an action so bold in any other woman would have been likely to offend or disgust but the whole thing was done with so much quietudeso much nonchalanceso much reposewith so evident an air of the highest breeding in shortthat nothing of mere effrontery was perceptible and my sole sentiments were those of admiration and surprise i observed that upon her first elevation of the glass she had seemed satisfied with a momentary inspection of my person and was withdrawing the instrument when as if struck by a second thought she resumed it and so continued to regard me with fixed attention for the space of several minutesfor five minutes at the very least i am sure this action so remarkable in an american theatre attracted very general observation and gave rise to an indefinite movement or buzz among the audience which for a moment filled me with confusion but produced no visible effect upon the countenance of madame lalande having satisfied her curiosityif such it wasshe dropped the glass and quietly gave her attention again to the stage her profile now being turned toward myself as before i continued to watch her unremittingly although i was fully conscious of my rudeness in so doing presently i saw the head slowly and slightly change its position and soon i became convinced that the lady while pretending to look at the stage was in fact attentively regarding myself it is needless to say what effect this conduct on the part of so fascinating a woman had upon my excitable mind having thus scrutinized me for perhaps a quarter of an hour the fair object of my passion addressed the gentleman who attended her and while she spoke i saw distinctly by the glances of both that the conversation had reference to myself upon its conclusion madame lalande again turned toward the stage and for a few minutes seemed absorbed in the performance at the expiration of this period however i was thrown into an extremity of agitation by seeing her unfold for the second time the eyeglass which hung at her side fully confront me as before and disregarding the renewed buzz of the audience survey me from head to foot with the same miraculous composure which had previously so delighted and confounded my soul this extraordinary behavior by throwing me into a perfect fever of excitementinto an absolute delirium of loveserved rather to embolden than to disconcert me in the mad intensity of my devotion i forgot everything but the presence and the majestic loveliness of the vision which confronted my gaze watching my opportunity when i thought the audience were fully engaged with the opera i at length caught the eyes of madame lalande and upon the instant made a slight but unmistakable bow she blushed very deeplythen averted her eyesthen slowly and cautiously looked around apparently to see if my rash action had been noticedthen leaned over toward the gentleman who sat by her side i now felt a burning sense of the impropriety i had committed and expected nothing less than instant exposure while a vision of pistols upon the morrow floated rapidly and uncomfortably through my brain i was greatly and immediately relieved however when i saw the lady merely hand the gentleman a playbill without speaking but the reader may form some feeble conception of my astonishmentof my profound amazementmy delirious bewilderment of heart and soulwhen instantly afterward having again glanced furtively around she allowed her bright eyes to set fully and steadily upon my own and then with a faint smile disclosing a bright line of her pearly teeth made two distinct pointed and unequivocal affirmative inclinations of the head it is useless of course to dwell upon my joyupon my transportupon my illimitable ecstasy of heart if ever man was mad with excess of happiness it was myself at that moment i loved this was my first loveso i felt it to be it was love supremeindescribable it was love at first sight and at first sight too it had been appreciated and returned yes returned how and why should i doubt it for an instant what other construction could i possibly put upon such conduct on the part of a lady so beautifulso wealthyevidently so accomplishedof so high breedingof so lofty a position in societyin every regard so entirely respectable as i felt assured was madame lalande yes she loved meshe returned the enthusiasm of my love with an enthusiasm as blindas uncompromisingas uncalculatingas abandonedand as utterly unbounded as my own these delicious fancies and reflections however were now interrupted by the falling of the dropcurtain the audience arose and the usual tumult immediately supervened quitting talbot abruptly i made every effort to force my way into closer proximity with madame lalande having failed in this on account of the crowd i at length gave up the chase and bent my steps homeward consoling myself for my disappointment in not having been able to touch even the hem of her robe by the reflection that i should be introduced by talbot in due form upon the morrow this morrow at last came that is to say a day finally dawned upon a long and weary night of impatience and then the hours until one were snailpaced dreary and innumerable but even stamboul it is said shall have an end and there came an end to this long delay the clock struck as the last echo ceased i stepped into bs and inquired for talbot out said the footmantalbots own out i replied staggering back half a dozen paceslet me tell you my fine fellow that this thing is thoroughly impossible and impracticable mr talbot is not out what do you mean nothing sir only mr talbot is not in thats all he rode over to s immediately after breakfast and left word that he would not be in town again for a week i stood petrified with horror and rage i endeavored to reply but my tongue refused its office at length i turned on my heel livid with wrath and inwardly consigning the whole tribe of the talbots to the innermost regions of erebus it was evident that my considerate friend il fanatico had quite forgotten his appointment with myselfhad forgotten it as soon as it was made at no time was he a very scrupulous man of his word there was no help for it so smothering my vexation as well as i could i strolled moodily up the street propounding futile inquiries about madame lalande to every male acquaintance i met by report she was known i found to allto many by sightbut she had been in town only a few weeks and there were very few therefore who claimed her personal acquaintance these few being still comparatively strangers could not or would not take the liberty of introducing me through the formality of a morning call while i stood thus in despair conversing with a trio of friends upon the all absorbing subject of my heart it so happened that the subject itself passed by as i live there she is cried one surprisingly beautiful exclaimed a second an angel upon earth ejaculated a third i looked and in an open carriage which approached us passing slowly down the street sat the enchanting vision of the opera accompanied by the younger lady who had occupied a portion of her box her companion also wears remarkably well said the one of my trio who had spoken first astonishingly said the second still quite a brilliant air but art will do wonders upon my word she looks better than she did at paris five years ago a beautiful woman stilldont you think so froissartsimpson i mean still said i and why shouldnt she be but compared with her friend she is as a rushlight to the evening stara glowworm to antares ha ha hawhy simpson you have an astonishing tact at making discoveriesoriginal ones i mean and here we separated while one of the trio began humming a gay vaudeville of which i caught only the lines ninon ninon ninon a bas a bas ninon de lenclos during this little scene however one thing had served greatly to console me although it fed the passion by which i was consumed as the carriage of madame lalande rolled by our group i had observed that she recognized me and more than this she had blessed me by the most seraphic of all imaginable smiles with no equivocal mark of the recognition as for an introduction i was obliged to abandon all hope of it until such time as talbot should think proper to return from the country in the meantime i perseveringly frequented every reputable place of public amusement and at length at the theatre where i first saw her i had the supreme bliss of meeting her and of exchanging glances with her once again this did not occur however until the lapse of a fortnight every day in the interim i had inquired for talbot at his hotel and every day had been thrown into a spasm of wrath by the everlasting not come home yet of his footman upon the evening in question therefore i was in a condition little short of madness madame lalande i had been told was a parisianhad lately arrived from parismight she not suddenly returnreturn before talbot came backand might she not be thus lost to me forever the thought was too terrible to bear since my future happiness was at issue i resolved to act with a manly decision in a word upon the breaking up of the play i traced the lady to her residence noted the address and the next morning sent her a full and elaborate letter in which i poured out my whole heart i spoke boldly freelyin a word i spoke with passion i concealed nothingnothing even of my weakness i alluded to the romantic circumstances of our first meetingeven to the glances which had passed between us i went so far as to say that i felt assured of her love while i offered this assurance and my own intensity of devotion as two excuses for my otherwise unpardonable conduct as a third i spoke of my fear that she might quit the city before i could have the opportunity of a formal introduction i concluded the most wildly enthusiastic epistle ever penned with a frank declaration of my worldly circumstancesof my affluenceand with an offer of my heart and of my hand in an agony of expectation i awaited the reply after what seemed the lapse of a century it came yes actually came romantic as all this may appear i really received a letter from madame lalandethe beautiful the wealthy the idolized madame lalande her eyesher magnificent eyes had not belied her noble heart like a true frenchwoman as she was she had obeyed the frank dictates of her reasonthe generous impulses of her naturedespising the conventional pruderies of the world she had not scorned my proposals she had not sheltered herself in silence she had not returned my letter unopened she had even sent me in reply one penned by her own exquisite fingers it ran thus monsieur simpson vill pardonne me for not compose de butefulle tong of his contree so vell as might it is only de late dat i am arrive and not yet ave do opportunite for toletudier vid dis apologie for the maniere i vill now say dat helas monsieur simpson ave guess but de too true need i say de more helas am i not ready speak de too moshe eugenie laland this noblespirited note i kissed a million times and committed no doubt on its account a thousand other extravagances that have now escaped my memory still talbot would not return alas could he have formed even the vaguest idea of the suffering his absence had occasioned his friend would not his sympathizing nature have flown immediately to my relief still however he came not i wrote he replied he was detained by urgent businessbut would shortly return he begged me not to be impatientto moderate my transportsto read soothing booksto drink nothing stronger than hockand to bring the consolations of philosophy to my aid the fool if he could not come himself why in the name of every thing rational could he not have enclosed me a letter of presentation i wrote him again entreating him to forward one forthwith my letter was returned by that footman with the following endorsement in pencil the scoundrel had joined his master in the country left syesterday for parts unknowndid not say whereor when be backso thought best to return letter knowing your handwriting and as how you is always more or less in a hurry yours sincerely stubbs after this it is needless to say that i devoted to the infernal deities both master and valetbut there was little use in anger and no consolation at all in complaint but i had yet a resource left in my constitutional audacity hitherto it had served me well and i now resolved to make it avail me to the end besides after the correspondence which had passed between us what act of mere informality could i commit within bounds that ought to be regarded as indecorous by madame lalande since the affair of the letter i had been in the habit of watching her house and thus discovered that about twilight it was her custom to promenade attended only by a negro in livery in a public square overlooked by her windows here amid the luxuriant and shadowing groves in the gray gloom of a sweet midsummer evening i observed my opportunity and accosted her the better to deceive the servant in attendance i did this with the assured air of an old and familiar acquaintance with a presence of mind truly parisian she took the cue at once and to greet me held out the most bewitchingly little of hands the valet at once fell into the rear and now with hearts full to overflowing we discoursed long and unreservedly of our love as madame lalande spoke english even less fluently than she wrote it our conversation was necessarily in french in this sweet tongue so adapted to passion i gave loose to the impetuous enthusiasm of my nature and with all the eloquence i could command besought her to consent to an immediate marriage at this impatience she smiled she urged the old story of decorumthat bugbear which deters so many from bliss until the opportunity for bliss has forever gone by i had most imprudently made it known among my friends she observed that i desired her acquaintancethus that i did not possess itthus again there was no possibility of concealing the date of our first knowledge of each other and then she adverted with a blush to the extreme recency of this date to wed immediately would be improperwould be indecorouswould be outre all this she said with a charming air of naivete which enraptured while it grieved and convinced me she went even so far as to accuse me laughingly of rashnessof imprudence she bade me remember that i really even know not who she waswhat were her prospects her connections her standing in society she begged me but with a sigh to reconsider my proposal and termed my love an infatuationa will o the wispa fancy or fantasy of the momenta baseless and unstable creation rather of the imagination than of the heart these things she uttered as the shadows of the sweet twilight gathered darkly and more darkly around usand then with a gentle pressure of her fairylike hand overthrew in a single sweet instant all the argumentative fabric she had reared i replied as best i couldas only a true lover can i spoke at length and perseveringly of my devotion of my passionof her exceeding beauty and of my own enthusiastic admiration in conclusion i dwelt with a convincing energy upon the perils that encompass the course of lovethat course of true love that never did run smoothand thus deduced the manifest danger of rendering that course unnecessarily long this latter argument seemed finally to soften the rigor of her determination she relented but there was yet an obstacle she said which she felt assured i had not properly considered this was a delicate pointfor a woman to urge especially so in mentioning it she saw that she must make a sacrifice of her feelings still for me every sacrifice should be made she alluded to the topic of age was i awarewas i fully aware of the discrepancy between us that the age of the husband should surpass by a few yearseven by fifteen or twentythe age of the wife was regarded by the world as admissible and indeed as even proper but she had always entertained the belief that the years of the wife should never exceed in number those of the husband a discrepancy of this unnatural kind gave rise too frequently alas to a life of unhappiness now she was aware that my own age did not exceed two and twenty and i on the contrary perhaps was not aware that the years of my eugenie extended very considerably beyond that sum about all this there was a nobility of soula dignity of candorwhich delightedwhich enchanted mewhich eternally riveted my chains i could scarcely restrain the excessive transport which possessed me my sweetest eugenie i cried what is all this about which you are discoursing your years surpass in some measure my own but what then the customs of the world are so many conventional follies to those who love as ourselves in what respect differs a year from an hour i am twentytwo you say granted indeed you may as well call me at once twentythree now you yourself my dearest eugenie can have numbered no more thancan have numbered no more thanno more thanthanthanthan here i paused for an instant in the expectation that madame lalande would interrupt me by supplying her true age but a frenchwoman is seldom direct and has always by way of answer to an embarrassing query some little practical reply of her own in the present instance eugenie who for a few moments past had seemed to be searching for something in her bosom at length let fall upon the grass a miniature which i immediately picked up and presented to her keep it she said with one of her most ravishing smiles keep it for my sakefor the sake of her whom it too flatteringly represents besides upon the back of the trinket you may discover perhaps the very information you seem to desire it is now to be sure growing rather darkbut you can examine it at your leisure in the morning in the meantime you shall be my escort home tonight my friends are about holding a little musical levee i can promise you too some good singing we french are not nearly so punctilious as you americans and i shall have no difficulty in smuggling you in in the character of an old acquaintance with this she took my arm and i attended her home the mansion was quite a fine one and i believe furnished in good taste of this latter point however i am scarcely qualified to judge for it was just dark as we arrived and in american mansions of the better sort lights seldom during the heat of summer make their appearance at this the most pleasant period of the day in about an hour after my arrival to be sure a single shaded solar lamp was lit in the principal drawingroom and this apartment i could thus see was arranged with unusual good taste and even splendor but two other rooms of the suite and in which the company chiefly assembled remained during the whole evening in a very agreeable shadow this is a wellconceived custom giving the party at least a choice of light or shade and one which our friends over the water could not do better than immediately adopt the evening thus spent was unquestionably the most delicious of my life madame lalande had not overrated the musical abilities of her friends and the singing i here heard i had never heard excelled in any private circle out of vienna the instrumental performers were many and of superior talents the vocalists were chiefly ladies and no individual sang less than well at length upon a peremptory call for madame lalande she arose at once without affectation or demur from the chaise longue upon which she had sat by my side and accompanied by one or two gentlemen and her female friend of the opera repaired to the piano in the main drawingroom i would have escorted her myself but felt that under the circumstances of my introduction to the house i had better remain unobserved where i was i was thus deprived of the pleasure of seeing although not of hearing her sing the impression she produced upon the company seemed electrical but the effect upon myself was something even more i know not how adequately to describe it it arose in part no doubt from the sentiment of love with which i was imbued but chiefly from my conviction of the extreme sensibility of the singer it is beyond the reach of art to endow either air or recitative with more impassioned expression than was hers her utterance of the romance in otellothe tone with which she gave the words sul mio sasso in the capulettiis ringing in my memory yet her lower tones were absolutely miraculous her voice embraced three complete octaves extending from the contralto d to the d upper soprano and though sufficiently powerful to have filled the san carlos executed with the minutest precision every difficulty of vocal compositionascending and descending scales cadences or fiorituri in the final of the somnambula she brought about a most remarkable effect at the words ah non guinge uman pensiero al contento ond io son piena here in imitation of malibran she modified the original phrase of bellini so as to let her voice descend to the tenor g when by a rapid transition she struck the g above the treble stave springing over an interval of two octaves upon rising from the piano after these miracles of vocal execution she resumed her seat by my side when i expressed to her in terms of the deepest enthusiasm my delight at her performance of my surprise i said nothing and yet was i most unfeignedly surprised for a certain feebleness or rather a certain tremulous indecision of voice in ordinary conversation had prepared me to anticipate that in singing she would not acquit herself with any remarkable ability our conversation was now long earnest uninterrupted and totally unreserved she made me relate many of the earlier passages of my life and listened with breathless attention to every word of the narrative i concealed nothingfelt that i had a right to conceal nothingfrom her confiding affection encouraged by her candor upon the delicate point of her age i entered with perfect frankness not only into a detail of my many minor vices but made full confession of those moral and even of those physical infirmities the disclosure of which in demanding so much higher a degree of courage is so much surer an evidence of love i touched upon my college indiscretionsupon my extravagancesupon my carousalsupon my debtsupon my flirtations i even went so far as to speak of a slightly hectic cough with which at one time i had been troubledof a chronic rheumatismof a twinge of hereditary goutand in conclusion of the disagreeable and inconvenient but hitherto carefully concealed weakness of my eyes upon this latter point said madame lalande laughingly you have been surely injudicious in coming to confession for without the confession i take it for granted that no one would have accused you of the crime by the by she continued have you any recollection and here i fancied that a blush even through the gloom of the apartment became distinctly visible upon her cheekhave you any recollection mon cher ami of this little ocular assistant which now depends from my neck as she spoke she twirled in her fingers the identical double eyeglass which had so overwhelmed me with confusion at the opera full wellalas do i remember it i exclaimed pressing passionately the delicate hand which offered the glasses for my inspection they formed a complex and magnificent toy richly chased and filigreed and gleaming with jewels which even in the deficient light i could not help perceiving were of high value eh bien mon ami she resumed with a certain empressment of manner that rather surprised meeh bien mon ami you have earnestly besought of me a favor which you have been pleased to denominate priceless you have demanded of me my hand upon the morrow should i yield to your entreatiesand i may add to the pleadings of my own bosomwould i not be entitled to demand of you a verya very little boon in return name it i exclaimed with an energy that had nearly drawn upon us the observation of the company and restrained by their presence alone from throwing myself impetuously at her feet name it my beloved my eugenie my ownname itbut alas it is already yielded ere named you shall conquer then mon ami said she for the sake of the eugenie whom you love this little weakness which you have at last confessedthis weakness more moral than physicaland which let me assure you is so unbecoming the nobility of your real natureso inconsistent with the candor of your usual characterand which if permitted further control will assuredly involve you sooner or later in some very disagreeable scrape you shall conquer for my sake this affectation which leads you as you yourself acknowledge to the tacit or implied denial of your infirmity of vision for this infirmity you virtually deny in refusing to employ the customary means for its relief you will understand me to say then that i wish you to wear spectaclesah hushyou have already consented to wear them for my sake you shall accept the little toy which i now hold in my hand and which though admirable as an aid to vision is really of no very immense value as a gem you perceive that by a trifling modification thusor thusit can be adapted to the eyes in the form of spectacles or worn in the waistcoat pocket as an eyeglass it is in the former mode however and habitually that you have already consented to wear it for my sake this requestmust i confess itconfused me in no little degree but the condition with which it was coupled rendered hesitation of course a matter altogether out of the question it is done i cried with all the enthusiasm that i could muster at the moment it is doneit is most cheerfully agreed i sacrifice every feeling for your sake tonight i wear this dear eyeglass as an eyeglass and upon my heart but with the earliest dawn of that morning which gives me the pleasure of calling you wife i will place it upon myupon my noseand there wear it ever afterward in the less romantic and less fashionable but certainly in the more serviceable form which you desire our conversation now turned upon the details of our arrangements for the morrow talbot i learned from my betrothed had just arrived in town i was to see him at once and procure a carriage the soiree would scarcely break up before two and by this hour the vehicle was to be at the door when in the confusion occasioned by the departure of the company madame l could easily enter it unobserved we were then to call at the house of a clergyman who would be in waiting there be married drop talbot and proceed on a short tour to the east leaving the fashionable world at home to make whatever comments upon the matter it thought best having planned all this i immediately took leave and went in search of talbot but on the way i could not refrain from stepping into a hotel for the purpose of inspecting the miniature and this i did by the powerful aid of the glasses the countenance was a surpassingly beautiful one those large luminous eyesthat proud grecian nosethose dark luxuriant curlsah said i exultingly to myself this is indeed the speaking image of my beloved i turned the reverse and discovered the wordseugenie lalandeaged twentyseven years and seven months i found talbot at home and proceeded at once to acquaint him with my good fortune he professed excessive astonishment of course but congratulated me most cordially and proffered every assistance in his power in a word we carried out our arrangement to the letter and at two in the morning just ten minutes after the ceremony i found myself in a close carriage with madame lalandewith mrs simpson i should sayand driving at a great rate out of town in a direction northeast by north halfnorth it had been determined for us by talbot that as we were to be up all night we should make our first stop at c a village about twenty miles from the city and there get an early breakfast and some repose before proceeding upon our route at four precisely therefore the carriage drew up at the door of the principal inn i handed my adored wife out and ordered breakfast forthwith in the meantime we were shown into a small parlor and sat down it was now nearly if not altogether daylight and as i gazed enraptured at the angel by my side the singular idea came all at once into my head that this was really the very first moment since my acquaintance with the celebrated loveliness of madame lalande that i had enjoyed a near inspection of that loveliness by daylight at all and now mon ami said she taking my hand and so interrupting this train of reflection and now mon cher ami since we are indissolubly onesince i have yielded to your passionate entreaties and performed my portion of our agreementi presume you have not forgotten that you also have a little favor to bestowa little promise which it is your intention to keep ah let me see let me remember yes full easily do i call to mind the precise words of the dear promise you made to eugenie last night listen you spoke thus it is doneit is most cheerfully agreed i sacrifice every feeling for your sake tonight i wear this dear eyeglass as an eyeglass and upon my heart but with the earliest dawn of that morning which gives me the privilege of calling you wife i will place it upon myupon my noseand there wear it ever afterward in the less romantic and less fashionable but certainly in the more serviceable form which you desire these were the exact words my beloved husband were they not they were i said you have an excellent memory and assuredly my beautiful eugenie there is no disposition on my part to evade the performance of the trivial promise they imply see behold they are becomingratherare they not and here having arranged the glasses in the ordinary form of spectacles i applied them gingerly in their proper position while madame simpson adjusting her cap and folding her arms sat bolt upright in her chair in a somewhat stiff and prim and indeed in a somewhat undignified position goodness gracious me i exclaimed almost at the very instant that the rim of the spectacles had settled upon my nosemy goodness gracious mewhy what can be the matter with these glasses and taking them quickly off i wiped them carefully with a silk handkerchief and adjusted them again but if in the first instance there had occurred something which occasioned me surprise in the second this surprise became elevated into astonishment and this astonishment was profoundwas extremeindeed i may say it was horrific what in the name of everything hideous did this mean could i believe my eyescould ithat was the question was thatwas thatwas that rouge and were thoseand were thosewere those wrinkles upon the visage of eugenie lalande and oh jupiter and every one of the gods and goddesses little and big whatwhatwhatwhat had become of her teeth i dashed the spectacles violently to the ground and leaping to my feet stood erect in the middle of the floor confronting mrs simpson with my arms set akimbo and grinning and foaming but at the same time utterly speechless with terror and with rage now i have already said that madame eugenie lalandethat is to say simpsonspoke the english language but very little better than she wrote it and for this reason she very properly never attempted to speak it upon ordinary occasions but rage will carry a lady to any extreme and in the present care it carried mrs simpson to the very extraordinary extreme of attempting to hold a conversation in a tongue that she did not altogether understand vell monsieur said she after surveying me in great apparent astonishment for some momentsvell monsieurand vat denvat de matter now is it de dance of de saint itusse dat you ave if not like me vat for vy buy de pig in the

himneither me nor my companion de madame stephanie lalande he is name de napoleon bonaparte froissart and i suppose you say dat dat too is not von ver respectable name either the length or the nature of this speech had the effect of working up mrs simpson into a very extraordinary passion indeed and as she made an end of it with great labor she lumped up from her chair like somebody bewitched dropping upon the floor an entire universe of bustle as she lumped once upon her feet she gnashed her gums brandished her arms rolled up her sleeves shook her fist in my face and concluded the performance by tearing the cap from her head and with it an immense wig of the most valuable and beautiful black hair the whole of which she dashed upon the ground with a yell and there trammpled and danced a fandango upon it in an absolute ecstasy and agony of rage meantime i sank aghast into the chair which she had vacated moissart and voissart i repeated thoughtfully as she cut one of her pigeonwings and croissart and froissart as she completed anothermoissart and voissart and croissart and napoleon bonaparte froissartwhy you ineffable old serpent thats methats medye hear thats mehere i screamed at the top of my voicethats meee i am napoleon bonaparte froissart and if i havnt married my great great grandmother i wish i may be everlastingly confounded madame eugenie lalande quasi simpsonformerly moissartwas in sober fact my great great grandmother in her youth she had been beautiful and even at eightytwo retained the majestic height the sculptural contour of head the fine eyes and the grecian nose of her girlhood by the aid of these of pearlpowder of rouge of false hair false teeth and false tournure as well as of the most skilful modistes of paris she contrived to hold a respectable footing among the beauties en peu passees of the french metropolis in this respect indeed she might have been regarded as little less than the equal of the celebrated ninon de lenclos she was immensely wealthy and being left for the second time a widow without children she bethought herself of my existence in america and for the purpose of making me her heir paid a visit to the united states in company with a distant and exceedingly lovely relative of her second husbandsa madame stephanie lalande at the opera my great great grandmothers attention was arrested by my notice and upon surveying me through her eyeglass she was struck with a certain family resemblance to herself thus interested and knowing that the heir she sought was actually in the city she made inquiries of her party respecting me the gentleman who attended her knew my person and told her who i was the information thus obtained induced her to renew her scrutiny and this scrutiny it was which so emboldened me that i behaved in the absurd manner already detailed she returned my bow however under the impression that by some odd accident i had discovered her identity when deceived by my weakness of vision and the arts of the toilet in respect to the age and charms of the strange lady i demanded so enthusiastically of talbot who she was he concluded that i meant the younger beauty as a matter of course and so informed me with perfect truth that she was the celebrated widow madame lalande in the street next morning my great great grandmother encountered talbot an old parisian acquaintance and the conversation very naturally turned upon myself my deficiencies of vision were then explained for these were notorious although i was entirely ignorant of their notoriety and my good old relative discovered much to her chagrin that she had been deceived in supposing me aware of her identity and that i had been merely making a fool of myself in making open love in a theatre to an old woman unknown by way of punishing me for this imprudence she concocted with talbot a plot he purposely kept out of my way to avoid giving me the introduction my street inquiries about the lovely widow madame lalande were supposed to refer to the younger lady of course and thus the conversation with the three gentlemen whom i encountered shortly after leaving talbots hotel will be easily explained as also their allusion to ninon de lenclos i had no opportunity of seeing madame lalande closely during daylight and at her musical soiree my silly weakness in refusing the aid of glasses effectually prevented me from making a discovery of her age when madame lalande was called upon to sing the younger lady was intended and it was she who arose to obey the call my great great grandmother to further the deception arising at the same moment and accompanying her to the piano in the main drawingroom had i decided upon escorting her thither it had been her design to suggest the propriety of my remaining where i was but my own prudential views rendered this unnecessary the songs which i so much admired and which so confirmed my impression of the youth of my mistress were executed by madame stephanie lalande the eyeglass was presented by way of adding a reproof to the hoaxa sting to the epigram of the deception its presentation afforded an opportunity for the lecture upon affectation with which i was so especially edified it is almost superfluous to add that the glasses of the instrument as worn by the old lady had been exchanged by her for a pair better adapted to my years they suited me in fact to a t the clergyman who merely pretended to tie the fatal knot was a boon companion of talbots and no priest he was an excellent whip however and having doffed his cassock to put on a greatcoat he drove the hack which conveyed the happy couple out of town talbot took a seat at his side the two scoundrels were thus in at the death and through a halfopen window of the back parlor of the inn amused themselves in grinning at the denouement of the drama i believe i shall be forced to call them both out nevertheless i am not the husband of my great great grandmother and this is a reflection which affords me infinite reliefbut i am the husband of madame lalandeof madame stephanie lalandewith whom my good old relative besides making me her sole heir when she diesif she ever doeshas been at the trouble of concocting me a match in conclusion i am done forever with billets doux and am never to be met without spectacles
