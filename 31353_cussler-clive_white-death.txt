clive cussler white death numa files prologue i west of the british isles diego aguirrez awoke from his restless sleep think ing that a rat had scurried across his face his wide forehead was bathed in a cold sweat his heart hammered in his chest and a formless panic gnawed hungrily at his innards he listened to the muffled snores of his sleeping crewmen and the chuckle and swash of wavelets against the wooden hull nothing appeared to be amiss yet he couldnt shake the uneasy feeling that an unseen threat lurked in the shadows easing from his hammock aguirrez wrapped a thick woolen blanket around his brawny shoulders and climbed a companionway to the fogshrouded deck in the muted light of the moon the solidly built caravel glistened as if it were made of spiderwebs aguirrez went over to a form huddled next to the yellow glow of an oil lamp good evening captain the man said at his approach aguirrez was pleased to see that the watch was awake and alert good evening the captain replied all goes well yes sir still no wind though aguirrez glanced up at the ghostly masts and sails it will come i can smell it aye captain the man said stifling a yawn go below and get some sleep ill relieve you it isnt time yet my shifts not over for another turn of the glass the captain picked up the hourglass next to the lamp and turned it over there he said now its time the man grunted his thanks and shuffled off to the crews quar ters while the captain took up a post in the ships high squaredoff stern castle he gazed off to the south staring into the smoky mists that rose like steam from the mirrorflat sea he was still at his post when the sun rose his oliveblack eyes were redrimmed and they ached with weariness his blanket was soggy with moisture with typical stubbornness he ignored the discomforts and paced back and forth like a caged tiger the captain was a basque an inhabitant of the rugged mountains between spain and france and his instincts honed by years at sea were not to be taken lightly the basques were the best sailors in the world and men like aguirrez routinely voyaged to regions that more timid mariners regarded as the realm of sea serpents and giant whirlpools like many basques he had eyebrows like bramble thick ets large protruding ears a long straight nose and a chin like a mountain ledge in later years scientists would suggest that the basques with their heavy facial features were the direct descendants ofcromagnon man the crew emerged yawning and stretching into the gray predawn light and set about their tasks the captain refused offers to relieve him his persistence was rewarded near midmorning his blood shot eyes glimpsed a shimmering splinter of light through the thick curtain of haze the quick nervous flicker lasted only an instant but it filled aguirrez with an odd combination of relief and dread pulse quickening aguirrez raised the brass spyglass that hung by a cord around his neck snapped the sections to their full length and squinted through the eyepiece at first he saw only a gray monotone circle of magnification where the fog bank blended with the sea the captain wiped his eyes with his sleeve blinked to clear his vision and raised the telescope again again he saw nothing a trick of the light he thought suddenly he saw movement through the lens a sharp prow had emerged from the mists like the probing beak of a raptor then the full length of the boat came into view the slim blackhulled craft shot forward glided a few seconds then surged forward again two other ships followed in quick succession scudding over the flat sur face like giant water insects aguirrez swore softly to himself war galleys sunlight reflected off the wet oars that dipped into the sea with a mechanical cadence with each sweep of the oars the sleek vessels rapidly closed the gap separating them from the sailing ship the captain calmly appraised the fastapproaching ships from stem to stern taking in the clean functional lines with the appreci ation of a skilled shipbuilder true greyhounds of the sea capable of short bursts of high speed the fighting galleys developed by venice were used by dozens of european countries each galley was propelled by a hundredandfifty oars three ranks of twentyfive on each side the low level profile imparted a stream lined look that was ahead of its time gracefully curving up at the rear where the captains house overhung the stern the prow was elon gated although it no longer functioned as a ram as in times past i he bow had been transformed into an artillery platform a small threesided lateen sail hung from a single mast near the stern but human muscle power gave the galley its speed and ma neuverability the spanish penal system provided a steady supply of rowers condemned to die pulling the heavy thirtyfoot oars the cor sia a narrow gangway that ran fore and aft was the realm of hard men who urged the rowers on with threats and whiplashes aguirrez knew that the firepower arrayed against his ship would be formidable the galleys were nearly twice the eightyfoot length of his tubby caravel the fighting galley routinely carried fifty of the singleshot muzzleloaded smoothbore arquebuses the heaviest gun a castiron highangle mortar called a bombard was mounted on the bow artillery platform its position on the rightfront side was a holdover from the days when naval strategy centered on ramming the enemy headon while the galley was a throwback to the sturdy greek craft that carried odysseus from circe to cyclops the caravel was the wave of the future fast and maneuverable for its day the rugged ship could sail anywhere on the watery surface of the earth the caravel blended its southern rigging with a tough northern hull of flushbuilt plank ing and a hinged axeled rudder the easily rigged lateen sails de scended from the arabic dhow made the ship far superior to any contemporary sailing vessel when sailing close to the wind unfortunately for aguirrez those sails so miraculous in their sim ple efficiency now hung limply from the twin masts with no breeze to stir the canvas the sails were useless sheets of fabric the becalmed caravel was glued to the surface of the sea like a ship in a bottle aguirrez glanced at the lifeless canvas and cursed the elements conspiring against him he seethed at the shortsighted arrogance that had led him to defy his instinct to stay far out to sea with their low freeboard the galleys were not designed for open waters and would have had difficulty following the caravel but he had sailed close to land because the route was more direct with favorable winds his ship could outrun any vessel on the sea hed never antic ipated a dead calm nor had he expected the galleys to find him so easily he brushed away his selfrecriminations and suspicions time enough to deal with questions later tossing his blanket aside as if it were a matadors cape he strode the length of the ship bellowing or ders the men came alive as the captains powerful voice echoed from one end of the ship to the other within seconds the deck re sembled a stirredup anthill launch the boats aguirrez pointed to the approaching war ships look smart lads or well be keeping the executioners work ing day and night they moved to their tasks with quicksilver speed every man on board the caravel knew that the horrors of torture and burning at the stake would be their fate if the galleys captured them within min utes all three of the caravels boats were in the water manned by the strongest rowers the lines attached to the ship went bowstringtaut but the caravel stubbornly refused to move aguirrez yelled at his men to row harder the air over his head turned blue as he appealed to their basque manhood with every salty curse he could muster pull together aguirrez shouted his dark eyes blazing youre rowing like a bunch of spanish whores the oars churned the calm water into a sudsy foam the ship shuddered and creaked and finally it began to inch forward aguir rez roared his encouragement and dashed back to the stern he leaned on the rail and put his eye to his spyglass through the lens he saw a tall thin man in the bow platform of the lead galley look ing back at him through a telescope el braserof aguirrez whispered with unveiled contempt ignatius martinez saw aguirrez looking at him and curled his thick voluptuarys lips in a snarl of triumph his pitiless yellow eyes burned with fanaticism in their deepset sockets the long aristocratic nose was lifted in the air as if it had encountered a bad smell captain blackthorne he purred to the redbearded man at his side spread the word among the rowers tell them they will be free if we catch our prey the captain shrugged and carried out the order knowing that martinez had no intention of keeping his promise that it was merely a cruel deception el brasero was spanish for brazier martinez had earned his nick name for his zeal in roasting heretics at the auto de fe as the public spectacles of punishment were called he was a familiar figure at the quemerdo or place of burning where he used every means includ ing bribery to make sure that he had the honor of lighting the pyre although his official title was public prosecutor and advisor to the inquisition he had persuaded his higherups to appoint him as the inquisitor in charge of prosecuting the basques the prosecution of the basques was extremely profitable the inquisition immediately confiscated the property of the accused the stolen wealth of its vic tims financed the inquisitions prisons secret police torture cham bers army and bureaucracy and it made rich men of the inquisitors basques had brought the arts of navigation and shipbuilding to unheardof levels of expertise aguirrez had sailed to the secret fish ing grounds across the western sea dozens of times on whaling or codfishing trips basques were natural capitalists and many like aguirrez had become rich selling whale products and cod his busy shipyard on the nervion river built vessels of every type and size aguirrez had been aware of the inquisition and its excesses but he was too busy running his various enterprises and enjoying the infre quent company of his beautiful wife and two children to give it much thought it was on his return from one trip that he had learned first hand that martinez and the inquisition were malevolent forces that could not be ignored an angry crowd had greeted the fishladen ships that edged up to the docks to unload their catch the people had shouted for aguir rezs attention and pleaded for his help the inquisition had arrested a group of local women and charged them with witchcraft his wife had been among those taken she and the others had been tried and found guilty and were being moved from prison to the burning place aguirrez calmed the crowd and went directly to the provincial capital although he was a man of influence his pleas to free the prisoners fell on deaf ears officials said they could do nothing this was a church matter not a civil one some whispered that their own lives and property could be placed in jeopardy if they went against the orders of the holy office hi brasero they whispered in fear aguirrez had taken matters into his own hands and rounded up a hundred of his men theyd attacked the convoy taking the ac cused witches to the stake and freed the women without firing a shot even as he took his wife into his arms aguirrez knew that el brasero had engineered the witchcraft arrests and trials to bring the basque and his property within his greedy grasp aguirrez suspected that there was an even more compelling rea son he had come to the inquisitions attention the year before a council of elders had given him stewardship of the most sacred relics of basqueland one day they would be used to rally the basques in a right for independence against spain for now they were contained in a chest hidden in a secret chamber of aguirrezs luxurious home martinez could have heard of the artifacts the region was rife with informers martinez would know how sacred relics could ignite fa naticism in much the same way that the holy grail had launched the bloody crusades anything that united the basques would be a threat to the inquisition martinez did not respond to the freeing of the women aguirrez was no fool martinez would strike only after he had collected every scrap of incriminating evidence aguirrez used this time to prepare he put the fastest caravel in his fleet up on the ways at san sebastian as if it were undergoing repairs he spread generous amounts of money around to enlist his own army of spies including some in the prosecutors entourage and made it known that the biggest reward would go to the man who warned of his arrest then he went about his business as usual and waited staying close to home where he surrounded himself with guards all veterans of combat several months quietly passed then one night one of his spies a man who worked in the office of the inquisition itself galloped breathlessly up to his villa and pounded on his door martinez was leading a group of soldiers to arrest him aguirrez paid off the grate ful spy and put his welllaid plans into effect he kissed his wife and children goodbye and promised to meet them in portugal while his family escaped in a farm wagon with much of their wealth a decoy was dispatched to lead the arrest party on a merry chase through the countryside accompanied by his armed entourage aguirrez made his way to the coast under cover of darkness the caravel slid down the ways unfurled its sails and headed north when the sun rose the next day a fleet of fighting galleys had emerged from the dawn mists in an attempt to cut the caravel off using adroit seamanship aguirrez had eluded his pursuers and a steady breeze had sent the ship winging north along the coast of france he set a course for denmark where he would begin the turn west toward greenland and iceland and the great land be yond but then off the british isles the ships wake petered out along with the wind and aguirrez and his men found themselves sitting in a pool of dead air now with the trio of galleys closing in for the kill aguirrez was de termined to fight to the death if need be but his strongest instinct was survival he ordered the gun crew to prepare for battle in arming the caravel he had sacrificed armament for speed firepower for flex ibility the standard arquebus was a cumbersome muzzleloaded matchlock gun that was hooked onto a portable stand and needed two men to load and fire the gunners on the caravel were armed with smaller lighter versions that could be fired by one man his crewmen were excellent marksmen who would make every shot count for heavy artillery aguirrez had chosen a pair of bronze cannon that could be moved on wheeled carriages the gun crews had drilled to the point where they could load aim and fire with clockwork preci sion unheard of in most ships the rowers were visibly tired and the ship was like a fly crawl ing across a bucket of molasses the galleys were almost within fir ing range their snipers could pick off the rowers with ease he decided that the men would have to stay at their oars as long as the ship moved aguirrez had a modicum of control he urged his men to keep pulling and he was turning back to help the gun crew when his finetuned senses detected a shift in temperature usually the har binger of a breeze the smaller lateen sail flapped like the wing of an injured bird then it was still as the captain scanned the sea for the puckering of the surface that would herald a puff of wind he heard the unmistakable roar of a bombard the widemouthed mortar was carried in a fixed carriage with no means of training or elevation the cannonball splashed harmlessly into the sea about a hundred yards off the caravels stern aguirrez laughed knowing that it was practically impossible to score a direct hit with a bombard even on a target as slowmoving as the caravel the galleys had been moving threeabreast as a cloud of smoke drifted over the water the galleys flanking the lead boat shot ahead and came straight in behind the caravel the maneuver was a feint both galleys veered to the left and one took the lead galleys had most of their armament on the right front side as they passed the slowmoving caravel they could rake its deck and rigging with small and medium guns anticipating the attack aguirrez had placed both cannon close to gether on the port side and covered their muzzles with a black cloth the enemy would assume that the caravel also carried the ineffi cient bombard and that its flanks were virtually unprotected the captain scanned the artillery platform through the spyglass and swore as he recognized a former crewman who had sailed with him on many fishing trips the man knew the route aguirrez fol lowed to the western sea more than likely the inquisition was hold ing a threat against his family aguirrez checked the elevation of each cannon he pulled aside the black cloth and sighted through the gun ports on an imaginary circle on the sea having encountered no opposition the first galley came in close to the caraveland aguirrez gave the order to fire both cannon thundered one shot was premature and snapped the beak off the galley but the second cannonball smashed into the ar tillery platform the bow section disintegrated in a burst of fire and smoke water poured into the ruptured hull aided by the galleys forward speed and the boat slipped below the surface and sank within moments aguirrez felt a pang of pity for the rowers manacled to their oars and unable to escape but their death would be quick compared to weeks and months of suffering the crew of the second galley saw the lead boats fate and in a dis play of the nimbleness the triremes were famous for it veered sharply away from the caravel then looped around to rejoin martinez who had prudently held his boat back aguirrez guessed that the galleys would split up come around both sides of the ship careful to stay out of cannon range then cir cle back and attack the vulnerable rowers almost as if martinez were reading his thoughts the galleys pulled apart and each began a long swing around the opposite sides of the ship circling like wary hyenas aguirrez heard a snap above his head caused by a desultory flap of the mainsail he held his breath wondering if it was only an er rant puff as before then the sail flapped again and filled out and the masts creaked he ran to the bow leaned over the rail and shouted at his deck crew to bring the rowers back on board too late the galleys had cut short their long lazy loop and angled sharply back on a course that brought them directly at the ship the right hand galley swung around and presented its long side and the gun ners concentrated their arquebus fire on the defenseless longboat a withering fusillade raked the rowers emboldened the second galley tried the same maneuver on the port side the caravels marksmen had rallied after being taken by surprise and they concentrated their fire on the exposed artillery platform where aguirrez had last seen martinez elbrasero was un doubtedly hiding behind thick wood but he would get the message the volley hit the platform like a leaden fist as soon as the marks en let off one shot they picked up another weapon and fired again while crewmen feverishly reloaded the guns the fusillade was con tinuous and deadly unable to withstand the prolonged hail of fire the galley veered off its hull splintered and its oars in fragments the caravels crew rushed to haul in the long boats the first boat was bathed in blood and half the rowers were dead aguirrez yelled orders to his heavy gunners raced to the helm and grabbed the wheel gun crews swarmed around the cannon and muscled the heavy weapons into the bow gunports other deckhands adjusted the rig ging to wring the most out of the freshening breeze as the caravel picked up speed leaving a growing wake the cap tain steered the ship toward the galley that had been raked by fire from his gunners the galley tried to elude him but it had lost row ers and was moving erratically aguirrez waited until he was within fifty yards the galleys gunners fired at their pursuer but the shots had little effect the cannon boomed and the balls scored a direct hit on the roofed captains house on the stern blasting it to toothpicks the cannon were speedily reloaded and aimed at the galleys waterline where they punched massive holes in the hull heavy with men and equip ment the galley quickly slipped under the surface leaving bubbles shards of wood and a few hapless swimmers to mark its passing the captain turned his attention to the third galley seeing the odds change martinez was on the run his galley sped off to the south like a startled hare the agile caravel turned from its kill and tried to follow aguirrez had blood in his eyes as he savored the prospect of dousing el braseros fire it was not to be the freshening breeze was still gentle and the caravel could not match the speed of the fleeing galley whose row ers were pulling for their lives before long the galley was a dark spot on the ocean aguirrez would have chased martinez to the ends of the earth but he saw sails on the horizon and guessed that they might be enemy re inforcements the inquisition had a long reach he remembered his promise to his wife and children and his responsibility to the basque people reluctantly he swung the ship around and set a course north toward denmark aguirrez had no illusions about his enemy mar tinez might be a coward but he was patient and persistent it would be only a matter of time before they met again prologue ii germany shortly after midnight the dogs began to howl along a swath of countryside between the city of hamburg and the north sea terrified canines stared at the black moonless sky with lolling tongues and shivering haunches their keen hearing had picked up what human ears could not the faint whir of engines from the giant silverskinned torpedo that slithered through the thick layer of clouds high above four maybach cylinder engines a pair on each side hung in streamlined housings from the bottom of the footlong airship lights glowed in the oversized windows of the control car near the rront of the fuselage the long narrow control car was organized like a ships pilothouse complete with compass and spoked steering wheels for the rudder and elevators standing next to the helmsman feet wide apart arms clasped behind his back was captain heinrich braun a tall ramrodstraight figure impeccably dressed in a darkblue uniform and a tallpeaked cap cold had seeped into the cabin and overwhelmed its heaters so he wore a thick turtleneck sweater under his jacket brauns haughty profile could have been chiseled from granite his rigid posture and silver hair cropped close to his scalp militarystyle and the slight elevation to his jutting chin recalled his days as a pruss ian naval officer braun checked the compass heading then turned to a portly middleaged man whose bushy upturned mustache made him re semble a goodnatured walrus well herr lutz we have successfully completed the first leg of our historic journey braun had an elegant anachronistic way of speaking we are maintaining our goal of one hundred twenty kilo meters per hour even with a slight headwind fuel consumption is exactly as calculated my compliments herr professor herman lutz looked like the bartender in a munich beer cellar but he was one of the most highly skilled aeronautical engineers in europe after his retirement braun had written a book suggesting airship service across the pole to north america at a lecture pro moting his book hed met lutz who was trying to raise money to fund a polar airship venture the men were drawn to each other by their firm belief that airships could promote international cooperation lutzs blue eyes danced with excitement my congratulations to you captain braun together we will advance the greater glory of world peace im sure you mean the greater glory ofgermany sneered ger hardt heinz a short slight man who had been standing behind the others close enough to hear every word with great ceremony he lit up a cigarette in a steeltipped voice braun said herr heinz have you for gotten that above our heads are thousands of cubic feet of highly flammable hydrogen smoking is permitted only in the section so designated in the crews quarters heinz mumbled an answer and snuffed out the cigarette with his fingers attempting to gain the edge he drew himself up like a preen ins rooster heinz had shaved his head to the skin and affected a pincenez for his nearsighted eyes the palewhite head was perched on narrow shoulders while the effect was supposed to be intimi dating it was more grotesque lutz thought that with his tight black leather overcoat heinz looked like a maggot emerging from its pupa but he wisely kept this thought to himself having heinz on board was the price he and braun had had to pay to get the airship into the air that and the aircrafts name nieztsche after the german philosopher germany was struggling to get out from under the financial and psychologi cal yoke imposed by the treaty of versailles when lutz had pro posed an airship voyage to the north pole the public had been eager to contribute funds but the project had stagnated a group of industrialists quietly approached lutz with a new proposition with military backing they would fund an airship to make a secret trip to the north pole if the mission succeeded it would be made public and the allies would be presented with a fait accompli that displayed the superiority of german air technology failure would be kept a secret to avoid a black mark the airship was built under cover lutz patterning it on the huge airship gmf zep pelin as part of the deal he agreed to take heinz along on the ex pedition to represent the interests of the industrialists captain would you enlighten us as to our progress lutz said braun stepped over to a chart table here is our position we will follow the course taken by the norge and the italia to the spitsber gen islands from there we make the dash to the pole i expect the last leg to take about fifteen hours depending on weather i hope we have better luck than the italians heinz said un necessarily reminding the others of previous airship attempts to reach the pole in the norwegian explorer amundsen and an italian engineer named umberto nobile had successfully reached and cir cled the pole in an italian dirigible named the norge however no biles second expedition in the sister ship known as the italia was supposed to have landed at the pole but it had crashed amundsen had been lost in a rescue attempt nobile and some of his men were finally rescued it is not a question of luck said lutz this airships design built on the mistakes of others precisely with this mission in mind it is stronger and better able to handle rough weather it has redun dant communications systems the use of blaugas will allow for greater control because we wont have to vent hydrogen as ballast we have defrosting ability in our controls its machinery is made to op erate at subfreezing arctic temperatures it is the fastest airship ever built we have a network of planes and ships in place that will re spond immediately if we run into any problems our meteorologi cal capacity is second to none i have the utmost confidence in you and the ship heinz said with an unctuous smile as his natural inclination to toady up to oth ers came to the fore good i suggest we all get some rest before we reach spitsbergen we will refuel there and proceed to the pole the trip to spitsbergen was uneventful contacted by radio the refueling and resupply crew was ready and the airship was on its way within hours heading north past the franz josef archipelago the dull gray sea below was speckled with pieces of floating ice the chunks eventually graduated to large irregular pancakes that joined to form ice broken here and there by dark black veins of open water near the pole the ice became a vast unbroken expanse al though the bluishwhite surface looked flat from a thousand feet in the air land explorers had learned the hard way that it was criss crossed by ridges and hummocks good news braun announced cheerfully we are at eighty five degrees north we will make the pole soon the weather condi tions are ideal no wind clear skies the anticipation grew and even those who were offduty crowded into the control cabin and peered out the big windows as if they hoped to see a tall striped shaft marking the spot at degrees north one observer called out captain i think i see something on the ice the captain peered through his binoculars at where the crewman was pointing most interesting he handed the binoculars to lutz its a boat lutz said after a moment braun nodded in agreement and directed the helmsman to change course what are you doing heinz said braun handed him the binoculars look he said without elab oration heinz fumbled with his pincenez and squinted through the glasses i see nothing he said flatly braun wasnt surprised at the answer the man was as blind as a bat nevertheless there is a boat on the ice what would a boat be doing here heinz said eyes blinking rap idly ive heard of no other expeditions to the pole i order you to re turn to our course on what grounds herr heinz the captain asked elevating his chin even more it was apparent from the coldness of his voice that he didnt care what the reply would be our mission is to go to the north pole heinz said captain braun glared at heinz as if he was about to kick the lit tle man out the door and watch his body fall onto the pack ice lutz recognized the dangerous mood the captain was in and in tervened herr heinz you are right my friend but i believe our charge was also to investigate any matter that may be of aid to us or the next expedition braun added in addition we are dutybound no less than any ship that sails the sea to help those who may be in distress if they see us they will radio someone and jeopardize our mis sion heinz said trying another tack they would have to be blind and deaf not to have seen or heard us said braun and if they report our presence so what our ship has no markings except for the name seeing he was defeated heinz slowly lit up a cigarette and con spicuously blew smoke in the air daring the captain to stop him the captain ignored the defiant gesture and gave the order to de scend the helmsman adjusted the controls and the giant airship began its long sloping glide down to the pack ice the faroe islands the present the lone ship bearing down on the faroe islands looked like the loser in a paintball fight the hull of the foot sea sentinel was splashed from stem to stern with an eyeblinding psy chedelic potpourri of tiedye rainbow colors a piping calliope and a crew of clowns would not have been out of place to complete the carnival atmosphere the ships raffish appearance was deceptive as many had learned to their sorrow the sea sentinel was as dan gerous in its own way as any vessel in the pages of jane s fighting ships the sea sentinel had arrived in faroe waters after a mile trip from the shetland islands off of scotland greeting the vessel was a small flotilla of fishing boats and yachts hired by international press organizations the danish cruiser leiferifson stood by and a hel icopter circled above in the overcast sky it was drizzling typical summer weather for the faroes an ar chipelago of eighteen specks of rock located in the northeast atlantic halfway between denmark and iceland the human inhabi tants of the faroes are largely descended from the vikings who set tled there in the ninth century although the islands are part of the kingdom of denmark the locals speak a language derived from old norse the people are outnumbered by the millions of birds that nest in the towering cliffs that stand like ramparts against the sea a tall ruggedly built man in his forties stood on the ships fore deck surrounded by reporters and camera technicians marcus ryan the captain of the sea sentinel was conservatively dressed in a black tailored officers uniform decorated with gold braid on the collar and sleeves with his movie star profile tanned skin the collarlength hair tousled by the breeze and the fringe of gingercolored beard framing his square jaw ryan looked as if he had been cast for the movie role of a dashing sea captain the image was one he went to great pains to cultivate congratulations ladies and gentlemen ryan said in a well modulated voice that carried over the rumble of engines and the swash of water against the hull sorry we couldnt have provided smoother seas some of you look a bit green around the gills after our trip from the shetlands the members of the press pool had been chosen by lot to cover the invasion story after a night spent in cramped bunks as the ship nav igated rolling seas some members of the fourth estate were wish ing they hadnt been so lucky thats okay croaked a female reporter from cnn just make sure the story is worth all the damned dramamine i swallowed ryan flashed his hollywood smile i can almost guarantee that youll see action he swept his arm theatrically in a wide arc the cameras dutifully followed his pointing finger to the warship the cruiser was moving in a wide circle just fast enough to maintain headway fluttering from its main mast was the redandwhite flag of denmark the last time we tried to stop the faroese from slaugh tering pilot whales that danish cruiser you see fired a shot across our bow small arms fire narrowly missed one of our crew although the danes deny they shot at us did you really slam them with a garbage gun asked the cnn reporter we defended ourselves with the materials at hand ryan replied with mock seriousness our cook had rigged up a catapult to launch biodegradable garbage bags off the deck hes a medieval weapons buff so he developed a gadget similar to a trebuchet that had a sur prising range when the cruiser tried to cut us off we nailed it with a direct hit much to our surprise and theirs he paused and with per fect comic timing said theres nothing like being slimed with potato peels eggshells and coffee grounds to take the wind out of your sails laughter rippled through the group the bbc reporter said arent you worried that antics of that sort add to the reputation given to the sentinels of the sea as one of the more radical environmental and animal rights groups your organization has freely admitted to scuttling whaling ships blocking waterways spraypainting baby seals harassing sealers cutting drift nets ryan raised his hand in protest those were pirate whale ships international waters and the other stuff you mentioned we can doc ument as legal under international agreements on the other hand our ships have been rammed our people gassed and shot at and ille gal arrests made what do you say to those people who call you a terrorist organi zation a reporter from the economist said i would ask them what could be more terrifying than the cold blooded slaughter of fifteen hundred to two thousand defenseless pilot whales each year and i would remind them that no one has ever been hurt or killed by an sos intervention ryan flashed his smile again cmon folks youve met the people on this ship he gestured toward an attractive young woman who had been standing apart from the others listening to the discussion tell me honestly does this lady look scary therri weld was in her midthirties of medium height with a compact wellproportioned body the faded jeans and workshirt she wore under her baggy windbreaker did little to disguise her ath letic but distinctly feminine figure an sos baseball hat covered chestnut hair whose natural curl was made even more pronounced by the damp air and her gentian eyes were alert and intelligent she stepped forward and gave the press corps a bright smile ive already met most of you she said in a voice that was low but clear so you know that when marcus doesnt have me slaving away as a deckhand im a legal advisor to sos as marcus said we use direct action as a last resort we pulled back after our last en counter in these waters to pursue a boycott of faroe fish but you still havent stopped the grinds the bbc reporter said to ryan the sentinels have never underestimated how tough it would be to end a tradition that goes back hundreds of years ryan answered the faroese have the same stubbornness their viking forefathers needed to survive theyre not about to give in to a bunch ofwhale huggers like us but while i admire the faroese i think the grindarap is cruel and barbaric its unworthy of the islanders as a people i know a few of you have been to a grind before anyone care to sum it up damned bloody business the bbc reporter admitted but i dont like fox hunts either at least the fox has a sporting chance ryan said his jaw hard ening the grind is simply a massacre when someone spots a pod of pilot whales the siren goes off and boats herd the whales in to shore the localswomen and kids sometimesare waiting on the beach theres a lot of drinking and its a big party for everyone except the whales the people stick gaffs into the whales blowholes and drag the animals inshore where they have their jugular veins cut and they bleed to death the water turns red from the bloodletting some times youll see people sawing the animals heads off while the whales are still alive a blond female reporter said how is a grind any different from slaughtering steers for beef youre asking the wrong person ryan said im a vegan he waited for the laughter to die down your point is welltaken though we may be protecting the faroese from themselves pilot whale meat is loaded with mercury and cadmium its hurting their children but if they want to poison themselves and their kids the re porter said isnt it intolerant of sos to condemn their traditions gladiatorial combat and public executions were traditions once civilization decided these savage spectacles have no place in the mod ern world inflicting unnecessary pain on defenseless animals is the same thing they say its tradition we say its murder thats why were back why not continue with the boycott the bbc man asked therri addressed the question the boycott was too slow hun dreds of pilot whales continue to be killed so weve changed our strategy the oil industry wants to sink wells in these waters if we bring enough bad publicity to the hunt the oil companies might hold back that would put pressure on the islanders to end their grinds and weve got other business here as well ryan added theres a multinational fishprocessing company that were going to picket to demonstrate our opposition to the harmful effects offishfarming the fox news reporter was incredulous is there anyone you dont plan to antagonize let me know who weve missed ryan said to laughter the bbc man said how far do you intend to push your protest as far as we can this hunt is illegal under international law in our opinion you people are here as witnesses things could get dicey if anyone wants to leave now i can arrange a transfer he scanned the faces surrounding him and smiled no one good well then brave souls into the breach we go weve been keeping track of several pods of pilot whales the waters around here fairly teem with them that young deckhand you see waving wildly may have something to tell us a crew member who had been keeping watch trotted over a couple of pods are passing by stremoy he said our observer on shore says the sirens wailing and the boats are being launched ryan turned back to the reporters theyll probably try to drive the whales ashore at the kvivik killing field well put ourselves be tween the boats and the whales if we cant drive the pod away well start cutting the boats off the cnn reporter pointed to the cruiser isnt it going to irritate those chaps im counting on it ryan said with a ferocious grin high in the bridge of the leiferifsson a man in civilian clothes squinted at the sea sentinel through a powerful pair of binoculars my god karl becker murmured to eric petersen the ships cap tain that ship looks as if it were painted by a madman ah so you know captain ryan petersen replied with a faint smile only by reputation he seems to have what the americans call a teflon shield for all his lawbreaking he has never been convicted on any charge what do you know of ryan captain first of all he is not mad he is possessed with a nearfanatical determination but all his actions are measured even the gaudy color scheme of his ship is calculated it lulls unsuspecting opponents into making mistakesand shows up quite well on television maybe we could arrest them for visual pollution of the sea cap tain petersen said becker i suspect ryan would find an expert to say the ship is nothing less than a floating work of art glad to see that youve maintained your sense of humor despite the humiliation this ship suffered from its last encounter with the sentinels of the sea it only took a few minutes of hosing down the deck to get rid of the garbage they threw at us my predecessor felt that it was neces sary to respond to the garbage attack with gunfire becker winced captain olafsen was still commanding a desk the last time i heard the publicity was incredibly bad danish war ship attacks unarmed boat headlines that the crew was drunk my god what a disaster having served as olafsens first officer i have the greatest re spect for his judgment his problem was that he didnt have clear di rection from the bureaucrats in copenhagen bureaucrats like me becker said the captain responded with a tight smile i follow orders my su periors said that you were coming aboard as a navydepartment ob server here you are i wouldnt want a bureaucrat aboard my ship if i were in your shoes but i assure you i have no authority to supersede your orders i will of course report what i see and hear but let me remind you that if this mission is a fiasco both our heads will roll the captain hadnt known what to make of becker when he first welcomed him aboard the erilsson the official was short and dark and with his large moist eyes and long nose he looked like a de spondent cormorant petersen on the other hand fit the common mold for many danish men he was tall squarejawed and blond i was reluctant to have you aboard the captain said but the hot heads who are involved in this situation could let things get out of control i welcome the opportunity to consult with someone from the government becker thanked the captain and said what do you think of this grindarap business the captain shrugged i have many friends on the island they would rather die than give up their old customs they say its what makes them who they are i respect their feelings and you im a copenhagener this whale thing seems like a big waste of time to me but theres a great deal at stake here the government respects the wishes of the islanders but the boycott has hurt their fish ing we dont want the faroes to lose their livelihood so that they be come a ward of the state too damned expensive to say nothing of the revenue losses to our country if the oil companies are persuaded to hold back their drilling because of this whale hunt im well aware that this situation is something of a morality play all the actors know their roles exactly the islanders have planned this grind to defy sos and to make sure parliament is aware of their concerns ryan has been just as vocal in saying he wont allow any thing to stand in his way and you captain petersen do you know your role of course i just dont know how the drama ends becker grunted in answer let me reassure you the captain said the faroe police have been ordered to stay in the background under no circumstances am i to use guns my orders are to protect the islanders from danger i can use my judgment on how this is to be done if the sea sentinel comes close enough to endanger the smaller boats then i have the au thority to nudge the sos ship aside please excuse me mr becker i see that the curtain is about to go up from several harbors fishing boats were racing to a disturbed area of ocean they were moving fast their bows up on plane bounc ing over the low chop the boats were converging on a spot where the shiny black backs of a pod of pilot whales broke the surface fountains of spray exploded from the whales blowholes the sea sentinel was also moving in on the whales petersen gave his helmsman orders the cruiser broke out of its holding pattern becker had been mulling over petersens earlier words tell me captain when does a nudge become a ram whenever i want it to isnt there a fine line between the two petersen told his helmsman to increase speed and set a course di rectly toward the sea sentinel then the captain turned to becker and gave him a grim smile were about to find out ryan watched the cruiser break out of its lazy circle and head toward the sos ship looks like hamlet finally made a decision he said to chuck mercer his first mate who was at the wheel of the sea sentinel the sea sentinel had been trying to drive the whales out to sea the pod held about fifty pilot whales and some of the female whales were holding back to stay with their calves slowing the rescue at tempt the sos ship zigzagged like a lone cowpoke trying to corral stray cattle but the nervous whales made the job almost impossible like herding cats ryan muttered he went out on the star board bridge wing to see how close the advancing whaleboats were to the pod he had never seen so many islanders involved in a grind it seemed as if every harbor in the faroes had emptied out dozens of boats ranging in size from commercial trawlers to open dories powered by outboard motors were speeding from several different directions to join the hunt the dark water was streaked with their wakes therri weld was already out on the wing watching the armada gather youve got to admire their stubbornness she said ryan was equally awestruck he nodded in agreement now i know how custer felt the faroese are going all out to defend their bloody traditions this is no spontaneous outpouring therri said from the or derly way theyre moving theyve got a plan the words had barely left her lips when as if on signal the ad vancing fleet began to split up in a pincer movement in a classic mil itary flanking maneuver the boats swept around ryans ship so they were on the seaward side of the slowmoving whales they spread out in a line facing inshore with the pilot whales between them and the sea sentinel the ends of the line began to curve slowly inward the whales bunched closer together and moved toward shore ryan was afraid of hurting the panicked whales or breaking up family units if the ship stood in place reluctantly he ordered the helmsman to move the ship out of the path of the hunt as the sea sentinel moved aside a loud chorus of triumphant cheers went up from the fishermen the line of boats began to wrap itself around the hapless whales in a deadly embrace the whale boats moved forward tightening up the line to drive their prey to the killing field where the sharp knives and spears of the executioners awaited ryan ordered mercer to steer the sea sentinel out to open water giving up awfully easy mercer said wait and see ryan said with an enigmatic smile the cruiser came up alongside the sea sentinel like a cop escort ing an unruly spectator from a soccer game but when the ships were about a half mile from the whale hunt the navy escort began to fall back ryan took over the wheel frequently checking the cruisers lo cation when the ships were in what he judged to be the right posi tion he picked up the phone to the engine room full speed ahead he ordered the sea sentinel was a clunky widebeamed vessel high at both ends with a silhouette like an oldfashioned bathtub the slow moving research ship was designed mainly as a stable platform from which to launch undersea instrumentation and nets the first thing ryan had done after sos had acquired the ship at auction was to out fit the engine room with powerful diesels that could push her along at a more respectable clip ryan cut the wheel hard left the ship shivered from the strain as it circled about in a great arcing swash of foam and raced back to ward the whale hunt caught offguard the cruiser attempted to follow but the warship couldnt match the sea sentinels tight turn and went wide losing valuable seconds the whale hunt had advanced to within a mile of shore when the sea sentinel caught up with the pod and the line of herdsmen the sos ship made a sharp turn that brought it across the wakes of the whaleboats ryan stayed at the wheel he wanted sole responsibility in case something went wrong his plan to disrupt the hunt required a deft touch on the helm too fast or too close and the whalers would be overturned and thrown into the frigid water he kept the ship at an even speed using its broad beam to create a following sea the wave hit the boats sternon some boats managed to ride the wave that lifted them out of the water others lost headway and spun around in a wild attempt to prevent pitchpoling the line broke up into a disorganized jumble leaving large open spaces between the boats like gaps in a row of teeth ryan spun the wheel again and brought the sea sentinel around in another sharp turn that placed the ship broadside to the advancing whales the whales fleeing the advancing whalers sensed the presence of the ves sel turned back in the opposite direction and began to break through the openings in the hunt line now it was the turn of the sea sentinels crew to cheerbut their jubilation was shortlived the fastermoving cruiser had caught up with the sos ship and was alongside no more than a hundred yards away matching the sea sentinels speed knot for knot a voice speak ing in english crackled over the radio this is captain petersen of the leiferilsson calling the sos ves sel sea sentinel ryan snatched up the microphone this is captain ryan what can i do for you captain petersen you are requested to move your ship to open water we are acting in accordance with international law he gave therri a crooked grin my legal advisor is standing here by my side i dont intend to debate the finer points of the law with you or your advisors captain ryan you are endangering danish fishermen i have the authority to use force if you dont move immediately i will blow your ship out of the water the gun turret on the frigates fore deck turned so that the barrel was pointed directly at the sea sentinel thats a dangerous game youre playing ryan said with delib erate calmness a bad shot could miss us and sink some of those fish ermen youre trying to protect petersen said i dont think we would miss at this range but i want to avoid bloodshed youve given the tv cameras plenty of footage many pilot whales have escaped and the hunt has been dis rupted youve made your point and are no longer welcome ryan chuckled nice to deal with a reasonable man unlike your gunhappy predecessor okay i will pull out of the way but were not leaving faroe waters weve got other business you are free to do as you please as long as it doesnt break our laws or endanger our people ryan breathed a sigh of relief his outward serenity only an act he was aware of the danger to his crew and the press people he turned the helm back to his first mate and gave the order to move off slowly once beyond the hunt area the sea sentinel headed out to sea ryans plan was to anchor the ship a few miles offshore while he pre pared for the protest against the fish farm chastened by the sea sentinels earlier move petersen made sure the cruiser stayed slightly behind ready to dart in and cut off the ship if it tried to break away therri broke the tension in the pilothouse captain petersen doesnt know what a narrow escape he just had she said with a grin one shot and i would have dragged him into court and slapped a property lien on his ship i think he was more afraid of our garbage gun ryan said their mirth was cut short by the sound of mercer swearing ryan said whats wrong chuck damnit mark mercer was standing with both hands on the wheel you must have messed up the steering pushing this ship around like a jet ski he frowned then stepped back here you try it ryan tried to turn the wheel it gave for an inch on either side but it seemed locked into place he exerted a slight pressure then gave up the damned thing is locked into place ryan said with a com bination of anger and puzzlement ryan picked up the telephone ordered the engine room to stop and turned his attention back to the wheel instead of slowing down the ship inexplicably picked up speed ryan swore and called down to the engine room again whats wrong cal he barked those engines finally made you deaf i said cut speed not increase it ryans engineer cal rumson was a topflight seaman hell i know what you said cal replied the frustration in his voice was obvious i did reduce speed the engines are acting crazy the con trols dont seem to be working then kill the power ryan said im trying but the diesels are work ing harder keep trying cal ryan slammed the phone in its cradle this was insanity the ship seemed to have a mind of her own ryans eyes swept the sea ahead of the ship good news no vessels or land masses in the way the worst that could happen would be to run out of fuel in the at lantic ryan picked up the radio microphone to inform the cruiser of their predicament but he was interrupted by a yell from mercer the wheels turning mercer was trying to hold on to the wheel which was gradually spinning slowly to the right bringing the ship around toward the cruiser ryan grabbed the rim then he and mercer tried to bring the ship back on course they used every ounce of strength they could muster but the wheel slipped out of their sweaty hands and the sea sentinel moved closer to the warship the danish ship had taken notice of the course change a famil iar voice crackled over the radio come in sea sentinel this is captain petersen what is the in tention of your course change were having problems with our steering the wheel is locked and we cant shut down our engines thats impossible petersen said tell that to the ship a pause then petersen said well bear off to give you plenty of sea room well issue a warning as to any ships in your way thanks looks like youll get your wish about us leaving the faroes the cruiser began to peel away but before the danish ship could veer off the sea sentinel made a sharp turn and drove toward the cruisers exposed side like a water borne guided missile sailors lined the cruisers decks and frantically tried to wave off the advancing ship the cruiser blew short rapid warning bursts of its horn voices squawked over the radio in danish and english seeing that the ships were within seconds of disaster the sailors ran for their lives in a last desperate attempt to avert a certain collision ryan put all his weight into the wheel he was still hanging on when the ship smashed into the side of the cruiser the sea sentinels sharp bow pen etrated the steel hull plates like a bayonet then slid off the moving ship in a horrendous shriek of tearing metal the sea sentinel wallowed in the ocean like a dazed boxer who had just taken a hard right to the nose the cruiser was struggling to keep afloat as thousands of gallons of water poured in through the gaping hole in the hull crewmen scrambled into the lifeboats and prepared to lower them into the cold sea therri had been thrown to her knees by the impact ryan helped her to her feet and he and the others in the pilothouse dashed down to the deck the panicked tv people seeing that they were now part of the story rather than covering it were trying to get someone to tell them what to do people were bruised and limping someone was screaming for help and crew and press people were extracting a bloody body from the metal mush that was all that was left of the bow section ryan shouted orders to abandon ship with all the yelling and confusion no one looked up to see the hel icopter wheeling high above the ships the chopper circled a few times like a hungry buzzard then headed off along the coast off the northern coast of russia twelve hundred mile s southeast of the faroe islands the searchandsurvey ship william beebe lay at anchor in the frigid waters of the barents sea the letters numa were embla zoned on the footlong turquoise hull named after one of the pioneers in deepsea exploration the beebe bristled with muscular cranes and winches capable of hoisting entire boats off the ocean floor four crewmen dressed in neoprene wetsuits stood on the stern deck eyes fixed on a patch of ocean where the surface roiled like a bubbling cauldron the surface grew paler and mounded into a foamy white dome and the submersible rescue vehicle sea lamprey burst from the water like a mutant leviathan coming up for air with the precision of a navy assault team the ready crew pushed an outboardpowered inflatable down the stern ramp into the water scrambled aboard and raced toward the wallowing submersible the ready team attached a towline to the brightorange vehicle and a winch on board the beebe hauled in the submersible until it was under the tall aframe that angled out over the ships stern kevlar cables were fastened to eyebolts on the submersibles abbreviated deck the powerful aframe motor growled and the submersible was hoisted from the sea as it dangled from the cables the sea lam prey offered a full view of its unlovely cylindrical hull and strangely truncated accordion bow the aframe swung slowly over the deck and lowered the vehi cle into a custommade steel cradle while the waiting deck crew placed a ladder against the cradle then the hatch at the top of the low conning tower opened and clanged back on its hinges kurt austin poked his head out and blinked like a mole his steelgray almost platinum hair was radiant in the intense metallic light of the overcast sky austin greeted the deck crew with a wave then squeezed his broad shoulders through the narrow hatchway climbed out and stood next to the conning tower seconds later his partner joe zavala stuck his head out into the fresh air and handed his partner a shiny aluminum case austin tossed the case down to a stocky middleaged man who stood at the base of the ladder the man was dressed in a wool turtleneck sweater yellow rainproof pants and a slicker only the highpeaked cap on his head identified him as russian navy when he saw the case go airborne he let out a yell of despair he caught the container hobbled it for an instant then hugged it close to his chest as austin and zavala descended the ladder the russian opened the case and removed a paperwrapped object cushioned in protec tive plastic foam then he unwrapped the paper to reveal a heavy square bottle holding it like a newborn he mumbled in russian noticing the perplexed looks on the faces of the numa men he said pardon me gentlemen i was offering a prayer of thanks that the contents of the container were undamaged austin eyed the label and grimaced we just dove three hundred feet and cracked into a submarine to retrieve a bottle ofvodla oh noff vlasov replied digging into the case three bottles the finest vodka made in russia he carefully unwrapped the other containers and planted a noisy kiss on each one before laying it back in the case jewel of russia is one of our finest and moskovska is su perb charodei is the best chilled austin wondered if he would ever understand the russian mind set of course he said cheerfully sinking a submarine to keep your booze cool makes perfect sense when you explain it that way the submarine was an old foxtrotclass boat used for training vlasov said it hadnt seen service for more than thirty years he gave austin a karatgold smile you must admit it was your idea to place objects on the sub to test your ability to retrieve them mea culpa it didnt seem like a bad idea at the time vlasov closed the cover of the case your dive was a success then by and large zavala said weve got a few technical problems nothing major then we must celebrate with a drink vlasov said austin reached over and took the case from the russians hand no time like the present they picked up three plastic cups from the mess hall then headed for the ready room vlasov opened the bottle of charodei and poured a healthy portion into each cup he raised his drink in toast heres to the brave young men who died on the kursk vlasov slugged down the vodka as if he were drinking herbal tea austin sipped his drink he knew from past experience that demons lurked in the potent russian firewater and heres to something like the kursk never happening again austin said the kursk sinking had been one of the worst submarine disasters on record more than a hundred crewmen had died in when the oscar iiclass cruise missile sub had sunk in the barents sea after an explosion in the torpedo compartment vlasov said with your submersible no young man serving his country in any nation need die such a horrible death thanks to the ingenuity of numa we have a way to get into a sunken vessel whether the escape hatch is operable or accessible or not the inno vations you came up with for this vehicle are revolutionary thats kind of you to say commander vlasov joe deserves the credit for hammering some odds and ends together and applying good old american common sense thanks for the praise but i stole the idea from mother nature zavala said with typical modesty a graduate in marine engineering from the new york maritime college zavala possessed a brilliant mechanical mind hed been recruited by numa director james sandecker right out of college and in addition to his duties on the special assignments team led by austin he had designed numer ous manned and unmanned underwater vehicles nonsense vlasov said its a long way from the lamprey eel to your submersible the principles the same zavala said lampreys are superbly engineered creatures they latch on to a moving fish sink their ring of teeth into the skin and suck the blood out of it we use suction and lasers rather than teeth the main problem was coming up with a flexible watertight seal that would attach to any surface and allow us to make the cut with the use of spaceage materials and computers we put together a pretty good package vlasov raised his vodka glass again i hold the proof of your in genuity in my hand when will the sea lamprey be fully operational soon zavala said i hope the sooner the better i shudder to think of the potential for dis aster the soviets built some magnificent boats but my countrymen have always leaned toward gigantism over quality vlasov finished his drink and rose from his chair now i must go back to my cabin to prepare a report for my superiors they should be very pleased im grateful for all your hard work i will thank admiral sandecker per sonally as vlasov left one of the ships officers came into the room and told austin he had a telephone call austin picked up the telephone listened a few moments asked some questions then said stand by ill get right back to you he hung up and said that was natos east atlantic subma rine disaster office they need our help on a rescue mission someones lost a sub zavala said a danish cruiser went down off the faroe islands and some of the crew were trapped inside theyre still alive apparently the swedes and the brits are on their way but the cruiser doesnt have an escape hatch the danes need someone who can go directly through the hull and get the guys out they heard we were out here making test dives how long do we have a few hours the way they tell it zavala shook his head the faroes must be more than a thousand miles from here the beebe is a fast ship for her size but shed need wings to get there in time austin thought about it a minute then said youre a genius glad you finally realized it mind telling me how you came to that conclusion it would make a great pickup line in a bar first let me ask is the sea lamprey in any shape to use on a real life rescue operation i detected a note ofcya when vlasov asked when it would be ready we civil service types automatically take cover your ass when we sign on zavala said you must have passed the course with flying colors well zavala pondered the question for a moment you saw how she handled coming up sure like a brahma bull but we made it okay youd pay big bucks for a ride like that at disney world zavala slowly shook his head you do have a talent for present ing the possibility of a horrible death in a lighthearted way my death wish isnt any stronger than yours you told me the sea lamprey is built like a brick outhouse okay i was bragging structurally shes extremely sound op erationally she could do better on balance how do the odds of a successful mission stack up about fiftyfifty i can juryrig some repairs to increase the odds slightly in our favor im not pushing you joe you dont have to id never sleep again if we didnt try to help these guys but weve still got to get the submersible to that danish cruiser youve figured it out havent you you old fox zavala said noting austins grin maybe austin replied ive got a few details to work through with vlasov since im about to risk my life on a typical spurofthemoment austin scheme i wonder if you could tell me whats cooking under that prematurely silvergray hair of yours not at all austm said do you recall what vlasov said about soviet gigantism yeah but think austin said heading for the door think real big karl becker restlessly paced the deck of the dan ish research vessel thor shoulders hunched hands thrust into the pockets of his great coat the navy bureaucrat looked like a large wingless bird becker wore several layers of clothing yet he shivered as his thoughts went back to the collision he had been shoved into a lifeboat only to be thrown into the freezing water when the over loaded craft capsized during launch if a faroese trawler had not plucked his semiconscious body to safety he would have been dead within minutes he stopped to light a cigarette cupping his hands around the name and leaned on the rail as he stared bleakly at the red plastic sphere that marked the grave of the sunken cruiser he heard his name being called the thors captain nils larsen was striding across the deck in his direction where are those damned americans becker growled good news they just called said the captain they expect to be here in five minutes about time becker said like his colleague on the leiferifsson captain larsen was tall and blond with a craggy profile in all fairness he said its only been a matter of hours since the cruiser went down the nato response team needed a minimum of seventytwo hours to place a mother ship crew and rescue vehicle on site the numa people have lived up to their pledge to get here within eight hours they deserve some lee way i know i know becker said more in exasperation than anger i dont mean to be ungrateful but every minute counts he flicked the cigarette butt into the sea and jammed his hands even further into his pockets too bad denmark no longer has capital punishment he fumed id like to see that whole murderous sos bunch swing ing from the end of a rope youre sure they deliberately rammed you no doubt of it they changed course and came directly at us bang like a torpedo he glanced at his watch youre sure the americans said five minutes i dont see any ships approaching that is puzzling the captain said he raised his binoculars and scanned the horizon i dont see any vessels either hearing a noise he pointed the lenses toward the overcast sky wait theres a heli copter coming this way its moving very fast the pencilpoint speck grew rapidly larger against the slategray cloud cover and before long the thrumpthrump of rotors was audi ble the aircraft made directly for the thor and buzzed the ship slightly higher than mastlevel then it banked and went into a wide circle around the research vessel the letters numa were clearly visible in big bold letters on the side of the turquoise bell the ships first mate trotted across the deck toward the captain and pointed to the circling chopper its the americans theyre asking permission to land the captain replied in the affirmative and the crewman relayed the okay into a squawking hand radio the helicopter swooped in hovered above the stern deck and descended in slow motion mak ing a gentle landing at the exact center of the white circle that marked the helipad the door flew open and two men emerged under the spinning ro tors and made their way across the deck as a politician becker was an acute observer of people the men moved with the casual easiness that he had seen in other americans but their determined stride and the way they carried themselves projected an air of supreme confi dence the broadshouldered man leading the way was just over six feet tall and around two hundred pounds becker estimated his hair was gray but as the man drew near becker saw that he was young probably around forty his darkcomplexioned companion was slightly shorter younger and slimmer he walked with the panther like grace of a boxer it would not have surprised becker if hed known that the man had financed his way through college fighting as a middleweight his movements were relaxed but with the in herent energy of a coiled spring the captain stepped forward to greet the americans welcome to the thor he said thanks im kurt austin from the national underwater and marine agency said the husky man who looked as if he could walk through a wall and this is my partner joe zavala he shook hands wth the captain then becker almost bringing tears to the danes eyes wth a crushing handshake zavala pulverized those bones austin had missed you made good time the captain said were a few minutes behind schedule austin said the logis tics were somewhat complicated thats all right thank god you came becker said rubbing his hand he glanced toward the helicopter wheres the rescue team austin and zavala exchanged an amused glance youre looking at it austin said beckers astonishment gave way to barely restrained fury he whirled around to face the captain how in gods name are these two gentlemen going to rescue captain petersen and his men captain larsen was wondering the same thing but was more re served i suggest you ask them he replied with obvious embar rassment at beckers outburst well becker said glaring first at austin then at zavala becker could not have known that the two men who had stepped off the helicopter equaled a shipload of rescuers born in seattle austin had been raised in and around the sea which was not sur prising since his father was the owner of a marine salvage company while studying for his masters degree in systems management at the university of washington hed attended a highly rated seattle dive school where hed attained proficiency in a number of specialized areas hed put his expertise to work on north sea oil rigs had worked for his father awhile then had been hired by the cia to conduct underwater intelligence when the cold war ended hed been recruited by sandecker to head the special assignments team zavala was the son of mexican parents who had waded across the rio grande settling in santa fe his oilstained mechanical genius was the stuff of legend around the halls ofnuma and he could re pair modify or restore any kind of engine ever devised he had spent thousands of hours as a pilot in helicopters and small jet and turbo prop craft his assignment to austins team had proved a fortunate pairing many of their assignments would never become public knowledge but their wisecracking camaraderie in the face ofdan aer masked a steely determination and a competence few could rival austin calmly regarded becker with piercing bluegreen eyes the color of coral under water he was not unsympathetic to beckers plight and deflected the danes fury with a broad smile sorry for being flip i should have explained immediately that the rescue ve hicle is on its way should be here in about an hour zavala added theres a lot we can do in the meantime austin said he turned to the captain i need help unloading a piece of equipment from the chopper can you spare a few men with strong backs yes of course the captain was relieved to be doing something at last moving with crisp efficiency he dispatched his first mate to round up the work detail at austins direction the grunting crewmen lifted a large wooden crate from the helicopters storage compartment and set it down on the deck using a crowbar from the helicopter austin pried the top off the box and peered inside after a quick inspection he said everything looks shipshape whats the latest on the situation captain larsen pointed to the bobbing buoy that marked the sunken cruiser while austin and zavala listened intently larsen provided a quick summary of the collision and sinking it doesnt make sense austin said from what you say they had plenty of sea room so did theandrea doria and the stockholm zavala said refer ring to the disastrous sea collision off nantucket becker mumbled something about sos criminals but austin ig nored him and concentrated on the business at hand what makes you so sure the captain and his men are still alive we were doing a whale population survey not far from here when we got the call for help larsen said we dropped a hy drophone over the side and picked up the sound of someone tapping an sos on the hull in morse code unfortunately we can only re ceive not send messages however we determined that there were thirteen men including captain andersen trapped in a pocket of air in the forward bunkroom the air is foul and they were in the early stages of hypothermia when did you last hear from them about two hours ago it was essentially the same message only the tapping has become much fainter toward the end they tapped out the same word over and over what was it desperate austin broke the grim silence that followed did you get any other equipment down to the ship the faroese coast guard called the nato base on stremoy they contacted the nato submarine rescue network minutes after the cruiser went down those ships you see out there are mostly from scandinavian countries weve been acting as the interim mother ship a swedish vessel should arrive soon with a rescue ve hicle but like the others its useless in this situation its set up to res cue men through a submarine rescue hatch weve been able to pinpoint the cruisers location twohundredsixty feet down but be yond that for all our technical ability were only spectators at a dis aster in the making not necessarily austin said then you think you can help becker said with pleading eyes maybe austin said we can say better after we see what were up against becker apologized for his earlier abruptness sorry i flew off the handle were grateful for your offer to help i owe a special debt to captain petersen after we were hit and there was no doubt the cruiser would sink within minutes he made sure i had a place in a lifeboat when he learned others were still below he rushed off to help them and must have been trapped when the ship sank hes a brave man all the more reason for saving him and his crew austin said do you have any idea of the ships position on the bottom yes of course come with me the captain said he led the way to an electronics lab off the main deck the room was equipped with computer monitors used for remote sensing projects this is a high resolution sonar picture of the leiferifyson he said indicating the image on a large monitor as you can see she is lying at a slight angle on an inclined slope the crews quarters are here one deck below the mess area a short distance back from the bow obviously air was trapped here he circled a section of hull with the cursor its a miracle theyre still alive its a miracle they may wish never happened becker observed glumly tell us about the compartment its quite large there are bunks for two dozen crewmen its reached by a single companionway through the mess hall there is also an emergency hatch well need specific details about the bunkroom particularly the location of pipes conduits and structural supports the captain handed over a file the navy department faxed this material to us in anticipation of the rescue attempt i think youll find everything you need if not we can get it to you quickly austin and zavala studied the ships schematic layouts then went back to the sonar image theres only so much we can learn from pictures austin said finally maybe its time i went for a swim good thing you brought your swimsuit zavala said its the new michelin model guaranteed to wow the ladies becker and the captain wondered if they had stumbled into the company of madmen they exchanged puzzled glances then hurried to keep up with the numa men while zavala sketched out their strategy for captain larsen and becker austin supervised the four strapping crewmen as they moved the crate until it was under a boom they unwound cable from the crane then austin ran it into the big box and gave the signal to start the hoist the brightyellow figure that rose from the crate was nearly seven feet tall and looked like a robot in a fifties scifi film the cast alu minum arms and legs did indeed bulge like those of the michelin man and the helmet resembled an oversized fishbowl the arms ended in pincers like those of an insect four small fans protected by circular housings projected from the elbows and the back of the arms austin rapped his knuckles against the unit pack attached to the figures back this is the latest in hardsuit technology this model can operate at depths of two thousand feet for up to six hours so ill have plenty of leeway mind if i borrow a short ladder ill need an experienced boat crew in the water too the captain dispatched his first mate to carry out the requests austin stripped off his windbreaker pulled a heavy wool sweater over his turtleneck jersey and yanked a black navy watch cap down over his ears the suit broke at the waist into two sections austin climbed the ladder and eased his body into the bottom pod then the top section was attached the lifting line attached and the boom slowly lifted him off the deck using the suits radio which was the same frequency as the ships handsets he called a halt when he was a few feet above the deck he moved his arms and legs aided by sixteen hydraulically compen sated rotary joints then he tried out the manually operated manip ulators at the end of each hand pod finally he tried the footpad controls and listened to the whirr of the vertical and horizontal thrusters all systems go austin said the atmospheric diving suit or ads had been developed to pro tect divers from intense ocean pressures while allowing them to carry out tasks of relative delicacy despite its humanoid shape the hard suit was considered a vehicle and the diver referred to as its pilot with zavala supervising the operation the boom pivoted over the water austin swung back and forth like a yoyo at the end of its swing seeing that the launch crew had its boat in the water he said lower away the cable paid out and austin dropped into the heaving swells green froth surged over his helmet the boat crew detached the cable fastening and austin sank like a stone for several fathoms until he adjusted the suit to neutral buoyancy then he played with the thrusters moving up down back and forward then into a hover he took a last look at the pale surface glimmering above him switched on the lights on the chest section mashed the vertical con trol pad and began his descent unaware of the events unfolding more than two hun dred feet above his head captain petersen lay in his bunk and stared into the darkness wondering whether he would freeze to death or suffocate first from lack of oxygen it was purely an intel lectual exercise he was beyond caring how the end came he only hoped that it arrived soon the cold had drained most of his energy every labored breath of carbon dioxide that he and his crew exhaled made the air less able to sustain life the captain was drifting off into the comatose state that comes when the will to live ebbs like the lowering tide even thoughts of his wife and children could not pull him back he longed to reach the numb stage that might cushion his aches and pains his body still harbored enough life to sustain his misery his tortured lungs launched into a coughing fit that triggered a throbbing in his left arm broken when hed been thrown against a bulkhead it was a simple fracture but it hurt like hell the groans of his crewmen reminded petersen that he was not alone in his dis comfort as he had a dozen times already the captain ran through the col lision in his mind and wondered if he could have avoided it all had been going well a dangerous confrontation had been avoided and the sea sentinel was being escorted out to sea then without warn ing that crazy circuspainted ship had veered toward the cruisers ex posed side his frantic order to bear off had come too late the tortured sound of tearing steel had told him that the wound was fatal his naval training had quickly come into play hed given the order to aban don ship and had been supervising the launch of the lifeboats when a sailor ran up and said that men were injured below decks petersen hadnt hesitated hed left the lifeboat launch in the hands of his first mate and hurried to aid his men the night watch had been asleep when the leiferilsson was hit the sea sentinels bow had penetrated the hull behind the sleeping quarters sparing the crew from instant death but injuring some men petersen dashed into the mess hall then halftumbled down the companionway and saw that the uninjured were tending to their comrades abandon ship he ordered form human stretchers the ship was sinking at a sterndown angle from the weight of the sea that poured in through the gaping hole water flowed into the mess hall then down through the open hatch into the bunkroom cut ting off escape petersen climbed partway up the ladder slammed the hatch shut and spun the wheel that locked it tight then the ship lurched as he was descending and he slammed against the bulk head losing consciousness it was a fortunate accident because he didnt hear the horrible moans and creaks the ship made on its fatal plunge to the bottom and his limp body wasnt further injured when moments later the cruiser slammed into the soft mud even so when the captain awoke in the darkened cabin it was to an even more terrible sound the cries of his men soon after he regained consciousness a beam of light had stabbed the darkness and revealed bloodied and pale faces among the jumbled bunks and sea chests the ships chef a short round man named lars called the captains name over here petersen croaked the flickering light came his way lars crawled up beside pe tersen holding an electric torch are you all right lars the captain asked some bumps and bruises my fat protected me how about you sir petersen managed a wet laugh im not so lucky broken left arm what happened captain i was sleeping a ship slammed into us damn lars said i was having a sweet dream of good things to eat before i got tossed from my bunk didnt expect to see you down here sir one of the crew said you were in trouble i came to help he struggled to get up im not much help sitting here can you give me a hand they fashioned an improvised sling from the captains belt and went around the cabin with the help of a few men who hadnt been severely injured they tried to make those less fortunate comfortable the damp biting cold was the worst immediate danger they might be able to buy time petersen thought the bunkroom had a supply of immersion suits used for coldwater protection if the ship went down it took awhile to round up the suits which were scattered through out the cabin in bags and to get the injured men into them they slipped on their gloves and pulled down the hoods then they rounded up spare blankets and clothes and wrapped themselves in several layers with the cold temporarily held at bay petersen turned his efforts to the air problem one of the aluminum lockers held breathing de vices to be used in case of fire or other emergency these were passed around they too would buy time petersen decided to use up their canned air first because it was purer than the air in the cabin which was making the men sick petersen formed tapping crews for the same reason pow officers allocate duties to maintain morale the men took turns using a wrench to rap sos on the hull as one man after another tired of the job petersen continued to tap away although he wasnt sure why bored with the sos he began tapping out messages describing their plight eventually he tired and rapped the bulkhead whenever strength allowed which wasnt often then he stopped altogether his thoughts turned from rescue he shut his eyes and once more he began to think of death using the marker buoy line as his guide austin sank into the depths feetfirst and slightly angled forward like an old hardhat diver being lowered at the end of an invisible air hose dancing rainbow shafts lanced the water like sunlight streaming through stainglass windows as austin plunged deeper the water filtered out the col ors and the twilight abruptly turned into a violet night the powerful halogen lights mounted on the front of the hard suit caught snowy motes of marine vegetation and nervous schools offish in their beams but before long austin was dropping into the benthic levels where only the hardiest offish lived at two hundred feet his lights pick out the cruisers masts and antennas then the ships ghostly contours materialized austin hit the vertical thrusters and slowed to a stop at deck level then the horizontal thrusters whirred and he cruised along the hull rounded the stern and came back to the bow the ship lay as shown in the sonar picture at a slight angle on the slope with the bow higher than the stern he studied the ship with the intensity of a medical examiner inspecting the autopsied body of a murder victim paying particular attention to the triangular gash in the side no vessel could have survived the giant bayonet wound seeing only twisted metal beyond the jagged opening he moved toward the bow again he approached within inches of the hull feel ing as dwarfed as a fly on a wall leaned his helmet against the steel plating and listened the only sounds were the hollow noise of his breathing and the whirr of thrusters as they kept the suit at a hover austin pushed off several feet came around goosed the horizontal thrusters and let his metal knees slam into the ship on the other side of the hull petersens halfclosed eyes blinked fully open he held his breath what was that a hoarse voice said in the darkness lars had been huddled on the bunk next to the captains thank god you heard it too petersen whispered i thought i was going mad listen they strained their ears and heard tapping on the outside of the hull morse code slow and measured as if the sender were struggling with each letter the captains eyes widened like those of a cartoon character as he translated the rough taps into letters pete austin was cursing the awkwardness of communicating at his di rection one of the crew had attached a specially adapted ballpeen hammer to his right hand manipulator the mechanical arm moved with agonizing slowness but by concentrating all his resources he finished tapping out one word in morse code ersen he stopped and put his helmet against the hull after a moment he heard dots and dashes clunked out in reply yes status air bad cold help soon a pause then hurry soon petersen called out to his men that rescue was imminent he felt guilty lying their time was about to run out he was having a prob lem focusing it was getting harder to breathe and soon it would be impossible the temperature had plunged to below zero and even the immersion suit couldnt keep out the cold he had stopped shiv ering the first sign of hypothermia lars interrupted petersens drifting thoughts captain can i ask you a question petersen grunted in the affirmative why the hell did you come back sir you could have saved your self petersen said i heard somewhere a captain is supposed to go down with his ship this is about as far down as you can go captain petersen made a gargling sound that was as close to laughter as he could muster lars did the same but their strength soon left them they made themselves as comfortable as they could and waited the boat crew was watching for austin to pop out of the water and they snagged him like a runaway calf within min utes he was back on the deck where he spelled out the situation to becker and captain larsen dear god becker said what a terrible way to die my govern ment will spare no expense to retrieve their bodies for the families beckers pessimism was starting to annoy austin please stop playing the role of the melancholy dane mr becker your govern ment can hold on to its wallet those men arent dead yet but you said i fylow what i said theyre in tough shape but that doesnt mean theyre doomed the squalus submarine rescue took more than a day to accomplish and thirtythree were saved austin paused as his sharp ears picked up a new sound he stared at the sky and shaded his eyes against the glare of the overcast looks like the cavalry has arrived a gigantic helicopter was bearing down on the ship dangling below the helicopter in a sling was a blimpshaped submarine with a blunt nose thats the largest helicopter ive ever seen captain larsen said actually the mi is the biggest helicopter in the world austin said its more than a hundred feet long they call it the flying crane becker smiled for the first time in hours please tell me that strangelooking object hanging below the helicopter is your rescue vehicle the sea lamprey isnt the prettiest craft in the sea zavala said with a shrug i sacrificed form for function in designing her to the contrary becker said shes beautiful the captain shook his head in wonderment how on earth did you get this equipment here so quickly you were twelve hundred miles away when the rescue call went out we remembered that the russians like to do things in a big way austin said they jumped at the chance to show the world theyre still a firstrate nation but that helicopter couldnt have carried it all that way in such a short time you gentlemen must be magicians it took a lot of work to pull this rabbit out of a hat austin said as he watched the helicopter maneuver the mi picked up the submersible at sea and transferred it to a land base where two antonov n heavyduty transport planes were waiting the sea lamprey went on one plane the big chopper and the numa heli copter were loaded on the other it was a twohour flight to the nato base in the faroes while they unloaded the submersible and got it ready to fly we came out here to prepare the way the powerful turboshaft engines drowned out the captains reply as the aircraft moved closer and hovered the eight rotor blades and fivebladed tail rotor threshed the air and the downdraft they cre ated scooped a vast watery crater out of the sea the submersible was released a few feet above the roiling water and the helicopter moved off the sea lamprey had been fitted out with large airfilled pontoons it sank beneath the waves but quickly bobbed back to the surface austin suggested that the captain ready the sick bay to treat ex treme hypothermia then the boat crew ferried them out to the sub mersible the launch crew detached the pontoons the submersible blew air from its ballast tanks and sank below the blueblack surface the sea lamprey hovered kept at an even keel by its thrusters austin and zavala sat in the snug cockpit their faces washed by the blue light from the instrument panel and ran down the dive check list then zavala pushed the control stick forward angled the blunt prow down and blew ballast he steered the submersible in a de scending spiral as casually as if he were taking the family out on a sunday drive austin peered into the gauzy bluish blackness beyond the range of the lights i didnt have time to ask you before we came aboard he said almost in afterthought is this thing safe as a former president once said depends on your definition ofis austin groaned let me rephrase my question are the leaks and the pump fixed i think i stopped up the leaks and the ballast pump works well under ideal conditions what about actual conditions kurt my father used to quote an old spanish proverb the closed mouth swallows no flies what the hell do flies have to do with our situation nothing zavala said i just thought we should change the sub ject maybe the problem with the ballast control will go away the vehicle had been built as a rescue system of last resort once its lasers punched a hole in a sunken vessel water would rush in after the sub disengaged there was no way to plug the opening all trapped crewmen had to be evacuated in one trip this was a proto type built to carry only eight people plus a pilot and copilot if all thirteen men and their captain were taken off the cruiser theyd be over the weight limit by six austin said ive been running the figures in my head estimate a hundredfifty pounds per man and weve got more than a ton of weight theres a safety margin built into the lamprey so its prob ably no big whoop except for the lame ballast tank no problem weve got a backup pump if the main isnt work ing in designing the sea lamprey zavala had followed common practice and built redundant systems zavala paused some of the crew might be dead ive been thinking about that austin said wed increase our safety margin if we left bodies down there but im not leaving until weve got every man aboard dead or alive the cockpit grew silent as both men considered the awful possi bilities the only sound was the hum of electric motors as the un gainly craft dropped into the depths before long they were at the side of the cruiser austin directed zavala to the penetration point then came a soft clunk as the front end of the submersible bumped the curved steel plates electric pump motors hummed and the sub mersible stayed where it was glued to the steel by a vacuum the escape tunnel made of a tough but pliable synthetic material was extended eight vertical and horizontal thrusters kept the vehi cle steady under the direction of computers that monitored its move ment in relation to the current the instruments indicated when the seal was complete normally a thin probe would penetrate the hull to look for explosive fumes sensors gauged the pressure within the seal and kept the vacuum on place given the safe signal to enter austin strapped on a small air tank and a scuba regulator and emerged from the air lock there was some leakage around the seal but not enough to worry about he started to crawl through the escape tunnel inside the cruiser the crew and captain had slipped into a deathlike sleep captain petersen was roused from his cold slumber by the sound of a giant woodpecker damned bird while one level of his brain cursed the source of the noise another was automatically ana lyzing it grouping the raps into familiar patterns each the equiva lent of a letter hello he flicked the torch on the chef had heard the noise and his eyes were as big as fried eggs the captains stiff fingers groped for the wrench by his side and banged it weakly against the hull then again with more force the reply was immediate move away more easily said than done the captain thought petersen told the chef to back off from the bulkhead then followed rolling out of his bunk he crawled across the deck and called out to the other men to move he sat with his back to a locker for what seemed an eternity not sure what to expect austin crawled back into the lamprey mission accomplished he said turning on the can opener zavala said he hit the switch for the ring of cutting lasers they sliced through the twoinch metal skin as easily as a paring knife through an orange a monitor showed the penetration and the brilliant red of the lasers the lasers automati cally shut off petersen had been watching as a faint pink circle deepened in color until it was a bright molten reddishorange he felt welcome heat against his face there was a hollow clang as a section of the hull fell into the cabin and he had to shield his eyes against a bright disk of light steam filled the escape tunnel and the edges of the opening were still hot from the laser cutters austin pushed a specially made lad der over the rim and stuck his head through the opening any of you gentlemen call a taxi he said despite his lighthearted manner austin wondered if the rescue was too late he had never seen such a bedraggled bunch he called out for captain petersen a greasecovered apparition crawled for ward and croaked im the captain who are you austin climbed into the ship and helped the captain to his feet the introductions will have to wait please tell your men who can still move to crawl through that hole the captain translated the order austin threw a couple of soggy blankets onto the rough edges of the opening then helped those who couldnt make it under their own power petersen collapsed as he was trying to crawl into the submersible and austin had to give him a shove then clambered in behind him as he entered the air lock he saw water trickling in through the rim of the seal where zavala had done a hasty patch job he quickly closed the hatch behind him zavala had put the con trols on auto while he pulled the crew through the air lock the bulky survival suits didnt make the task any easier it was a miracle that any of the crew was still alive amazingly some had made the trip themselves the passenger space consisted of two padded benches running the length of the sub separated by a narrow aisle the survivors crowded onto the benches or stood in the aisle like commuters on a tokyo subway sorry theres no firstclass section austin said no complaint said the captain my men will agree that it is bet ter than our former living arrangements with the crew settled kurt returned to the cockpit we had a lit tle leakage around the seal he reported zavala indicated a blinking light on a computergenerated dia gram of the submersible more than a little the ring blew out like a flat tire a second after we closed the air lock he retracted the telescopic escape tube disengaged the sub mersible from the dead ship and backed off clearly revealing in its floodlights the round hole where the lasers had cut out the escape route when the sub was clear of the wreck he activated the ballast pumps the electric motors clicked into action with a low hum ex cept from the front right pump where there was a sound like a fork going down a garbage disposal one ballast tank still had water in it disrupting the subs equilibrium as the others filled with com pressed air the sea lamprey operated like any other submarine it pumped water into its ballast tanks to dive pumped in air to ascend the computer tried to compensate by giving more power to the vertical thrusters the submersible lurched into a nosedown angle and the smell of hot metal came through the vents zavala pumped water back into the other tanks and the lamprey leveled out more or less austin stared at the instrument panel a light was blinking on a schematic troubleshooting diagram he ran a check on the computer that served as the brains of the vehicle the trouble system indicated that the warning light had been triggered by an actual mechanical problem the kind of glitch that could show up with new equipment and was probably easily repairable but this was not a test run it was a deep submergence dive to fifty fathoms another light started blinking red both front motors are gone austin said better use the backup pumps those were the backup pumps zavala said so much for redundant systems whats the problem i could tell you in a minute if i had this thing up on a lift i dont see any garages nearby and in any case i forgot my credit card as my father used to say all it takes to move a stubborn burro is a stick of dynamite zavala said around the halls ofnuma austin had a welldeserved reputa tion for having an unflappable stubbornness in the face of adversity most men wisely cut and run in the face of sure disaster austin faced it with equanimity the fact that he was still alive and breathing showed that he possessed a remarkable combination of resourceful ness and luck those whod had to tough it out with him found his serendipity frightening austin always shrugged off their complaints but now joe was giving him a taste of his own medicine austin compressed his lips in a tight smile laced his fingers behind his head and sat back in his seat you wouldnt be so relaxed if you didnt have a plan austin said zavala gave his partner an exaggerated wink and removed the twopronged key that had been hanging from a chain around his neck he flipped open a small metal cap in the center of the console and inserted the key when i turn this key and flick the little switch next to it the third redundant system comes into play explosive charges will blow off all the ballast tanks and up we go smart eh not if the thor is in the way when we come flying out of the water wed sink the ship and us if it makes you feel any better press that button it sends up a warning buoy to the surface flares whistles the whole nine yards austin punched the button there was a swoosh as the buoy was ejected from the sub he advised their passengers to hold tight zavala jerked his thumb skyward a boyish grin on his face going up he hit the switch and they braced themselves the only sound was zavala swearing under his breath in spanish the switch didnt work he said with a sheepish grin lets see if i can summarize this were three hundred feet down with overloaded capacity the cabin full of halfdead sailors and the panic button doesnt work you have a knack for brevity kurt thanks ill expand further weve got two front tanks full of water two rear ones empty and that spells neutral buoyancy any way of lightening the lamprey i can jettison the connector tube well get to the surface but it wont be pretty doesnt seem we have much of an alternative ill tell our pas sengers to hold on austin made his announcement buckled himself into his seat and gave the signal zavala crossed his fingers and blew off the rescue tube it had been made detachable as a precaution in case the sub mersible had to extricate itself from a rescue in a hurry there was a muffled explosion and the submersible lurched the sea lamprey rose a foot then a yard then several yards their progress was ex cruciatingly slow at first but the craft gained more speed the higher it went before long it was speeding to the surface the sea lamprey exploded from the sea sternfirst and splashed down in a fountain of white water the vehicle rolled violently toss ing those inside around like dice in a shaker alerted by the warning buoys soundandlight show small boats dashed in and their crews attached pontoons that stabilized the craft in a more or less horizon tal position the thor got a line on the vehicle and hauled the sea lamprey close to where a crane could lift it to the deck medical personnel swarmed over the submersible the second the hatch was popped and the sur vivors were extracted one by one loaded onto stretchers and hustled onto waiting medivac helicopters that transferred them to the land hospital by the time austin and zavala climbed from the sub mersible the deck was practically deserted except for a handful of crew who came over and congratulated them then quickly left zavala looked around the nearempty deck no brass band heroism is its own reward austin said pontifically but i wouldnt turn down a shot oftequila if someone offered it to me what a coincidence i just happen to have a bottle of blue agave tucked away in my duffel bag primo stuff we may have to delay our celebration mr becker is coming our way the danish bureaucrat was striding across the deck his face beaming with unmistakable happiness he pumped their hands pounded the numa men on the back and showered them with ef fusive praise gentlemen i thank you he said breathlessly denmark thanks you the world thanks you our pleasure austin said thanks for the opportunity to test the sea lamprey under actual conditions the russian chopper is at the nato base with the transport planes well give them a call and we can be out of here in a few hours beckers face reassumed its usual mask of businesslike dourness mr zavala is free to go but im afraid you might have to delay your trip a special investigative court that was formed to look into the cruiser incident is convening a hearing in torshavn tomorrow they would like you to testify dont see how i can help i didnt see the actual sinking yes but you dove on the eriyson twice you can describe the damage in detail it will help make our case seeing the doubt in austins face he said im afraid well have to insist that you be our guest in the islands until the hearing is terminated cheer up the us embassy has been informed of our request and will transmit it to numa ive already arranged lodging for you well be staying in the same hotel in fact the islands are beautiful and youll only be delayed a day or two before you can rejoin your ship its no problem for me kurt zavala said i can get the lam prey back to the beebe and wrap up the tests austins eyes flashed with anger he didnt like being told what to do by an officious little government drone he made no effort to dis guise the annoyance in his voice looks like ill be your guest mr becker he turned to zavala well have to put off our celebration ill call the nato base and get things moving before long the engine roar of the huge russian helicopter filled the air the sling was attached under the sea lampreys belly and the helicopter lifted the vehicle from the ships deck then zavala took off in the numa helicopter and followed the submersible back to the base where the sub would be loaded onto a transport plane for the return trip one other thing becker said id like you to keep that re markable suit on board in case the court has the need for further ev idence if not well gladly ship it anywhere you wish you want me to make another dive possibly i would clear it with your superiors of course of course austin said he was too tired to argue the captain came over and announced that the shuttle was ready to take them back to the mainland austin wasnt enthusiastic about spending any more time than he had to with the danish bureaucrat ill come ashore tomorrow if its all right with you captain larsen wants to show me some of the results of his whale research the captain saw the desperation in austins eyes and played along oh yes as i said youll find our work fascinating ill deliver mr austin to shore in the morning becker shrugged suit yourself ive spent enough time at sea to last me a lifetime austin watched the shuttle boat head toward land and turned to the captain thanks for rescuing me from mr becker larsen sighed heavily i suppose bureaucrats like becker have a value in the scheme of things so do the stomach bacteria that aid in digestion austin said the captain laughed and put his hand on austins shoulder i think a liquid celebration of your successful mission is in order i think youre right austin said austin received v ip treatment aboard the research ves sel after drinks in the captains cabin he enjoyed a delicious meal then he was entertained with incredible underwater footage of the ships whale research he was given a comfortable cabin and slept like a log and the next morning he said his farewell to captain larsen the captain seemed sorry to see him go were going to be here a few days doing survey work on the cruiser let me know if there is anything i can ever do for you or for numa they shook hands and austin climbed into the shuttle for the short trip to the western harbor happy to be on dry land once more after weeks on and under the sea he made his way along the cob blestone quay past the line of fishing boats the capital city of the faroe islands was named torshavn thors harbor after the mightiest of the scandinavian gods despite its thundering namesake torshavn was a quiet settlement located on a headland between two busy boat harbors austin would have preferred to explore the narrow streets that ran between the colorful old houses but a glance at his watch told him he had better get moving if he wanted to make the hearing he dropped his duffel bag off at the hotel room that becker had arranged for him he figured he wouldnt be in the faroes more than another day or so and decided to leave whether becker wanted him to or not on his way out he asked the desk to book him a flight to copen hagen in two days his destination was a short walk up the hill toward vaglio square in the heart of the citys commercial center a few minutes later he stopped in front of an impressive nineteenthcentury building built ofdarkhued basalt the plaque on the exterior identified the struc ture as the raohus or town hall he mentally girded his loins for the ordeal ahead as an employee of a federal agency austin was no stranger to the hazards of navigating governmental seas the rescue of the men trapped in the leiferisson might have been the easiest part of his faroese adventure he reflected the receptionist in the raohus lobby told austin how to get to the hearing room he followed a corridor to a door guarded by a burly policeman and identified himself the officer told him to wait and slipped into the room he reappeared a moment later with becker taking austin by the arm becker moved out of earshot good to see you again mr austin he glanced at the policeman and lowered his voice this matter requires a great deal of delicacy do you know anything about the faroe islands government only that theres an affiliation with denmark i dont know the details correct the islands are part of the kingdom of denmark but they have had home rule since theyre quite independent even keeping their own language however when they get into financial trouble they dont hesitate to ask copenhagen for money he said with a faint smile this incident occurred in faroese waters but a danish warship was involved which means sos wouldnt win any popularity contests in den mark becker brushed off his comment with an airy wave ive made my feelings clear those crazy people should be hanged for sinking our ship but i am a realist the whole regrettable incident would never have happened if it hadnt been for the islanders stubbornness in keeping their old customs you mean the whale hunt i wont comment on the morality of the grindarap many in den mark regard the grind as a barbaric and unnecessary ritual more important are the economic considerations companies that might buy faroese fish or explore for oil dont want the public to think they are doing business with whale murderers when the faroese cant pay their bills copenhagen must open its pocketbook so much for independence becker smiled again the danish government wants to resolve this case quickly with the minimum amount of international pub licity we dont want these sos people seen as courageous martyrs who acted rashly but in defense of helpless creatures what do you want from me please go beyond your technical observations in your testimony we know what sank the cruiser feel free to emphasize the human suffering you witnessed our goal is to convict ryan in the court of public opinion then get these reckless hooligans out of our country and make sure they dont come back we want to make sure that the world sees them as pariahs rather than martyrs perhaps then some thing like this wont happen again suppose ryan is innocent in all this his innocence or guilt is of no concern to my government there are greater issues at stake as you say a matter of great delicacy ill tell your people what i saw thats all i can promise becker nodded fair enough shall we go in the policeman opened the door and becker and austin stepped inside the hearing room austins eyes swept around the large dark paneled chamber and took in the suits presumably government and legal people who filled several rows of chairs he was wearing his usual working gear of jeans turtleneck and windbreaker having no need on board ship for dressier outfits more suits sat behind a long wooden table at the front of the room sitting in a chair to the right of the table was a man in a uniform he was speaking in danish his words taken down by a stenographer becker indicated a seat sat next to austin and whispered in his ear thats the representative from the coast guard youre next the coast guard witness concluded a few minutes later and austin heard his own name called four men and two women sat at the table with the group evenly divided between faroese and danish representatives the magistrate an avuncular dane with a long viking face said his name was lundgren he explained to austin that he would ask questions with the others on the board offering followup this was only an inquiry to collect an informational base not a trial he explained so there would be no crossexamination he would also translate when necessary austin eased into the chair and under questioning offered a straightforward account of the rescue he didnt have to embellish the suffering or the crews ordeal in its dark and practically airless tomb the expression on beckers face showed that he was pleased with what he heard austin stepped down after fortyfive minutes with the thanks of the board he was anxious to leave but decided to stay when the courts chairman announced in danish and eng lish that the captain of the sea sentinel would present his case austin was curious how anyone could defend himself against eye witness accounts the door opened and two policemen walked in between them was a tall and ruggedly built man in his midforties austin took in the ginger captain ahab chinfringe the coifed hair and the gilttrimmed uniforrri the magistrate asked the witness to sit down and introduce him self my name is marcus ryan the man said his gray eyes making direct contact with those in the audience i am the executive direc tor of the sentinels of the sea organization and captain of the sos flagship the sea sentinel for those who dont know us sos is an in ternational organization dedicated to the preservation of the sea and the marine life that dwells within it please give the court an account of the events surrounding your collision with the danish cruiser leif eriksson ryan started into a diatribe against the whale hunt speaking in a firm voice the magistrate asked him to keep his remarks confined to the collision ryan apologized and described how the sea sentinel had suddenly veered toward the cruiser striking it captain ryan lundgren said with unconcealed amusement do you mean to tell me that your ship attached and rammed the leif eriksson of its own accord for the first time since hed started testifying ryan lost his aplomb uh no sir im telling you that the controls of my ship did not respond let me see if i understand this clearly said a woman on the board of inquiry you are saying that the ship took control of itself and went off on its merry way there was a ripple of laughter in the audience it seems so ryan conceded his admission opened the doors for a round of probing questions the hearing may not have been adversarial austin thought but the court was nibbling ryan apart like a flock of hungry ducks ryan did his best to parry the questions but with each reply his case became weaker finally he lifted his hands as if to say enough i realize that my explanation raises more questions than it an swers but let me say this unequivocally so there is no misunder standing we did not deliberately ram the danish ship i have witnesses who can back me up you can check with captain pe tersen hell tell you that i warned him how long before the collision did this warning occur lundgren asked ryan took a deep breath and let it out less than a minute before we hit lundgren asked no further questions ryan was excused and the female reporter from cnn took the stand she was calm during her recounting of the collision but she broke down and glared at ryan with accusing eyes when she described the death other cameraman lundgren signaled a court officer to insert a videotape into a tv set that had been set off to one side where everyone had a good view of the screen the tape began to roll it showed ryan standing on the deck of his ship surrounded by reporters and photographers there was some joking about rough seas then the reporters voice saying just make sure the story is worth all the damned dramamine i swallowed the camera executed a closeup of ryans grinning face as he replied i can almost guarantee that youll see action as the cam era followed his finger pointing toward the danish cruiser there was a muttering in the audience thats it austin thought ryan is toast the tape ended and lundgren asked the reporter one question was that your voice on the tape when the reporter replied in the affirmative ryan sprang to his feet thats unfair youre using my comment completely out of con text please be seated mr ryan lundgren said a bemused expres sion on his face ryan realized his outburst would bolster the image of a hothead capable of ramming a ship he regained his composure my apolo gies sir i was not told that the video would be introduced into evi dence i hope i will have the chance to comment on it this is not an american court of law but you will have every op portunity to make your side known before this hearing is adjourned the board will hear from captain petersen and his crew as soon as they are able you will remain in protective custody at the police sta tion until then we will do our best to expedite the process ryan thanked the court then escorted by the policemen he left the room is that all austin asked becker apparently so i expected they might ask you back to the stand but it appears they dont need you anymore i hope your plans havent been disrupted austin assured becker that it was no problem he sat in his chair as the room began to empty chewing over ryans testimony either the man was telling the truth or he was a very good actor that would be for wiser men to decide first a good stiff cup of coffee then he would check out earlier flights to copenhagen from there hed fly back to washington mr austin a woman was walking toward him her face wreathed in a bright smile austin noticed her athletic and wellproportioned figure the chestnut hair that fell to her shoulders the unblemished skin and alert eyes she was dressed in a white icelandic wool jumper known as a lopapesya they shook hands my name is therri weld she said in a voice that was mellow and warm im a legal advisor with the sos or ganization nice to meet you ms weld what can i do for you therri had been watching austins serious expression as he gave his testimony and she was unprepared for his devastating smile with his broad shoulders burnished features and bluegreen eyes he reminded her of a buccaneer captain in a pirate movie she almost forgot what she was going to say but quickly regained her mental footing i wonder if you could spare a few minutes of your time she said i was about to look for a cup of coffee youre welcome to join me thanks theres a pretty decent cafe around the corner they found a quiet table and ordered two cappuccinos your testimony was fascinating she said as they sipped their coffee your captain ryan was the star of the day my words paled by comparison with his story therri laughed softly her laughter had a musical lilt that austin liked today wasnt his finest hour im afraid usually he can be quite eloquent particularly on those subjects hes most passionate about tough trying to explain to a bunch of skeptics that your ship was possessed by evil spirits the reporters testimony and the video didnt help i agree which is why i wanted to meet with you austin gave her his best countryboy grin aw shucks i had hoped you found yourself hopelessly attracted by my animal mag netism therri raised a finely arched brow that goes without saying she said but the main reason i wanted to talk was to see if you could help sos to begin with ms weld therri and may i call you kurt austin nodded ive got a couple of problems right off the bat therri first of all i dont know how i can help you and second i dont know if i want to help your organization im not in favor of whale slaughter but i dont endorse radical nutcases therri skewered austin with a leveled gaze of her laserbright eyes henry david thoreau john muir and edward abbey were considered radical nut cases in their times but i concede your point sos tends to be too activist for the taste of many okay you say you dont endorse radicals do you endorse injustice because thats exactly whats involved here in what way marcus did not ram that danish ship on purpose i was in the pilot house when it happened he and the others did everything they could to avoid that collision have you told this to the danish authorities yes they said they didnt need me to testify and told me to leave the country okay austin said i believe you just like that you dont seem like someone who accepts the world at face value i dont know what else to say without offending you nothing you say can offend me glad to hear that but what gives you the idea that i would care whether the case against ryan is just or not im not asking you to care about marcus therris tone hinted that there was a bit of hard steel behind her soft features austin suppressed a smile what exactly do you want from me therri she brushed a lock of hair out other face and said id like you to make a dive on the sea sentinel what purpose would a dive serve it might prove that marcus is innocent in what way she spread her hands i dont know but you might find some thing all i know is that marcus is telling the truth to be honest much of his radicalism is hot air hes really a hardnosed pragma list who calculates the odds very carefully hes not the kind of per son who goes around ramming navy ships in a fury besides he loved the sea sentinel he even picked the ridiculous psychedelic color scheme himself no one on the ship including me intended for any one to get hurt austin leaned back in his chair clasped his hands behind his head and stared at therris earnest face he liked the way her perfect lips turned up in a mona lisa smile even when she was serious her girl nextdoor appearance couldnt disguise the sensuous woman who lurked behind remarkable eyes there were a thousand reasons why he should simply thank her for the coffee shake her hand and wish her good luck there were maybe three good reasons why he might consider her request she was beautiful she might have a case and right or wrong she was passionate about her cause his plane flight was two days away there was no reason his short stay in the faroes had to be boring intrigued he sat forward and ordered another round of coffees okay then austin said tell me exactly what happened a few hours later austin was a world away from the warmth of the coffee shop encased in the bulbous protective armor of his aluminum hardsuit sinking once more into the cold faroese sea as he dropped into the deep he smiled as he pictured how becker would react if he knew that a danish vessel was being used to help marcus ryan and the sos it would serve the conniv ing little bureaucrat right austin thought his chuckle echoing inside the helmet after taking leave of them weld he had gone back to the hotel called captain larsen and asked permission to make another dive from the thor he said he wanted to shoot pictures of the rescue scene for a report which was partially true larsen didnt hesitate to say yes and even sent a shuttle boat in to bring austin back to the ship since becker had asked austin to leave the hardsuit it was all ready for him austins fathometer told him he was nearing bottom he slowed his descent with short bursts of the vertical thrusters and came to a hummingbird hover about fifty feet above the bow section of the cruiser the sea had wasted no time gathering the ship to its bosom a shaggy coat of marine growth covered the hull and superstructure like an alpaca blanket schools ofdeepwater fish nosed in and out of the portholes drawn by sea life that had made its home in the shad owed nooks and crannies of the vessel using a digital still camera austin shot pictures of the hole that the sea lamprey had made during the rescue mission and of the threesided gash where the sea sentinel had punctured the hull austin had quizzed captain larsen about the last known position of the sea sentinel relative to the cruiser using an undersea dead reck oning he headed in the general area of the sinking he used a standard search pattern running a series of roughly parallel courses until his lights picked out the psychedelic paint job on the ships hull like the cruiser the sos ship was already grow ing a fur coat of marine growth the combination of sea grass and tiedye effect was startling the sea sentinel had landed rightside up on the bottom and except for its smashed pug nose the ship ap peared to be in sound condition austin surveyed the crushed bow and recalled ryans testimony the engines had gone haywire ryan said and failed to respond to controls there was no way to check out the engines without going inside the wreck but the steering system might more easily be in vestigated because part of it was external the steering of a modern ship is done with a combination of electronics and hydraulics but even with computers gps positioning and autopilot the concept is no different than it was when columbus set sail to look for india at one end is a wheel or a tiller at the other is a rudder turn the wheel and the rudder pivots sending the vessel in the appropriate direction austin soared above the stern executed a hairpin turn then dropped several yards until he was facing the mantail rudder curious the rudder was intact but something was out of sync bolted to the rudder were two cables that led forward from the blade to each side of the hull austin followed the starboard cable to a steel box about the size of a large suitcase that was welded to the hull an elec trical conduit led from the box through the hull even more curious the welds around the boxes and conduit were shiny and looked new he backed off and followed the cable to an identical box on the other side he raised the camera and made a couple of shots a rubbercoated line as thick as a mans thumb connected the two boxes another line ran from the portside box along the curve of the hull to a point that would have been above the waterline when the ship was afloat at its end was a flat plastic disk about six inches in diameter the significance of what he was seeing dawned on austin loofs lie someone owes you an apology mr ryan austin took some pictures then pried the disk off with his ma nipulators and placed it in a carrying case attached to the outside of the hardsuit he stayed down another twenty minutes exploring every square inch of the hull finding nothing more out of the ordi nary he tapped his vertical thruster control and began the trip to the surface once out of his hardsuit he thanked captain larsen for the use of the thor and caught a boat ride into torshavn back in his hotel room he slipped the cassette out of the digital camera and into his laptop computer and brought the underwater pictures onto the screen he studied the enlarged and enhanced pic tures until he practically had them committed to memory then he called therri and asked to meet her again at the coffee shop he got there early and had the computer set up on the table when she arrived a few minutes later good news or bad she said both austin pushed the laptop across the table ive solved one mystery but uncovered another she sat down and stared at the picture on the screen what ex actly am i looking at i think its a mechanism to override or bypass the steering con trols from the bridge youre sure of this reasonably certain he clicked the computer mouse through a series of pictures that showed the boxes welded to the hull from different angles these housings could cover winches that can pull the rudder in either di rection or lock it in place look here this electrical connection runs up the side of the ship to a receiver above the waterline someone out side the ship could have controlled the steering therri furrowed her brow looks like a little pie plate austin dug into his jacket pulled out the plastic disk hed pried off the hull and dropped it on the table no pie in this plate its an antenna that could have been used to pick up signals therri glanced at the screen then picked the disk up and studied it this would explain the steering problems marcus had what about the engines he couldnt shut down youve got me there austin said if you could get into the ship and tear the engine room apart maybe youd find a mechanism that would allow the ships speed to be controlled from the outside as well i knew everyone on the sea sentinel theyre intensely loyal she jutted her chin forward as if she expected an argument theres no one in that crew who would sabotage the ship i havent made any accusations sorry she said i suppose i should keep an open mind about someone from the crew being involved not necessarily let me ask what they say at airport security did anyone else pack your baggage or has it been out of your sight so you do think someone from the outside could have sabotaged the ship austin nodded i found a power source line for the winches lead ing into the hull to tap the ships energy supply someone would have to get inside the ship to accomplish that now that you mention it she said without hesitation the ship needed some engine work it was in dry dock for four days in the shetland islands who did the work marcus would know ill ask him it could be important he tapped the screen this may be ryans ticket out of jail id suggest you get in touch with a guy at my hotel named becker who seems to be some sort ofbehindthescenes muckymuck with the danish navy department he might be able to help i dont understand why would the danes want to help marcus after all the awful things theyve said about him thats for public consumption what they really want is to kick ryans butt out of the faroes and make sure he never shows his face here again they dont want him to get on his soapbox because it might scare away companies that are thinking about investing in the faroes sorry if this messes up ryans martyrdom plans i wont deny that marcus was hoping to make this a cause celebre isnt that a risky strategy if he pushes the danes too far they may be forced to convict him and toss him into jail he doesnt strike me as a reckless guy he isnt reckless at all but marcus will take a calculated risk if he thinks the stakes are worth it in this case he would have weighed going to jail against a chance to stop the grind austin extracted the camera cassette from the computer and pre sented it to therri tell becker that i will testify to what i saw and verify that i took these pictures ill run a check on the manufacturer of this antenna but its possible that it was put together out of stan dard parts and wont tell us anything i dont know how to thank you therri said rising from her chair my standard fee is acceptance of a dinner invitation id be more than pleased to she stopped short and glanced across the room past austins shoulder kurt do you know that man hes been staring at you for some time austin turned and saw a balding longjawed man in his sixties who was now making his way to the table its kurt austin ofnuma if im not mistaken the man said in a booming voice austin stood and extended his hand professor jorgensen nice to see you its been three years since we last saw each other four actually since we worked on that project in the yucatan what a wonderful surprise i saw the news of the miraculous rescue you performed but assumed you had departed the faroes the professor was tall and narrowshouldered the ample tufts of hair flanking his freckled pate resembled swan wings he spoke english with an oxford accent which was not surprising since he had spent his undergraduate years at the famed english university i stayed on to help ms weld here with a project austin intro duced therri and said this is professor peter jorgensen dr jor gensen is one of the foremost fisheries physiologists in the world kurt makes it sound far more glamorous than it is im simply a fish physician so to speak well what brings you to this farflung out post of civilization ms weld im an attorney im studying the danish legal system austin said how about you professor are you doing some work here in the faroes yes ive been looking into some peculiar phenomena he said without taking his eyes off of therri maybe im being forward but i have a splendid suggestion perhaps we could have dinner together tonight and i could tell you about what ive been doing im afraid ms weld and i already have plans a pained expression crossed thems face oh kurt im so sorry i started to say id be pleased to have dinner with you but not tonight im going to be busy with that legal matter we discussed hoist by my own petard austin said with a shrug looks like you and i have a date professor splendid ill see you in the dining room of the hotel hania around seven if that sounds all right turning to therri he said im devastated ms weld i hope we will meet again he kissed her hand hes charming therri said after jorgensen left very courtly in an oldfashioned way i agree austin said but id still rather have you as my dinner partner im so sorry perhaps when we get back to the states her eyes darkened a shade ive been thinking about your theory about the possibility that the sea sentinel was controlled from the outside what would be the range involved in controlling a ship it could be done from quite a distance but whoever did it would stay close by to see if the ship were responding to command any ideas there were a number of boats carrying press in the area even a helicopter the controls could have been worked from the sea or the air it wouldnt have required much in the way of equipment a transmit ter with a joystick maybe like you see for video games assuming we know the how lets talk about the why who would benefit by neutralizing ryan do you have all day the list could go on forever marcus has made enemies all over the world for a start lets confine ourselves to the faroe islands the whalers would top the enemy list passions run high over the issue but theyre basically decent people in spite of their odd customs i cant see them attacking the navy ship thats been sent to protect them she paused in thought theres another possibility but its probably too farfetched to consider try me she furrowed her brow in concentration after thegrindarap op eration marcus and his crew planned to make a showing at a fish farm owned by the oceanus corporation the sentinels are also against largescale aquaculture because of the harm to the environ ment what do you know about oceanus not much its a multinational distributor of seafood products traditionally theyve bought fish from fleets around the world but in the last few years theyve gotten into aquaculture in a huge way their fish farms are on the same scale as some of the land farms op erated by the agribusiness outfits in the states you think oceanus could have arranged this whole thing oh i dont know kurt they would have the resources though and just maybe the motive where was their fish farm located not far from here near a place called skaalshavn marcus planned to run the sea sentinel back and forth in front of the farm for the benefit of the cameras therri glanced at her watch that reminds me i should be going ive got a lot of work to do they shook hands vowing to get together again therri made her way across the dining room and stopped briefly to throw him a coquettish glance over her shoulder the gesture was probably meant to be reassuring but it only made austin sadder professor jorgensen had politely watched for sev eral minutes as austin tried to navigate his way through the in comprehensible courses listed on the menu but finally he could bear it no longer he leaned across the table and said if youd like to try a faroese specialty id recommend the fried puffin or the pilotwhale steak austin pictured himself gnawing on a drumstick from one of the stubby little birds with the parrot beak and passed on the puffin after hearing the bloody way in which pilot whales met their demise in the faroes he decided he would rather eat shark snout but he set tled for thesyrpilyot wellaged mutton after one bite he wished he had gone for the puffin hows your mutton jorgensen said not quite as tough as shoe leather austin replied working his jaw oh my i should have advised you to get the boiled mutton as i did they dry slerpifyot in the wind its usually prepared at christ mas and served the rest of the year its a bit over the hill as they say he brightened at a new thought the life expectancy in the faroes is quite high so it must be good for you austin sawed off a small bite and managed to swallow it then he put his knife and fork down while he gave his jaw muscles a rest what brings you to the faroes dr jorgensen it cant be the food the professors eyes danced with amusement ive been looking into reports of diminishing fish stocks in the islands its a real mys tery in what way i thought at first that the cause of the vanishing fish might be pol lution but the waters are amazingly pure around the faroes i can only do so much testing onsite so im heading back to copenhagen tomorrow to run some water samples through the computer there may be small traces of chemicals that might have a bearing on the problem any theories as to the source of the chemicals its strange he said tugging at one of his tufts of hair im sure the problem has something to do with a nearby fish farm but so far there is no discernible link between the two austin had been eyeing the mutton wondering where he could get a burger but his ears perked up at the professors words did you say you were testing the water near a fish farm yes there are several aquaculture facilities in the islands that produce trout salmon and the like i collected samples from the wa ters around a farming operation in skaalshavn a few hours drive up the coast from torshavn on sundini the long sound that separates streymoy from the island ofeysturoy used to be a whaling station there in the old days the farm is owned by a big fisheries conglom erate austin took a long shot oceanus yes youve heard of it only recently as i understand what youre saying professor the fish levels near this farm are lower than they should be thats right jorgensen replied with furrowed brow a real puzzle ive heard fish farms can be harmful to the environment austin said recalling his conversation with therri weld true the waste products from a fish farm can be toxic they feed the fish a special chemical diet so theyll grow faster but oceanus claims it has a stateoftheart water purification system so far i havent found any evidence to dispute that claim have you visited this fish farm jorgensen bared his big teeth in a grin no visitors allowed theyve got the placed locked up tighter than the crown jewels i managed to speak offpremises with someone from the law firm that represents the company in denmark he assured me that no chem icals were used at the farm and that it has the finest in watercleaning facilities always the skeptical scientist i rented a little house not far from the oceanus operation and went as close as i could by boat to take the water samples as i said im leaving for copenhagen to morrow but you and your young lady friend are welcome to go up to the cottage its a pretty ride thanks professor unfortunately ms weld will be busy the next few days that is unfortunate austin nodded absentmindedly he was intrigued by jorgensens mention of the tight security at oceanus where some might see this as an obstacle austin saw an invitation to probe the connection be tween oceanus and the disastrous collision of the sos ship and the cruiser i might take you up on your cottage offer id like to see a little more of the faroes before i leave wonderful stay as long as you want the islands are spectacu lar ill call the landlord to say youll be coming his name is gunnar jepsen and he lives in a house behind the cottage you can use my rental car theres a small boat that goes along with the cottage and plenty to keep you busy incredible birding on the cliffs the hiking is superb and there are some fascinating archeological ruins nearby austin smiled and said im sure ill find something to do after dinner they had a nightcap in the hotel bar then bid each other goodbye with a promise to hook up in copenhagen the pro fessor was staying with a friend that night and would leave the is lands in the morning austin went up to his hotel room he wanted to get an early start the next day he went over to the window and stood awhile in thought as he looked out over the quaint town and harbor then he snatched up his cell phone and punched out a familiar number gamay morgantrout was in her office at numa headquarters in washington dc staring intently at the computer monitor when the telephone rang without moving her eyes from the screen she picked up the telephone and mumbled an absentminded hello at the sound of austins voice she broke into a dazzling smile that was made distinctive by the slight space between her front teeth kurt she said with obvious delight its wonderful to hear from you same here how are things back at numa still smiling gamay brushed a strand of long darkred hair away from her forehead and said weve been treading water here since you and joe left im reading a new abstract on toadfish nerve re search that could help cure balance problems in humans pauls at his computer working on a model of the java trench i dont know when ive had so much excitement i feel sorry for you and joe that daring rescue must have bored you to tears paul trouts computer was backtoback with his wifes trout was staring at the screen in typical pose with head dipped low par tially in thought but also to accommodate his sixfooteight height he had lightbrown hair parted down the middle in jazz age style and combed back at the temples as always he was dressed impec cably wearing a lightweight olive tan suit from italy and one of the colorful matching bow ties that were his addiction he peered up ward with hazel eyes as if over glasses although he wore contacts please ask our fearless leader when hes coming home paul said numa headquarters has been as quiet as a tomb while he and joe have been making headlines austin overheard trouts question tell paul ill be back at my desk in a few days joes due later in the week after he wraps up tests on his latest toy i wanted to let you know where id be im driving up the faroe coast tomorrow to a little village called skaalshavn whats going on gamay said i want to look into a fishfarm operation run by a company called oceanus there may be a connection between oceanus and the sink ing of those two ships here in the faroes while im poking around could you see what you can learn about this outfit i dont have much to go on maybe hiram can help out hiram yeager was the com puter whiz who rode herd on numas vast database they chatted a few more minutes with austin filling gamay in on the rescue of the danish sailors then hung up with gamay prom ising to get right on the oceanus request she related the gist of her conversation with austin kurt can whistle up a wind better than anyone i know paul said with a chuckle alluding to the ancient belief that whistling on a ship can attract a storm what did he want to know about fishfarming how to run your tractor underwater no a grain binder gamay said with exaggerated primness how could i forget that you practically grew up on a fishing boat just a simple son of a son of a fisherman as jimmy buffett would say trout had been born on cape cod into a fishing family his an cestral path had diverged when as a youngster he hung around the woods hole oceanographic institution some of the scientists at the institution had encouraged him to study oceanography hed re ceived his phd in ocean science at the scripps institution of oceanography specializing in deepocean geology and was profi cient in using computer graphics in his various undersea projects i happen to know that despite your display of ignorance you know a lot more about aquaculture than you let on fishfarming is nothing new back home folks have been seeding and harvesting the clam and oyster flats for a hundred years or more then you know its essentially the same principle only extended to fin fish the fish are bred in tanks and raised in open net cages that float in the ocean the farms can produce fish in a fraction of the time it takes to catch them in the wild paul frowned with the government clamping down on the wild fishery because of stock depletion competition like that is the last thing a fisherman needs the fish farmers would disagree they say aquaculture produces cheaper food provides employment and pours money into the econ omy as a marine biologist where do you stand on the issue gamay had received a degree in marine archaeology before chang ing her field of interest and enrolling at scripps where shed attained a doctorate in marine biology and in the process met and married paul i guess i stand smack in the middle she said fishfarming does have benefits but im a little worried that with big companies running the farms things could get out of control which way is the wind blowing hard to tell but i can give you an example of whats happening imagine youre a politician running for office and the fishfarm in dustry says it will invest hundreds of millions of dollars in the coastal communities and that investment will generate jobs and billions of dollars each year in economic activity in your district which side would you back trout let out a low whistle billions i had no idea there was that kind of money involved im talking about a fraction of the world business there are fish farms all over the world if youve had salmon or shrimp or scallops lately the fish you ate could have been raised in canada or thailand or colombia the farms must have incredible capacity to pump out fish in those quantities its phenomenal in british columbia theyve got seventy million farmraised salmon compared to fiftyfive thousand wild caught how can the wild fishermen compete with production like that they cant gamay said with a shrug kurt was interested in a company called oceanus lets see what i can find her hands played over the computer keyboard strange usually the biggest problem with the internet is too much information theres almost nothing on oceanus all i could find is this one paragraph article saying that a salmonprocessing plant in canada had been sold to oceanus ill peck around some more it took another fifteen minutes of hunting and paul was deep in the java trench again when he heard gamay finally say aha pay dirt gamay scrolled down i found a few sentences about the acqui sition buried in an industry newsletter story oceanus apparently owns companies around the world that are expected to produce more than five hundred million pounds a year the merger gives market access in this country through an american subsidiary the seller figures the us will buy a quarter of what they produce five hundred million pounds im turning in my fishing rod i wouldnt mind seeing one of these plants wheres the nearest one the canadian operation i just mentioned id like to see it too so whats stopping us were twiddling our thumbs while kurt and joe are away the world isnt in need of saving and if it is dirk and al are always available she squinted at the screen the plant is in cape breton which is more than a skip and a jump from the shores of the potomac when will you learn to trust my yankee ingenuity paul said with a fake sigh while gamay watched with a bemused smile paul picked up the phone and punched out a number after a brief conversation he hung up with a triumphant grin on his boyish face that was a pal in numas travel department theres a numa plane leaving for boston in a few hours they have two seats available maybe you can charm the pilot into an addon to cape breton its worth a try gamay said pushing the off button on her computer what about your toadfish research paul said gamay replied with a bad imitation of a toads croak what about the java trench its been there for millions of years i think it can wait a few more days his computer monitor went blank as well relieved that their boredom at last had come to an end they raced each other to their office door the morning gloom had burned off and the faroes were enjoying a rare moment of sunshine that revealed the splendor of the island scenery the countryside seemed to be covered in brightgreen billiard table baize the rugged terrain was barren of trees dotted by grassroofed houses and an occasional church steeple and laced by crooked stone walls and foot trails austin drove the professors volvo along a twisting coastal road that offered inland views of distant mountains jagged gray out croppings rose from the cold blue sea like huge petrified whale fins birds swirled around the lofty vertical cliffs where the sea had sculpted the irregular shoreline around midday austin emerged from a mountain tunnel and saw a dolllike village clustered on a gently sloping hill at the edge of a fjord the serpentine road followed a series of descending switchbacks dropping thousands of feet in a few miles the volvos wheels skirted the edge of hairpin turns with no guardrails along the berm austin was happy when he reached the level road that ran be tween the foamflecked surf and the colorfully painted houses built on the slope of the hillside like spectators at an amphitheater a woman was planting flowers in front of a tiny church whose grassy roof was surmounted by a short rectangular steeple austin danced at his faroese phrasebook and got out of the car he said orsaa hvar er gunnar jepsen excuse me where could i find gunnar jepsen she put her trowel down and came over austin saw that she was a handsome woman who could have been between fifty and sixty her silvery hair was tied in a bun and she was tanned except for the sun blush on her high cheekbones her eyes were as gray as the nearby sea a bright smile crossed her narrow face and she pointed toward a side road that led to the outskirts of town gott taaf he said thank you eingisjt no im american we dont see many americans here in skaalshavn she said speaking english with a scandinavian lilt welcome i hope im not the last gunnar lives up there on the hill just follow that little road she smiled again i hope you have a good visit austin thanked her once more got back in the car and followed a pair of gravel ruts for about a quarter of a mile the road ended at a large grassroofed house built of vertical dark chocolatecolored planking a pickup truck was parked in the drive a hundred yards down the slope was a smaller twin of the main house austin climbed the porch stairs and knocked the man who answered the door was of medium height and slightly on the portly side he had an appleround face and cheeks and thin strands of reddishblond hair combed over his bald head ja he said with a pleasant smile mr jepsen austin said my name is kurt austin im a friend of professor jorgensens mr austin come in he pumped kurts hand like a usedcar salesman greeting a prospect then he ushered him into a rustic liv ing room dr jorgensen phoned and said you were coming its a long drive from torshavn jepsen said would you like a drink not now thanks maybe later jepsen nodded and said youre here to do a little fishing ive heard you can catch fish on dry land in the faroes not quite jepsen said with a grin but almost as good i was doing some ship salvage work in torshavn and thought fishing would be a good way to relax ship salvage austin he swore in faroese i should have known youre the american who saved the danish sailors i saw it on the television miraculous wait til the people in the village learn i am entertaining a celebrity i was hoping i wouldnt be bothered of course but it will be impossible to keep your visit a secret from the townspeople i met one of them outside the church she seemed nice enough that would be the ministers widow shes the postmistress and head gossip everyone will know youre here by now is that the professors cottage down the hill yes jepsen said removing a key ring from a nail in the wall come ill show you austin got his duffel from the car as they walked down the hardpacked path jepsen said youre a good friend of dr jorgensen i met him a few years ago his reputation as a fish scientist is worldknown yes i know i was very honored to have him here now you they stopped in front of the cottage whose porch offered a view of the harbor where a picturesque fleet of fishing boats was anchored are you a fisherman mr jepsen in a little place like this you survive by doing many things i rent out my cottage my expenses arent great they climbed onto the cottage porch and went inside the inte rior was basically one room with a single bed bathroom kitchen area a small table and a couple of chairs but it looked comfortable jepsen said theres fishing gear in the closet let me know if you need a guide for fishing or hiking my roots go back to the vikings and no one knows this place better thanks for your offer but ive been around a lot of people lately id like to spend some time on my own i understand that a boat goes with the cottage third one from the end of the pier jepsen said a double ender the keys are in it thank you for your help if youll excuse me id like to unpack then ill go into the village and stretch my legs austin said jepsen told austin to let him know if he needed anything dress warm he said as he went out the door the weather changes quickly around here heeding jepsens advice austin pulled a windbreaker over his sweater he went outside and stood on the cottage porch sucking in the cool air the land sloped gradually down to the sea from his van tage he had a clear view of the harbor the fish pier and the boats he walked back up the path to the volvo and drove into the village austins first stop was the bustling fish pier where a procession of trawlers unloaded their catches under an umbrella of squalling seabirds he found the boat tied up as jepsen had described it was a wellbuilt wooden inboard about twenty feet long turned up dory fashion at both ends he checked the motor and found it relatively clean and new the key was in the ignition as jepsen had said austin started the engine and listened to it for a few minutes satisfied that it was running smoothly he switched it off and headed back to his car on the way he encountered the ministers widow coming out of a loading bay hallo american she said with a friendly grin did you find gunnar yes thank you she was holding a fish wrapped in newspaper i came down here to get some supper my name is pia knutsen they shook hands pias grip was warm and firm nice to meet you im kurt austin ive been enjoying the sights skaalshavn is a beautiful village ive been wondering what the name means in english you are talking to the unofficial village historian skaalshavn means skull harbor austin glanced out at the water is the bay shaped like a skull oh no it goes way back the vikings discovered skulls in some caves when they founded the settlement people were here before the vikings irish monks perhaps or maybe even earlier the caves were on the other side of the headland at what was the original harbor for the old whaling station it became too small as fishing grew so the fish ermen moved their boats and settled here id like to do some hiking would you recommend any routes where i can get a good view of the town and its surroundings from the bird cliffs you can see for miles take that path behind the village she said pointing you will go through the moors by some beautiful waterfalls and streams past a big lake the trail climbs sharply after you pass the old farm ruins and you will be at the cliffs dont go too close to the edge especially if its foggy un less you have wings the ledges are nearly five hundred meters tall follow the cairns back and keep them on your left the trail is steep and goes down fast dont walk too close to the edge along the sea because sometimes the waves crash over the rocks and can catch you ill be careful one more thing dress warm the weather changes quickly sometimes gunnar gave me the same advice he seems quite knowledge able is he a native gunnar would like people to think he goes back to erik the red she sniffed hes from copenhagen moved into the village a year or two ago do you know him well oh yes she said with a roll of her lovely eyes gunnar tried to get me into his bed but im not that hard up pia was a goodlooking woman and austin wasnt surprised at jepsens attempt but he hadnt driven all this way to tune in on the local romances i heard there was a fish operation of some sort up the coast yes youll see it from the cliffs ugly concrete and metal build ings the harbor is full of their fish cages they raise fish there and ship it out the local fishermen dont like it the fishing around the old harbor has gone bad no one from town works there not even gunnar anymore he worked at the fish farm in the beginning something to do with construction he used his money to buy his houses and lives off the rentals do you get many visitors here austin was watching a sleek blue yacht coming into the harbor birdwatchers and fishermen she followed austins eyes like those men in that pretty boat its owned by a rich spaniard i hear they say he came all the way from spain for the fishing austin turned back to pia you speak english very well we learn it in the schools along with danish and my husband and i spent some time in england when we were first married i dont get much chance to speak it she lifted the fish under austins nose and said would you like to come to my house for dinner i could practice my english it wouldnt be too much trouble no no come by after your walk my house is behind the church they agreed to meet in a few hours and austin drove to the trail head the gravel path climbed gradually through rolling moors splashed with wildflowers and passed near a small lake almost per fectly round that looked as if it were made of cold crystal about a mile from the lake he came upon the ruins of an old farm and an an cient graveyard the path grew steeper and less visible as pia advised he followed the carefully piled heaps of rock that marked the way he could see flocks of sheep so far away that they looked like bits of lint tower ing in the distance were layered mountains with cascading wedding veil waterfalls the trail led to the cliffs where hundreds ofseabirds filled the air balancing delicately on updrafts of air tall sea stacks soared from the bay their flat summits wreathed in fog austin chewed on a power bar and thought that the faroes must be the most otherworldly place on the planet he kept on going until he stood atop a ridge that gave him a panoramic view of the serrated coast a rounded headland separated skaalshavn from a smaller inlet clustered along the shore of the old harbor were dozens of neatly arranged buildings as he surveyed the scene below he felt a drop of rain on his cheek dark billowing clouds were rolling in from the layered mountains to obliterate the sun he started down from the exposed ridge even with switch backs easing the vertical drop the going was hard on the steep trail and he had to move slowly until the ground leveled out again as he approached sea level the heavens opened up he kept heading to ward the lights of the town and before long he was at his car pia took one look at the drenched and bedraggled figure at her door and shook her head you look like youve crawled out of the sea she pulled austin in by the sleeve and ordered him to go into the bathroom and strip austin was too wet to protest while he was undressing she cracked the door open and tossed in a towel and dry clothes i was sure my husbands clothes would fit she said approvingly when austin ventured out in the shirt and pants he was a big man like you while pia set the table austin spread his clothes out next to a wood stove then stood practically on top of it basking in the heat until she informed him that dinner was ready the baked fresh cod melted in his mouth they washed dinner down with a light homemade white wine dessert was a sweet raisin pudding over their meal she talked about her life in the faroes and austin told her a little about his numa work she was fascinated by his travels to exotic places for his numa assignments i forgot to ask did you have a good walk even with the rain pia said as she cleared the dishes i climbed to the top of the cliffs the views were incredible i saw the fish farm you mentioned do they allow visitors oh no pia replied with a shake other head they dont let anyone in like i said before none of the village men work there theres a road along the shore that they used when they were build ing but its blocked off with a high fence everything comes and goes by sea they say its like a separate town out there sounds interesting too bad no one can get in pia refilled austins glass and gave him a sly look i could get in in a minute if i wanted to through the mermaids gate he shook his head unsure he had heard her correctly the mer maids gate thats what my father used to call the natural arch at the edge of the old harbor he used to take me out sometimes in his boat and wed go there he never took me in its dangerous because of the cur rents and rocks some men have drowned trying to go through the gate so the fishermen stay away they say its haunted by the souls of the dead you can hear them moaning but its only the way the wind blows through the caves it sounds as if your father wasnt afraid of ghosts he wasnt afraid of any thing what do these caves have to do with the fish farm its a way to go in one cave joins others that lead to the old har bor my father said there are paintings on the walls wait ill show you she went to a bookcase and took out an old family album tucked between pages of photos was a sheet of paper which she unfolded and spread on the table drawn on the paper were rough sketches of bison and deer more interesting to austin were depictions of long graceful boats powered by sail and oar these are very old drawings austin said although he was un able to place them in time did your father show them to anyone else not outside the family he wanted the caves kept a secret be cause he was afraid they would get ruined if people knew about them then the caves cant be entered from the land side there was a way but it was blocked with boulders my father said it would be no problem to move them he wanted to get some sci entists in from the university so it would be done right but he died in a storm im sorry pia smiled like i said he wasnt afraid of anything anyhow after he died my mother moved the family away to live with rela tives i came back here with my husband i was too busy raising kids to worry about the caves then the fish company bought the land and the old whaling station and no one could get out there are there more pictures she shook her head poppa tried to make a map of the caves but i dont know what happened to it he said the people who made the paintings were smart they used pictures offish and birds like signs as long as you follow the right fish you wont get lost some of the caves lead to blind alleys they talked into the night austin finally looked at his watch and said that he had to go pia wouldnt let him leave until he agreed to return for dinner the next evening he drove along the deserted road in the dusky light that passes for night in northern climes a light was on at the main house but he saw no sign ofjepsen and guessed he had gone to bed the rain had ended he went out on the porch and stood there awhile looking down on the quiet village and harbor then went back inside the cottage and got ready to sack out although the remote village seemed peaceful he couldnt shake the uneasy feeling that skaalshavn was a place of dark secrets before he turned in he made sure that the door and windows were locked paul trout threaded the widebeamed humvee through the heavy washington traffic like a runner going for a touchdown at the super bowl although he and gamay often took the hummer on fourwheeling family trips in the virginia country side nothing they encountered offroad could compare with the chal lenges of driving in the nations capital they made good time though as gamay called out openings in the traffic and paul spun the wheel over without looking their ability to work together like a welloiled machine had been crucial on countless numa assign ments and was a tribute to the acumen of admiral sandecker who had hired them together paul turned down a narrow georgetown street and tucked the humvee into the parking space behind their brick town house and they bolted for the door minutes later they were jumping into a taxi their hastily packed overnight bags in hand the numa exec utive jet was waiting at the airport with its engines warming up the pilot who was flying a contingent of scientists to boston knew the trouts from past missions with the special assignments team she had gotten the okay from numa to add the extra leg to her trip and filed a new flight plan after dropping off the scientists at logan airport the plane con tinued up the atlantic coast with a cruising speed of nearly five hundred miles an hour the cessna citation had the trouts in hali fax nova scoria in time for a late dinner they stayed overnight at a hotel near the airport and caught an air canada flight to cape breton early the next morning then rented a car at the sydney air port and drove out of the city up the rocky coast to look for the pro cessing plant that oceanus had acquired gamay had picked up a travel guide at the airport the travel writer whod written the sec tion describing this part of the remote coast must have been desper ate because he had listed the fishprocessing plant as a tourist attraction after not seeing any signs of civilization for many miles they came upon a combination general store coffee shop and service station gamay who was taking her turn at the wheel pulled alongside the battered pickup trucks lined up in front of the ramshackle falsefront building paul looked up from the map he was studying charming but weve got another few miles before we get to the center of town we have to stop for gas anyhow gamay said tapping the fuel gauge while you pump the pump ill pump the locals for gossip tucking the guidebook under her arm gamay stepped over the mangy black labrador retriever stretched out in a deathlike sleep on the rickety front porch and pushed the door open her nostrils were greeted by a pleasant fragrance of pipe tobacco bacon and coffee the store which occupied one half of the room was crammed with every sort of item from beef jerky to rifle ammunition the coffee shop took up the other side of the store a dozen or so men and women sat at round formicaandchrome tables all eyes turned to gamay at fiveten and a hundredthirty five pounds gamays slimhipped figure and unusual red hair would have attracted attention at a malibu beach party the curious stares followed her every move as she poured two plastic cups full of cof fee from a selfservice dispenser gamay went to pay and the plump young woman at the cash reg ister greeted her with a friendly smile passing through she said as if she couldnt imagine any traveler staying in town longer than it took to fill a coffee cup gamay nodded my husband and i are taking a drive along the coast dont blame you for not staying the woman said with resigna tion not much to see around here despite her striking sophistication gamays midwestern roots had given her a downhome earthiness that was hard to resist we think its beautiful country she said with an engaging smile wed stay longer if we had time she opened the guidebook to the foldedover page it says here that theres a pretty little fishing harbor and a fish processing plant nearby it does the cashier said with disbelief the other people in the room had been listening to every word a spindly whitehaired woman cackled like a hen fishing aint what it used to be plant sold out some big outfit bought the business fired all the folks working there nobody knows what theyre doing people who work there never come into town sometimes we see the eskimos driving around in their big black trucks gamay glanced into the guidebook looking for something she missed did you say eskimos i didnt think we were that far north her innocent question started a table debate some of the locals contended that eskimos guarded the plant others said that the men driving the suvs were indians or maybe mongolians gamay won dered if she had stumbled into the local insane asylum a thought that was reinforced when the cashier mumbled something about aliens aliens gamay said the cashier blinked through thick roundframed glasses her eyes growing wider its like that secret ufo place in the states area fiftyone like they show on the xfiles i seen a ufo once when i was hunting near the old plant in terjected a man who could have been a hundred years old big sil ver thing all lit up hell joe said the skinny woman ive seen you so lit up youve probably seen purple elephants yup the man said with a gaptoothed grin seen them too the restaurant filled with laughter gamay smiled sweetly and said to the cashier wed love to tell our friends back home that we saw a ufo base is it far from here maybe twenty miles the cashier said she gave gamay directions to the plant gamay thanked the young woman put a tendollar bill in the empty tip jar scooped up the coffees and headed out the door paul was leaning against the car his arms folded across his chest he took the coffee she offered him any luck gamay glanced back at the store im not sure i seem to have run into the cast of twin peay in the last few minutes ive learned that this part of the world is home to eskimos who drive big black suvs a ufo base and purple elephants that explains it he said with mock seriousness while you were inside a bunch of big critters the color of plums came thun dering by here after what i heard im not surprised she said slipping behind the wheel think the locals were having a little fun at the expense of a tourist paul said getting into the passenger side ill let you know after we find big silver things around area fiftyone seeing the quizzical expression on her husbands face she laughed and said ill explain on the way they drove past the turnoff that led to the town center and har bor into an area of heavy pine forest even with the cashiers de tailed directions which included every stump and stone for miles they almost missed the turnoff there was no sign marking the en trance only the hardpacked ruts showing fairly recent use distin guished the way from any of the other fire roads that cut into the thick woods about a half mile from the main road they pulled over the cashier had advised gamay to park at a clearing near a big glacial boulder and to walk through the woods a few townspeople who had driven close to the plants gates had been intercepted and rudely turned away the eskimos or whatever they were probably had hid den cameras gamay and paul left the car and made their way through the woods parallel to the road for about an eighth of a mile until they could see the sun glinting off a high chainlink fence a black cable ran along the top of the fence indicating that the razor wire was electrified no cameras were visible although it was possible that they were disguised what now gamay said we can fish or cut bait paul replied i never liked cutting bait me neither lets fish paul stepped out of the woods into the cleared grassy swath around the fence his sharp eye noticed a thin almostinvisible wire at ankle height he pointed to the ground trip wire he snapped a dead branch off a nearby tree and dropped it on the wire then he slipped back into the woods he and gamay flattened out bellyfirst on the pine needle carpeting soon they heard the sound of a motor and a black suv lumbered to a stop on the other side of the fence the door opened and fierce looking pure white samoyeds as big as lions lunged out and ran up to the fence the snuffling dogs were followed a moment later by a swarthy roundfaced guard in a black uniform he cradled a leveled assault rifle in his hands while the dogs dashed back and forth along the fence the guard suspiciously eyed the woods he saw the branch lying on the trip wire in an unintelligible language he mumbled into a hand radio then he moved on the dogs may have sensed the two human beings in the woods they growled and stood stifflegged staring at the trees that hid the trouts the guard yelled at them and they jumped back into the suv then he drove off not bad time paul said checking his watch ninety seconds maybe its time we got out of here gamay said theyll be sending someone to clear away that branch the trouts melted back into the woods walking and trotting they returned to their rental car minutes later they were on the main road gamay shook her head in wonderment that guard did he look like an eskimo to you yeah kinda i guess never ran into many eskimos back on old cape cod whats an eskimo doing this far south selling eskimo pies the only thing that guy and his puppy dogs were selling was a quick trip to the morgue lets see whats going on in the big city gamay nodded and a few minutes later she was taking the turnoff that led to town the village was hardly quaint and she could see why it was only a footnote in the travel guide the houses were pro tected against the weather by asphalt shingles of drab green and faded maroon and the roofs were covered with aluminum to allow the snow to slide off there were few people or cars around some of the shops in the minuscule business section posted signs that said they were closed until further notice and the town had an abandoned look the harbor was picturesque as the tour book said but it was empty of boats adding to the towns forlorn aspect the fish pier was deserted except for a ragged flock of sleeping gulls gamay spotted a restaurantbar neon sign in a small square building overlooking the harbor paul suggested that she grab a table and order him fish and chips while he meandered around and tried to find someone who could tell him about the oceanus plant gamay stepped into the yeasty atmosphere of the restaurant and saw that the place was vacant except for a heavyset bartender and one customer she took a table with a view of the harbor the bartender came over for her order like the people shed met in the general store he proved to be a friendly type he apologized for not having fish and chips but said the grilled ham and cheese sandwich was pretty good gamay said that would be fine and ordered two sand wiches along with a molson she liked the canadian beer because it was stronger than the american brew gamay was sipping her beer admiring the flyspecked ceiling the tornfishnetandweatheredlobsterbuoy decorations on the wall when the man sitting at the bar slid off his stool apparently he had taken the sight of an attractive woman drinking alone in a bar at mid day as an invitation he sidled over with a beer bottle in his hand and ran his eyes over camays red hair and lithe athletic body unable to see her wedding ring because her left hand was resting on her knee he figured gamay was fair game good mornin he said with an amiable smile mind if i join you gamay wasnt put off by the direct approach she moved well among men because she had a talent for thinking like they do with her tall slim figure and long swirledup hair it was hard to believe that gamay had been a tomboy running with a gang of boys build ing tree houses playing baseball in the streets of racine she was an expert marksman as well thanks to her father whod taught her to shoot skeet be my guest gamay said casually and waved him into a chair my names mike neal he said neal was in his forties he was dressed in work clothes and wore shinhigh black rubber boots with his dark rugged profile and thick black hair neal would have had classic good looks if not for a weakness around the mouth and a ruby nose colored by too much booze you sound american i am she extended her hand and introduced herself pretty name neal said impressed by the firmness of gamays grip like the general store cashier he said just passing through gamay nodded ive always wanted to see the maritime provinces are you a fisherman yep he pointed out the window and with unrestrained pride said thats my beauty over there at the boatyard dock the tiffany named her after my old girlfriend we broke up last year but its bad luck to change the name of a boat are you taking a day off from fishing not exactly boat shop did some work on my engine they wont release tiffany until i pay them afraid id take off without paying would you he smirked i stung them for a few bucks before still that seems shortsighted on their part with your boat you could go fishing and earn the money to pay them back neals smile dissolved into a frown i could if there were fish to sell someone at the general store mentioned that the fishing was bad worse than bad rest of the fleet has moved up the coast some of the guys come home between trips to see family how long has this been going on bout six months any idea whats causing the drought he shrugged when we talked to the provincial fisheries people they said the fish musta moved off looking for better feeding they didnt even send someone like we asked dont want to get their feet wet i guess the marine biologists all must be busy sitting on their fat asses looking at their computers do you agree with what they said about the fish moving off he grinned for a tourist youve got lots of questions when im not a tourist im a marine biologist neal blushed sorry i wasnt talking about your fat ass oh hell gamay laughed i know exactly what you mean about computer biologists who never leave their lab i think fishermen have more practical knowledge of the sea than any scientist at the same time professional expertise doesnt hurt maybe i can help you figure out why there are no fish to catch a cloud passed over neals features i didnt say there are no fish there are fish all right then whats the problem these arent like any fish ive seen in all my years of fishing i dont understand neal shrugged apparently this was one subject he didnt want to talk about ive studied fish in and out of the water all over the world gamay said there isnt much that would surprise me bet this would gamay stuck her hand out okay its a bet how much is your engine repair bill seven hundred fifty dollars canadian ill pay that if you show me what youre talking about let me buy you a beer to seal the deal neals unshaven jaw dropped open youre serious very look mike there are no fences in the ocean fish go pretty much where they please there may be something harmful in these waters that could affect american fishermen as well okay he said shaking her hand when can you go how about today neal grinned like a cheshire cat the source of his happiness wasnt hard to figure out a nicelooking and friendly american woman was paying his boatyard bill and going out on his boat alone where he could turn on his rugged charm just then paul trout walked into the bar and came over to the table sorry i took so long paul said harbors pretty deserted this is mike neal gamay said mike id like you to meet my husband neal glanced up at trouts nearly sevenfoottall figure and his fantasies about gamay evaporated but he was a practical mana deal was a deal pleased to meet you he said they shook hands mike here has agreed to take us out on his boat to show us some unusual fish gamay said we can leave in an hour neal said thatll give you time to eat your lunch see you over at the boat he rose from his chair and started to leave do we need to bring anything paul asked naw neal said he stopped and said elephant gun maybe he roared with laughter at the trouts puzzled expressions they could still hear him laughing after he passed through the door with his longstemmed pipe teeth like a broken picket fence and stormbeaten face old eric looked like a grizzled character out of captains courageous pia said that the retired fisherman spoke english and knew the local waters better than the fish now too old to go fishing he did odd jobs around the pier de spite his fierce expression he was more than obliging when austin mentioned pias name austin had arrived at the fish pier early looking for advice about local weather and sea conditions a purpleblue pall from the throaty exhausts of the skaalshavn fishing fleet hung in the damp air fish ermen decked out in foulweather gear and boots slogged through the drizzle as they loaded bait buckets and tubs of coiled trawl line on their boats in preparation for a day at sea he told the old salt he was taking professor jorgensens boat out to go fishing old eric squinted at the scudding gray clouds and pursed his lips in thought rain should stop and the fog will burn off soon he pointed to a tall pillar of rock guarding the harbor entrance go to the starboard of that sea stack youll find good fishing after a mile wind comes up around midday but the professors boat is weatherly i should know he said with a gaptoothed grin i built her shell get you home in one piece hows the fishing the other way along the coast the old fisherman wrinkled his nose stinks around the fish farm a wet ride too coming back with a following sea austin thanked eric for his advice stowed his day pack and fish ing gear in the boat checked the fuel level and ventilated the bilge the inboard engine started right away and soon settled down to a smooth rumble austin cast off the lines pushed away from the dock and pointed the bow toward the twohundredfoothigh chimney shaped rock formation that stood like a stone waterspout at the har bor entrance he went to the left rather than to the right of the lofty column hoping old eric wouldnt see him soon the boat was cruising past towering cliffs where thousands of nesting seabirds soared like windblown confetti the motor purred like a milkfed kitten there was a slight chop to the water but the doubleender sliced rather than slapped its way through the waves spray occasionally splashed over the bow austin stayed warm and dry in the yellow foulweather gear and boots hed found in the boats storage compartment the high ramparts along the coast dissolved into a series of craggy bluffs that dropped down to low hills and finally dipped to sea level as he neared the old harbor he saw no other boats the local fish ermen were working more productive grounds in the other direction only when he rounded a point of land did he discover that he was not alone the bluehulled spanish yacht he had seen entering the harbor the day before lay at anchor in the inlet about a half mile from shore the sleek boat was more than two hundred feet long its low clean lines suggested that the yacht was built for speed as well as comfort the name on the stern was navarra the decks were deserted no one came out to wave as was customary when one boat encountered an other particularly in such remote waters austin felt unseen eyes watching him from behind the darktinted windows as he continued past the yacht toward land sunlight shining through the clouds re flected dully off the distant metal rooftops he had glimpsed from the high ridge the day before a dot rose in the sky from the general vicinity of the buildings the speck rapidly grew in size and became a black helicopter with no markings the chopper came in low and buzzed the boat like an angry hornet circled twice then hovered facing austin a few hun dred yards away rocket pods hung from the fuselage more com pany was on its way a boat was bearing down on his position it was moving fast throwing up fountains of spray as it skimmed the wave tops the craft ate up the distance and austin saw that it was a low slung cigarette boat like the soupedup models favored by florida drug smugglers the boat slowed and made a broadside pass close enough for austin to get a good look at the three men on board they were short and stocky and had round faces and swarthy complexions their black hair was cut in bangs over their almost asian eyes one man stayed at the wheel while the others watched austin with an unhealthy interest their rifles raised to their shoulders the boat cut engines and slowed to a stop and the man at the wheel raised an electronic bullhorn to his lips he yelled something in what sounded like faroese austin responded with a goofy smile and threw up his hands in the universal gesture of ignorance the man tried again in danish then in english private property keep away still playing mickey the dunce austin maintained the goofy grin he held his fishing pole over his head and pointed at it the un smiling riflemen did the same thing with their weapons austin waved as if to say he understood the silent message he replaced the fishing pole in its rack then he gunned the motor waved a friendly goodbye and aimed the boat out of the harbor glancing over his shoulder a minute later austin saw the ciga rette boat speeding back toward land the helicopter sheared off and rapidly outpaced the boat he passed the yacht again the decks were still deserted he continued along the coast toward a headland shaped like a parrots beak a few minutes later he sighted the mer maids gate at the bottom of a vertical cliff it was amazingly sym metrical for a natural arch the opening was about twenty feet high and slightly narrower in width it looked like a mouse hole com pared to the overpowering wall of rough brownishblack rock despite its lyrical name the mermaids gate was far from wel coming the sea was relatively calm but waves pounded the fang shaped rocks on either side and in front of the arch spray flew high in the air the water in front of the opening boiled and swirled with vicious crosscurrents like a giant washing machine over the crash of the sea austin heard a hollow soughing issuing from the opening the hair rose on the back of his neck the mournful dirge was what he imagined the moans of drowned sailors would sound like re gretfully he didnt see a single mermaid austin halted the boat a respectable distance from the gate any attempt to pass through now would be like trying to thread a needle in a jostling crowd austin checked his watch and settled back and munched on the bread and cheese pia had thoughtfully packed for him he was finishing his breakfast when he sensed a change in the sea conditions it was as if king neptune had waved his trident while the water in the immediate vicinity was still restless the waves no longer exploded against the archway with artillery force pia had said that the gate was safely navigable only on either side of a slack current he secured all loose objects on the boat donned his life jacket spread his legs wide for stability throttled up and pointed the boat at the gate even at slack current the water around the opening was dimpled by swirling vortexes he clenched his teeth and prayed that pias childhood memory other fathers words was accurate when he was only yards away from the lethal reach of the rocks he gunned the throttle aiming slightly to the right as instructed although it was dangerously close to the rocks with inches to spare the boat slith ered through the tight opening as easily as an eel making a quick lefthand turn in the domed chamber he headed toward a narrow cleft in the rocks and entered a canal inches wider than the doubleender the boat banged against the kelpcovered ledges as it followed the channel in a rough scourse that widened into a circular lagoon the size of a backyard pool the waters sur face was black with seaweed and the smell of the ocean was almost overpowering in the confined space austin pulled the doubleender alongside a ledge and wrapped the mooring line around a rocky knob he slipped off his life jacket and foulweather gear climbed a short flight of natural steps and stepped into an opening shaped like an upsidedown keyhole he was im mediately buffeted by a musty wind the air was amplified like a trumpeters breath as it flowed from the cleft producing the haunt ing moan of the dead mariners he clicked his flashlight on and followed a tunnel that eventually widened into a large cave three smaller caverns branched off from the main chamber painted on the wall next to each opening was a picture of a fish remembering pias instructions he entered the cave marked by a sea bream he soon found himself in a bewildering maze of caves and tunnels without the crude markers he would have become hopelessly lost after walking a few minutes he en tered a highceilinged chamber whose walls had been smoothed down and were covered with colorful renderings he recognized the bison and deer from the drawings pias father had made the ochre and red colors were still vibrant the pictures unfolded into a hunting scene that included antelope wild horses and even a woolly mammoth hunters dressed in short kilts were shown attacking their prey with spears and bows and ar rows the mural encompassed vignettes of everyday life there were scenes with people regally dressed in flowing robes sleek sailing ships two and threestory houses of sophisticated architecture the depiction of mammoths suggested that the drawings went back to neolithic times but this was a civilization of the highest order austin followed the sea bream into a series of smaller caves and saw the remains of old firepits he was more concerned with evi dence of recent human occupation the murmur of voices came from just ahead he edged cautiously forward with his back plastered against a wall and peered around a corner into a cave the size of a small warehouse the space looked like a natural cavern that had been expanded with the help of explosives and jackhammers flood lights hanging from the high ceiling illuminated hundreds of plastic cartons stacked high on wooden pallets from the shadows austin watched a work crew of a dozen men dressed in black coveralls unload boxes from a forklift and place them on a conveyor belt the workers were swarthy and dark skinned like the men he had seen in the patrol boat they had straight jetblack hair cut in bangs high cheekbones and almond shaped eyes they were finishing their task and after a while half the work crew drifted out the door and the rest remained a few min utes to clean up at a word from a man whose air of authority tabbed him as the boss they too straggled out through a door austin stepped from his hiding place and inspected the writing on the boxes the words stenciled in several languages identified the contents as refined fish food he continued past a large freight door set into one wall probably used to bring the fish food into the ware house and made his way toward the door that the work crew had gone through the next room was a nexus for dozens of pipes and pumps that extended from a huge round bin chutes ran up the side of the con tainer austin concluded that the food was poured into chutes mixed in the tank and conveyed throughout the fish farm by the network of pipes he borrowed a pry bar from a tool room next to the mixing area he hefted the flat metal bar in his hand thinking it would be about as effective as a feather against automatic weapons but tucked it in his belt anyhow then he followed the feed pipes from the mixing area the pipes ran through a passageway and ended at a wall with a door in it austin cracked open the door and cold air blew against his face he listened hearing nothing he stepped into the open the fresh air felt good after the mustiness of the caverns after exiting through the other side of the wall the pipes contin ued and ran down a broad white gravelcovered alley that sepa rated two rows of buildings placed parallel to each other smaller pipes branched out from the main conduit into the buildings the onestory structures were built of cinder block and had roofs of cor rugated steel the air was heavy with the smell offish and the low hum of machinery came from every direction austin went over to the nearest building and found the steel door unlocked oceanus probably didnt expect prowlers to get past its boats and helicopter the interior lit by lowlevel ceiling lights was in semidarkness the hum he had heard came from electrical mo tors powering the pumps that circulated water in rows of large blue plastic tanks they were lined up on either side of a center aisle that ran the length of the building the tanks were serviced by water mains feed pipes pumpsvalves and electrical connections austin climbed a metal ladder up the side of one tank the beam from his flashlight stirred up hundreds of startled fish each no bigger than a finger he climbed down slipped out of the fish nursery and worked his way from building to building the structures were identical except for differences in the size and species of the fish they housed he rec ognized salmon cod and other familiar types in the holding tanks a centrally located smaller building housed a central computer cen ter it was unoccupied he watched the blinking dials and gauges on the central panel and realized why he had seen few people in his travels the fish farm was almost totally automated as he was emerging from the computer center he heard the crunch of boots he dodged around a corner as two guards strolled by the men had their weapons slung on their shoulders and they were laughing at some shared joke never suspecting that an intruder lurked in their midst after the guards had passed austin made his way to the harbor a pier that was long enough to accommodate large ships extended from the rocky shoreline tied up to the dock was the patrol boat that had intercepted him earlier there was no sign of the helicopter the tops of hundreds of fish cages were visible along the harbors edge men in open boats were tending the fish cages under a cloud of noisy gulls more guards lolled on the dock idly watching the action austin checked his watch he had to leave right away if he ex pected to get back to the mermaids gate before the end of slack cur rent he circled around the complex and came upon a building similar to the others except that it was set off by itself warning signs were posted on the outside he bypassed a main door and found a sec ondary entrance on the other side unlike the doors to the other fish nurseries this one was locked using the pry bar austin sprung the lock as quietly as possible and pushed the door open in the dim interior light he saw that the tanks were twice the size of those hed seen earlier and there were half as many something about the place bothered him but he couldnt put his finger on it for the first time since hed begun his explorations his skin began to crawl he wasnt alone in the building a single guard was strolling around the perimeter of the tanks he timed the guard waited until he was at the far end of his patrol then set the pry bar down climbed a ladder up the side of the nearest tank and peered over the edge the smell offish was even stronger than the odor emanating from the smaller tanks in the other buildings he leaned over and heard the soft swish of swirling water the tank was occupied he pointed the flashlight to see what was inside and the water exploded there was a blurry flash of white and a gaping mouth lined with sharp teeth austin jerked back in reflex something wet and slimy grazed his head he lost his hold and fell off the ladder his flailing hands grabbed a section of plastic hose breaking it and he crashed to the concrete floor water poured from the broken hose he scrambled to his feet and through dazed eyes he saw a red light flashing above the tank he swore to himself the systems failure had set off an alarm the guard had heard the ruckus and was running his way austin ducked into a space between two tanks nearly tripping on a stack of metal pipe the guard ran past austin and stopped when he saw the gushing water austin picked up a short length of metal pipe and stepped out behind the guard the man must have sensed austins presence he halfturned and went to unsling his rifle but the pipe came down on his head and he crumpled to the floor with the immediate threat disposed of austins first instinct was to cut and run but he decided to create a diversion first wielding the pipe as a sledgehammer he methodically smashed several plastic pipe assemblies red alarm lights blinked over several tanks now and water from the damaged pipes poured onto the floor and created a river austin splashed through the puddles toward the door the rush of water had drowned out other sounds and he didnt hear the pounding footsteps of a second man they met at an intersection be tween two lines of tanks almost crashing into each other like a cou ple of circus clowns the comic aspect was intensified when they both slipped and went down but austin had no reason to laugh when the man sprang to his feet and yanked a pistol from a holster at his belt austin swung the pipe as he rose to a standing position and the pistol went flying the mans eyes widened with surprise at austins quickness he reached under the shirt of his black uniform and pulled out a knife with a long blade made from a hard white mate rial he stepped back taking up a defensive position in that second instant austin had a chance to study his opponent the man was about a head shorter than austin his head seemed to sit directly on muscular shoulders that hinted at the power in the squat body like the guards he had a wide round face with bangs and almondshaped eyes that were as black and hard as obsidian vertical tattoos decorated his high cheekbones beneath the flat nose were wide fleshy lips he spread that mouth in a toothy smile but there was no mirth in it only cruelty austin was in no mood for a smiling contest time was not on his side more guards could show up at any second he couldnt retreat he had to dispatch this obstacle and pray there werent others his hands tightened on the pipe his eyes must have given away his in tentions because the man lunged without warning he moved with scorpionspeed despite his thickset body austin felt a stinging pain on the left side of his rib cage he had been holding the pipe like a louisville slugger and the knife had slipped inside his guard austin felt a wetness where the blade had sliced through his sweater and shirt the mans smile grew wider and the bloodtipped knife was poised for another slashing attack he feinted to his left austin re acted with pure reflex and swung the pipe as if he were hitting a home run there was a sickening scrunch sound as the pipe con nected with the mans nose crushing bone and cartilage blood sprayed as if from a fountain austin couldnt believe it after a blow that would have felled a steer the man was still on his feet a dazed look came into the mans eyes and a second later the knife fell from his limp fingers and he collapsed to the floor austin began sprinting for the exit but he heard shouts and ducked behind a fish tank several guards burst through the door and ran to ward the blinking red lights austin stuck his head out and heard ex cited voices coming from the direction of the harbor he stepped out into the open sprinted around the side of the building and returned to the main complex offish nurseries with most of the attention fo cused on the damage he had left behind him austin was able to make his way to the fishfood warehouse austin was relieved to see that the warehouse was still deserted soon he could lose himself in the labyrinth of caves he had his hand tight against his chest but he couldnt stanch the bleeding completely even worse he was leaving a trail of blood droplets a siren wailed in the distance he was trotting past the forklift when a thought struck him he was making it too easy for these guys he slid into the forklift seat started the motor aimed the tines at a tall stack of food cartons and nailed the accelerator the vehicle lurched forward and smashed into the boxes with enough force to topple them the boxes crashed onto the conveyor belt and blocked the opening he knocked over a couple more piles in front of the ac cess and freight doors as a finishing touch he jammed a tine into the control box for the conveyor belt moments later he was hurrying through the caverns he paused in the main picture gallery and listened he could hear yells over his own heavy breathing an even worse sound was the barking of dogs his crude barricade had been breached he continued at a measured trot following the bobbing bullseye of the flashlight in his haste he mistook one fish marker for another and lost precious moments finding his way back the shouts and barks were louder now and he could see the phantasmagoric glow of lights behind him the caves amplified and echoed the voices creating the impression that a whole army was after him the stutter of an automatic weapon echoed throughout the caves austin dove for the floor and a hail of bullets splattered harmlessly against the walls he tried to ignore the searing pain of his chest wound and scrambled to his feet another fusillade raked the pas sageway but by then he was around a curve and the angled wall pro tected him seconds later he was squeezing through the last narrow passageway then he was out and climbing down the natural staircase to the boat when he tried to start the engine it coughed he reached down into the cold water with his right hand cleaned the seaweed that had tangled the propeller and tried the starter again this time the motor responded as he pulled away and pointed the boat toward the canal that would take him back to the mermaids gate two blackclad fig ures climbed down to the edge of the pool the beams from their flashlights caught him but they also illuminated the canal opening austin aimed for the cleft and slammed against the sides of the canal tearing off hunks of wood he saw gray daylight ahead and then the boat burst into the mermaids gate he snapped the wheel over the boat made a sharp right turn toward the opening but the slack current was ending and the devilish confluence of tides and cur rents had returned the boat slid sideways down the side of a wave and headed for a woodsplintering collision with the far wall only to be saved when another billow pitched it back toward the canal opening austin gunned the throttle trying to gain control the boat skid ded as if it were riding on banana peels he gave the wheel a quick jerk to avoid crashing into a jagged outcropping that would have sliced the boat in two the propeller tinged against an underwater ledge he brought the boat around again but the waves caught him in another game offrisbee toss the doubleender lost headway and was pushed backward into the grotto austin gauged the ebb and flow of the circulating water and in desperation aimed for a v that marked a calmer area between currents as the boat fishtailed toward the opening austin saw that he had company his pursuers had made their way along the ledges that bordered the canal they stood on the rocks only yards away from where he was about to pass one of the men aimed his rifle at austin who was an easy target but his companion pushed the barrel down he undipped a hand grenade from his belt tossed it lightly in the air a few times like a baseball pitcher warming up then as austin passed the man pulled the pin holding down on the lever austins eyes glanced from the grenade and into the merciless face of the man who had stabbed him his nose was a bloody pulp and streams of blood had caked on his cheeks he must have been in terrible pain but the face broadened into a wide grin as he leisurely lofted the grenade into austins boat then he and the other man ducked behind an outcropping of rocks and covered their ears the arcing grenade clunked into the boat landing practically at austins feet austin wrung the last bit of torque out of the engine the boat planed at a sharp angle and the grenade rolled down the deck until it lodged against the narrow transom the boat burst through the arch into the open water choosing be tween the devil and the deep blue sea austin instinctively chose the latter a part of his brain made the choice between being blown to bits instantaneously and freezing to death in a few minutes he launched his body off the boat he plunged into the frigid water and a second later heard the muffled thud of the grenade then the fuel tanks erupted in a sec ondary explosion austin stayed under as long as he could and sur faced under a rainfall of wood splinters the boat was gone and he dove again to avoid the burning fuel that floated on the waters sur face when he came up a second time he was numb with cold but the survival instinct burned in his chest he started to swim in the di rection of land but he had taken only a few more strokes before his joints felt as if someone had poured liquid oxygen into them over the wavetops he caught a blurred glimpse of a boat speed ing his way his pursuers were no doubt coming to finish off the job a gurgled laugh escaped from his throat by the time they ar rived hed be nothing but a giant slurpee seconds before he slipped below the surface however austins oneway trip to davey joness locker was cut short a hand reached over the side of the launch and grabbed him by the hair his teeth clacked like a pair of castanets and his scalp felt as if it were being pulled out by the roots then other hands were grabbing him by the armpits and collar and he was hauled from the sea sputter ing and coughing like a kitten in a well his legs were still dangling in the water when the motor launch took off and raced over the waves with a roar of jet propulsion en gines its bow high in the air through blurred vision austin saw to his surprise that they were swinging alongside the blue yacht semiconscious he was passed up to the deck and carried to what must be the sick bay where he was relieved of his soggy clothes wrapped in warm towels and examined by a frowning man with a stethoscope then he was thrust into a sauna where eventually he could move his fingers and toes he was examined a second time and given a blue fleece sweat suit to wear apparently he was going to live his transition from neardeath to nearlife was accomplished under the watchful eye of two men built like professional wrestlers who spoke to each other in spanish the same guard dogs escorted him as he walked on rubber legs to a luxurious stateroom they set tled him into a comfortable reclining chair covered him with a soft blanket and left him to rest austin fell into an exhausted sleep when he awakened he saw that he was under scrutiny by a pair of dark eyes a man sat in an armchair watching him from a few feet away as if he were a speci men on a lab slide the man grinned when he saw austins eyelids flutter good youre awake he said his voice was deep and resonant and he spoke american english with only a hint of an accent the man reached over to a side table for a silverplated flask and poured austin a drink with shaking fingers austin swirled the greenishyellow amber liquor around in the bottom of the brandy snifter breathed in the heavy fumes and took a deep sip the fiery herbal liquor trickled down his throat and its warmth spread throughout his body austin glanced at the flask this tastes too good to be antifreeze but the effect is the same the man chuckled and took a swig from the flask green izarra is one hundred proof he said wiping his mouth with the back of his hand its usually served in glasses hardly bigger than your thumb i thought a little extra might be of benefit in your case how is your wound austins hand reached down and touched his ribs he could feel the stiffness of a bandage under his shirt but there was no pain even when he pressed with his fingers he remembered the flash of white as the ivory knife slashed his flesh how bad was it another halfinch deeper and we would have been burying you at sea the grim assessment was accompanied by a grin it feels okay my ships doctor is an expert in treating trauma he sewed you up and froze the wound austin glanced around at his surroundings his memories return ing ships doctor this is the blue yacht isnt it thats right my name is balthazar aguirrez this is my boat with his barrel chest and large hands aguirrez looked more like a longshoreman than the owner of a yacht that was probably worth several million dollars he had a broad forehead and thick black eye brows over a strong nose a wide mouth that curved upward in a natural grin and a chin like a granite ledge his eyes were the purple black of ripe olives he wore a lightblue sweat suit identical to the one on loan to austin a black beret was perched at a jaunty angle on his thick pepperandsalt hair pleased to meet you mr aguirrez my name is kurt austin thanks for your hospitality aguirrez extended his hand in a bonecrunching grip think nothing of it mr austin we like to entertain guests his dark eyes danced with amusement most arrive on board in a more conventional manner however may i pour you another izarra austin waved it off he wanted to keep a clear head perhaps after you have some food are you hungry austin had worked up an appetite since the bread and cheese hed eaten for brunch yes now that you mention it i wouldnt mind a sandwich i would be a poor host if i could not do better than a sandwich if you feel well enough id like you to join me for a light meal in the salon austin levered himself out of the chair and stood somewhat shak ily ill be fine aguirrez said splendid ill give you a few minutes come when youre ready he rose and left the cabin austin stared at the closed door and shook his head his brain still felt waterlogged he was weak from blood loss he went into the bathroom and looked in the mirror he looked like a commercial for ghoul makeup not sur prising after being stabbed shot at and blown out of the water he washed his face with cold then hot water noticing an electric shaver he removed the stubble on his chin when he stepped back into the stateroom he saw he had company the toughfaced stewards who had escorted him earlier were wait ing one opened the door and led the way while the other man took up the rear the walk gave austin ample opportunity to exercise and he felt his legs grow stronger with every step they came to the main deck salon and one of the men motioned for austin to enter then he and the other man left him alone austin stepped into the salon and raised his eyebrows he had been on dozens of yachts and had found the decor to be similar chrome and leather and clean contemporary lines were the norm but the navarras salon resembled the interior of a southern european farmhouse the eggshellwhite walls and ceiling were of stucco inlaid with roughhewn beams and the floor was a red tile a fire was crackling in a large stone fireplace that had been built into one wall over the mantle was a painting of men playing a game austin recognized as jai alai he went up to a stilllife painting of assorted fruit and was examining the signature when a deep voice said interested in art mr austin aguirrez had come up from behind without making a sound austin said i collect dueling pistols which i think of as a form of art without question deadly art is still art i picked up that cezanne for my little collection last year the other pieces i found at auction or acquired from private sources austin strolled past the gauguins a degas manets and monets the little collection was more extensive than that found in many museums he moved to another wall that was covered with large photographs these are originals too a few of my holdings aguirrez said with a shrug ship building yards steel mills and so forth he sounded like a jaded waiter rattling off items on a menu but enough of business he took austin by the arm dinner is ready he led the way through sliding doors into an elegant dining room at the center of the room was an oval mahogany table set for twelve aguirrez removed his beret and with a snap of his wrist and great accuracy flung it to a chair across the room he gestured grandly to ward the two opposite chairs at one end of the table as the two men took their seats a waiter appeared from nowhere and poured their tall goblets full of wine i think you will like this sturdy spanish rioja aguirrez said he raised his glass to art to the master and crew of the navarra youre very gracious aguirrez said with obvious approval ah good he said his eyes lighting up i see that our feast is about to begin there were no appetizers and they dug right into the main course a hearty bean pepper and porkrib dish served with cabbage austin complimented the chef and asked what the dish was this is called alubias de tolosa aguirrez said downing his food with gusto we basques treat it with an almost mystical reverence basque of course navarra is a basque province then theres the jai alai painting and the black beret im impressed mr austin you seem to know a great deal about my people anyone interested in the sea knows that the basques were the greatest explorers sailors and shipbuilders in the world aguirrez clapped his hands bravo he refilled austins wine glass and leaned forward tell me what is your interest in the sea he maintained his ferocious grin but pinioned austin with a pene trating gaze austin admired the way aguirrez had subtly managed the con versational shift until he knew his host better and learned why the blue yacht was hanging out near the oceanus fish farm austin planned to play his cards close to his vest im a salvage specialist he said ive been working on a project in the faroes i came to skaalshavn to do some fishing aguirrez sat back and roared with laughter excuse my bad man ners he said with tears in his eyes but it was my men who fished you from the sea austins mouth widened in a sheepish grin a cold swim wasnt in my plans aguirrez became serious again from what we saw there was an explosion on your boat the ventilation for the engine compartment was insufficient and gasoline vapors collected it happens sometimes with inboards austin said aguirrez nodded strange in my experience explosions of that type usually happen when a boat has been sitting at the dock and your wound undoubtedly was caused by flying metal undoubtedly austin said with a poker face knowing full well that the ships doctor would have seen that there were no burn marks on his skin and his wound was too neat to be from a jagged hunk of metal austin didnt know why aguirrez was playing verbal cat andmouse but he went along with the game i was lucky you were nearby nodding soberly aguirrez said we watched your earlier en counter with the patrol boat and saw you head along the coast when we rounded the point later you had vanished not long after that you burst from that sea cave like a man shot from a cannon he clapped his big hands together boom your boat was in pieces and you were in the water that about sums it up austin said with a faint smile after offering austin a short thick cigar which he refused aguir rez lit up a dark stogie that smelled like a toxic waste site so my friend he said blowing smoke through his nostrils did you get into the caves caves austin feigned innocence for gods sakes man thats why im here to find the caves surely you must have wondered what my boat is doing in this god forsaken place it had occurred to me then allow me to explain i have done very well with my busi nesses an understatement youre very fortunate congratulations thank you my wealth gives me the means and the time to do whatever i like some men choose to spend their fortune on beauti ful young women i choose to be an amateur archaeologist ambitious hobbies in either case i still enjoy the company of beautiful women especially if they are intelligent but with me the past is more than a hobby he looked as if he were about to spring from his chair it is my passion as you said earlier the basques were great men of the sea they pioneered the cod and whale fisheries off north america decades before columbus an ancestor of mine diego aguirrez profited from this trade he would be proud to see his descendant has carried on his legacy youre more than kind mr austin he was a man of great courage and unyielding principle qualities that got him in trouble with the spanish inquisition he angered one of the more ruthless inquisitors then he was executed aguirrez smiled he was resourceful as well diego saw his wife and children to safety i am a direct descendant of his eldest son family tradition says he escaped in one of his ships but his fate is a mystery the sea is full of unsolved puzzles aguirrez nodded nevertheless he left tantalizing clues that show he intended to put himself far beyond the reach of the inqui sition the traditional north american route for the basques in cluded a stopover here in the faroes so i began to explore that link you know the origins of the name skaalshavn ive been told it means skull harbor aguirrez smiled and rose from the table to extract an ornately carved wooden box from a cabinet he unlatched the top and pulled out a skull cradling it in one hand like hamlet contemplating yorick this is from one of those caves ive had it looked at by ex perts it has distinct basque characteristics he tossed the skull to austin as if it were a ball probably hoping to shock him austin caught the skull neatly and spun it in his hand like a ge ographer studying a globe of the world maybe its your ancestor diego he tossed the skull back i wondered the same thing and had it tested for dna this gen tleman and i are not related im sad to say aguirrez put the skull back into the box and rejoined austin at the table this is my sec ond visit here the first time i expected that the caves would be ac cessible from land i was dismayed to learn that the harbor and cave area had been purchased for use as a fish farm i located a man who had worked in demolition when the farm was set up he said that when the owners were blasting out rock to create storage space they broke through to the caves i tried to persuade the owners to let me conduct archaeological explorations but they refused i pulled every string i could think of but even with my connections oceanus wouldnt budge so i came back for another look youre very persistent this has become a quest which is why im interested in your ad venture i suspected the natural arch might provide entry into the caves but the waters around them were too dangerous for our launches apparently you found a way to get in dumb luck austin said briefly aguirrez chuckled i think it was more than luck please tell me what you saw i will bribe you with more wine he snapped his fingers the waiter brought a new bottle opened it and refilled their glasses no bribe is necessary austin said consider it partial repay ment for your hospitality and the fine meal he sipped from his glass enjoying the buildup of suspense youre right there is a way into the caves through the arch the locals call it the mer maids gate the cave network is quite extensive i only saw part of it austin went into detail about the cave art saying nothing about his side trip into the fish farm aguirrez hung on every word similar paleolithic paintings dating back twelve thousand years have been found on the walls of caves in basque country he mur mured at one point the other drawings indicate that an advanced civilization must have used the caves that was my impression supposedly the faroes were uninhab ited before the irish monks and the vikings settled here maybe the historians were wrong i wouldnt be surprised the scholars have no idea where my people came from our language has no antecedents in europe or asia basques have the highest percentage ofrhnegative blood type in the world leading some to speculate that we go directly back to cromagnon man he banged his fist lightly on the table id give anything to get into those caves you saw the warm reception i got you seem to have stirred up a hornets nest while you slept the patrol boats came out from shore and demanded permission to come aboard we refused of course the boat i saw had a couple of men with automatic rifles aguirrez waved toward the art hanging on the wall when they saw that my men outgunned and outnumbered them they quickly left they had a helicopter too it was armed with rockets oh yes that he said as if he were talking about a pesky gnat i had my men brandish their handheld surfacetoair missiles and the helicopter stopped bothering us missiles and automatic weapons the navarra was armed like a warship aguirrez read austins mind wealthy men can be a target for kidnappers the navarra would be fair game for pirates so i have made sure it is not exactly toothless of necessity i have surrounded myself with loyal and wellarmed men why do you suppose oceanus is so prickly about people poking into its business austin said were talking about a fish farm not diamond mines i asked myself the same question aguirrez said with a shrug one of the men who had kept watch over austin came into the dining room he handed aguirrez a plastic bag and whispered into his ear aguirrez nodded and said thank you for being so forthcoming about your visit to the caves mr austin is there anything more i can do for you i wouldnt mind a lift back to the village done my man has informed me that we are passing the sea stack and should be anchoring in a few minutes he handed the plastic bag over your clothes and personal effects have been drying out austin was ushered back to his cabin so he could change the bag also held his wallet which contained his numa photo id card prominently displayed in its plastic window aguirrez was a cool one he would have known that austins story about being in ma rine salvage was made out of whole cloth yet hed never let on in side the bag was a business card with his hosts name and a telephone number austin tucked the card into his wallet aguirrez was waiting on deck to say goodbye i appreciate your hospitality austin said shaking hands with his host i hope im not being rude having to eat and run not at all aguirrez said with an enigmatic smile i wouldnt be surprised if our paths crossed again stranger things have happened austin said with a grin moments later austin was in the launch heading across the quiet harbor two thousand feet above skaalshavn harbor the bell jet ranger helicopter that had been tracking the yacht along the coast came to a hover and focused its wescam high resolution surveillance camera on the launch making its way to shore the man in the pilots seat stared at a video monitor watching as a lone passenger disembarked from the boat the helicopter pilot had a pieshaped face with high cheekbones marked with vertical tattoo lines his coalblack hair was cut in bangs over his low forehead characteristics that might lead a casual ob server to take him for a native of the northern tundra but the fea tures normally associated with the eskimo were distorted in place of a pleasant smile was a cruel leering expression eyes that should have twinkled with innocent good humor were as hard as black di amonds the brownishred skin was pockmarked as if the corrup tion within had seeped through the pores the hastily applied band age taped across the mans crushed nose intensified the grotesque image we have the target in view he said with a nasal snarl speaking in an ancient language that had its origins under the aurora borealis the electronic signal from the camera which was housed in a pod beneath the cockpit was converted into microwaves and transmitted instantaneously to the other side of the globe to a darkened room where palegray eyes watched the same picture seen from the heli copter i can see him quite clearly the grayeyed man said his silky voice was quiet and cultured but it had the sullen menace of a rattle snake who is this person who violated our security so easily his name is kurt austin a pause the same austin who rescued the danish sailors from their sunken ship yes great toonook he is a marine engineer with the national underwater and marine agency are you certain a mere engineer wouldnt have been so bold or resourceful as to penetrate our facility and why would numa be interested in our operation i dont know but our watcher has verified his identity and the yacht that picked him up and drove off your men is it a numa vessel as far as we know it is private of spanish registry were check ing on the ownership through our sources in madrid see that it is done speedily what is the latest damage report at our facility one guard dead we were able to repair the damaged pipes and save the prime specimens the guard deserved to die for being careless i want the speci mens moved to canada immediately our experiments are too vital to be jeopardized yes great toonook an idiot can see what has happened mr austin has somehow drawn a connection between oceanus and the collision we so con veniently arranged thats impossible the evidence is in front of your eyes umealiq dont argue with it you must deal with the situation the pilot tightened his grip on the controls ready to send the hel icopter swooping down like an eagle the cruel eyes watching the monitor screen followed the figure making its way from the fish pier to the parked car within seconds he could launch his rockets or spray the target with fleshshredding machinegun fire and obliterate the life of a bothersome man the thin lips widened in a cruel smile should we kill austin while we have him in our sights do i detect a yearning to avenge the damage to your precious nose the voice had a mocking tone to it without waiting for an answer he said i should kill him for the trouble he has caused me had he allowed the danish sailors to die the revulsion of the world would be directed at sos and the attention of the press diverted away from oceanus i will do it now aw dont be impatient we must not attract any more attention to his demise than necessary he is staying at an isolated cottage it would be the perfect place we could drop his body off a cliff thenjw to it but make it look like an accident austin must not be allowed to broadcast his findings to the world our plans are at a critical stage i will return to the base and organize our men i will see that austin enjoys a lingering death that he experiences fear and pain as the life drains from his body that no have someone else do it i have other plans for you you must leave for canada immediately to make sure the specimens get there safely then you are to go to washington and eliminate that senator who opposes our legislation i have arranged cover for you and your men the pilot glanced with fierce longing at the monitor and touched the tender mush that was his nose as you wish he said with re luctance his hands played over the cyclic pitch control and a moment later the hovering helicopter darted off in the direction of the old harbor unaware how close he had come to a violent end austin sat behind the steering wheel of professor jorgensens volvo contemplating his next move he was wary of the remote location of the cottage he gazed at the warm lights of the town then grabbed his duffel and left the car he walked into the village without encountering a soul and went up to the house behind the church pia beamed when she opened the door at his knock and invited him inside the exertions of the day must have been apparent in his face when he stepped into the light her smile disappeared are you all right she said with concern in her voice nothing a glass ofalamt couldnt help clucking like a mother hen she ushered him to the kitchen table poured him a tall glass ofafavit then watched as he drank well she said finally did you catch many fish no but i went to visit the mermaids pia let out a whooping laugh clapped her hands and poured him a couple more fingers of liquor i lew it she said with excitement in her voice and were the caves as wonderful as my father said she listened like a child as austin described his entry through the mermaids gate at slack tide and his journey into the cave network he told her that he would have stayed longer but men with guns chased him away cursing impressively in faroese she said you cant go back to the cottage tonight gunnar says he doesnt work for those people but i think he does i was wondering the same thing i left the car at the fish pier maybe i should leave town god no youll drive off the road into the sea no you will stay here tonight and leave early tomorrow are you sure you want a gentleman staying the night people will talk austin said with a broad smile she grinned back eyes sparkling with childlike mischief i hope so shortly before dawn austin awakened and got up from the sofa pia heard him stir and rose to make him a breakfast she cooked an industrialsized potato omelet with smoked fish and pastry on the side then she packed him a lunch of cold cuts cheese and apple and sent him on his way first eliciting a promise to return the town was coming alive as he made his way in the damp morn ing air to the fish pier a couple of fishermen on their way to work waved at him from their trucks as he was opening the car door the keys slipped from his fingers as he waved backand when he bent to pick them up his nostrils picked up a chemical smell and he de tected a soft splatsplat sound he got down on his knees and peered under the car where the odor was even stronger fluid dripped where the brake hoses had been cleanly cut austin grunted to him self softly then he went over to the fish pier and asked around for a aood mechanic the harbormaster said he would call and before long a lanky middleaged man showed up after inspecting the damage the mechanic stood and handed austin a section of the hose somebody dont like you no chance it was an accident the taciturn faroese pointed to where the road out of town skirted a cliff and he shook his head i figure youd be flying with the birds up there on the first curve no problem to fix though the mechanic repaired the brakes in short order when austin went to pay him he waved away the money thats okay youre a friend ofpias austin said the people who did this might know i was at pias i wonder if i should talk to the police no such thing here dont worry the whole town will keep close watch on her austin thanked him again and minutes later he was driving out of town as he surveyed the sea stack in his rear view mirror he men tally ticked off the events of his short stay in skaalshavn he was leav ing town with more questions than answers look on the bright side he told himself with a grin he had made some terrific new friends paul trout stepped onto the deck of neals wooden hulled trawler and appraised the boat with an expert eye what he found surprised him neal was a charming conniver and a drunk but he was a nononsense fisherman who took pride in his boat the signs offender care were everywhere woodwork gleamed with fresh paint the deck was scrubbed clean of oil stains rust was kept under control the pilothouse had the latest in fishfinding and naviga tional equipment when trout complimented neal on the condition of his boat the fisherman beamed like a father whod been told his firstborn was his spitting image soon he and neal were swapping sea stories at one point when neal was out of hearing gamay raised an eyebrow and said you and mike appear to be getting along swimmingly i sup pose youll be trading recipes before long hes an interesting guy look at this boat its as wellfound as anything ive ever been on glad to hear you say that numa now owns a piece of tiffany the ransom to spring the trawler from the boatyard had been closer to a thousand dollars than to seven hundred fifty after a quick fueltank fillup which gamay also paid for neal set the trawler on a course that would take it into the open sea fishin grounds not far neal yelled over the throb of the engine bout seven miles ten fathoms bottoms smooth as a babys behind prime for trawling be there shortly after a while neal checked his gps position cut the throttle to an idle and lowered the neta conical mesh bag around a hundred andfiftyfeet long designed to be dragged along the sea bottom the boat made two sets and caught lots of seaweed but no fish this is very strange trout said inspecting the cod end the nar row pouch at the end of the net where harvested fish are concen trated i can understand hauling in a poor catch but its highly unusual to bring in nothing not even trash fish the nets absolutely empty a knowing grin crossed neals face you may wish it stayed empty the net was lowered again pulled along the bottom and slowly winched back onto the boat a boom was used to hoist the cod end over the deck where any catch could be emptied out this time something was thrashing wildly in the net flashes of silverywhite scales were visible through the tangle of mesh as a large fish fiercely struggled to free itself neal yelled out a warning as he prepared to empty the contents of the net onto the deck stand way back folks weve got a live one the big fish landed on the deck with a squishy thud freed from the net it became even more ferocious in its exertions skittering across the deck as it arched and snapped its long body round eyes staring with an unfishlike malevolence mouth wide and snapping at air the creature slammed into the fish hold a raised box built into the deck far from slowing it down the impact seemed to make it angrier the convulsions became more violent and it scudded back across the slippery deck whahoo neal yelled quickly stepping out of the way of the biting jaws he lowered a gaff handle near the fishs head in a snap ping blur the fish bit the handle in two paul watched spellbound from the raised safety of a pile of net ting gamay had taken out a video camera and was busy filming thats the biggest salmon ive ever seen paul said the fish was about five feet long this is crazy gamay said holding the camera steady salmon dont act like this when theyre caught theyve got weak teeth that would break if they tried to do anything like that tell that to the damned fish neal said holding up the jagged end of the gaff handle he tossed it aside and grabbed a pitchfork speared the fish behind the gills and pinned it to the deck the fish continued to struggle neal produced an old louisville slugger and whacked the fish on the head it was stunned for a second then started snapping again although less violently sometimes you have to slam them a few more times before they quiet down neal explained moving with great caution he managed to loop a line around the tail then he fed the line into an overhanging pulley pulled the pitch fork out lifted the fish and swung it over the open fish hold still care ful to stay clear of the jaws when the fish was positioned over the hold he took a filleting knife and cut the line the fish fell into the hold where it could be heard banging against the sides that was the meanest fish ive ever seen paul said with a won dering shake of his head it behaved more like a barracuda than a salmon it looked like an atlantic salmon but im not sure what it was those strange white scales it was almost albino gamay shut off the camera and peered into the dimness of the fish hold listen its far too big and aggressive to be a normal fish its almost as if it were some sort of mutant she turned to neal when did you first start catching these things neal took the cigar stub from between his teeth and spit over the side first boats started bringing them up in the nets around six months ago the guys called them devilfish they tore the hell out of the nets but they were big so we cut them up and sent them off to market guess the meat was okay because nobody died he said with a smirk pretty soon thats all we were catching the smaller fish just disappeared he gestured to the fish hold with his cigar thats the reason why did you contact any fishery scientists and tell them what you were catching oh yeah we got in touch with the fisheries people they didnt send anyone down why not shortstaffed they said guess you got to look at it their way youre a marine biologist would you move out of your lab if some one called and said big ol devilfish was eating your stock yes i would have been here in a minute youre different from the others they wanted us to ship one of these babies up for them to look at why didnt you do it we were going to but after what happened to charlie marstons the fishermen got scared and said to hell with it and moved on who was charlie marstons paul said charlie was an oldtimer fished these waters for years even after it got hard for him to get around because of a bad leg he was a stub born old coot though and liked to go out alone they found him or what was left of himcoupla miles east of here from the looks of it he caught a bunch of these lunkers got too close and maybe his bum leg gave out hardly enough left to bury youre saying the fish killed him no other explanation thats when the boys started leaving i would have gone with them if i had my boat funny he said with a grin one of those babies is my ticket out of here gamay was already thinking ahead i want to bring it back to the lab for analysis suits me fine neal said well box it up as soon as its safe he pointed the tiffany back to land by the time they pulled up to the dock the fish was practically dead but it managed a few spas modic snaps enough to warrant keeping it on board awhile longer neal recommended a boarding house where they could stay the night gamay gave him a hundreddollar bonus and they agreed to meet the next morning a pleasant middleaged couple warmly welcomed them at the board ing house a victorian structure at the edge of town from the en thusiasm with which they were greeted paul and gamay figured that the b and b didnt get much business the room was cheap and clean and the couple cooked them a hearty dinner they had a good nights sleep and the next morning after a huge breakfast they set out to find neal and reclaim their fish the pier was deserted more worrisome there was no sign of neal or the tiffany they asked at the boatyard but nobody had seen him since the day before when hed paid for his engine work a few men were idling around the waterfront because they had nothing better to do no one had seen neal that morning the bartender theyd met the day before strolled by on his way to open up the restaurant they asked if he had any idea where neal might be probably nursing a hangover about now the bartender said he came in last night with a hundred bucks used most of it up buy ing drinks for himself and the regulars he was pretty tanked when he left hes done it before so i didnt worry about him neal navi gates better drunk than some men sober he took off around eleven and that was the last i saw of him hes been living on his boat even when the boatyard had it any idea why the tiffany isnt here paul asked the bartender scanned the harbor and swore under his breath damned idiot he was in no shape to run a boat would any of the other people who were in the bar know where he is naw they were even drunker than he was only one not drink ing was fred grogan and he left before mike trouts analytical ear was listening for inconsistencies who is grogan paul asked nobody youd want to know the bartender said with contempt lives in the woods near the old plant hes the only local guy the new owners kept on when they bought in pretty surprising because fred is such a shady character he pretty much keeps to himself sometimes he sneaks into town driving one of the big black suvs you see around the plant the bartender paused and looked across the water shading his eyes a small boat had entered the harbor and was moving toward the pier at great speed thats fitzy coming in hes the lighthouse keeper looks like hes in a big hurry the outboardpowered skiff skidded up to the dock and the whitebearded man in the boat tossed a line ashore he was clearly excited and didnt even wait to climb out of the boat before he started to babble almost incoherently calm down fitzy the bartender said cant understand a word the bearded man caught his breath and said i heard a big boom late last night rattled my windows figured it might be a jet flying real low went out this morning to take a look pieces of wood all over the place look at this he whipped back a tarpaulin pulled out a jagged plank and held it over his head the painted letters tif were clearly visible the bartenders lips tightened he went into his bar and called the police while he waited for the law to arrive he made several more phone calls pickup trucks began to arrive and a motley fleet of search boats was organized with fitzy in the lead the flotilla had already set out when the police chief arrived the chief talked to the bartender and got his story by then some of the boats were return ing they had more scraps of wood that identified the boat but no sign ofneal the sheriff put in a call to the coast guard which said it would send in a helicopter but the consensus seemed to be that neal had gotten drunk decided to go for a joyride and probably hit a rock near the point and sank the trouts did not comment on the explanation but as they drove back to the rooming house their conversation dwelt on more sinister possibilities gamay put it bluntly i think mike was murdered guess i wasnt the only one who saw the charring around the wood id guess his boat was set on fire or simply blown up neals bragging about the fish he caught could have got him killed is that what it is all about gamay said her eyes flashing with anger neal was killed over a fish maybe she shook her head poor guy i cant help thinking that were somehow responsible the only ones responsible are the guys who killed him and im betting that oceanus had a big hand in this if youre right they may come after us next then id suggest that we pack our gear and get out of town paul pulled the rental car in front of the guest house and they went inside paid their bill and grabbed their bags the owners were obviously sorry to see them go and followed them out to the car as they chattered on about how it was a shame that they were leaving gamay tugged pauls sleeve and steered him to the drivers side she got in and waved farewell sorry to spoil our sendoff party while we were talking i saw a black tahoe pass by looks like the wolves are gathering paul said he turned onto the road that would take them out of town and glanced in the mir ror no one on our tail except for a few vehicles they saw little traffic and once they had gone beyond the towns outskirts the road was empty the twolane road wound through thick pine woods gradually ascending so they were driving high above the sea on one side of the road was forest and on the other a sheer dropoff for hundreds of feet they were about two miles from the village when gamay turned to look at the road behind them and said uhoh paul glanced in the rearview mirror and saw a black tahoe bear ing down on them they must have been waiting down a side road for us to pass gamay tightened her seat belt okay then show them what you can do paul gave her an incredulous look you realize we are driving a sixcylinder family sedan that is probably half the size and weight of that black behemoth behind us damnit paul dont be so analytical youre a crazy massachusetts driver just put the pedal to the metal trout rolled his eyes yes maam he said he punched the gas pedal with his foot the car accelerated to a respectable eighty miles per hour easily matching their speed the tahoe continued to gain paul managed to wring another ten miles per hour out of the engine but the suv moved closer the road began to go into a series of curves that matched the con tour of the coastal hills the rental vehicle was no sports car but it held the road better on the turns than the big suv which leaned heavily as the curves became sharper trout had to hit the brakes to keep from going off the road but the suv was even less maneuver able slowed by the serpentine curves the suv lost ground trout curbed his elation he kept his eyes glued to the road hands firmly gripping the steering wheel pushing his car to just under the speed at which it could go out of control and overshoot a curve he knew that one lapsea patch of sandy highway an errant boulder or an error of judgmentcould get them both killed in a fiery crash gamay kept tabs on their pursuer and maintained a running com mentary the cars wheels squealed with each change in direction trout held it steady he was running between sixty and seventy miles per hour and was heading down a long gradual slope in the road when an unbelievable sight met his eyes ahead of them a black tahoe had pulled out onto the road from behind a huge boulder for a second he thought the suv behind him had used a shortcut then gamay shouted there are two suvs theyre trying to sandwich us in the vehicle in front of the trouts car slowed to block the road and the other suv quickly caught up from behind trout tried to go around but each time he poked the rental cars nose into the on coming lane the suv pulled in front of him he touched the brakes to avoid a rearend collision the following suv crashed into his rear bumper crushing it into the trunk and sending the car into a neck jolting wild fishtail paul fought the wheel and managed to keep the car from going into a spin the tahoe slammed into the car again the smell of gas from a ruptured tank filled the car the tahoe made another lunge but this time gamay saw it coming and yelled right trout spun the wheel to the right and the tahoe only clipped the bumper gamay glanced at the suvs which had pulled away theyre holding back for some reason that wont last paul said then wed better do something soon the rental agency is going to wonder why their car is only two feet long damn hes coming in again left trout jerked the wheel the car moved into the passing lane and trout saw something that made his hair stand up on edge the road curved sharply to the right the tahoes could keep them boxed in until the last minute the suv in front would screen the curve from view then it would slow to make the turn and the one behind would knock them off the cliff like a cue stick tapping a billiard ball paul yelled at gamay to hold tight and he gripped the wheel even tighter with his sweaty palms he tried to remove all thought from his mind relying only on instinct keeping sharp watch in the rearview mirror timing would be crucial the vehicle on their tail began to accelerate trout made his move when the suv came within a few feet of the cars bumper he jerked the wheel to the right the car hit the soft sandy berm along the side of the road and drove up on the inclined shoulder like a race car on the angled track of a speedway it crashed through bushes and small trees wood shrieked against metal he saw a flash of black as the tahoe flew by him on the left then came a horrendous screech of brakes and a crash the suv that had been on his tail had slammed into the rear of the vehicle in front locking bumpers the lead vehicle tried to slow and turn but the weight of the attached suv made any turn impossible and they were locked together both vehicles shot off the cliff like projectiles from a slingshot and plunged hundreds of feet in a fiery tandem death trap trout was having his own problems the banking had followed the contour of the road and now it curved while the car maintained a straight trajectory he lost all control as the car was airborne cen trifugal force kept him pressed into the drivers door the car landed at an angle collapsing the wheels with a sound like a junkyard sym phony he tried to glance over at gamay but the airbags deployed and all he could see was exploding white plastic then only blackness welcome back to torshavn mr austin said the friendly desk clerk at the hotel hania your fishing trip up the coast went well i trust yes thanks i ran into some very unusual fish the efficient desk clerk handed austin an envelope along with his room key this came in earlier today austin opened the envelope and read the message neatly printed on hotel letterhead im in copenhagen staying at the palace dinner offer still good therri austin smiled as he thought of thems incredible eyes and her dulcet voice he must remember to play the lottery maybe the winds of good fortune were blowing in his direction on a clean sheet of sta tionery he wrote a reply tonight at the tivoli he folded the paper gave it to the desk clerk and asked him to send the message would you try to reserve a room for tonight at the palace hotel he said id be happy to mr austin ill ready your bill for checkout austin went up to his room where he took a shower and shaved the phone rang as he was toweling himself dry the desk clerk said that his room at the palace was all set and that he had taken the lib erty of canceling the previous reservation at an airport hotel austin packed his bag and called professor jorgensen the professor was in class so austin left a message saying he would like to see him later in the day if possible he said he would be en route to copenhagen and suggested that jorgensen leave a reply at the palace hotel front desk austin gave the desk clerk a generous tip then he caught the hel icopter shuttle from torshavn to vagar airport and took the at lantic airways flight to copenhagen later that day the airport taxi dropped him off at radhuspladen the citys main square he made his way past the statue of hans christian andersen and the spout ing dragon water fountains to the stately old palace hotel overlook ing the busy square two messages waited for him one was from therri tivoli it is see you at six the other note was from professor jorgensen saying he would be in his office all afternoon austin dropped his duffel bag off in his room and called the pro fessor to tell him he was on his way as austin was leaving the hotel it occurred to him that jeans and turtleneck were hardly appropri ate for a night out with a beautiful woman he stopped at a mens clothing shop in the concourse and with the help of a knowledgeable salesman quickly picked out what he wanted a hefty bribe to the salesman and tailor insured that the clothes would be ready for him at five the university of copenhagen campus was a short cab ride from the central square the marine biological laboratory was part of the zoological institute park lawns surrounded the twostory brick building the professors cubicle had exactly enough room to ac commodate a desk and computer and two chairs and a clutter limit that the professor had far exceeded graphs and charts covered the walls and folders were piled everywhere pardon the mess he apologized my main office is at the helsingor campus i use this closet when im teaching classes here he removed a pile of papers from a chair to make room for austin nonplussed at what to do with the mess he placed it precariously atop a teetering stack of other papers on his desk wonderful to see you again kurt he said with his bigtoothed grin im so glad you were able to make it to our beautiful city its always a pleasure to visit copenhagen unfortunately my flight back to the states leaves tomorrow so i only have one night here better than nothing at all jorgensen said settling into the cramped area behind his desk tell me did you ever hear anything further from that lovely woman the attorney who was having cof fee with you in torshavn therri weld as a matter of fact im having dinner with her tonight lucky man im sure shell be a more enjoyable companion than i was jorgensen said with a chuckle well did you enjoy skaal shavn enjoy isnt the word for it skaalshavn is a surprising place thanks for letting me use your cottage and your boat my pleasure its incredible country isnt it austin nodded speaking of skaalshavn i was wondering how your lab tests turned out the professor rummaged through the mt everest of papers on his desk miraculously he found the file he was looking for he took his glasses off and replaced them i dont know if youre acquainted with my main areas of expertise i specialize in the effects ofhypoxia i study how oxygen deficiency and temperature change affect fish populations i dont claim to be an expert in every area so ive run my findings by various colleagues in bacterial viruses we have tested dozens of water samples and fish taken at various locations near the oceanus operation for signs of anomalies we wondered if there was a parasite nothing what about your original theory that there might be trace chem icals in the water no to the contrary the oceanus people werent exaggerating when they bragged their filtration system was stateoftheart the water is absolutely pure the other fish farms i tested produced waste from feed and so on in short i found nothing that would affect the skaalshavn stocks which begs the question what is decimating the fish popula tion jorgensen pushed his glasses up on his forehead there could be other reasons we havent touched predators habitat degradation a disruption of the food supply have you ruled out a link to the fish farm completely no i havent which is why im returning to skaalshavn to make more tests that might be a problem austin said in an understatement he proceeded to give the professor a condensed version of his ex ploration of the fish farm his narrow escape and rescue ill be glad to pay you for the loss of the boat he added the boat is the least of my concerns you could have been filled jorgensen was flabbergasted i ran into patrol boats when i was making my tests they looked intimidating but they never attacked or threatened me maybe they didnt like my face i fnow i didnt like theirs you may have noticed i am not exactly a movie star the profes sor said no one tried to kill me its possible that they knew your tests would come up negative in that case there was no reason to scare you off did you discuss your work with gunnar yes he was always there when i returned from my field tests and seemed very interested in what i was doing a light dawned in the professors eyes i see you think he was an informant for oceanus i dont know for certain but i was told that he worked for oceanus during the construction of the fish farm its certainly pos sible that he continued to be employed by the company after the plant was built jorgensen frowned have you mentioned this episode to the police not just yet technically speaking i was trespassing on private property but you dont try to fill somebody simply for being nosy that does seem like an overreaction however i cant see the faroe police department pushing the matter oceanus would deny that our little dustoff ever took place the way they reacted to a lit tle harmless snooping tells me they must have something to hide id like to poke around quietly and the police would simply stir things up as you wish i know little about intrigue my realm is science his brow wrinkled in thought that creature in the tank that scared the devil out of you you dont think it was a shark all i know is that it was big and hungry and as pale as a ghost a ghost fish interesting ill have to think about it in the mean time ill prepare for my return trip to the faroes are you sure you want to go it might be dangerous after my en counter this time im going in a research vessel besides safety in num bers it will provide access to a full range of research gear id love to bring along an archaeologist to research those caves not a great idea professor but theres someone in town who might be helpful in that area her father visited the caves and she told me how to gain entry her name is pia the ministers widow yes youve met her shes quite a woman ill say jorgensen said before catching himself the blush stain ing his cheeks told the whole story weve met a few times around the village shes impossible to avoid can you change your plans and return to skaalshavn with me austin shook his head thanks for the offer but ive got to get back to my duties at numa im leaving joe to wrap up the tests on the sea lamprey please keep me apprised of your findings i will of course jorgensen cradled his chin in his hand and a faraway look came to his eyes my scientific training abhors the whole idea of portents i am trained to draw no conclusion unless i have the facts to back it up theres something terribly wrong here kurt i can feel it in my bones something unholy if its any consolation ive had the same feeling it goes beyond a bunch of guys running around with guns he leaned forward with a level gaze in his bluegreen eyes id like you to promise me some thing when you go back to skaalshavn of course my boy anything you say take care professor austin said in a firm manner that left no room for misunderstanding tsike great care the sense of foreboding continued to haunt austin even after he stepped outside jorgensens office building into the bright danish sunlight several times during the cab ride back to the hotel he found himself glancing through the rear window he gave up finally and sat back to enjoy the ride if danger were stalk ing him he would never see it with all the traffic austin stopped at the clothing store to pick up his purchases he carried the neatly tied boxes to his room and called therri it was i have a room one floor below yours i think i can hear you singing in joyful anticipation of our dinner then you must have also heard me dancing as well its amazing how my charm affects women austin said ill meet you in the lobby we could make believe that were old lovers encountering each other by chance youre a surprising romantic mr austin ive been called worse things youll know me by the red carna tion in my lapel when the elevator doors opened therri stepped out as if she were on stage and immediately caught the attention of every male in the vicinity including austin he couldnt take his eyes off her as she glided across the lobby therris chestnut hair tumbled down to the thin straps other white anklelength lace dress that clung to her slim waist and thighs her warm smile showed that therri approved other date as well she surveyed the europeanstyled singlebreasted jacket of dove gray whose slightly pinched waist emphasized austins shoulders like a military uniform the blue shirt and white silk tie set off his deep tan coralcolored eyes and pale hair pinned to his lapel was a red carna tion she extended her hand which austin kissed lightly what a lovely surprise she said in an upperclass british accent i havent seen you since biarritz or was it casablanca therri put her wrist to her forehead oh who can say one place blends with the other over time dont you agree austin leaned close to her ear and whispered well always have marrakech then he hooked her arm in his and they strolled out the door as if they had known each other for ages they walked across the busy square toward tivoli the famed nineteenthcentury amusement park known for its rides and entertainment the lively park was ablaze with neon and filled with visitors taking in the theater dance and symphony music they stopped to watch a folkdance troupe for a few minutes therri suggested that they have dinner at a restaurant with an outdoor terrace and they were seated at a table that had a view of the ferris wheel austin picked up the menu since you chose the restaurant ill make the dinner selections if you dont mind not at all ive been subsisting onsmorrebrod sandwiches when the waiter came over austin ordered tiny fjord shrimps as an appetizer for the main course he ordered flaelesteg roast pork served with crackling and cabbage for himself and morbradbof small pork fillets in mushroom sauce for therri then for drinks he picked carlsberg pilsner beer rather than wine you placed that order rather deftly therri said admiringly i cheated i came to this same restaurant the last time i was in copenhagen on a numa assignment great minds as they say they toasted each other with their foamy glasses and sipped the cool crisp beer the shrimp came therri closed her eyes with pleas ure after the first bite this is wonderful the secret of cooking fish is to never let the flavoring drown out the subtle taste this is flavored with lime and spiced with fresh pepper one more thing to add to my thankyou list your good mood seems to go beyond the food your meeting with becker went well i take it your friend mr becker was actually quite charming he cant speak highly enough of you and was very impressed with the photos you took of the sea sentinel at my urging they checked out the sen tinel for themselves and found it had been sabotaged exactly as you described we came to terms they agreed to drop the charges against marcus congratulations no strings attached a whole ball of twine marcus and anyone associated with sos including yours truly must be out of denmark within the next forty eight hours were booked to fly home on the concorde tomorrow the concorde sos doesnt stint when it comes to travel does it she shrugged the people who contribute millions to sos dont seem to mind it as long as the oceans are protected ill try that line with the numa bean counters who keep an eye on the travel budget youll be having lunch at kinkaids while im dining on rubber chicken at thirtyfive thousand feet tell me what other conditions did becker impose no press conferences allowed on danish soil there can be no at tempts to salvage the sea sentinel and the only way we will ever step foot in denmark is if we smuggle ourselves in as guest workers again i cant thank you enough for all youve done everything comes with a price tell me all you know about oceanus of course ill be glad to as i said last time oceanus is a multi national corporation dealing in fish products and transport it oper ates fleets of fishing boats and transport vessels around the world that could describe a dozen corporations austin smiled why do i have the feeling youre hiding something therri looked shocked is it that obvious only to someone whos used to dealing with people who think that telling some of the truth gets them off the hook for all of it she frowned and said i deserved that its an old lawyer habit we attorneys like to keep something in reserve sos is very much in your debt what would you like to know who owns the company for starters sos asked itself the same question we ran into a thicket of in tertwining shadow corporations paper companies and murky trusts one name kept coming up toonook huh that name reminds me of a film i saw when i was a kid an old documentary called nanoo of the north is he an eskimo thats my guess we cant confirm it but we dug up some cir cumstantial evidence pointing in that direction it took an incredible amount of research we learned that hes a canadian citizen and that hes very good at keeping his face hidden thats all i can tell you about him and thats the whole truth austin nodded thinking about the swarthy darkskinned guards whod shot at him lets go back to oceanus what first brought them to the attention of sos they were one of the few companies that ignored our faroes boycott wed been aware offishfarming as an environmental issue but it was the companys attempts to hide its operations that got mar cus interested when he learned about the fish farm in the faroes he thought that he might stir things up if he focused the spotlight on the operation there are two ships on the bottom of the ocean that prove he was right let me ask you something therri said leveling her gaze what do you know about oceanus that you havent told me fair enough while you were negotiating with mr becker i poked into an oceanus fish farm in the faroes did you learn anything austin felt a twinge of pain in his chest wound i learned that they dont like people poking into their business id advise you and your friends to give them a wide berth now whos the evasive one austin only smiled as much as he wanted to trust therri he did not know the extent of her loyalty to sos and its leader ive told you enough to keep you out of trouble you must know that throwing me a tidbit of information is only going to stir up my curiosity just remember that curiosity killed the cat i wouldnt want to see you suffer a similar fate thanks for the warning she smiled her beguiling smile youre welcome maybe we can continue this conversation when we get back to washington i can think of any number of hotel lobbies that would be conducive to an accidental rendezvous we can pledge not to talk business lets begin now austin signaled the waiter and ordered two peter heering cherry liqueurs what would you like to talk about then therri said tell me about sos that could be construed as business okay ill ask you a personal question how did you come to be involved with the sentinels fate she said with a smile before i became a whalehugger i was a treehugger my future was ordained from the moment of birth my folks named me thoreau after henry david i wondered where the therri came from i suppose i was lucky they didnt name me henry my father was an environmental activist before there was such a thing my mother was from an old yankee family that got rich on slaves and rum when i graduated from harvard law school it was expected that i go into the family guilt business my turn now how did you get into numa austin gave therri the cliffs notes version of his career theres an unaccountable gap in time in your life history she said youre much too alert i worked for the cia during that period my division was disbanded after the cold war ended cant tell you more than that thats all right she said an air of mystery adds to your at tractiveness austin felt like an outfielder about to catch an easy pop fly therri had moved the conversation to a slightly more intimate level and he was about to respond in kind when he noticed her looking over his shoulder he turned and saw marcus ryan making his way toward their table therri ryan said with his matineeidol smile what a nice surprise hello marcus you remember kurt austin from the hearing in torshavn of course mr austin gave the only unbiased testimony during that whole fiasco why dont you join us therri said you dont mind do you kurt austin minded very much the encounter smelled strongly of a staged meeting but he was curious about the reason for the setup he motioned to a chair and shook hands with ryan the grip was sur prisingly firm only for a minute ryan said i dont want to intrude on your dinner but im glad for the opportunity to thank mr austin for helping sos your appreciation is misdirected i didnt do it to help sos it was a personal favor for miss weld shes the one who persuaded me to take a close look at your boat i dont know of many people who can resist her persuasiveness and she deserves a lot of credit nevertheless you did a great service for the creatures of the sea spare me the hearts and flowers mr ryan i gave therri the ev idence of sabotage because it was the right thing to do not because i believe in your cause then you know i had no responsibility for that collision i know that you purposely ratcheted up the tension hoping some thing would happen so you could get it on the tv cameras desperate times call for desperate measures from what i know about numa your organization isnt above using unorthodox methods to achieve its goals theres a big difference every one of us right up to admiral sandecker is ready to bear responsibility for our actions we dont take refuge behind posters of puppyfaced little harp seals ryans face turned the color of a cooked beet ive always been willing to take the consequences for my actions sure as long as you knew there was a way out ryan smiled over his anger youre a difficult man mr austin i try to be the waiter arrived just then with their dinners well i wont spoil your evening ryan said it was fun talking to you mr austin ill give you a call later them with a jaunty wave he joined the throngs moving past the restau rant austin watched ryan depart and said your friend takes an ex alted view of himself i thought the oceans already had a god nep tune or poseidon depending on your language of choice he expected therri to defend ryan but she laughed instead congratulations kurt its nice to know that marcus isnt the only one who has a talent for irritating people it comes naturally to me you should tell him that the next time you set up an accidental meeting she glanced at the ferris wheel avoiding his steady gaze then toyed with her fork before answering was it that transparent any more transparent and it would be invisible she sighed heavily sorry for the clumsy attempt to deceive you you didnt deserve it marcus wanted to meet you so he could thank you he was sincere about that i didnt expect you to get into a spit ting match please accept my apology only if youll have a nightcap in the palace lounge after we take a long walk around the neighborhood you drive a hard bargain austin gave her a devilish grin as your friend mr ryan said im a difficult man copenhagen seemed to be in the midst of a major cel ebration but the bash was only a normal night in one of eu ropes liveliest cities music issued from dozens of cafes the parks and squares along an expansive pedestrian mall named stroget teemed with strollers and street performers the party atmosphere was fun but it was hard to carry on a conversation austin suggested that they turn down a quiet street lined with closed boutiques and make their way back to the hotel the deserted street was dark except for a few shop windows and softly glowing gas lamps austin was listening to therri tell an an ecdote about becker when he noticed movement ahead and saw two figures step out of the shadows into a puddle of yellow light austin knew the danes to be lowkey and extra polite and copen hagen was relatively crimefree it didnt bother him when the two men took up a stance blocking the sidewalk maybe theyd had too much akavit he took therri s arm and prepared to walk around the pair he reassessed the situation when the men produced long clubs from behind their backs hearing a scraping footfall austin glanced over his shoulder two more men also wielding clubs were approaching from behind therri had become aware of the threat without comprehending it and had stopped talking in what looked like a rehearsed strategy the men began to encircle them austin looked around for a weapon figuring that anything was better than nothing he grabbed the lid from a row of trash cans the heavyduty cover was made of thick solid aluminum he was glad to see he stepped protectively in front of therri and used the lid like a medieval infantrymans shield to fend off a clanging blow from the nearest attacker the man brought the club up to strike again but austin went from defense to offense and straightarmed the heavy lid into the attackers face the man yelped with pain and his knees buckled austin lifted the lid in both hands and brought it down on the mans head where it made a sound like a gong his hands hurt at the shock of the impact but the attacker was even worse off crum pling onto the sidewalk in a dark heap another attacker swiftly closed in austin jammed the lid in his face but the attacker anticipated the move stepping back out of range and clubbing the lid harmlessly aside austin was trying to keep the tender left side of his rib from being hit the assailant sensed a weakness and landed a glancing blow to austins head austin saw whirling galaxies at the same time he heard therris scream one attacker held her while the other pulled her back by the hair to expose her throat a hard blow to her windpipe could be fatal austin blinked the stars from his eyes and tried to go to her aid his assailant stepped in front of him and brought his club down as if he were wielding a twohanded broadsword austin deflected the blow but it knocked the lid from his hand and he lost his balance down on one knee austin raised his arm to protect his head he saw wide faces and glittering eyes clubs raised in the air and braced him self for a shower of blows to rain down on his skull instead he heard thuds and grunts and men yelling in two different languages one in comprehensible the other spanish the attackers who had encircled him melted away like snowflakes he struggled to his feet and saw figures running away from him clubs rattled to the pavement shadows were moving in every direc tion and he was reminded of the scene in the movie ghost where the shades of the dead take the damned to the underworld then the shad ows disappeared he and therri were alone except for the slumped form of the man he had clouted the attackers friends had apparently abandoned him are you all right austin said taking thems arm yes im fine but as you can tell im very shaky what about you he lightly touched the side of his head my head feels like raw hamburger and my skull is full of twittering sparrows but other than that im fine it could have been worse i lnow she said with a shudder thank goodness those men saved us what men i was a little busy with my imitation oflvanhoe they came out of nowhere i think there were two of them they went after the others and chased them away austin kicked the battered trashcan lid hell i thought i scared them off with my headmasher he brushed the dirt off his ripped and dirty pants damn this is the first new suit ive bought in years therri couldnt help laughing incredible you narrowly missed being beaten to death and youre worried about your suit she em braced him in a warm hug therri was holding him tightly he didnt even complain about the pressure of her body against his knife wound he was thinking that she smelled very good when suddenly she stiffened backed away from him and looked over his shoulder with horror in her eyes kurt watch out austin turned and saw that the attacker whod been lying on the sidewalk was slowly getting to his feet the man stared at them for a few seconds apparently still dazed austin clenched his fists and started toward the man ready to send him back to lala land he stopped in midstep when a small circle of intense red appeared in the mans forehead get down austin yelled at therri when she hesitated he pulled her to the sidewalk shielding her body with his the man started toward them then he stopped as if he had walked into an invisible wall went down on his knees and fell face down onto the sidewalk austin heard footsteps and saw a figure running down the street austin pulled therri to her feet and apologized for knocking her down what happened she seemed to be in a daze someone shot our friend i saw the spot from a laser sight why would they do that maybe his company has a strict severance policy or maybe they didnt want him talking she said staring at the dead body either way this isnt a healthy place to be austin took therri by the arm and guided her away from the scene he kept a sharp eye out for a return of their attackers not re laxing until the lights of the palace hotel were in sight the hotel cocktail lounge seemed like another world austin and therri sat in a corner booth surrounded by the cheerful babel of voices and the tinkling of a jazz piano playing cole porter austin had ordered two double scotches therri took a deep swallow other drink and looked around at the other patrons did that really happen out there in the street it wasnt a production of west side story if thats what you mean can you tell me what you remember it all happened so fast two of those men with the clubs grabbed me she frowned loo what those sobs did to my hair anger was replacing her fear who were those jerks the attack was wellcoordinated they knew we were in copen hagen and must have been watching us tonight in order to set up the ambush whats your guess she replied without hesitation oceanus austin nodded grimly as i learned in the faroes oceanus has the thug power the violent inclination and the organization what happened next they let me go just like that then they were running away with the other men chasing after them she shook her head i wish our good samaritans had stayed so i could thank them should we tell the police what happened normally id say yes but i dont know if it would do any good they might pass it off as an attempted mugging given your rela tionship with the danish authorities you might be detained here longer than youd like youre right therri said she drained the last other glass id better get back to my room my flight leaves early in the morning austin walked therri to her door where they paused youre sure youll be okay yes im fine thanks for the interesting evening you certainly know how to show a girl a good time that was nothing just wait until our next date she smiled and kissed him lightly on the lips i can hardly wait he was impressed at how quickly therri had recovered she was proving to be an iron butterfly call me if you need anything she nodded austin wished her a good nights sleep and headed for the elevator she watched until the elevator doors had closed then she pulled her key out of the lock walked down the hall and knocked on another door which was opened by marcus ryan his smile disappeared when he saw the strain in her face are you all right he said with concern in his voice you look a little pale nothing a little makeup wont cure she brushed by him and stretched out on the sofa whip me up a strong cup of tea then have a seat and ill tell you all about it they sat down and she told them about their attack and rescue after hearing her story ryan tented his fingers and stared off into space austin is right its oceanus vmsure of it me too im less sure who our rescuers were austin didnt know who they were she shook her head he said no was he telling the truth he may suspect who they were but i didnt press him on that kurt doesnt strike me as someone who lies well well my toughminded legal counsel has a soft side after all you like him dont you ryan said with a foxy grin i wont deny it hesdifferent im different too you must admit that you are she said with a smile thats why were profes sional colleagues and not lovers ryan sighed theatrically guess im fated to be a bridesmaid never a bride youd make a hideous bride besides you had your chance to be a bride as you recall i didnt like playing second fiddle to sos didnt blame you i am something of a warrior monk when it comes to the sentinels crap dont give me that monk stuff i happen to know youve got a girlfriend in every port hell therri even a monk has to get out of the monastery and kick up his heels from time to time but lets talk about your in triguing relationship with austin do you think hes smitten by your charms enough to have him wrapped around your finger from what ive seen kurt doesnt wrap around anyone s finger her eyes narrowed whats going on in that tangle of plots and schemes that you call a mind just a thought id like to get numa on our side we need mus cle if were going to tackle oceanus and if we cant get numa to help us he shrugged then well have to go it alone therri shook her head were not big enough to do that this is not a street gang were dealing with theyre too big and powerful you saw how easily they sabotaged our ship if someone like kurt austin is nervous then we should pay attention we cant risk any more lives dont underestimate sos therri muscle isnt everything strength can come from knowledge dont talk in riddles marcus he smiled we may have a winning card josh green called yes terday he has stumbled onto something big and it concerns an oceanus operation in canada what sort of operation josh wasnt sure it came out of ben nighthawk the college intern in our office ryan nodded as you know nighthawk is a canadian indian hes been getting these weird letters from his family in the north woods a corporation took over a big tract of land near their village as a favor to ben josh looked into the ownership the land was purchased by a straw corporation set up by oceanus in her excitement therri put aside her fears this may be the lead were looking for uhhuh i thought the same thing which is why i told josh to check it out you sent him up there alone he was on his way to canada to meet ben when he called night hawk knows the lay of the land dont worry theyll be careful therri bit her lower lip as she thought back to the savage attack on a quiet copenhagen street she respected ryan for a hundred dif ferent reasons but sometimes his zeal to attain a goal got in the way of his judgment fear clouded her eyes i hope so she murmured the giant tree trunks soared like columns in an ancient temple their intertwining branches blocked the suns rays and created an artificial twilight on the forest floor far below the tree tops the dented old pickup lurched and dipped like a boat in a storm as it climbed over ropy tree roots and unyielding rocks joshua green sat on the passenger side jouncing on the hard seat he kept one hand above his head to cushion the impact of his skull against the interior of the trucks roof green was an environmental law expert with the sentinels of the sea he was a sandyhaired thinfaced man whose large round glasses and birdlike nose made him look like an emaciated owl he had gamely toughed out the ride without a complaint until the truck hit a bump that practically bounced him through the overhead im feeling like a kernel in a popcorn machine he said to the driver how much longer do i have to endure this torture about five minutes then well start walking ben nighthawk replied dont blame you for getting sick of the bumpy ride sorry about the transportation too its the best my cousin could come up with green nodded in resignation and turned his attention back to the deep woods that encroached on every side before being assigned to sos headquarters hed been part of the field operations swat team he had been rammed and shot at and hed spent short but un forgettable times in jails no better than medieval dungeons he had acquired a reputation for amazing aplomb under fire and his pro fessorial appearance disguised a tough interior but the unnatural darkness of his surroundings unnerved green more than anything or anybody he had ever encountered at sea the road doesnt bother me its these damned woodsy he said staring out at the forest damned creepy its the middle of the day the sun is shining and its dark as hades out there like something out of a tolkien novel wouldnt surprise me if an ore or an ogre jumped out at us whoops i think i just saw shrek nighthawk laughed i suppose the woods are a little spooky if youre not used to them he gazed through the windshield but in stead of apprehension a look of reverence bathed his round apple brown features its different when you grow up around here the forest and the darkness are your friends because they provide pro tection he paused and said wistfully most of the time a few minutes later nighthawk brought the truck to a halt and they got out and stood in the cathedral gloom clouds of tiny flies whirled around their heads the powerful scent of pine was almost suffocating but to nighthawk it was like the finest perfume he ab sorbed the sights and smells with a beatific expression on his face then he and green donned the backpacks that carried cameras and film survival tools water and snacks without consulting a compass nighthawk started walking this way he said as confident as if he were following a dotted line on the ground they moved in silence across the thick carpet made up of decades of fallen pine needles weaving their way through the tree trunks the air was hot and oppressive and sweat soaked their shirts within minutes except for clusters of ferns and moss hills no underbrush grew beneath the trees they made good time without bushes and briars to slow them down as he loped after nighthawk green re flected on the path that had led him from the comfort of his air conditioned office to this murky weald in addition to his duties with sos green taught parttime at georgetown university in washington which was where hed met ben nighthawk who was attending his class the young indian was in college on scholarship he wanted to use his education to save the north woods environment which was threatened by development struck by bens intelligence and enthusiasm green had asked him to be a research assistant in the sos office the lanky environmentalist and the stocky young indian were only a few years apart in age and they had soon become good friends as well as colleagues nighthawk was glad for the friendship because he infrequently made it home his family lived on the shores of a big lake in a remote and almost inaccessible part of eastern canada a seaplane owned jointly by the villagers made weekly trips to the near est town for supplies and emergencies and also carried mail back and forth his mother had been keeping nighthawk up to date about a major construction project on the lake someone was probably build ing a trophy lodge nighthawk had assumed with resignation it was the sort of project he was determined to wage war against when he got out of college then the week before his mother had written an upsetting letter hinting at dark goingson and asking her son to come home as soon as he could green told nighthawk to take as much time off as he needed a few days after nighthawk had left for canada he called the sos of fice he sounded desperate i need your help he implored of course green replied thinking his young friend had run out of money how much do you need i dont need any money im worried about my familyv nighthawk explained that he had gone to the town nearest to the village and learned that the seaplane hadnt come in for two weeks the townspeople assumed that the plane had mechanical problems and that someone would eventually come out of the woods by land looking for replacement parts he borrowed a truck from a relative who lived in town and fol lowed the crude road that led to the village he found the road fenced off and guarded by hardlooking men who said that the property was now private when he said he wanted to get to his village they waved him off with their weapons and warned him not to come back i dont understand green had said on the phone didnt your family live on reservation land there were only a handful of our people left a big paper con glomerate owned the land we were squatters technically but the company tolerated us they even used the tribe in ads to show what nice people they were they sold the land and the new owners have been working on a big project on the other side of the lake its their land they can do what they want to i know but that doesnt explain what happened to my people good point have you gone to the authorities it was the first thing i did i talked to the provincial police they said they were contacted by a city lawyer who told them that the vil lagers had been evicted but where did they go the police asked the same question the lawyer said they moved on probably squatting on someone elses property he said you have to understand my people are considered eccentric anachronisms the police here say there is nothing they can do i need help as they talked green checked his calendar ill have the company plane run me up there tomorrow morning he said sos leased an executive jet that was on standby are you sure why not with marcus tied up in denmark im nominally in command and to be honest having to deal with all the egos and turf wars in this office is driving me bonkers tell me where you are true to his word green had flown into quebec the following day he caught a connector flight on a small plane that took him to the town nighthawk had called from ben was waiting at the tiny air port the truck packed with camping supplies and ready to go they drove several hours along back roads and camped overnight looking at the map by the light of the camp lantern green saw that the forest covered a huge area pockmarked with large bodies of fresh water bens family lived off the land fished and hunted for a living and brought in hard cash revenue from the sport fishermen and hunters green had suggested hiring a floatplane to take them in but nighthawk said that the heavily armed guards he encountered had made it clear that trespassers would be shot the access road they guarded wasnt the only way to get to the village nighthawk said the next morning theyd driven a few more hours never encoun tering another vehicle until theyd come to the track that led into the deep woods after leaving the truck they walked now for about an hour mov ing like shadows in the silence of the tall trees until nighthawk stopped and raised his hand he froze in place eyes halfclosed mov ing his head slightly back and forth like a radar antenna focusing on an incoming target he seemed to have forsaken the ordinary senses of sight and hearing and was using some inner directionfinder as green watched fascinated he thought you can take the in dian out of the forest but you cant take the forest out of the indian at last nighthawk relaxed reached into his pack and unscrewed a canteen he handed it to green i hate to be a pest green said taking a swig of warm water but how much farther do we have to walk nighthawk pointed toward the line of trees about a hundred yards that way is a hunters trail that will take us to the lake how do you know ben tapped his nose no big deal ive been following the water smell try it after a sniff or two green found to his surprise that he could pick up the faint scent of rotting vegetation and fish mixed with the fragrance of pine nighthawk took some water and tucked the can teen back into his pack lowering his voice he said well have to be very careful from here on in ill communicate with hand signals green gave him the okay sign and they set off again almost im mediately the scenery began to change the trees grew shorter and slimmer as the soil under their feet became sandier the under growth thickened and they had to push their way through thorns that ripped at their clothes shafts of light streamed in from breaks in the trees overhead then quite suddenly they could see the sparkle of water at a sig nal from nighthawk they got down on their hands and knees and made their way to the edge of the lake after a moment nighthawk stood and walked to the waters edge with green following an elderly cessna floatplane was tied up at a rickety dock nighthawk inspected the plane finding nothing out of place he removed the cowling and gasped when he saw the engine josh look at this green peered at the engine looks like someone took an ax to it the hoses and connections hung loose where they had been cut the engine was scarred in a dozen places where it had been hit with something hard this is why no one could fly out of here nighthawk said he pointed to a footworn trail that led away from the floatplane dock that path leads to the village within minutes they were making their way to the edge of a clearing nighthawk held out his hand for them to stop then he squatted on his haunches and peered with sharp eyes through the bushes theres no one here he said finally are you sure unfortunately yes nighthawk said he walked unafraid into the open with green hesitantly taking up the rear the village consisted of a dozen or so sturdylooking log houses most with porches they were built on both sides of a swath of packeddown dirt in a rough approximation of a small towns main street complete with one structure that had a generalstore sign on it green expected someone to burst out the front door at any mo ment but the store and every other house in the village were as still as tombs this is my house where my parents and my sister lived nighthawk said stopping in front of one of the larger structures he went up on the porch and went inside after a few minutes he came out shaking his head no one everything is in place like they just stepped out for a minute i poked my head in a couple of the other places green said same thing how many people lived here forty or so where could they have gone nighthawk walked to the edge of the lake a few yards away he stood listening to the quiet lap of the waves after a moment he pointed to the opposite shore and said maybe over there green squinted across the lake how can you be sure my mother wrote that there was funny stuff going on across the lake weve got to check it out what kind of funny stuff she said big helicopters were coming in and unloading material night and day when the village men went over to investigate they were run off by guards then one day some guys with guns came over to the village and looked around they didnt hurt anyone but my mother figured theyd be back wouldnt it be better to go tell the authorities they could send someone in by plane i dont think theres time nighthawk said her letter is more than two weeks old besides i can feel danger and death in the air green shuddered he was stuck in the middle of nowhere and the only person who could get him out was raving like a medicine man in a b movie sensing his friends nervousness nighthawk smiled and said dont worry im not going native thats a good suggestion about the cops id feel better if we checked things out first cmon he said and they headed back to the knoll they had climbed a few minutes before they came to a natural overhang of rock nighthawk pulled away some branches that covered the opening lying upsidedown on a crude rack was a birchbark canoe nighthawk ran his hand lov ingly over the shiny surface i made this myself used only traditional materials and tech niques its beautiful green said straight out of last of the mohicans better ive gone all over the lake in it they dragged the canoe to the beach dined on beef jerky and rested as they waited for the sun to go down with the approach of dusk they threw their packs into the canoe pushed it into the water and started paddling night had fallen by the time they drew close to the shore they had to stop when the canoe hit something solid in the water nighthawk reached down thinking they had hit a rock its some kind of metal cage like a bait box he scanned the water with his sharp eyes the water is filled with them i smell fish lots of them it must be some sort of hatchery operation they found a breach in the floating barricade and pointed the canoe toward land something stirred and splashed in the metal cages confirming nighthawks theory of a fish hatchery eventually they came to the outer end of a floating dock lit by dim anklehigh lights they had seen from the water tied up to a series of finger piers were several jet skis and powerboats next to the smaller watercraft was a large catamaran it had a conveyor belt running down the middle and nighthawk guessed that it was used in the hatchery operation ive got an idea green said working systematically he pulled the ignition keys from the jet skis and the boats and threw them into the water then they tucked the canoe in between the other craft covered it with a borrowed tarp and climbed onto the pier where the dock joined the shore it continued as a blacktop walk way that led inland nighthawk and green decided to keep to the woods after walking a few minutes they encountered a wide dirt track as if a big bulldozer had plowed its way through the forest they followed the swath and came up on a row of trucks and earth moving machinery arranged in neat rows behind a huge storage building using the shed as a shield they peered around the corner and saw that they were at the edge of an open area carved out of the woods it was brightly illuminated by a ring of portable halogen lights mechanized shovels were flattening down the dirt and great roadbuilding machines were laying down swathes of blacktop work crews armed with shovels were smoothing out the hot asphalt in preparation for it to be flattened down by the steamrollers nighthawk said what do we do next professor how long do we have until daybreak about five hours to first light it would be smart to be back on the lake before then green sat with his back against a tree lets keep an eye on whats going on until then ill take the first watch shortly after midnight ben took over green stretched out on the ground and closed his eyes the cleared area was now almost deserted except for a few armed men lounging around nighthawk blinked his eyes and reached over to tap greens shoulder uh josh green sat up and looked toward the plaza what the hell beyond the clearing where there were only woods before was a huge domeshaped structure whose mottled surface glowed bluish white it seemed to have appeared by magic what is that thing ben whispered and where did it come from you got me green said maybe its a hotel naw green said too functionallooking would you stay in a place like that i grew up in a log cabin any place bigger than that is a hotel i dont mean to disparage your home territory but can you see fishermen and hunters flocking here that thing belongs in las vegas were talking north pole man looks like an overgrown igloo green had to admit the dome had the same contours as the eskimo shelters he had seen in national geographic but instead of hard snow the surface appeared to be a translucent plastic material huge hangar doors were set into the base of the dome overlooking the open area which was being built as a plaza as they watched there were signs of new activity the plaza was becoming busy again the construction crew had returned along with more armed men who could be seen glancing up at the night sky before long the sound of engines could be heard from above then a gigantic object moved across the night sky and blotted out the stars look at the dome nighthawk said a vertical seam had appeared in the top of the structure the seam widened into a wedge then the top half of the dome peeled back like the sections of an orange until it was completely open light streamed out of the domes interior and bathed the silvery skin of a gigantic torpedoshaped object that moved slowly to a position exactly above the vast opening we were both wrong nighthawk said our las vegas hotel is a blimp hangar green had been studying the contours of the enormous aircraft you ever see that old news footage about the hindenburg that big german airship that caught fire and burned back in the s but whats something like that doing here i think we may find out very soon green said the descending airship sank into the structure and the sections of the dome moved back into place and restored the round shape be fore long the doors overlooking the plaza slid open and a group of men emerged from inside the structure they were dressed in black uniforms and all had dark swarthy complexions they swarmed around a man whose bullish head was set on powerful shoulders the man walked over to the edge of the plaza and inspected the progress of the work nighthawk had paid little attention to the workers before but now he could see that unlike the uniformed men these people were dressed in jeans and work shirts and armed guards were watching them oh hell he whispered whats wrong green said those are men from my village thats my brother and father but i dont see my mother or any of the other women the leader continued on his inspection tour walking around the edge of the plaza the men who had been guarding the workers watched their leaders progress taking advantage of their inatten tion one of the laborers had edged closer to the woods then he dropped his shovel and made a break for freedom something about the way he ran with a slight limp looked familiar to nighthawk thats my cousin he said i can tell by the way he runs he hurt his foot bad when we were kids one of the guards glanced back and saw the fleeing man he raised his gun to fire but lowered it at an apparent command from the bullheaded man he stepped over to a stack of tools and snatched up a sharptipped metal pike from the pile he held it lightly in two hands drew back like a javelin thrower then snapped the pike for ward with all the strength of his squat powerful body the missile flew through the air in a metallic blur it had been thrown expertly ahead of the runner in a high looping trajectory and timed so that it caught him between the shoulder blades he went down pinned like a butterfly in a collection book by then the leader had turned his back and didnt even see him fall the whole scenethe aborted escape and the killing of his cousinhad taken only a few seconds nighthawk had watched frozen in place but now he lunged forward and despite greens at tempts to hold him back broke from cover and ran toward his cousins body green scrambled after the young indian and brought him down in a flying tackle he was on his feet a second later pulling nighthawk to his feet by the scruff of his neck they were clearly vis ible in the bright glare of lights nighthawk saw the guns pointed in their direction and his instincts took over he and green dashed for the woods shots rang out and green fell nighthawk stopped and went to help his companion but the bullet had caught green in the back of the head and destroyed his skull nighthawk turned and ran geysers of earth erupting around his feet he dove into the forest while a fusillade from the plaza shredded the branches over his head under a shower of twigs and leaves he dashed through the trees until he came to the edge of the lake and his feet pounded onto the dock he saw the jet skis and wished green had kept one ignition key nighthawk unsheathed a hunting knife from his belt and sliced the mooring lines then he shoved the watercraft as far away from the dock as he could he whipped the tarp from the canoe pushed off and began to paddle furiously he was in open water when he saw muzzle flashes from the dock area and heard the rattle of automatic arms fire the shooters were firing blind and their bullets were hit ting the water off to one side the canoe flew across the lake until it was out of range night hawk continued to paddle with all his strength once he had gained the other shore he could lose himself in the deep woods it is never entirely dark on water which catches and magnifies even the tiniest speck of light but now the lake around him began to glow as if it were infused with a luminescent chemical he turned and saw that the light was not coming from the lake but was a reflection behind him a wide shaft of light was shining toward the heavens the dome was opening the airship was rising slowly into the air when it was a few hundred feet over the trees the airship headed to ward the lake bathed in the eerie light from below the airship looked like an avenging monster out of some timeshrouded myth instead of approaching on a straight line the airship turned sharply and moved along the shore beams of light shot out from its under belly and probed the surface of the lake after making its first pass the airship turned onto a parallel track rather than make a random thrust into the space over the lake the airship was conducting a thorough search using a lawnmowing pat tern nighthawk was paddling for all he was worth but it would be only a matter of minutes before the searchlights dancing over the lakes surface caught the canoe the airship made another turn and started back on a course that would take it directly over the canoe once spotted the canoe would be an easy target nighthawk knew there was only one option avail able to him he drew his hunting knife and slashed a hole in the bot tom of the canoe cold water poured in and surged around his waist the water was up to his neck as the airship blotted out the sky al most directly overhead the guttural noise of its engines blocked out all other sound nighthawk ducked his head and held on to the sinking canoe to keep it below the surface above him the water glowed white from the moving bullseyes then went black again he stayed under as long as he could then gasping for breath he popped his head out of the water the airship had turned for another pass nighthawk could hear another sound mingling with the throb of engines the whine and snarl of jet skis someone must have had spare ignition keys nighthawk swam off at an angle away from the village minutes later he saw lights scudding across the lake at great speed as the jet skis made directly for the deserted village nighthawk kept swimming until he felt soft muck under his feet he crawled up onto the shore exhausted from the swim but he rested only long enough to wring water out of his shirt lights were coming his way along the beach nighthawk took one last sorrowful look across the lake before he melted into the woods like a sodden wraith abroad smile crossed austins bronzed face as the taxi crunched onto the long gravel driveway in fairfax virginia austin paid his fare from duties airport and sprinted up the steps of the victorian boathouse part of an old estate fronting on the potomac river he dropped his bags inside the door swept his eye around the combination studyden and the familiar line from robert louis stevenson came to mind home is the sailor home from sea like austin himself his house was a study in contrasts he was a man of action whose physical strength courage and quickness made him a force to be reckoned with yet he possessed a cool intellect and he often drew inspiration from the great minds of centuries past his work often involved the latest in hightech gadgets but his respect for the past was crystallized in the brace of dueling pistols that hung over his fireplace it was part of a collection of more than two hun dred sets to which he was always adding despite the limitations of a government salary the dichotomy in his personality was reflected in the comfortable darkwood colonial furniture that contrasted with the plain white walls like those in a new york art gallery that were hung with con temporary originals his extensive bookshelves groaned under the weight of hundreds of books that included first editions of joseph conrad and herman melville and wellworn volumes containing the writings of the great philosophers while he could spend hours studying the works and wisdom of plato and kant his extensive music library was heavy on progressive jazz curiously there was lit tle to indicate that he spent most of his working days on or under the sea except for a primitive painting of a clipper ship and a few other sailing vessels a photo of his catboat under full sail and a glass encased model of his racing hydroplane austin had lovingly converted the boathouse into a residence doing much of the work himself his assignments for numa and before that for the cia took him all over the globe but when his work was done he could always return to his safe harbor drop sail and throw the anchor over the side all that was needed to make the nautical analogy complete he reflected was a ration of grog he went into the kitchen and poured himself a glass of dark rum and jamaican ginger beer the ice tinkled pleasantly in his glass as he threw the doors open to release the musty smell he went out onto the deck where he filled his lungs with the fresh river air and surveyed the slowmoving potomac in the vanishing light nothing had changed the river was as beautiful and serene as ever he stretched out in a woodslatted adirondack chair lay back and stared at the sky as if the stars could tell him what was behind the events of the last few days his misadventures in the faroe islands and in copenhagen would have been the stuff of dreams if not for the itch on his chest where the knife wound was healing and the ten der swelling under his hair where a club had connected with his nog mn he could draw a straight line from the sabotage of the sos ship to the attack on a quiet copenhagen street the dark impulses that had inspired the sabotage of the sos ship were obviously a means to an end simply put someone wanted sos out of the picture when austin had gotten nosey hed become a target first in skaalshavn and later in copenhagen the situation could be summed up in a simple equation when ever someone got too close to a company called oceanus the results could be disastrous his thoughts drifted back to the faroe islands fish farm and the thing in the fish tank that had scared the hell out of him a miasma of pure evil seemed to hang over the oceanus op eration what had jorgensen said unholy then there was the basque tycoon balthazar aguirrez and his quixotic quest what was that all about austin went over the events of the past several days in his mind until he felt his eyelids drooping he downed the last of his drink climbed the stairs to his bedroom in the turret surmounting the mansard roof and turned in he slept soundly and was up and dressed early the next morning refreshed by a nights sleep and stim ulated by a pot of strong kona coffee he telephoned an old friend at the cia to make sure he would be in then called his numa of fice to say hed be late unlike his colleague dirk pitt who collected antique autos and relished driving them austin was indifferent when it came to ground transportation driving a sedan from the numa car pool nondescript except for its turquoise color he headed to langley along a route he knew well from his days with the cia and parked his car next to dozens of other government vehicles security at the sprawl ing complex was tighter since herinan perez whom he had called earlier was waiting in the vis itors area perez was a slightly built man with an olive complexion and darkbrown eyes that matched his thinning hair perez helped speed the checkin process through security and led austin through the labyrinth of corridors to an office uncluttered by a scrap of paper the only objects on the desktop were a computer monitor a tele phone and a photo of an attractive woman and two cute children kurt its great to see you perez said motioning for austin to sit down thinking of jumping sandeckers ship to come back into the company wed love to have you the cloakanddagger stuff youre so good at has become respectable at langley once again admiral sandecker might have something to say about that but ill have to admit that i still get mistyeyed when i think about the fun we had on our last job the secret missile retrieval job we did off gibraltar perez said with a boyish grin oh boy that was something i was thinking about that on the drive over this morning how long has it been too damned long you know something kurt i still hear little flamenco dancers in my head whenever i drink spanish wine a dreamy look came into perezs face by god we had some good times didnt we austin nodded in agreement the world has changed a lot since then perez laughed in reply not for you old pal hell i read about that amazing rescue you pulled off in the faroe islands you havent changed a bit you old sea dog still the same swashbuckling austin austin groaned these days for every minute swashing buckles i spend an hour at my desk dealing with reports i hear you i could do without the paperwork although ive got ten to like my ninetofive schedule since i became a father two kids would you believe it being a desk jockey isnt all bad you might want to try it no thanks id rather have my eyeballs tattooed perez laughed well you didnt come here to talk about the good ol days you said on the phone that you were looking for background info on balthazar aguirrez whats your interest in him if you dont mind my asking not at all i ran into aguirrez in the faroe islands he seemed like a fascinating character i know hes a shipbuilding magnate but i suspected there was more to him than meets the eye you met him he was fishing so was i i should have known perez said trouble attracts trouble why is he trouble what do you know about the basque separatist movement its been around a long time every so often basque terrorists blow up a public building or assassinate an innocent government of ficial that pretty much sums it up perez said theres been talk for decades of a separate basque state that would straddle spain and france the most radical separatist group eta started fighting for an autonomous basque state in when franco died in the new spanish government gave the basques more political power but the eta wants the whole enchilada theyve killed more than eight hundred people since taking up the cause anyone who is not on their side is an enemy a familiar story around the world unfortunately the political wing of the separatist movement is the batasuna party some people have compared it to sinn fein the public face of the ira the spanish government threw up its hands after more as sassinations and the discovery of a big eta weapons cache auton omy wasnt working so they banned batasuna and started to crack down on the whole separatist movement where does aguirrez fit in to this bloody little picture your instincts were right about there being more to him than meets the eye he has been a major backer of batasuna the gov ernment has accused him of financing terrorism i liked him he didnt look like a terrorist austin said recall ing his benefactors bluff and downtoearth manners sure and joe stalin looked like somebodys grandfather austin remembered the yachts toughlooking crew and the heavy duty armament that the vessel carried so are the charges true he freely admits to supporting batasuna but points out that it was a legitimate party when he gave them money the government suspects hes still channeling money into the movement they have no proof and aguirrez is too wellconnected to bring into court with flimsy evidence whats your take on the guy in all my years in spain i never met him which was why i was surprised when you said you had i think hes a moderate whod like to see a peaceful separatist solution but the eta murders have un dermined his cause hes afraid the crackdown will rekindle the con flict and endanger innocent citizens he may be right sounds like hes walking a very thin tightrope some people say that the pressures made him unhinged hes been talking about a way to rally european public opinion in favor of a basque nation did he give you any hint of whats on his mind perez narrowed his dark eyes surely you didnt talk just about fishing he struck me as very proud of his basque heritagehis yacht is named the natarm he didnt say a word about politics we talked mostly about archaeology hes an amateur archaeologist with strong interest in his own ancestors you make him sound like a contender for the nutty professor let me give you a warning old friend the spanish police would love to nail him to the wall they have no direct proof linking him to ter rorist acts but when they do you dont want to be in their way ill remember that thanks for the headsup hell kurt its the least i could do for a former comradein arms before perez had the chance to start reminiscing again austin glanced at his watch got to get moving thanks for your time not at all lets get together for lunch sometime we miss you here the brass is still ticked off about sandecker grabbing you for numa austin rose from his chair maybe well work on a joint opera tion someday perez smiled id like that he said the washington traffic had let up and before long austin saw the sun gleaming on the green glass facade of the thirtystory numa building overlooking the potomac he groaned when he walked into his office his efficient secretary had neatly piled the pink callback slips in the center of his desk in addition he would have to dig him self out of an avalanche of email messages before he got down to preparing a report on oceanus ah the exciting life of a swashbuckler he scrolled through his e mail deleted half of it as nonessential and shuffled through his pink slips there was a message from paul and gamay they had gone to canada to check into an oceanus operation zavala had left a call on his answering machine saying he would be home that night in time for a hot date some things never change austin thought with a shake of his head his handsome and charming partner was much in demand among washingtons female set austin sighed and began to tap away at his computer he was wrapping up the first draft when the phone rang good afternoon mr austin i was hoping id find you in your office austin smiled at the sound of thems voice im already pining for the high seas your flight home on the concorde went well i trust yes but i dont know why i hurried back my inbox is filled with depositions and briefs but i didnt call to complain id like to get to gether with you im halfway out the door a walk maybe cocktails and dinner then who knows well have to put the who knows on hold for now this is busi ness marcus wants to talk to you im really starting to dislike your friend he keeps getting in the way of what may be the love affair of the century this is important kurt okay ill meet with him with one condition we make a date for tonight its a deal she gave austin a time and place for the meeting thems charm notwithstanding he had agreed to talk to ryan because he had come to a dead end and thought he might learn something new he hung up leaned back in his swivel chair and laced his fingers behind his head it was easy to bring his thoughts around to oceanus his chest ached when he raised his arm and the pain made an effective mem ory aid he wondered if the trouts had turned up anything they hadnt called since leaving their message he tried to reach them on their cell phone and got no answer he didnt worry paul and gamay were fully capable of taking care of themselves next he called rudi gunn numas assistant director and set up a luncheon meeting rudis famed analytical skills might help guide him through the dense thicket surrounding the mysterious corporation gunn was bound to home in on aguirrez when he read the report questioning whether there was any link between basque terrorism and oceanus violence aguirrez had mentioned his ancestor diego austin pondered the basques obsession with his forebear and thought that aguirrez might be on to something from his own ex perience austin knew that the past is always the key to the present he needed someone who could guide him back five centuries one person came to mind immediately austin picked up the phone and punched out a number the worldfamous marine historian and gourmand st julien perlmutter was in an agony of ecstasy he sat outside a threehundredyearold tuscan villa whose shaded terrace had a breathtaking view of rolling vineyards visible in the distance dom inating the renaissance city of florence was the duomo the wide oak table before him groaned with italian cuisine from pungent sausage made locally to a thick rare beefsteak florentine there was so much wonderful food and so many wonderful colors and fragrances in fact that he was having a hard time trying to decide where to start get a grip on yourself old man he muttered stroking his gray beard as he stared at the spread wouldnt do to starve to death amid all this plenty at four hundred pounds perlmutter was in little danger of wast ing away since arriving in italy ten days before he had eaten his way up the italian boot on a promotional tour for an italianamerican food magazine he had trudged through wineries trattorias and smokehouses posed for photo opportunities in refrigerator rooms full of hanging prosciutto and delivered lectures on the history of food going back to the etruscans he had dined on sumptuous feasts everywhere he stopped the sensory overload had brought him to his present impasse the cell phone in his suit pocket trilled grateful for the distrac tion from his quandary he flipped the phone open state your busi ness in a concise and businesslike manner youre a hard man to find st julien the skyblue eyes in the ruddy face danced with pleasure at the sound of the familiar voice ofkurt austin to the contrary kurt mlad im like hansel and gretel follow the food crumbs and youll find me nibbling at the gingerbread house it was easier to follow the suggestion of your housekeeper she told me you were in italy hows the tour going perlmutter patted his substantial stomach its very fulfilling to say the least all goes well in the district of columbia i trust as far as i know i just flew back from copenhagen last night ah the city ofhans christian andersen and the little mermaid i remember when i was there some years ago there was this restau rant i dined at austin cut perlmutter off before he launched into a courseby course account of his meal id love to hear about it but right now i need your historical expertise always willing to talk about food or history fire away perl mutter was often asked to lend his expertise to numa queries have you ever come across a basque mariner by the name of diego aguirrez fifteenth or sixteenth century perlmutter dug into his encyclopedic mind ah yes something to do with the song of roland the epic french poem chanson de roland i struggled through that as part of a high school french course then you know the legend roland was the nephew of the em peror charlemagne he held off the saracens at roncesvalles with the help of his magic sword durendal as he was dying roland beat his sword against a rock to keep it out of the hands of his enemies but it wouldnt break he blew his horn to summon help charle magne hearing it came with his armies but it was too late roland was dead through the centuries roland became a basque hero a symbol of their stubborn character how do we get from roland to aguirrez i recall a reference to the aguirrez family in an eighteenth cen tury treatise on precolumbian voyages to the americas aguirrez was said to have made many fishing trips to north american waters decades before columbuss voyage unfortunately he ran afoul of the spanish inquisition there were unverified reports he had been en trusted with the roland relics from what you say the roland story was not just a legend the sword and the horn actually existed the inquisition apparently thought so they feared the relics could be used to rally the basques what happened to aguirrez and the relics they both disappeared there is no record of a shipwreck that i can recall may i ask what prompts your interest in the subject i met a descendant of diego aguirrez hes retracing the voyage of his longlost ancestor but he never said anything about sacred relics im not surprised basque separatists are still setting off bombs in spain lord knows what would happen if they got their hands on po tent symbols like this do you remember anything else about aguirrez not off the top of my head ill dig around in my books when i aet home perlmutter owned one of the worlds finest marine li braries ill be back in georgetown in a few days after a stopoff in milan youve been a great help as usual well talk again buon ap petito grazier perlmutter said clicking off his phone he turned his attention back to the table he was about to dig in to a plate of marinated artichoke hearts when his host who owned the villa and the surrounding vineyards came in with the bottle of wine he had gone for shock registered on the mans face youre not touching your food are you ill oh no signor nocci i was distracted by a telephone call re garding a question of a historical nature the silverhaired italian nodded perhaps a taste of the chingali the wild boar will help your memory the sauce was made from truffles found in my woods a splendid suggestion my friend with the dam breached perl mutter dug into the food with his usual gusto nocci politely held his curiosity at bay while his guest devoured the repast but when perl mutter dabbed his small mouth and set his napkin aside nocci said i am an amateur historian it is impossible not to be when one lives in a country surrounded by the remnants of countless civilizations perhaps i can help you with your question perlmutter poured himself another glass of chianti and re counted his conversation with austin the italian cocked his head i know nothing about this basque but your story brings to mind something i came across while doing some research in the biblioteca laurenzianaf i visited the laurentian library many years ago i was fascinated by the manuscripts more than ten thousand masterpieces nocci said nodding his head as you know the library was founded by the medici family to house their priceless collection of papers i have been writing a paper on lorenzo the magnificent which i hope to publish some day although i doubt if anyone will read it be assured shall read it perlmutter said grandly then it will have been worth my labor nocci said anyway one of the hazards of research is the temptation to wander away from the highway and while i was at the library i traveled a side road that led to the medici pope leo x with the death of king ferdinand in his seventeenyearold successor charles v encountered pres sure to restrict the power of the inquisition in the great humanist tradition of the medici family leo favored curtailing the inquisitors but charless advisors persuaded the young king that the inquisition was essential to maintain his rule and the persecution continued an other three hundred years a sad chapter in human history its comforting to know that aguirrez had the courage to speak out but the dark forces are strong and none was darker than a spaniard named martinez he sent a letter to the king urging him to support the inquisition and expand its powers as far as i can determine the letter was forwarded to leo for his comment and came to the library with the popes other pa pers he shook his head it is the fanatical raving of a monster martinez hated the basques wanted them wiped from the face of the earth i remember there was a mention of roland which i recall thinking was unusual in this context what was the nature of this reference nocci heaved a great sigh and tapped his head with his forefinger i cant remember one of the consequences of growing old perhaps youll remember after more wine i trust the wine more than my memory nocci said with a smile the assistant curator at the library is a friend of mine please relax and i will make a telephone call he was back in a few minutes she says she would be happy to produce the letter i mentioned for us any time we want to look at it perlmutter pushed his great bulk back from the table and rose to his feet i think perhaps a little exercise would do me some good the trip to florence took less than fifteen minutes nocci usually drove a fiat but in expectation ofperlmutters visit he had leased a mercedes which more comfortably accommodated his guests wide girth they parked near the leather and souvenir stalls that abounded in the piazza san lorenzo and went through an entrance to the left of the medici familys old parish chapel passing into the quiet cloisters they left the bustle of commerce be hind them and climbed the michelangelo stairs into the reading room the sturdy frame that supported perlmutters large figure al lowed more agility than would have seemed possible under the laws of gravity still he was puffing from the exertion of climbing the staircase and gladly agreed when nocci said that he would fetch his friend perlmutter strolled past the rows of carved straightbacked benches basking in the light that was filtering through the high win dows as he breathed in the musty odor of antiquity nocci returned after a minute with a handsome middleaged woman whom he introduced as mara maggi the assistant curator she had the reddishblond hair and fair florentine complexion that showed up so often in botticelli paintings perlmutter shook her hand thank you for seeing us on such short notice signora maggi she greeted perlmutter with a radiant smile not at all it is a pleasure to open our collection to someone of such repute please come with me the letter you wish to see is in my office she led the way to a space whose window overlooked the cloister garden and settled perlmutter in a small anteroom that had a spare desk and a couple of chairs several pages of wrinkled parchment lay in an open vellumbound wooden box she left the two men alone and said to call if they needed any help nocci gingerly lifted the first parchment page from the folder and held it by the edges my spanish is not too bad if youll allow me perlmutter nodded and nocci began to read as he listened perl mutter decided that he had seldom heard writing that dripped with so much venom and bloodthirsty hatred the diatribe was a litany of charges directed at the basqueswitchcraft and satanism among them even the uniqueness of their language was used in evidence martinez was obviously a madman but behind his ravings was a clever political message to the young medici king to restrict the in quisition would diminish the power of the throne ah nocci said adjusting his reading glasses here is the pas sage i was telling you about martinez writes but it is their tendency to rebellion i fear the most they are at tached to relics they have the sword and the horn to which they attribute great powers it gives them the power to rebel which will threaten the authority of the church and of your kingdom my lord there is one among them a man called aguirrez who is at the heart of this sedition i have vowed to pursue him to the ends of the earth to reclaim these relics sire if our sacred mission is not al lowed to continue its work until heresy is uprooted from the land i fear the call of rolands horn will summon our enemies to battle and that his blade will lay waste to all we hold dear interesting perlmutter said knitting his brow first of all he seems to be saying that the relics are real and second that this fel low aguirrez has them in his possession this certainly backs up the legendary accounts of rolands fall signora maggi poked her head in the door and asked if they needed anything nocci thanked her and said this is a fascinating document do you have any more papers authored by this man mar tmez im very sorry but there is nothing i can think of perlmutter tented his fingers and said martinez comes across in his writings as a man of great ego i would be surprised if he did not keep a journal of his daytoday activities it would be wonderful if such a book existed and we could get our hands on it perhaps at the state archives in seville signora maggi was only halflistening she was reading a sheet of paper that had been tucked into the box with the other records this is a list of all the manuscripts in this box apparently one of the doc uments was taken from this file by a previous curator and sent on to the venice state archives what sort of document perlmutter asked it is described here as an exoneration of a man of the sea writ ten by an englishman captain richard blackthorne it was sup posed to be returned but there are more than ninety kilometers of archives covering a thousand years of history so sometimes things fall through the cracks as you americans say id love to read blackthornes account perlmutter said im due in milan tomorrow but perhaps i can divert to venice perhaps it wont be necessary she took the file into her office and they could hear the soft clicking of a computer keyboard she reap peared after a moment i have contacted the venice state archives and asked for a virtual search of the records once the document is found it can be copied and transmitted through the internet well done perlmutter said and my heartfelt thanks signora maggi kissed perlmutter on both fleshy cheeks and be fore long he and nocci were driving through the suburbs of flo rence exhausted by the activities of the day perlmutter took a nap and awoke just in time for dinner he and nocci dined on the ter race he had regained his gustatory equilibrium and had no trouble downing his veal and pasta dishes after finishing up with a spinach salad and a simple doici of fresh fruit they watched the sun go down silently sipping on glasses oflimoncello the phone rang and nocci went to answer it while perlmutter sat in the dark savoring the smell of earth and grapevines carried to his tulip nose by a light evening breeze nocci appeared a few minutes later and summoned perlmutter into a small stateoftheart com puter room noting his guests upraised eyebrow nocci said even a business as small as mine must use the latest in communications in order to survive in the global market that was signora maggi he said sit ting down in front of the monitor she apologizes for the delay but the document you requested had to be retrieved from the museo storico navale the naval museum where it had been languishing here he said and rose to give up his seat the sturdy wooden chair creaked in protest when perlmutter set tied in he scanned the title page on which the author declared the iournal to be an account of an unwilling mercenary in the service of the spanish inquisition perlmutter leaned forward stared into the screen and began to read the words that had been written five centuries before the beer truck rounded a sharp curve and the driver slammed on his brakes to avoid hitting the battered wreck in the road the car that lay on its side a few yards from the edge looked as if it had been dropped from a great height two more wrecks smoldered at the bottom of the dropoff hundreds of feet below the driver hurried from his truck and peered into the car window he was surprised to discover that the people inside were still alive the trucker called for help on his cb radio the rescue crew had to use mechanical jaws to extricate the trouts and then the couple was taken to a small but wellequipped hospital paul suffered from a broken wrist gamay had a concussion and they were both covered with bumps and bruises they spent the night under observation went through another exam the next morning and were pronounced fit to go they were signing out at the front desk when two men wearing rumpled suits arrived identified themselves as provincial police and asked to talk with them they settled into an unoccupied visitors lounge and the trouts were asked to tell what happened the senior man was named mac farlane in a classic goodcop badcop pairing he was the friendly one who tuttutted while his partner a man named duffy was the belligerent officer who tried to pick holes in their story after replying to a particularly pointed question gamay who could never be mistaken for a shrinking violet stared at duffy and gave him a smile i may be wrong officer but it sounds as if were being accused of something macfarlane fidgeted with his hands its not that maam but look at it from our point of view you and your husband arrive in town from out of nowhere within twentyfour hours a fisherman you were seen with goes missing along with his boat then four men are killed in a very unusual accident damned bloody death plague if you ask me duffy growled weve told you everything paul said we were on vacation and went out with a fisherman named mike neal whom we met at a waterfront restaurant you can check with the bartender mr neal was looking for work and offered to take us out for a cruise pretty expensive cruise duffy sneered the boatyard says you paid offneals bill of nearly a thousand dollars were both ocean scientists when we learned about the problems the fishermen had been having with low catches we asked mr neal to do some survey work what happened next we stayed overnight at a bed and breakfast the next morning we learned that mr neal and his boat had been lost we were con tinuing our trip when we were caught between two very bad driv ers driving two very big cars from what you said duffy said making no attempt to hide his skepticism it sounds like these folks were trying to run you off the road it seems that way thats what we cant figure duffy said scratching the stubble on his chin why would they try to kill a couple of innocent tourists youll have to ask them paul said duffys ruddy face went an even deeper red he opened his mouth to respond macfarlane raised his hand to shush his partner those folks are in no condition to answer questions he said with a wan smile but you see this presents another problem the young lady here stopped at a general store and asked about a fish plant in town the four gentlemen who were killed were all employees of the same plant im a marine biologist gamay said my interest in fish is noth ing odd i dont mean to tell you how to do your job she said in a tone that indicated that was exactly what she was doing but maybe you should talk to someone at the plant thats another funny thing duffy said the plants closed gamay hid her surprise with a shrug and girded herself for more questions but just then macfarlanes cell phone rang saving them from another round of the third degree he excused himself got up and moved into the hall out of earshot a few minutes later he came back in and said thanks for your time folks you can go i wont argue with you officer but could you tell us whats going on paul said a minute ago we were public enemies one and two the worried expression that had been on macfarlanes face ear lier was replaced by a friendly smile that was the station we made some inquiries when we saw the id cards in your wallets just got a call from washington seems like you two are pretty important peo ple at numa well prepare a couple of statements and get them to you for additions and signatures anywhere we can take you he seemed relieved at the resolution of a difficult situation a rentalcar agency might be a good start gamay said and a pub would be a good finish paul said on the drive to the car rental office duffy dropped his badcop act and told them how to get to a pub where the beer and food were good and cheap the policemen who were going offduty invited themselves along too by the time they got into their second pint the detectives were very talkative they had retraced the trouts foot steps talking to the bandb owners and a few regulars around the waterfront mike neal was still missing and the man named gro gan had also disappeared there was no telephone number for the oceanus plant they were still trying to contact the corporations in ternational office but were having little luck gamay ordered another beer after the police officers left she blew off the foamy head and in an accusatory tone said thats the last time i take a drive in the country with you at least you didnt break any bones i have to drink my beer with my left hand and how am i going to tie my bow ties heaven forbid you use snapons you poor boy have you seen the dark circle under my eye i believe its what we called a mouse when i was a kid paul leaned over and lightly kissed his wife on the cheek on you it looks exotic i suppose thats better than nothing gamay said with an in dulgent smile what do we do now we cant go back to wash ington with nothing to show but a few lumps and repair bills for a nonexistent boat he sipped his beer what was the name of that scientist mike neal tried to contact throckmorton neal said he was at mcgill university montreal why not drop by and see him as long as were in the neighborhood brilliant idea gamay said enjoy your beer lefty ill update kurt on our plans gamay took her cell phone to a relatively quiet corner of the pub and called numa austin was out so she left a message saying they were following the oceanus trail to quebec and would be in contact she asked austins secretary to track down a telephone number for throckmorton and to see if she could put together a flight to mon treal several minutes later the secretary called back with the phone number and two reservations on a flight leaving later that day gamay called throckmorton she said she was a numa marine biologist and wondered if he had any time to talk about his work he was delighted and flattered he said and would be free after his last class their air canada flight landed at dorval airport around midafternoon they dropped their baggage off at the queen eliza beth hotel and caught a cab to the mcgill university campus a clus ter of gray granite older buildings along with more modern structures on the side of mont royal professor throckmorton was wrapping up his lecture as the trouts arrived and emerged from his classroom surrounded by a flock of chattering students throckmortons eye caught gamays stunning red hair and took in pauls tall figure he shooed away the students and came over to greet the newcomers the doctors trout i presume he said pumping their hands thank you for seeing us on such short notice gamay said not at all he said warmly its an honor to meet scientists from numa im flattered that youre interested in my work paul said we were traveling in canada and when gamay learned about your research she insisted that we make a detour hope im not the source of marital discord he said bushy eye brows jumping like startled caterpillars not at all gamay said montreal is one of our favorite cities well then now that weve got that settled why dont you come up to the lab and see whats on the slab as they say didnt they say that in the rocy horror picture showy gamay said correct some of my colleagues have taken to calling me the mad scientist frank n furter throckmorton was ofshorterthanaverage height chubby rather than plump and the roundness of his body was repeated in his moon shaped face and his circular eyeglasses yet he moved with the quick ness of an athlete as he led the way to the lab he ushered the trouts through a door and into a large brightly lit space and motioned for them to sit down at a lab table comput ers were scattered at stations around the room aerators bubbled in a series of tanks on the far side of the lab and a briny smell of fish filled the room throckmorton poured three lab beakers of iced tea and sat down at the table how did you hear about my work he said after a sip from his beaker something in a scientific journal the trouts exchanged glances to be honest gamay said we dont know what youre working on seeing throckmortons puzzled expression paul jumped in and said we got your name from a fisherman by the name of mike neal he said he had contacted you on behalf of the men in his fleet their catches were off and they thought it might have something to do with an odd type of fish he and the other fishermen in his town were landing oh yes mr neal his call was directed to my office but i never talked to him i was out of the country when he called and ive been too busy to get back to him sounded quite intriguing something about a devilfish maybe i can give him a call later today i hope you get good longdistance rates paul said neal is dead i dont understand he was killed in a boat explosion gamay said the police dont know what caused it a stunned expression crossed throckmortons face poor man he paused then said i hope this doesnt seem callous but i suppose now ill never know about this strange devilfish well be glad to tell you what we know gamay said throckmorton listened intently as gamay and paul took turns describing their trip with neal as each detail unfolded the cheer fulness drained from throckmortons rosycheeked face he gazed solemnly from gamay to paul are you absolutely certain of every thing you told me youre quite sure of the size of the fish and the strange white color and its aggressiveness see for yourself paul said producing the videotape shot on neals boat after viewing the tape throckmorton rose solemnfaced from his chair and paced back and forth hands clasped behind his back over and over he muttered this is not good not good at all gamay had a disarming way of cutting to the chase please tell us whats going on professor he stopped his pacing and sat down again as a marine biologist you must know about transgenic fish he said the first one was de veloped practically in your backyard at the university of maryland biotechnology institute ive read a number of papers but i cant say im an expert on the subject from what i understand genes are spliced into fish eggs to make them grow faster thats right the genes come from other species even from in sects and humans humans i dont use human genes in my experiments i agree with the chinese who are heavily into biofish research that using human genes in this manner is unethical how are the genes used they produce unusually high levels of growth hormones and stimulate the fishs appetite ive been developing transgenic fish with the federal department of fisheries and oceans lab in vancouver the salmon grown there are fed twenty times a day the constant feeding is essential these supersalmon are programmed to grow eight times faster forty times larger than normal in the first year you can see what a boon this is for a fish farmer he brings a fatter fish to market in a fraction of the time thus ensuring a larger profit to be sure those pushing to bring biofish to market call it the blue revolution they admit theyd like to increase profits but they say they have an altruistic motive as well dnaaltered fish will pro vide a cheap and plentiful source of food for the poorer nations of the world i think i heard the same arguments in favor of dnamodified crops gamay said with good reason genetically modified fish were a logical out growth of the biotech food trend if you can engineer corn why not do the same for higher living organisms this is likely to be far more controversial though the protests have already started the oppo nents say transgenic fish could mess up the environment wipe out the wild fishery and put the small fisherman out of business theyre call ing these biotech creations frankenfish catchy name said paul who had been listening with interest to the conversation cant see it selling too many fish where do you stand on this issue gamay said since i created some of these fish i have a special responsibility i want to see more study before we start raising these creatures on fish farms the push to commercialize what weve been doing worries me we need extensive risk assessment before we trigger what could be a disaster you sound very worried gamay said its what i dont know that concerns me things are spinning out of control dozens of commercial operations are pushing to bring their own fish to market more than two dozen fish species are being researched in addition to salmon the potential is enormous al though some fish farmers are turning away from transgenics because of the controversy but big corporations have been moving in there are dozens of patents for gene changes in canada and the us an economic and scientific juggernaut like that will be hard to stop once it gets going i feel like king canute trying to shout down the ocean the frustration was apparent in his voice billions of dollars are at stake so the pressure is enormous thats why the canadian government funds transgenic research the feeling is that if we dont lead the way others will we want to be ready when the dam bursts if there is so much pressure and money involved whats holding back the biofish tide a potential public relations nightmare let me give you an ex ample a new zealand company called king salmon was develop ing biofish but word about twoheaded and lumpcovered fish leaked out and the press whipped the public into a frenzy king had to stop its experiments and destroy everything because people were worried that these frankenfish might escape into the wild and start mating with normal ones is something like that a possibility gamay said not with contained fishfarming but i have no doubt that trans genic fish would escape if they were placed in openwater cages they are aggressive and hungry like a convict who yearns for free dom theyd find a way the government fisheries lab in vancouver is as tight as fort knox weve got electronic alarms security guards doublescreened tanks to keep fish from getting away but a private company might be less cautious gamay nodded weve had invasions of foreign species in us waters with potentially damaging results the asian swamp eel has been found in some statesits a voracious creature that can slither across dry land asian carp are in the mississippi river and there are worries they can get into lake michigan they grow up to four feet long and there have been stories of them jumping out of the water and knocking people out of boats but the real worry is the way they suck up plankton like a vacuum cleaner then theres the lion fish a real cutie they carry spines that can poison humans and they com pete for food with native species you make an excellent point but the situation with transgenic fish is even more complicated than a competition for food some of my colleagues are more worried about the trojan gene effect you recall the story of the trojan horse naturally the wooden horse filled with greek soldiers said paul the trojans thought it was a gift brought it inside their city wallsand that was the end of troy an appropriate analogy in this case throckmorton said he tapped his finger against the cover of a thick staplebound re port that was lying on the table this was published by english na ture the group that advises the british government on conservation matters it contains the results of two studies as a result of the find ings english nature is opposing release oftransgenic fish unless they are made infertile and a house of lords committee wants an out right ban on gm fish the first study was done at purdue univer sity where researchers found that transgenic male fish have a fourfold advantage in breeding larger fish are preferred as mates by females who says size isnt important paul said with his usual dry humor it happens to be very important in fish the researchers looked at the japanese medaka whose transgenic offspring were twenty two percent larger than their siblings these big males made up eighty percent of the breeding against twenty percent for the smaller males gamay leaned forward with her brow furrowed it would even tually be a disaster for the wild population worse than a disaster more like a catastrophe if you had one transgenic fish in a population of gm fish would become fifty percent of the population within sixteen generations which isnt long in fish terms gamay commented throckmorton nodded you can cut that time even further com puter models show that if you introduced sixty dnaaltered fish into a population of sixty thousand it would take only forty genera tions to pollute the gene pool to extinction you said there was a second study throckmorton rubbed his hands together oh yes it gets even better the researchers at universities in al abama and california gave salmon growthpromoter genes to some channel catfish they found that these transgenic fish were better at avoiding predators than were their natural counterparts to put it succinctly you think one of these superfish might get into the wild where it would outbreed and outlive the natural species quickly driving them to extinction thats it paul shook his head in disbelief given what youve just told us he said why would any government or company be fooling around with genetic dynamite like this i understand what youre saying but in the hands of a profes sional dynamite can be extremely useful throckmorton rose from his chair come see dr frankensteins workbench is right this way he led them to the other side of the lab the fish swimming in the tanks ranged in size from fingerlength to a couple of feet long he stopped in front of one of the larger tanks a silverscaled fish with a dark ridge along its spine was swimming slowly from one end of the tank to the other well what do you think of our latest genetically modified mon ster gamay leaned close so that her nose was inches from the glass looks like any other wellfed salmon you might see swimming in the atlantic ocean maybe a little more girth around the middle than normal appearances can be deceiving how old would you say this hand some fellow is id guess its about a year old actually only a few weeks ago it was a mere egg impossible i would agree with you if i hadnt played midwife at its birth what youre looking at is an eating machine weve managed to soup up its metabolism if that creature were placed in the wild it would quickly outeat the native stocks its little brain shouts one message over and over feed me im hungry watch throckmorton opened a cooler extracted a bucket of small bait fish and threw a handful into the tank the salmon pounced on the fish and within moments it had devoured its meal then it devoured the floating shreds i practically grew up on a fishing boat paul said with wide eyes ive seen shark go for a hooked cod and schools of blues drive bait fish onto the beach but ive never come across anything like this are you sure you didnt insert some piranha genes into your little baby nothing that complicated although we did some physical engi neering as well salmon have weak brittle teeth so we gave this model sharper more durable dentures that allow it to eat more quickly amazing gamay said equally impressed by the display this fish was only slightly modified weve built some real mon sters true frankenfish we destroyed them immediately so that there was no chance they might escape into the wild we found that we could control size but i started to worry when i saw how aggressive our creations were even though they looked fairly normal gamay said the fish we caught was aggressive and abnormal in size the worried look came back onto throckmortons face theres only one conclusion i can draw your devilfish was a mutant created in a lab someone is doing research that has gotten out of control in stead of destroying their mutants theyve allowed them into the wild its a shame the fish you caught was destroyed i can only hope that it was sterile what would happen if genetically engineered fish like the one we may have seen start to propagate a biotech fish is basically an alien species its no different than an exotic lifeform brought in from mars and introduced into our en vironment i see environmental and economic damage on an un precedented scale they could destroy whole fishing fleets causing huge economic hardship like that experienced by mr neal and his fellow fishermen it would totally upset the balance of nature in the waters along our coasts where the most productive areas are i have no idea what the longterm consequences would be let me play devils advocate gamay said after some thought suppose these socalled superfish did supplant the natural popula tion the commercial fishermen would in effect become the preda tors who keep the population within reasonable limits you would still have fish that could be harvested and sold at market they would just be bigger and meatier and meaner paul noted there are too many unknowns to take the risk throckmorton said in norway hybrid salmon escaped into the sea and bred suc cessfully with the native fish but were less able to survive in the wild so you could have a case where the superfish that replaces the wild stock dies out as a species eliminating itself as well as the natural pop ulation a sardonic voice said my dear throckmorton are you trying to frighten these poor people with your dire warnings a man wearing a lab coat had quietly slipped into the lab and was observing them a wide smile on his face frederick professor throckmorton said beaming turning to the trouts he said this is my esteemed colleague dr barker frederick these are the doc tors trout from numa in an audible aside throckmorton said they may call me frankenstein but this is dr strangelove both men laughed over the shared joke barker came over and shook hands he was in his early fifties with an imposing physique a shaved head and sunglasses that hid his eyes his skin had a bleachedout look to it its a great pleasure to meet someone from numa please dont let throckmorton frighten you youll never eat a salmon amandine again after listening to him what brings you to mcgill we were on vacation and heard about dr throckmortons work gamay said as a marine biologist i thought there might be something in it numa would be interested in a busmans holiday well let me defend myself against this slan der i am a strong proponent oftransgenic fish which makes me sus pect in the eyes of my friend here the doctor is more than a proponent he is affiliated with some of the biotech companies that are pushing to bring these creatures to market you make it sound like a dark conspiracy throckmorton my friend forgets to tell you that i am working with the full complicity and financial support of the canadian government dr barker would like to create a designer salmon so that peo ple could have a different flavor every day of the week thats not a bad idea throckmorton do you mind if i bor row it only if you claim full responsibility for creating such a monster the professor worries too much he gestured toward the fish tank that fine fellow is proof there is no need to create a transgenic fish of monstrous size and as he said biotech fish are less able to sur vive in the wild its easy enough to sterilize the fish so they wont replicate themselves yes but sterilization techniques are less than one hundred per cent reliable you might not be so casual after you hear the news that the trouts have brought me throckmorton asked the trouts to tell their story and run the video again when they were finished he said what do you make of it frederick barker shook his head im afraid i share some blame i got the message from neal when he called but i never called him back and what do you think barkers smile had disappeared i would say that it was impossi ble if it had not been witnessed by two qualified observers and video taped this has all the earmarks of a transgenic experiment gone wrong who would be so irresponsible as to let a fish like this escape into the wild apparently there are others if we are to believe the fish ermen we must get someone in the field immediately i agree wholeheartedly its evident that this white devilfish is al ready competing with the wild species for food whether it can pass along its genes is another question thats what has bothered me all along about this whole issue its unpredictability throckmorton said barker glanced at his watch what is not unpredictable is my next class which meets in a few minutes he bowed slightly and shook hands with paul and gamay im sorry that i have to run a pleasure meeting you your colleague is fascinating gamay said he looks more like a professional wrestler than a geneticist oh yes frederick is one of a kind the female students love him he rides a motorcycle around the city which they think is very cool is there something wrong with his eyes you noticed the sunglasses of course frederick tends toward al binism as you can see from his lack of complexion he avoids the sun and his eyes are very sensitive to light his handicap hasnt hindered his accomplishments though everything i said about his brilliance is true though unlike me he is putting his expertise to work in the private sector hell probably become a millionaire anyway we must both thank you for alerting us ill start immediately to put a field team together weve taken enough of your time gamay said not at all its been a treat to talk to you i hope well meet again throckmorton asked if he could copy the video minutes later paul and gamay were in a cab headed down the hill to the hotel interesting afternoon paul said more so than you think while throckmorton and i were copy ing the tape i asked him who barkers employers were i thought it wouldnt hurt to have another lead to chase down he said the com pany was named aurora pretty name paul said with a yawn what did he say about it gamay smiled mysteriously he said aurora is a subsidiary of a larger company paul blinked dont tell me she nodded oceanus he thought about it for a moment then said i tried to look at this as if i were creating a computer graphic but the problem is more like a kids picture puzzle barker is one dot the guys who tried to drive us off the road are another dot if we connect the two we can start to sketch out a picture so our course of action is very clear and what might that be gamay said with skepticism paul gave her a lopsided grin we have to come up with more dots the location ryan had suggested for a rendezvous was only a few minutes from numa headquarters austin drove along the george washington parkway to a sign that said theodore roosevelt island he parked his car walked over the footbridge that spanned a narrow waterway called little river and followed a path to the roosevelt memorial a wide plaza edged by low benches ryan was standing with his back to the bronze statue of the president apparently keeping an eye out for austin ryan waved him over thanks for coming kurt ryan turned and gazed up at the statue tr stood with legs wide apart fist raised high in the air teddy up there got me into this crazy business he put millions of acres under federal protection saved endangered birds from the plume hunters and made the grand canyon a national park he wasnt afraid to push the law to its lim its when he thought he was acting in the public good whenever i have doubts about what im doing i think of this guy staring down the fat cats austin couldnt help feeling that ryan was posing for a photo op its hard to believe you have doubts about anything marcus oh i do believe me especially when i think of the task ive carved out for myself protecting the worlds oceans and the critters that live in them if i recall my mythology the seagod position has been filled for the last few thousand years ryan smirked like a guilty child yeah i guess i do sound god like at times but mythology also tells us that gods commonly appoint themselves to their positions ill remember that if i ever lose my job at numa therri said you wanted to talk to me about something important yes ryan said looking past austins shoulder there she is now as a matter of fact therri was walking across the plaza with a young man austin guessed to be in his early twenties he had reddishbrown skin a broad face and high cheekbones good to see you again kurt therri said extending her hand her manner was businesslike in front of the other men but her eyes told austin she hadnt forgotten the goodnight kiss in copenhagen or at least thats what he hoped they said this is ben nighthawk ben is a research assistant in our office ryan suggested that they move off to the side of the memorial when he was sure they could talk out of the earshot of any wander ing tourists he wasted no time ben has uncovered some important information on oceanus he said with a nod from ryan the young indian began to tell his story i come from a tiny village in northern canada its pretty remote on a big lake and usually its pretty quiet up there a few months ago my mother wrote me a letter saying someone had bought a huge tract of land across the lake from the village big corporation she thought i hope to work against overdevelopment of the canadian wilds when i get out of college so i got really interested when she said they were building night and day on the lake helicopters and float planes were coming in at all hours i asked my mother to keep me up to date and the last time i heard from her was more than two weeks ago she was really worried about what austin said she didnt say only that it had something to do with the stuff going on across the lake so i got worried and went home to take a lookand my family was gone youre saying they disappeared austin said nighthawk nodded everyone in the village had vanished canadas a big place ben where was your village located nighthawk glanced at ryan in good time kurt ryan said tell mr austin what happened next ben i went looking for my family nighthawk continued i found them being kept prisoner on the other side of the lake guys with guns were forcing the men from my village to work clearing land around a big building do you know who they were i never saw them before they were dressed in black uniforms he looked at ryan for encouragement then went on its crazy but when we got there we ryan said josh green my next in command went along with ben dont be afraid to tell mr austin everything you saw no mat ter how wild it seems nighthawk shrugged okay then when we first got there we didnt see anything but forest except for where they were clearing then this huge building suddenly appeared out of nowhere he paused waiting for austin to reply with disbelieving laughter austin kept his bluegreen eyes leveled go on he said his face impassive thats it instead of trees we were looking at a giant dome josh and i thought it looked like an eskimo igloo only hundreds of times bigger while we were watching the top of the thing opened like this he cupped his hands to form an open clamshell turned out it was a hangar for a blimp austin said something like the goodyear blimp nighthawk screwed up his mouth in thought naw bigger and longer more like a rocket ship it even had a name on the fin niet zsche like the german philosopher i guess so ben said we saw the thing land in the hangar and the roof closed again and then a bunch of guys came out the front door my cousin was in a work gang and he tried to run for it and one of those bastards killed him nighthawks voice became choked with emotion ryan put his hand on nighthawks shoulder thats enough for now ben austin said id like to help but im going to need more details ryan said well be glad to fill you in but the information comes with a price austin raised an eyebrow im a little short of change today marcus were not interested in money we want sos and numa to work together to bring oceanus down we share the information you include us in any mission austin showed his teeth in a wide grin youd be better off call ing in the marines ryan numa is a scientific organization dedi cated to gathering knowledge its not a military organization cmon kurt youre being disingenuous ryan said with a knowing smile we researched your job at numa this special as signments team you run has come up against some pretty hard cases you didnt stop the bad guys by whacking them over the head with a scientific treatise you flatter me marcus i dont have the power to authorize a joint mission id have to run it by higherups ryan took the answer as a qualified yes i new youd come around he said triumphantly thank you so much save your thanks i have no intention of going to the head hon chos why not numa would be putting its reputation on the line if it worked with a fringe organization like sos on the other hand youd gain public support for the sentinels by putting them under numas um brella of legitimacy sorry its a onesided deal ryan brushed back his hair we havent told you everything kurt i have a personal stake in this as well it wasnt just bens cousinjosh green was killed it was my fault ben said i ran into the open and he tried to stop me they shot him you did what anyone would have done in your place ryan said josh was a brave man youre talking about two murders now austin said have you reported them to the police no we want to deal with this ourselves and theres something olse that may persuade you to change your mind we tracked down ae new owner of the land around bens lake it was a real estate straw corporation set up by oceanus youre sure of that positive are you with us now austin shook his head before you buckle on your sixshooters and ride off let me remind you what youre up against oceanus has money and worldwide connections and as youve seen they dont hesitate to commit coldblooded murder theyd swat you and any one you brought in from sos like a fly im sorry about bens cousin and your friend getting killed but it only proves what ive been say ing youll be putting your people in similar danger he glanced pointedly at therri theyre willing to take any risk for the environment ryan said apparently numa doesnt give a damn about it hold on marcus therri said she had seen austins jaw harden kurt has a point maybe we could offer a compromise sos could work behind the scenes with numa spoken like a true lawyer austin said therri hadnt expected austins quick rebuff whats that sup posed to mean she said a hint of coldness creeping into her voice i think this is less about the whales and the walruses and dead friends and more about your friends ego he turned back to ryan youre still ticked off about the loss of the sea sentinel she was your pride and joy you were going to play the martyr in front of the cable news cameras but the danes beat you to the punch when they dropped the charges and quietly kicked you out of their country thats not true therri said marcus is ryan silenced her with a wave of his hand dont waste your breath its apparent that kurt is a fairweather friend better than no friend at all austin said he pointed toward the statue of roosevelt maybe you should go back and read that guy s resume again he didnt ask others to stick their necks out sorry to hear about your cousin ben and about josh green nice to see you again therri austin had had his fill ofryans selfaggrandizement hed been hopeful when he heard nighthawks story but angry at ryan for slamming the door on a possible lead he was striding down the path when he heard footsteps from behind therri had followed him from the memorial she caught up with him and grabbed him lightly by the arm kurt please reconsider marcus really needs your help i can see that but i cant agree to his conditions we can work something out she pleaded if you and ben want help from numa youll have to cut loose from ryan i cant do that she said bringing the power other lovely eyes to bear i think you can austin said boring back with his own equally intense gaze damnit austin she said with exasperation youre one stub born bastard austin chuckled does that mean you wont go out to dinner with me therris face darkened with anger and she spun on her heel and strode off along the path austin watched her until she disappeared around a curve he shook his head the sacrifices i make for numa he thought he started off toward the parking lot only to stop short a minute later when a figure popped out of the woods it was ben nighthawk i made an excuse to get away nighthawk said breathlessly i told marcus i had to use the rest room i had to talk to you i dont blame you for not wanting to hook up with sos marcus has let all ac publicity go to his head he thinks hes wyatt earp but i saw those guys kill my cousin and josh i tried to tell him what hes up against but he wont listen if sos goes in my family is dead meat tell me where they are and ill do what i can its tough to explain ill have to draw you a map oh hell ryan was striding up the path toward them an angry expression on his handsome face call me austin said ben nodded and walked back to meet ryan they became en gaged in what looked like a heated discussion then ryan put his arm around ben and guided him back to the memorial he turned back once to glare at austin who shrugged off the evil eye and headed back to his car twenty minutes later austin strolled into the air and space museum on independence avenue he took the elevator to the third floor and was headed toward the library when he encountered a middleaged man in a wrinkled tan suit who had stepped out of a side room kurt austin as i live and breathe the man said i wondered if id bump into you mac always a good chance of that around here i practically live within these walls hows the pride ofnuma these days fine hows the smithsonians answer to st julien perlmutter macdougal chortled at the question tall and lean with fine sandy hair and a hawknose that dominated his narrow face he was the physical antithesis of the portly perlmutter but what he lacked in girth he made up for with an encyclopedic knowledge of air history that was every bit the equivalent of perlmutters grasp of the sea st julien carries much more um weight in the historical world than i do he said with a twinkle in his gray eyes what brings you into the rarified atmosphere of the archives division im doing some research on an old airship i was hoping id find something in the library no need to go to the archives im on my way to a meeting but we can talk on the way austin said have you ever come across a mention of an airship called the nietzsche oh sure only one airship had that namethe one that was lost on the secret polar expedition of you know it then he nodded there were rumors that the germans had sent an airship to the north pole on a secret mission if it had succeeded it was meant to cow the allies and tout the glories of german kultur in the propaganda war the germans denied it but they couldnt ex plain the disappearance of two of their greatest airship pioneers heinrich braun and herman lutz the war came along and the sto ries faded so that was it oh no after the war papers were discovered that suggested strongly that the flight had indeed taken place with an airship sim ilar to the graf zeppelin the airship supposedly sent a radio message as it neared the pole they had discovered something of interest on the ice they didnt say what no and some people believe it was a fabrication anyhow maybe something josef goebbels made up butyo believe the accounts its entirely possible certainly the technology was there what could have happened to the airship there are all sorts of possibilities engine failure sudden storm ice human error the graf zeppelin was a highly successful aircraft but were talking about operating in extreme conditions other air ships have come to similar fates it could have crashed into the pack ice been carried hundreds of miles away and gone into the sea when the ice melted his face lit up dont tell me youve found traces of it at the bottom of the sea unfortunately no someone mentioned it to me and well my scientific curiosity got the better of me i know exactly what you mean he stopped in front of a door heres my meeting come by again and well talk some more i will thanks for your help austin was glad that mac wasnt pressing him further he didnt like being evasive with old friends macdougal paused with his hand on the doorknob the fact that were talking about the arctic is a funny coincidence theres a big reception tonight to open a new exhibition on eskimo culture and art people of the frozen north or something like that dogsled races the whole thing dogsled races in washington i said the same thing but apparently its so why dont you come by and see for yourself i may just do that as he was leaving the museum austin stopped at the information booth and picked up a brochure for the exhibition which was in fact called denizens of the frozen north the opening night reception was by invitation only he ran his eye down the brochure and stopped at the name of the sponsor oceanus he tucked the brochure in his pocket and drove back to his office a few calls later he had wrangled an invitation and after working awhile longer on his report to gunn he went home to change as he walked past the bookshelves in his combined living roomlibrary he ran his fingers along the spines of the neatly shelved volumes the voices of aristotle dante and locke seemed to speak to him austins fascination with the great philosophers went back to his college days and the influence of a thoughtprovoking professor later philosophy provided a distraction from his work and helped shed light on the darker elements of the human soul in the course of his assignments austin had killed men and injured others his sense of duty justice and selfpreservation had shielded him from crippling and perhaps dangerous selfdoubt but austin was not a callous man and philosophy gave him a moral compass to follow when he examined the rightness of his actions he extracted a thick volume flicked on the stereo so that the liq uid notes flowed from john coltranes saxophone then went out on the deck and settled into a chair riffling through the pages he quickly found the quote hed been thinking about since macdougal had mentioned a blimp named nietzsche whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster and when you lool into an abyss the abyss also loofs into you he stared off into space for a few moments wondering if he had seen the abyss or more important whether it was looking back at him then he closed the book put it back on the shelf and went to get ready for the reception a huge banner emblazoned with the words denizens of the frozen north was draped over the mall entrance to the national museum of natural history painted on the banner so there would be no mistaking the subject of the show were figures in hooded fur parkas riding dogsleds across a forbidding arctic land scape mountainous hulking icebergs loomed in the background austin walked between the portico columns and stepped into the museums expansive octagonal rotunda at the center of the eighty footwide space was a masterpiece of taxidermy an african elephant charging across an imaginary savanna the twelveton animal dwarfed the petite decent standing under its upraised trunk good evening the young woman said with a smile handing austin a program she was wearing a lightweight facsimile of tradi tional eskimo dress welcome to the denizens of the frozen north exhibition go through that door and youll see the displays in the special exhibition hall a movie on eskimo culture will be showing every twenty minutes in the i max theater the sled dog and harpoon competitions will be held on the mall in about fifteen minutes should be quite exciting austin thanked the guide and trailed the guests into the special ex hibit area the welllit display cases were filled with eskimo art work and ivory carvings tools for hunting and fishing cleverly fashioned skin suits and boots that would keep their owners warm and dry in the coldest of arctic temperatures driftwood sleds canoes and whaleboats a doleful chant backed by the beat of a tomtom came from speakers scattered around the hall the chattering crowd was the usual combination of washington politicians bureaucrats and press for all its importance in the world washington was still a small town and austin recognized a number of familiar faces he was talking to a historian from the navy mu seum who was a kayak enthusiast when he heard his name called angus macdougal from the air and space museum was making his way through the milling guests he took austins arm come over here kurt theres someone i want you to meet he led austin to a dignifiedlooking grayhaired man and intro duced him as charles gleason the curator of the exhibition i told chuck that you were interested in eskimos macdougal said actually they prefer to be called inuit which means the peo ple gleason said eskimo was a name the indians gave them it means eaters of raw flesh their name for themselves is nakooruk which means good he smiled sorry for the lec ture i taught college for many years and the pedagogue in me keeps reasserting itself no apology necessary austin said i never resist the opportu nity to learn something new thats very kind of you do you have any questions on the exhi bition i was wondering about the sponsor austin said he read the placard stating that items in the case were on loan from oceanus and he decided to take a long shot ive heard the head of oceanus is a man named toonook toonook thats right gleason gave him a wary look youre serious very id like to meet the gentleman gleason replied with a strange half smile and made a sound be tween a chortle and a snicker unable to contain himself he burst forth with a loud guffaw sorry he said but id hardly call toonook a gentleman toonook is the inuit name of an evil spirit hes considered to be the creator and destroyer youre saying toonook is a mythological name thats right the inuit say hes in the sea the earth and the air every time theres an unexpected noise like the ice cracking under foot its toonook looking for a victim when the wind howls like a pack of hungry wolves its toonook austin was confused toonook was the name therri had given him as the head of oceanus i can see why my question made you laugh austin said with an embarrassed smile i must have mis understood theres no misunderstanding as far as the inuit are concerned gleason said when they travel alone they keep an eye out for toonook they carry a bone knife and wave it around to keep toonook at bay austins eye drifted past gleasons shoulder something like the little pig sticker in that display case gleason tapped the glass in front of the ornately carved white blade thats a very rare and unusual item in what way most inuit knives were tools mainly used for skinning that knife was made with one purpose to kill other human beings odd austin said i had always heard that the eskimos were a peaceful and goodnatured people very true they live in close quarters in a harsh and demanding environment where tempers could easily flare into violence they know cooperation is vital to survival and so theyve evolved a whole set of rituals and customs to diffuse aggression that knife looks about as aggressive as it gets gleason nodded in agreement the inuit are subject to the same dark passions as the rest of humankind the people who made that weapon were from a tribe that broke the peaceful mold we think they came from siberia in prehistoric times and settled in northern quebec they tended toward rape pillage human sacrifice very nasty the other communities banded together many years ago and drove them off they named them kiolya doesnt ring a bell its the inuit name for the aurora borealis which the arctic peo ple regard as the manifestation of evil the real name of the tribe no one knows what happened to the kiolya they scattered around canada many of them ended up in the cities where their descendants formed criminal enterprises murder for hire and extortion mainly some of them retained their old tribal customs such as the vertical tattoos over the cheekbones until they found that it identified them easily to the police im curious how is an exhibition like this pulled together in many different ways with this one a public relations firm from oceanus approached the museum and asked if we would be in terested in placing the show they said the sponsors had a strong in terest in educating the public on inuit culture and they would organize the exhibition and pay all costs well we couldnt resist its a fascinating show dont you think austin stared at the kiolya knife which was identical to the weapon that had slashed his chest open at the faroe islands fish farm he was thinking about the vertical tattoos on the face of the man whod wielded the knife yes fascinating he said since i cant introduce you to toonook perhaps youd like to meet the representative from oceanus hes here i just spoke to him a few minutes ago in the diorama room fol low me the lights in the diorama room had been dimmed to simulate the arctic night lasers projected a moving display of the northern lights on the ceiling standing alone in front of a lifesized diorama show ing a seal hunt was a tall wellbuilt man with a shaved head dark sunglasses covered his eyes gleason approached the man and said dr barker id like you to meet kurt austin mr austin is with the national underwater and marine agency you must know of it i would have to come from another planet not to know numa they shook hands austin felt like his fingers were clutching a frozen side of beef i hope you dont mind if i share our little joke gleason said to kurt mr austin thought that the head of oceanus was named toonook mr gleason explained that toonook was not a man but an evil spirit austin said barker stared at austin through the dark lenses its more com plicated than that he said toonook is considered to be evil in the inuit culture he is the embodiment of that clever light display on the ceiling but like others through history the people of the north wor shipped the thing they feared the most toonook is a god then sometimes but i assure you that the head of oceanus is very human i stand corrected if its not toonook what is his real name he prefers to keep his identity a secret if youd like to call him toonook feel free to do so he has been called worse names by his competitors he stays out of the limelight and it falls upon his em ployees to represent him in my case i work for a company named aurora which is a subsidiary of oceanus what sort of work do you do for aurora im a geneticist austin glanced around the room this is a wide departure from genetics i like to get out of the lab i suggested that oceanus sponsor this exhibition i have a direct interest in the kiolya my greatgreat grandfather was a new england whaling captain he stayed with the tribe and tried to stop the walrus hunting that led to its dissolution mr gleason tells me that the other eskimos ran the kiolya off because they were thieves and murderers they did what they had to do to survive barker said id love to continue this discussion gleason said but youll have to excuse me i see an assistant who needs my attention please give me a call sometime and we can talk at length mr austin when gleason was gone austin said tell me dr barker what part of business is oceanus involved in that would require the serv ices of a geneticist the frozen smile disappeared come on austin were alone so we dont need to play games anymore you know very well what oceanus does you broke into our faroe islands operation caused a lot of damage and killed one of my men i wont forget it gee austin said now youve got me confused youve obvi ously mistaken me for someone else i dont think so the danish press published your picture every where youre quite the hero in denmark you know for rescuing their sailors after that collision a collision which your company engineered austin said drop ping all pretense and which would have worked except for your meddling the soft cultivated voice had become a snarl well that ends now youve interfered in my business for the last time your business i thought you were a humble employee for oceanus dr barker or should i call you toonook barker removed his glasses and stared at austin with palegray eyes the moving colors played across his ashen features as if pro jected on a screen who i am is not important what i am has a di rect bearing on your future i am the instrument of your death turn around austin glanced over his shoulder two swarthy men stood behind him blocking the way they had closed the door to keep the other guests out austin wondered which would offer him the better chance pushing barker through the display glass or bulling his way between the men at the door he had already decided he didnt like either option and was groping for a third when there was a knock at the door and macdougal stuck his head in hey kurt he called out im looking for charlie gleason sorry to interrupt you not at all austin said macdougal wasnt the seventh cavalry but he would do the guards looked for direction to barker he replaced his sun glasses gave austin his glacial smile and said til we meet again and made for the door the guards stepped aside to let him through and a second later all three men were lost in the crowd austins reunion with macdougal didnt last long as they merged with the crowd mac spotted a senator who was a friend of the smith sonian and he dashed off to collar him for funding austin mingled with the other guests until he heard an announcement saying that the dogsled races were about to begin he was heading back to the ro tunda when he caught a glimpse of chestnut hair cascading to bare shoulders therri must have felt his attention she turned and glared in his direction then she smiled kurt what a nice surprise she said as they shook hands she eyed him from head to toe you look quite handsome in your tuxedo austin hadnt expected the friendly greeting after the acrimony of their parting exchange on roosevelt island thanks he said hope it doesnt smell too strongly of mothballs she adjusted one of his lapels as if she were his prom date you smell quite nice as a matter of fact the same thing that attracted you im sure it didnt escape your attention that these displays are the property of oceanus thats the main reason were here therri glanced off to the side of the rotunda where ben nighthawk stood he looked uneasy in his black tuxedo unsure of what to do with his hands shifting his weight from one foot to the other she waved him over you remember ben therri said good to see you again austin said shaking hands nice tux thanks nighthawk said without enthusiasm its rented he glanced around at the other guests im a little out of my element dont worry austin said most of the people who come to these receptions are here for the food and the gossip ben agreed to escort me therri said marcus thought bens memory might be jogged by something he saw has it been not yet therri said what about you have you learned any thing yes he said with a tight smile ive learned that you dont lis ten to warnings of possible danger thats ancient history therri said like someone trying to be patient with an annoying child austin took in the challenging gaze and decided he was wasting his breath trying to change her mind im on my way outside to see the dogsled races he said would you like to join me thank you she said hooking her arm in nighthawks we were headed that way ourselves a guide directed them outside traffic on madison drive had been stopped to allow spectators to cross to the national mall it was a beautiful night lit by floodlights the red sandstone turrets of the smithsonian castle were clearly visible across the eighthundred foot width of greensward toward the potomac the plain white spike of the washington monument soared into the night sky a large section of open grass had been marked off with yellow po lice tape and was brightly illuminated by portable lights inside the enclosure orange pylons were arranged in a rectangle hundreds of reception guests in evening attire and passersby attracted by the lights and crowd ringed the perimeter a few national park service uniforms could be seen from the other side of the racecourse where several trucks were lined up came a sound like a kennel at feeding time then the excited yelps and barks were drowned out by a male voice on the public address system welcome to the denizens of the frozen north exhibition ladies and gentlemen the announcer said youre about to see the most exciting part of the show the dogsled competition this is more than a race the contestants from two different inuit communities in canada will demonstrate the skills needed to survive in the arctic the hunter must speed to the kill and use his harpoon with unerr ing accuracy as you know we dont have much snowfall in wash ington this time of year he paused to allow for the laughter so the racers will have wheels on their sleds instead of runners enjoy the show figures milled around the trucks then broke into two groups each pushing a sled toward an opening in the taped enclosure the sleds one bright blue the other fireengine red were brought to the starting point and placed side by side the wolflike sled dogs were taken from the kennel trailers and hooked into their harnesses excited by the prospect of a run the huskies grew more agitated the barking reached a crescendo as the impatient dogs pulled against their harnesses the ninedog teams with eight in pairs and one as leader exerted an amazing amount of muscle power when harnessed together even with the brakes set and handlers holding on the sleds inched forward two men the drivers obviously detached themselves from the others and climbed onto their sleds a second later the starting gun went off the drivers shouted commands the dogs dug their paws in and the sleds took off like twin rockets the dogs immediately went into an allout run unsure of the conditions on the grassy course the drivers slowed slightly as they came into the first turn there was some skidding but the sleds came out of the turn side by side and stayed neck and neck into the second curve successfully navigating it the sleds were moving at full tilt again as they raced toward the spot where austin stood behind the yellow tape next to them and ben the drivers urged the dogs on with loud kissing sounds in def erence to the mild evening the drivers were not dressed in hooded fur parkas instead wearing skin pants tucked into their boots sweat glistened on their bare chests the sleds were modified tube steel rigs like those used to train dogs when there is no snow for the runners to glide upon steel mesh platforms about six feet long and more than a yard wide nestled be tween four rubber airplane tires the sleds were steered by a small wheel at the top of a vertical tube frame the drivers stood with feet placed on narrow side extensions that flanked the main platform bodies hunched over the steering posts to cut wind resistance and lower the center of gravity as the sleds flashed by with whirring wheels the faces of the drivers were only a blur the racers were still abreast as they came into the third turn the red one was on the inside looking for a gain the driver tried to cut the turn tightly but the sled caught an edge and the wheels on the other side lifted off the ground a few inches the driver skillfully compensated with the weight of his body and a touch of the brake and the wheels slammed down again the bluesled driver took ad vantage of the lost gamble he could have gone wide but he finessed the turn with admirable skill and gained a quarter of a length in the straightaway the crowd was cheering madly and it went wild when the blue sled increased the lead to half a length another few feet and the blue sled would be able to pull over in front of the red one blocking the way and controlling the race the blue driver kept glancing over his shoulder looking for an opportunity he got his chance in the fourth and last curve the leading sled on the outside came into the turn at a perfect speed and angle to put him completely ahead of the other racer but the red sled suddenly veered to the right and its front wheel caught the leaders rearleft tire the blue sled fishtailed from the impact and the driver fought to bring it under control the dogs sensed the whiplash about to take place and tried to compensate by pulling harder but the centrifugal forces acting on the light vehicle proved too potent the blue sled went up on two wheels and flipped the driver went airborne like a circus performer shot out of a cannon he hit the grass hard rolled several times and lay still the dogs kept run ning and dragged the sled on its side until they could pull it no far ther then they began to fight among themselves the handlers ducked under the yellow tape and rushed in to get the dogs under control while others tended to the fallen driver the redsled driver pushed ahead at full speed although he had the race won not slowing until he had passed over the finish line the sled was still moving when he jumped off it and grabbed a harpoon from a barrel without pausing to aim he sent the spear winging to ward an archery target set up near the course the spear hit the bulls eye at dead center then he pulled a hatchet from his belt and hurled it at the target as well bullseye again the victorious driver raised his fists high in the air and let out a chilling cry of victory then strutted around the perimeter of the race course his wide mouth set in a grin his face like a malevolent jack olantern his arrogant posturing put to rest any doubts that the col lision was an accident a lone boo issued from the stunned crowd then was joined by others growing into an angry chorus as the spec tators showed their disapproval of the winning tactics disgusted with the race guests began to move back to the museum the driver gestured at the departing spectators as if daring some one to step forward his gaze swept the crowdlooking for anyone brave or foolish enough to take him onwhen it fell on austin the dark eyes narrowed into slits austin tensed standing only a few feet away was the man who had slashed him and tossed a hand grenade into his boat at the mermaids gate he would have recog nized the man from the hate burning in his feral eyes even without the vertical tattoo lines on the cheekbones and the mangled knot of flesh where austin had bashed him in the nose the thick lips in the dark wide face formed a silent word austin austin was stunned that the man knew his name but he hid his surprise using his most mocking tone he said long time no see nanook you owe me for the plastic surgery i did on your pretty face the driver stepped closer until they were a foot or so apart sepa rated only by the yellow tape austin could smell the mans fetid breath the name is umealiq he said i want you to call my name when you beg me for mercy dont blame you for being dissatisfied with your nose job austin said evenly you didnt give me a lot to work with pay me for the boat you blew up and well call it even the only payment you will get is deathff the man snarled his thick fingers dropped down to his belt and he began to slide the bone knife from its scabbard although most of the spectators had left there were still knots of people hanging around austin sensed that there was no safety in numbers and the man would not hesitate to kill him even in front of dozens of witnesses he clenched his right fist ready to send it crashing into the broken nose where it would inflict the most damage and pain then out of the corner of his eye he saw a sudden movement ben nighthawk had hurled himself at the driver the indian was too light and his tackling form too imperfect to do any damage the driver grunted and his squat body shuddered slightly from the im pact but he kept his footing and swatted nighthawk aside with a mighty blow again the hand groped for the knife and he took a step forward only to freeze at the sound of a commotion the bluesled driver was making his way across the mall accompanied by several angry han dlers dirt and blood stained his face umealiq whirled to face the newcomers they exchanged angry words obviously arguing over the race tactics with a quick burning glance back at austin the red sled driver pushed his way through the others and made his way back to the trucks therri was down on her knees tending to nighthawk austin went to her side and saw that the indians only injury was a bruise where hed been struck under the eye as they helped him to his feet he spit the words out that was the man who killed my cousin youre sure therri said nighthawk nodded dumbly his dazed eyes fixed on the figure walking across the mall and he stumbled forward austin saw where he was going and stepped in front of him barring his path he and his pals will kill you i don t care now is not the time austin said in a voice that said he wasnt yielding nighthawk saw that his determination wasnt enough to get him past austins wide shoulders he swore in his native language and stalked across the mall toward the museum therri said thanks for stopping ben we should tell the po lice not a bad idea but it might be a problem a group of men was striding onto the mall from the direction of the museum in the lead was the tall figure of dr barker he hailed austin like a longlost buddy nice to see you again austin im on my way out and stopped to say goodbye thanks but im not going anywhere oh but you are umealiq is waiting for you and your friend youre about to learn why he is named after the stoneheaded lance the inuit use on seal hunts barker pointed to where scarface stood in the middle of the race course then escorted by two bodyguards he strode off to where a limo awaited leaving the rest of his men behind others came running over from where the trucks were parked austin did a quick count and estimated that there were about twenty men in all not exactly great odds their prospects didnt get any bet ter when a couple of men ran over to the portable lights that had il luminated the racecourse and snapped them off the mall had become a big and lonely place the nearest police presence was a traffic cop on madison drive stopping cars so the guests could return to the museum the remaining guests were mak ing their way back to the reception and the passersby had resumed their strolls austins sharp eye followed the shadows that were mov ing across the grass in a classic encircling maneuver he took therris arm and tried to guide her toward the museum but barkers men barred their way it was a repeat of the scene in copenhagen but this time austin had no trashcan lid to use as a shield and a weapon he could see several strollers and even a cou ple of national park service people walking through the mall un mindful of the unfolding drama but decided against calling for help anyone he talked to would be put in immediate danger one light had been left on standing in the bullseye of illumina tion like an actor in the spotlight was umealiq his hand was on his scabbard his men were closing in from the sides and behind austin had no choice he took therris hand and they slowly began to walk toward what was certain death despite the aura of death in the air austin maintained an uncanny serenity he had developed the ability to shift his brain into what could best be described as a mental overdrive while his synapses continued to crackle an inner voice slowed his thought processes calmly taking in details fed to it by the senses and formu lating a plan of action he and therri faced two possible fates at a signal from their lead er the men pacing on both sides could carve them up with their hatch ets more likely austin judged scarface would do the job as he himself had promised austin was working on a third option al though it wouldnt have been apparent to their escorts he glanced fearfully around him giving the impression of being consumed with panic and confusion while mentally he mapped out an escape route and calculated the odds therri squeezed his hand until his knuckles hurt kurt what should we do she said with only the slightest tremor in her voice the question gave austin a sense of relief it told him that far from having given up hope therri was also looking for a way out of their predicament her determination suggested that she could call upon untapped reserves she would need them austin thought keep walking just think of it as a stroll in the park therri glanced sideways at their silent escorts some stroll some park i havent had so much fun since our copenhagen date the spark of humor was a good sign they took a few more steps austin murmured when i say mush i want you to follow my lead did you say mush thats right stay with me climb up on my heels if you have to no matter where i go stay close therri nodded and they continued to walk at a snails pace austin and therri had advanced close enough to scarface to see the hard eyes glittering like black diamonds under the lowcut bangs the others seemed in no hurry probably trying to draw out the terror as long as possible in their black coveralls the men looked like mourn ers at a wake austin saw them only as dangerous obstacles to be re moved or eluded the real focus of his attention lay off to the left the red dogsled had been left unattended the dogs sat or lay curled up on the grass eyes halfclosed mouths open in a canine grin austin took a deep breath timing would be everything another step closer to the end of their lives scarface anticipated their arrival his hand dropped to the hilt of the bone knife in its scabbard the cruel mouth widened in a smile like someone licking his chops over a tender steak he said something in an unintelligible language it was only a few words probably a gloating rernark but it caught the attention of his men who all looked in their leaders direction austin gripped thems hand ready he whispered she squeezed back mush austin sidestepped to his left yanked therri practically off her feet and lunged toward a gap in the line of pickets the guards saw them break out and tried to head them off like defensive lineback ers converging to stop a runner with the ball they raced toward the closing gap at the last moment austin changed direction he shook offtherris hand and putting all the weight of his body behind his shoulder smashed into the midsection of the guard to his left the man let out a sound like a malfunctioning steam engine and doubled over the other guard charged in hatchet in hand using the bounce from his first encounter austin came out of his crouch and slammed into the man with his other shoulder the impact lifted the other man off his feet the hatchet went flying onto the grass therri was right behind him a few more steps and they were at the sled the dogs noticed their approach and perked their ears up austin grabbed the sleds upright framework and held it tight he didnt want the dog team to bolt off without being instructed therri rolled onto the steelmesh platform then sat up legs extended forward hands gripping the uprights in front of her austin kicked off the brake hike he snapped in a clear commanding voice the sleds regular driver probably used an inuit command but the team knew from his tone what austin wanted mushers dont use the word mush to get dogs moving the word is too soft austin was a man of the sea but he wasnt above developing landbased skills dogsledding unfortunately wasnt among them he had tried dogsled driving a few times as a diversion on ski trips and after being thrown into snowdrifts a couple of times he discovered that it looked easier than it was the driver had to balance on runners that seemed as thin as knife blades while trying to control a pack of an imals only a few generations removed from their wolf brethren sled dogs were deceptively small but welded together in a team they produced an incredible explosion of power with their short legs he knew too that a dogsled driver had to come across as the leader of the pack if the strongwilled dogs were to respond to his commands the team was on its feet even before he shouted the com mand the gang line connecting the dogs to the sled went taut and the wheel almost jerked out of his hands austin ran several steps helping the sled along then he jumped on board and let the dogs do all the work they bayed loudly happy doing what they did best which was to run their hearts out from the instant he had gotten his hand on the sled the whole op eration had taken only a few seconds scarfaces men tried to cut the sled off the dogs were too fast they barked gleefully as they out distanced their pursuers once they were in the clear austin exper imented with the steering he tried gee and haw commands to make the dogs go right and left and he was glad to see that the team was multilingual steering required a tender touch on the wheel es pecially on the curves turn too sharply and the sled acted like the business end of a bullwhip although the weight of two people kept all four wheels on the ground the combined load also kept their speed down austin hadnt considered this a problem figuring that they could still outdistance a running man especially the burly scarface and his shortlegged cohorts his confidence drained away when he looked back umealiq s on the other sled in hot pursuit austin steered off the grass onto a paved walkway the sled picked up speed on the smooth asphalt but he had to share the walkway and this was presenting a problem as he wove around obstacles like a slalom racer he narrowly missed a young couple then brushed by a man walking a toy poodle that yapped at austin he drove a woman on rollerblades up on the turf and she swore creatively at him angry shouts and curses followed the sled as he pushed the dogs to even greater speed he tried to figure out how long the team would last running at full tilt and decided he didnt have much time sled dogs are accus tomed to running in the cold and snow and with their thick fur coats they would quickly become overheated in the warm evening tem peratures he glanced around to get his bearings they were mov ing across the mall away from the museum toward the castle and the smithsonian quad he looked behind him umealiq had gained ground and it would be only a matter of time before he caught up easy he commanded the dogs and he put pressure on the brake to reinforce his command they slowed what are you doing therri said get off what get off and make a run for the lights and people around the smithsonian i cant outrun him with you on board its me he really wants therri reluctantly overcame her natural inclination to argue comprehending the danger she rolled off the sled then got to her feet and started running austin shouted at the dogs to get moving the team took off again in a necksnapping start he made a right angle turn onto another path the sled felt lighter and more re sponsive and he was moving faster than before he was glad to see scarface still chasing him therri was safe but pausing to let her on had given umealiq the chance to gain ground austins eyes were blurred with the sweat running down his fore head he wiped away the moisture with the sleeve of his tux and glanced over his shoulder scarface had cut the distance in half austin dodged another pedestrian and looked ahead he could see the white spike of the washington monument in the distance there might be armed security guards around the monument but he would never make it that far the dogs were becoming weary he could feel them slow their pace slightly and the sled was acting like a car run ning out of gas he urged the team on with the kissing sound he had heard the drivers use during the race cars were moving along the street ahead of him with luck and timing he could put the traffic between him and his pursuers the sled emerged from the mall onto the sidewalk austin saw an open ing between two moving vehicles and steered for it hoping to whisk through to the other side of the street the dogs hesitated but he urged them on the paws of the lead dog had left the curb when one of the ubiquitous limos that prowled the streets of washington came out of nowhere and cut him off austin cut the steering wheel hard the lead dog was way ahead of him and had already changed directions dashing off to the right with the team and the sled behind him the sled heeled over at an angle like a boat sailing close to the wind austin compensated with his body and the sled slammed back down on all four wheels and straightened out the dogs were pulling the sled along the sidewalk scarface had cut the angle and was pacing austin along the side walk a few yards away the two sleds raced along the sidewalk like the chariot racers in benhur the dogs swerved around pedestrians austin had just about relinquished control conceding that the dogs could steer the ed far better than he could and simply concentrated on hanging on even at top form his skills would have been no match for the other driver the sleds were running side by side almost close enough to touch then scarface upped the ante and aimed a pistol at austin from a few feet away austin had the feeling that someone had just painted a bullseye on his forehead but getting a clean shot wouldnt be easy scarface held the wheel with his left hand and the pistol in his right without the stability of two hands holding on to the wheel the sled wavered from side to side and scarface was finding it impossible to keep the pistol barrel leveled he tried a shot anyhow the bullet missed austin and went high austin took little com fort from the wild shot scarface would keep trying until he emptied his gun even if the flying lead missed austin someone else could be hurt or killed acting more on instinct than intellect austin quickly touched his brakes the eskimos sled pulled slightly ahead of him borrowing a page from umealiqs book of dirty race tactics austin angled his sled to the right his front wheel slammed into the rear wheel of the other sled and scarface fought to maintain control the maneuver was risky but it had the desired effect with only one sweatsoaked hand gripping the steering wheel scarface was unable to stop the rim from spinning the sleds front wheels jack knifed the sled itself fishtailed then flipped and scarface tumbled off the pistol flying out of his hand and clattering onto the sidewalk he rolled several times before coming to a stop his dog team kept on running dragging the sled on its side before they figured out it was a waste of time austin was in no position to celebrate his team was pulling the sled toward constitution avenue he yelled a command to stop and jammed his foot down on the brakes but it was no use the dogs had been spooked by the gunshot and unnerved by austins erratic driv ing and he realized he was simply along for the ride they plunged into the busy boulevard without looking the sled flew off the curb became airborne and slammed down on all four wheels austins teeth rattled in his skull there was a ban shee screech as an suv as big as a house slammed on its brakes its massive chrome grille only inches away austin caught a glimpse of the horrified face behind the wheel the drivers eyes popping out of his head as he watched a man in a tux drive a sled team across wash ingtons busiest boulevard the best austin could do was to hang on and try to keep the sled upright his ears were filled with the squeal of brakes and then he heard a thud as someone rearended another car there were several more thuds as the chain reaction continued the air reeked of the smell of burnt rubber then he was safely across the avenue and the dogs were scrambling onto the opposite sidewalk the sled was mov ing slow enough for him to jump off before it hit the curb the dogs were exhausted from running in the unaccustomed heat and had no desire to keep moving they simply plopped down where they were their sides heaving and their tongues dripping like faucets austin looked back across the trail of chaos he had left on con stitution avenue traffic on his side had come to a stop and angry people were getting out of their cars to trade registration and license numbers scarface stood on the opposite curb blood streaming down his face he pulled his knife from his belt holding it close to his chest he stepped off the curb only to pause at the sound of sirens then one of the kennel trucks austin had seen near the racecourse screeched to a stop hiding the eskimo from view for a few seconds when it took off a second later the man had vanished austin went over to the panting dogs and patted each one on the head well have to do this again but not too soon he said he brushed the knees and elbows of his tuxedo but he knew he must look as if he were coming off a weekend binge shrugging in resignation he walked back to the museum therri was standing on the constitution avenue side of the fourstory granite edifice the expression of anxiety on her face disappeared when she saw austin trudging toward her and she ran over to throw her arms around him thank goodness youre all right she said hugging him in a tight embrace what happened to that awful man he got thrown for a loop by the washington traffic and called it a night sorry i had to kick you off back there thats all right ive been dumped by guys before although this is the first time its been off a moving dogsled therri said that after she had been unceremoniously kicked off the sled she had found a police cruiser parked near the castle shed told the police that her friend was in danger of being murdered on the mall and though the police had looked at her as if she were crazy they did go to investigate she had come back to the museum to look for ben but thered been no sign of him she was trying to decide what to do next when she heard the sirens walked onto the boule vard and saw austin plodding down the avenue they shared a cab back to their cars and parted with a lingering kiss and the promise to get in touch the next day a turquoise numa vehicle was in austins driveway when he got home and the front door was unlocked he walked into the house and heard the dave brubeck quartet playing take five on the stereo sitting in austins favorite black leather chair with a drink in his hand was rudi gunn second in command at numa gunn was a wiry little man slim with narrow shoulders and matching hips he was a master of logistics a graduate of annapolis and a former com mander in the navy hope you dont mind my breaking into your house gunn said not at all thats why i gave you the lock code gunn pointed to the glass youre getting a little low on your highland malt scotch whiskey he said his lips turning up in his typ ical mischievous grin ill talk to the butler about it austin recognized the book that gunn was holding didnt know you liked nietzsche i found it on the coffee table pretty heavy stuff it might be heavier than you think austin said going over to the bar to mix himself a dark and stormy gunn put the book aside and picked up a bound folder from a side table thanks for getting your report to me i found it far more in teresting than mr nietzsches writings thought you might austin said settling into a sofa with his drink gunn pushed his thick hornrimmed glasses up onto his thinning hair and leafed through the folder at times like this i realize what a boring life i lead he said youve really missed your calling you should be writing scripts for video games austin took a big gulp of his drink savoring the deep flavor of the dark rum and the tingle of the jamaican ginger beer naw this stuff is too farfetched i beg to differ old pal whats farfetched about a mysterious cor poration that sinks ships by remote control a longlost cave with fantastic wall art in the faroe islands a creature out of jaws that knocks you on your ass he started to chuckle uncontrollably now thats something i would have liked to witness theres no such thing as respect anymore austin lamented gunn got his composure back and he turned a few more pages the list goes on and on murderous eskimo thugs who hunt hu mans instead of seals oh yes a female attorney with a radical envi ronmental group he looked up from his reading she has long slim legs i suppose austin thought about thems figure about average in length id say but quite shapely cant have everything i suppose gunn put the folder on his lap and gave austin the onceover taking in his scuffed shoes crooked bow tie and the hole in the knee of the tuxedo did the bouncer throw you out of the museum reception you look a little ah rum pled the reception was fine but i learned that washington is going to the dogs nothing new there hope that tux wasnt rented gunn said worse austin replied i own it maybe numa will buy me a new one ill take it up with admiral sandecker gunn said austin refreshed their drinks then laid out the story of the meet ing with marcus ryan and the evenings events after absorbing the account without comment gunn tapped the report on his lap any thoughts on how your dogsled adventure fits in with this wild tale lots of thoughts but nothing coherent ill sum up what i know in a single sentence the people who run oceanus deal ruthlessly with anyone who gets in their way that would be my conclusion too based on what youve said gunn paused for a moment brow furrowed he had the capacity to think as coldly and clearly as a computer he processed the moun tain of information separating the wheat from the chaff after a few moments he said what about this basque character aguirrez interesting fellow hes the wild card in this poker game i talked to a friend at the cia aguirrez may or may not be allied with basque separatists perlmutter is looking into the family background for me all i know for now is that hes either a basque terrorist or an amateur archaeologist take your pick maybe he could birddog this thing for us too bad you cant get in touch with him austin set his drink down pulled his wallet from his pocket and extracted the card aguirrez had given him as he was leaving the basques yacht he handed the card to gunn who noted the phone number on the back why not he said and handed the card back austin picked up a phone and punched out the number he was tired from the nights exertions and his expectations were low so he was startled when he heard the familiar basso voice on the line what a pleasant surprise mr austin i had the feeling wed be talking again hope im not interrupting anything important not at all are you still in the faroes i am in washington on business washington yes the fishing in the faroes didnt live up to its reputation what can i do for you mr austin i called to thank you for pulling me out of some difficulties in copenhagen aguirrez made no attempt to deny that his men had chased away the clubyielding thugs whod attacked austin and them weld he simply laughed and said you have a way of getting yourself in dif ficult situations my friend most of my troubles have to do with a company called oceanus i was hoping we might chat about that subject again maybe you could bring me up to date on your archaeological investigation as well id like that very much aguirrez said i have meetings in the morning but tomorrow afternoon would be convenient they agreed on a time and austin jotted down the directions aguirrez gave him for an address in washington he hung up and started to fill gunn in on the short conversation when the phone rang it was zavala who had returned from europe joe had fixed the problems with the sea lamprey then had jumped ship when the beebe had been invited by the danish vessel thor to join in a faroe islands research project just wanted to let you know im home ive hugged my corvette and im about to head out for a nightcap with a beautiful young lady zavala said anything new since i last saw you the usual stuff tonight a crazy eskimo on a dogsled chased me through the mall with murder in his heart other than that things are quiet there was silence at the other end of the line then zavala said youre not kidding are you nope rudis here drop by my place and youll get the whole sor did story zavala lived in a small building in arlington virginia that had once housed a district library guess im cancelling that date be by in a few minutes he said one more thing still got that bottle of tequila we were going to break into back in the faroes sure its in my duffel bag i think you better bring it with you the next morning austin stopped at the museum of natural history on the way to numa headquarters gleason was in the exhibition hall when austin arrived and he didnt look happy the guests music and food of the reception had disappeared but that wasnt the main cause of his concern the display cases were empty not even a placard remained gleason was beside himself this is terrible absolutely terrible he was saying looks like you had a fire sale austin said worse this is a total disaster the sponsors have pulled the ex hibition can they do that austin realized it was a dumb question even as the words left his mouth gleason waved his arms yes according to the small print in the contract they insisted we sign they are allowed to break up the ex hibition any time they want to and give us a small monetary com pensation instead why did they close the show damned if i know the pr firm that set the whole thing up said theyre just following orders what about dr barker i tried to get in touch with him but hes vanished into thin air youve been closer to oceanus than most people austin said getting to his real reason for stopping by the museum what do you know about dr barker not much im afraid i know more about his ancestor the whaling captain he mentioned yes frederick barker sr one of the kiolya knives you saw on display originally belonged to him it was more than a hundred years old dreadful thing and razorsharp gave me a stomachache just looking at it where would i look for information on captain barker you can start in my office gleason cast a woeful glance at the empty display cases cmon not much for me to do here the office was in the administrative wing gleason gestured for austin to take a seat then plucked an old volume from the shelf the title was whaling captains of new bedford he opened the book to a page and plopped it in front of austin i dug this out of our library when the exhibition first came through thats captain barker the new england whaling skippers were a tough lot many became captains in their twenties mutinies destructive storms hostile nativesall in a days work to them the adversity made some men ogres others humanitarians austin examined the grainy blackandwhite photograph in the book barker was dressed in native garb and it was hard to make out his features a fur parka framed his face and bone goggles with hor izontal slits in them covered his eyes white stubble adorned his chin interesting eyewear austin said those are sunglasses the inuit were very aware of the dangers from snow blindness they would have been particularly important to barker whose eyes were probably sensitive to light there was al binism in barkers family they say thats why he spent so many win ters in the frozen north to avoid the direct sunlight gleason explained that in barkers ship the orient was wrecked and the captain was the only survivor the natives saved barkers life and he spent the winter in an eskimo settlement he recounts how the chiefs wife pulled off his boots and thawed his frozen feet out with the warmth of her naked bosom i can think of worse ways to thaw out where does the kiolya tribe come in they were the ones who saved him that seems out of character with what you told me of their blood thirsty ways i would have expected them to kill a stranger that would have been the normal case but dont forget that barker stood out from the ordinary whale hunter with his pure white hair pale skin and eyes he must have looked like some sort of snow god toonook perhaps anything is possible barker didnt go into detail about some things quaker society in new bedford would not have approved of one of their number posing as a god the experience transformed him though in what way he became a staunch conservationist when he got home he urged his fellow whale men to stop slaughtering the walrus the ki olya rnuscled in on the walrus hunting grounds like a street gang tak ing over new drug turf they even took women and tools from those they conquered the other inuit tribes practically starved as a result until they banded together and drove the kiolya away barker saw this conflict over walrus meat and wanted to end it he was grateful to the kiolya and thought if the walrus were saved they might change their marauding ways was he right barker was naive in my view i dont think anything would have changed their behavior short of brute force austin pondered over the answer as a student of philosophy he was a great believer in the theory that past is present the kiolya might be the key to unraveling the tangled skein that surrounded oceanus where could i go to learn more about the tribe canadian police blotter for the most part id venture there isnt much information between their diaspora and the present but i did find a crazy story that verifies what i said earlier about the god thing he rummaged around in a filing cabinet and produced a clip from the new yor times encased in a plastic envelope it was datelined hudson bay austin took a minute to read the story the arctic north added another mystery to its history of explo ration when a halfcrazed german crawled out of the frozen tun dra claiming that he was the sole survivor of an airship disaster canadian authorities said the german who identified himself as gerhardt heinz was brought in by a group of unknown eskimos who had apparently rescued him the times found mr heinz in a hospital ward where he died a short time later in the interview mr heinz said i was on a secret trip to the north pole for the greater glory of the fatherland we landed at the pole but on the way back we sighted the wreck of a boat frozen in the ice the captain insisted on landing on the ice to investigate it was a boat of great antiquity probably hundreds of years old we removed a frozen body which we placed in the airship cooler along with some unusual items after rising from the ice and traveling a distance we experi enced mechanical problems and had to land the survivors de cided to try to cross the ice but i stayed to guard the zeppelin i was near death when the local natives found me and i was nursed back to health mr heinz said that the natives spoke no english but he learned that their name was kiolya he said that they thought he was a god having come from the skies and when he requested through sign language that they bring him to the nearest settlement they complied german authorities contacted by the times said that they had no knowledge of mr heinz nor of any dirigible voyage to the north pole austin asked gleason to run off a copy of the article and thanked him for his time and information sorry about your exhibition he said on the way out thank you gleason shook his head it simply astounds me why they pulled up stakes so abruptly by the way have you heard about senator graham thats another disaster one of our strongest supporters austin said i think i saw graham last night at the reception you did while he was driving home to virginia his car was forced off the road by a truck hes in critical condition hitand run sorry to hear about that too damn gleason said hope its not true about bad things run ning in threes there may be a simpler explanation for your run of bad luck austin said oh whats that austin pointed to the sky and in all seriousness said toonook st julien perlmutter stepped into his spacious georgetown carriage house and cast an appreciative glance around at the hundreds of volumes old and new that spilled off the sagging wall shelves and flowed like a vast river of words breaking off into tributaries that ran into every room an ordinary human being confronted with this seeming confusion would have fled the premises a beatific smile came to his lips as his eye lingered on one stack then moved on to another he could rat tle off titles even quote whole pages from what was generally ac knowledged to be the worlds most complete collection of literature regarding historic ships he was starving after dealing with the rigors of a transatlantic flight finding space aboard a plane to accommodate his substantial bulk was not a problem he simply reserved two seats but even the binary offerings of first class were to perlmutters way of thinking the equivalent of a church hamandbean supper he headed for the kitchen like a heatseeking missile and was glad to see that the house keeper had followed his shopping instructions even though it was early in the day before long he was dining on a provenalestyle stuffed lamb with potatoes perfumed with thyme and washed down with a simple but wellbalanced bordeaux thus fortified he was dabbing at his mouth and magnificent gray beard with a napkin when the phone rang kurt he said recognizing the voice on the line how in blazes did you know i was back there was a report on cnn that italy had run out of pasta i as sumed you would be coming home for a square meal no perlmutter boomed actually i returned because i missed being taunted on the phone by impertinent young whippersnappers who should know better you sound in fine fettle st julien it must have been a good trip it was and i do feel as if ive eaten all the pasta in italy but its good to be back on my own turf i wondered what you had turned up on my historical query i was going to call you later today fascinating material can you drop by ill brew up some coffee and we can talk about my find ings five minutes i just happen to be driving through georgetown when austin arrived perlmutter served two giant cups of cafe latte he pushed aside a pile of books to reveal a chair for austin and another stack to make room for his own wide haunches on an over sized sofa perlmutter sipped his coffee well now getting down to business after you called me in florence i discussed your query about the roland relics with my host a signor nocci he remembered a his torical reference he had seen in a letter to the medici pope penned by a man named martinez who was a fanatical supporter of the span ish inquisition particularly where it applied to the basques mr nocci put me in touch with an assistant curator at the laurentian li brary she dug out a manuscript written by martinez in which he di rects particular venom at diego aguirrez the ancestor of balthazar the man i met good work perlmutter smiled thats only the start martinez says flatly that aguirrez had the sword and the horn of roland and that he would pursue him and i quote to the ends of the earth to retrieve these objects austin let out a low whistle that establishes that the roland relics were real and puts them directly in the hands of the aguirrez family it would seem to verify the rumors that diego was in possession of the sword and horn perlmutter passed over a folder this is a copy of a manuscript from the venice state archives it was found at the naval museum in a file having to do with war galleys austin read the title on the first page an exoneration of a man of the sea the publication date on the frontispiece was the preamble described the work as an account by richard blackthorns an unwilling mercenary in the service of the spanish inquisition a hum ble sailor who has always stood in defence of his majestys name in which he proves infamies that have been brought against him to be untrue and warns any and all never to trust the murdering spaniards he glanced up at perlmutter blackthorne is surely a master of the neverending sentence but what does he have to do with roland and the longdead aguirrez everything mlad frything he looked into the bottom of his coffee cup while youre up old boy would you fetch me a re fill im feeling peaked after the rigors of travel get one for your self austin had no intention of getting up but he rose from his chair and went for the refills he knew that perlmutter functioned best when he was eating or drinking perlmutter sipped his coffee and ran his hand over the manuscript as if he were reading it with his fingers you can study this at your leisure but ill give you a quick summary now apparently black thorne fell afoul of rumors that he had willingly served the hated spaniard and he wanted to set the record straight that came across loud and clear in the preamble blackthorne was worried about the stain on his name he was born of a respectable merchant family in sussex he went to sea as a youth and worked his way up from cabin boy to master of a merchant vessel plying the mediterranean he was captured by barbary pi rates and forced to become a rower on an algerian galley the gal ley was shipwrecked and he was rescued by the genoese who turned him over to the spanish remind me never to be rescued by the genoese blackthorne was a hot potato according to the inquisition sys tem any englishman was a heretic and subject to torture arrest and execution english and dutch sailors shunned spanish ports for fear they would be arrested if you were caught with a copy of the king james bible or possessed some ancient classic deemed heretical you were to put it literally toast austin glanced down at the folder either blackthorne survived or his memoirs were ghostwritten he had nine lives our captain blackthorne he actually escaped once from the spanish but was recaptured he was eventually dragged from his dark cell in irons to stand trial the prosecutor called him an enemy of the faith and other opprobrious names as he put it he was condemned to death and was headed for the stake when fate intervened in the unlikely form ofel brasero isnt that the name of a mexican restaurant in falls church youre asking the wrong man ive always considered mexican and restaurant uttered in the same sentence as no less an oxymoron than military intelligence el brasero means brazier in spanish it was the nickname given the aforementioned martinez for his zeal in putting the torch to heretics not the type you would invite to a barbecue no but he proved to be blackthornes savior the englishman impressed martinez with his resourcefulness and his ability to speak spanish but more important blackthorne was familiar with war galleys and sailing ships that shows the lengths to which martinez would go to catch aguirrez even sparing a victim oh yes we know from his writings that he thought aguirrez was especially dangerous because he had been charged with the steward ship of the roland relics and might use them to rally his countrymen against the spaniards when aguirrez escaped arrest in his ship mar tinez went after him blackthorne was commanding braseros lead galley when they caught up with aguirrez on his caravel off the coast of france in although he was becalmed outnumbered and out gunned aguirrez managed to sink two galleys and put martinez to flight the more i learn about diego the more i like him perlmutter nodded his strategy was brilliant i intend to include this fight in a collection im preparing of classic sea battles unfor tunately brasero had the services of an informer who knew that aguirrez always stopped in the faroe islands to rest before crossing the ocean to north america austin leaned forward in his chair and murmured skaalshavn you know it i was in skaalshavn a few days ago cant say im familiar with the place cant blame you its quite remote a picturesque little fishing vil lage with a natural harbor of refuge there are some interesting caves nearby caves the blue eyes danced with excitement quite an extensive network ive seen them from the drawings on the walls id say theyve been occupied off and on going back to ancient times the basques or others may have been using them for hundreds maybe thousands of years blackthorne mentions the caves in his narrative in fact they were instrumental in his story in what way aguirrez could easily have outdistanced his pursuers and fled to north america where brasero would never find him the basques were the only mariners intrepid enough to sail the atlantic in those days but diego knew that brasero would go after his family and he knew that even if he stashed the relics in north america when he returned to europe brasero would be waiting maybe he decided to take a stand for the most primal of reasons austin said he wanted his revenge on the man who had ruined his life and stolen his fortune no disagreement there brasero was just as determined to finish the job hed started he had switched from his galley to a warship twice the size of diegos caravel he had put blackthorne in com mand the ship bristled with guns that would have made short work of the basques but diego knew from their previous encounter of the informant on board braseros ship and prudently moved the caravel away from the caves diego stationed a handful of his men on shore where they could be seen by brasero and when martinez launched his boats the men ran into the caves drawing their pursuers after them i smell a trap youve got a better nose than martinez although in fairness he was probably distracted by thoughts of all the fun he was going to have burning diego and his crew shades of custers last stand that cave system is a labyrinth perfect to stage an ambush then im sure you wont be surprised to hear thats what hap pened it was a twopronged strategy the caravel swept down on the warship and cowed its skeleton crew with a few cannon shots then they boarded the ship and took it over meanwhile diego launched his ambush he had dragged one of his ships cannon into the caves and used it to take the wind out of the attack perlmutter raised a pudgy fist as if he were reliving the battle brasero was a skilled swordsman but aguirrez was better instead of killing him he toyed with martinez before he doused braseros flame forever where was mr blackthorne in all this one of braseros men went to take a shot at diego blackthorne killed the man diego had his men bring blackthorne to him the englishman laid out his story diego needed a skilled captain to command the warship so he made a deal blackthorne would take charge of the ship and get diegos men home safely several weeks later by blackthornes account he sailed up the thames with his prize what happened to the roland relics blackthorne never mentions them but by his account diego called for a small volunteer crew to stay with him and sent the oth ers home with blackthorne diego no longer needed gunners and cannon crew only skilled sailors even with brasero dead he knew the relics would not be safe as long as the inquisition was alive so he continued west never to be heard from again another unsolved mystery of the sea maybe not austin said he handed perlmutter the news clip about the zeppelin crash perlmutter read the story and looked up these unusual items heinz mentions could be the longlost relics my thoughts exactly which means theyre in the hands of oceanus would oceanus give them up austin thought of his runins with the oceanus thugs not likely he said with a rueful chuckle perlmutter gazed at austin over tented ringers it seems there is more to this whole saga than meets the eye a hell of a lot more and ill be glad to tell you all the gory details over another cup of coffee austin lifted his cup as long as youre up old boy could you fetch me a refill get one for yourself austin arrived three minutes before his appointed meeting time with aguirrez after leaving perlmutters house austin drove down embassy row the gods that look over wash ington drivers were smiling and he found a parking space with no trouble he walked along pennsylvania avenue until he stood in front of a square building that consisted of several darkglass stories grafted onto some old washington houses austin read the sign next to the front door and wondered if he had the wrong address given the troubles the aguirrez family had had with the spanish authori ties through the centuries the last place he would have expected to find balthazar was at the embassy of spain austin gave his name to a security guard at the door and was passed on to the receptionist who punched out a number on her in tercom phone and spoke in spanish to someone on the line then she smiled and in a lovely accent that evoked visions of castile said mr aguirrez is with the ambassador hell be with you in a mo ment a few minutes later aguirrez came strolling out of a hallway aguirrez had shed his blue sweat suit and black beret and was im peccably dressed in a darkgray suit that would have cost austin a weeks pay but even the best of tailors couldnt hide the peasant hands and sturdy physique he was talking to a snowyhaired man who walked beside him hands behind his back head lowered in thought as he listened intently to what the basque was saying aguir rez saw austin and waved at him the two men broke off their con versation parting with warm handshakes and smiles aguirrez strode over to where austin stood and wrapped an arm around his shoulder mr austin he said cheerfully how nice to see you again im sorry i didnt introduce you to the ambassador but he was late for a meeting come this way aguirrez led austin down a hallway to a door into what had been a drawing room in one of the old houses that were part of the em bassy complex the centerpiece was an oversized marble fireplace and the room itself was comfortably appointed with plush rugs and heavy dark wood furniture oil paintings of spanish rural scenes decorated the walls as they took their seats aguirrez evidently noted the wondering look on austins face because he said you look puzzled mr austin austin saw no reason to beat around the bush im surprised to find you herea man accused of being a basque terrorist within the walls of the spanish embassy aguirrez didnt seem offended you have obviously looked into my background which i expected so you know that the accusations have not been substantiated still i noticed that youre not wearing your black beret aguirrez gave out a booming laugh in deference to my hosts i have shed my chapeau although i miss wearing it i think that some in this building might think i had a bomb under the beret and their nervousness would interfere with our work which is to settle the basque problem peacefully once and for all thats a tall order after hundreds of years of conflict im confident it can be accomplished what happened to your ancestral quest the past and the present are inseparable in this cause the basque separatists want a homeland the spanish government has experi mented with autonomy with unfortunate results if i find the relics i am looking for their discovery could set off an emotional wave of basque nationalism i know my people it would tear spain apart so you have suddenly become very important to the spanish gov ernment he nodded i have met with highlevel officials in madrid who asked me to inform your state department people of the situation and assure them i am not a terrorist i have agreed once i find the relics to put them in safekeeping whats to prevent you from going back on your word the basque frowned and a dangerous expression came to his dark eyes it is a logical question and one the spanish government also asked i told them that i will honor the memory of my ancestor who was chosen to be the guardian of the relics in return the span ish government will take graduated meaningful steps toward basque autonomy youre using the relics as leverage he shrugged i prefer to call it a solution that takes into account our mutual interests not a bad deal considering the fact that you dont have the relics a technicality he said the broad smile returning i have un earthed information on the sea routes my ancestor took to the new world the basques were in the faroes as early as after stop ping at the faroes diego would head for newfoundland or labrador there is ample precedent for this theory my people fished for cod and whales off north america as far back as the middle ages ive read that cabot found indians using words that could have had a basque origin no doubt about it he said his face flushing with excitement my research indicates that there are some unexplored caves near channelport aux basques in newfoundland i will rejoin my yacht there as soon as i clear up my business here and i am convinced that before long i will hold the sword and horn of roland in my hands austin paused wondering how he could gently break the news then decided that it could not be done there may be a problem he said aguirrez eyed austin warily what do you mean austin handed over an envelope containing a copy of the black thorne manuscript this material suggests that the relics may not be where you think they are austin proceeded to lay out the story perlmutter had told him as aguirrez listened storm clouds seemed to move in and perch on his brow i know of st julien perlmutter through my own research he is highly respected as a sea historian there is none more knowledgeable aguirrez slammed a fist into his palm i ifnew diego wasnt killed by brasero he escaped with the relics theres more austin said he handed aguirrez the news clip detailing the interview with the zeppelins survivor i still dont understand the basque said after reading the article oceanus is the owner of the zeppelin that found your ancestors boat locked in the ice aguirrez saw the connection immediately you believe that oceanus has the sacred relics in its possession its a good bet if you follow the chain of evidence and in your view oceanus cant be approached on this matter i dont think oceanus can be approached on anythmg austin said with a rueful chuckle you recall my boating accident i have a confession to make an oceanus security guard blew up my boat with a hand grenade and i must confess that i never believed your story about engine fumes while were in a confessing mood austin said maybe you can tell me why your men followed me to copenhagen a precaution to be frank i didnt know what to make of you i knew from your identity card that you were with numa but i didnt know why you were poking into the oceanus operation and assumed it must be an official mission my curiosity was stirred so i decided to keep an eye on you you made no effort to hide your movements my men happened to be nearby when you were at tacked how is the young lady you were with by the way shes fine thanks to the alertness of your men then youre not angry at being followed not at all but i wouldnt like to see you make it a habit i understand aguirrez paused in thought am i correct to as sume the men who attacked you were from oceanus that seems a safe conclusion the attackers resembled the guards i encountered at the oceanus operation in the faroes oceanus tried to kill you twice be careful my friend they may try again they already have aguirrez didnt ask for details and it was obvious he had other things on his mind he rose from his chair and paced the room blackthornes manuscript clutched in his hand the people here must not know of this material without the relics the spanish gov ernment will lose its incentive to move on basque autonomy but this goes beyond political matters he said in a hollow voice i have failed my ancestor diego by not finding the relics there may still be a way aguirrez stopped his pacing and fixed austin with a penetrating stare what are you saying were both interested in nailing oceanus to the wall lets talk about it taking account as you said before of mutual interests aguirrez hiked his bushy eyebrows but his face remained im passive then he went over to a liquor cabinet and brought back two small glasses and a bottle of greenishyellow liquor he poured the glasses full and handed one to austin who recognized the distinc tive scent ofizzara an hour later austin slid behind the wheel of his car he wondered if he had made a deal that might come back to haunt him but he trusted his instincts which were all he had to go on at this point he sensed that aguirrez was devious but principled and since they shared the same goals it would be foolish not to form a loose al liance he checked his cell phone and saw that there were two calls the first was from the trouts he was relieved to hear from them he knew from working with them on the special assignments team that paul and gamay were able to take care of themselves but at the same time they had gone looking for oceanus without knowing how dangerous their mission might be gamay answered his call she and paul had returned from canada a few hours before and dropped their luggage off at their town house then they had gone to numa headquarters to meet with zavala who was going to update them did you get inside the oceanus operation austin asked no gamay said but we bumped into a few of their people gamay was being a little too casual i know from personal expe rience that when you bump into oceanus it bumps back are you and paul all right were fine a slight concussion for me and a broken wrist for paul the cuts and bruises are healing nicely austin swore under his breath angry at himself for putting his partners in danger i didnt realize what i was getting you into im sorry dont be you only asked us to see what we could learn about oceanus it was our decision to go flying off to canada and poke our noses in where they werent welcome it was worth the trip too we wouldnt have learned about the devilfish otherwise the only devilfish austin had ever heard of was the manta ray are you sure that concussion is on the mend ive never been more clearheaded kurt in all my years as a ma rine biologist ive never encountered anything like this before paul calls it white death austin experienced a quick frisson as he recalled his brush with the large toothy creature in the oceanus fish tank you can fill me in when i get there he hung up and punched out gunns number hello rudi he said without the usual exchange of pleasantries i think its time we had a meeting with sandecker the giant video screen in the conference room glowed blue for a second then an image appeared there was a flash of silverywhite scales in a net and mike neal was heard shouting hold on folks weve got a live one there was a blurred glimpse of a fish slamming against the deck and a closeup of a toothy mouth snapping a gaff handle in two the handheld camera showed the same fish being clouted with a baseball bat the astonished voices of the trouts were audible in the background paul trout clicked the remote control and froze the picture the lights blinked back on and a crisp commanding voice was heard to say it seems jaws has formidable competition admiral james sandecker the driving force behind numa sat at a long conference table his head enveloped in a purple cloud that belched from the fat cigar in his hand that thing up on the screen is in a class of its own admiral said gamay who sat at the table along with austin zavala and rudi gunn the great white shark attacks when its hungry or hunted the creature were looking at is more like mack the knife just plain mean sandecker blew out a plume of smoke and glanced around the table now that youve engaged my attention with what must be the short est monster movie on record please tell me what in blazes is going on and what that creature has to do with the cast on pauls wrist gamay and paul took turns telling the story of their canadian adventure from their visit to the oceanus fishprocessing plant to their talk with the geneticists at mcgill austin cut in did you say frederick barker yes gamay said do you know him weve had a passing acquaintance his men tried to kill me last night austin gave the gathering a quick rundown of his encounter with barker and the wild dogsled race through the mall congratulations kurt the traffic tieup you caused was page one in the washington post sandecker paused in thought let me see if i understand this story to date you believe that oceanus or chestrated the sinking of two ships in faroe waters to divert atten tion from a secret project directed by this man barker having to do with the breeding of mutant fish he gestured at the screen fish similar to the one paul and gamay encountered in canada and that people from a rogue eskimo tribe made attempts on your life in the faroes in copenhagen and in washington sounds unbelievable when somebody else tells it austin said with a shake of his head baron munchausen couldnt have done better luckily paul and gamay have verified the existence of these homicidal eskimos he turned to gunn what do you make of this fantastic tale rudi before i answer id like to ask gamay what could happen if these artificially mutated superfish got into the sea and started breeding according to dr throckmorton barkers colleague in sufficient numbers they could create a biological time bomb gamay said they could replace the natural strains of fish within a few genera tions whats wrong with that sandecker said playing devils advo cate fishermen would have to catch a few large fish instead of many smaller ones true but we dont know enough about the longrange effects what would happen if these frankenfish had some property that made them unfit for human consumption what if an unforeseen mutant strain resulted what if the superfish offspring couldnt sur vive in the wild youd have neither the natural species nor the mu tants the ocean system would be thrown out of whack fishermen processing people and distributors would be idled around the world this would disrupt whole societies that depend upon fish protein for nourishment industrial nations would be damaged as well thats quite a dismal forecast sandecker said im being conservative in my assessment there are so many unknowns we know that more than twentyfive species are being targeted for genetic modification it could mean a tragedy of un imaginable proportions if they escape into the sea were assuming that monster up there escaped from a research lab rudi said suppose he and others like him were released into the sea deliberately gamay stared at gunn as if he had grown a set of horns why would anyone risk extinction of a whole species that would be a ter rible thing gunn shook his head not for everyone what are you saying sandecker asked that the fish will vanish from the sea but not from the oceanus holding tanks oceanus has been acquiring international patents for its fish genes the species would be preserved in oceanus dna banks very clever rudi sandecker said oceanus would have created a monopoly on a major source of the worlds protein paul said a monopoly like that could be worth billions of dol lars it goes beyond money sandecker said fish protein is a major source of nourishment for much of the world food is power this explains why oceanus is so triggerhappy austin said if the news got out that they were about to deplete the worlds oceans the adverse public reaction would be overwhelming certainly sounds plausible gunn said you establish biofish hatcheries around the world you could seed the major fishbreeding areas in a short time you wouldnt need many fish gamay said each male biofish released could breed with dozens of females but id like to point out there is nothing illegal about dumping fish into the open sea theyve been responsible for the loss of two ships and several deaths trying to keep their dirty little secret austin said theyre holding an entire indian village captive last i heard murder and kidnapping were illegal sandecker said but since we cant pin the killings and other crimes on oceanus yet well have to proceed with care we cant go through the regular channels even the canadian government cant know of our action oceanus could bring the forces of the law down on us the special assignments team was formed for missions away from official oversight so its the perfect vehicle to carry out our plan i didnt know we had a plan zavala said seems obvious to me the admiral said we blow oceanus and their bloody scheme out of the water like the pirates they are i re alize it wont be easy nighthawks family and relatives could be placed in jeopardy the fact that weve stumbled onto the scene might make oceanus act in haste theres another factor we should take into account austin said marcus ryan is determined to get sos involved they could com promise our plan and put the captives in real danger that settles it sandecker said we move immediately weve got to strike at the heart of this thing that facility in the canadian woods kurt did this young indian give you any inkling where his village was located ryan had him on a short leash ben seems to have disappeared but ill keep trying to find him we cant wait that long sandeckers gaze moved over to a scruffylooking man who had quietly slipped into the room during the discussion and taken a seat in a corner hiram do you have something for us hiram yeager was the director of the vast computer network that covered the entire tenth floor of the numa building the center processed and stored the biggest amount of digital data on the oceans ever assembled under one roof the brains behind this incredible display of informationgathering power was dressed in his standard uniform levi pants and jacket over a pure white tshirt his feet were stuffed into a pair of cowboy boots that looked as if they had come from boot hill his long hair was tied in a ponytail and his gray eyes peered out at the world through wirerimmed granny glasses rudi asked me to see if max would compile a list of places that have experienced sudden fish kills and to crosscheck when possible with nearby fishprocessing plants or farms do you want us to adjourn this meeting to the data center sandecker asked yeagers boyish face beamed with excitement stay right where you are youre about to see a demonstration of portable max sandecker grimaced he was impatient to get his troops moving and wasnt interested in yeagers experiments only their results but his respect for the computer genius displayed itself in the same un characteristic patience that allowed yeager to ignore the numa dress code yeager connected a laptop computer to various outlets and to the video screen he clicked the on button anyone who expected an or dinary presentation didnt know hiram yeager the image of a woman appeared on the video screen her eyes were topaz brown and her hair a shiny auburn her shoulders bare down to the first hints of her breasts it was hard to believe that the lovely woman on the screen was an artificial intelligence system the end product of the most complex electronic circuitry imaginable yeager had recorded his voice digi tally altering it to give it a feminine tone and programmed the face of his wife a successful artist into the system max tended to be just as testy and petulant as she was when he was working in the data center yeager sat at a huge console and max was projected in d onto a giant monitor with the portable max you dont have to come to the data center to ask questions the laptop connects to the mainframe so i can bring her with me wherever i go isnt that right max normally max responded to the opening question with a daz zling smile but the face on the screen looked as if she had been suck ing on lemons yeager fiddled with the connections and tried again max are you okay the eyes looked down to the bottom of the screen im feeling rather flat you look fine from out here yeager said fine no you look wonderfulf sandeckers patience had run out perhaps you should send the young lady a bouquet of roses that always works for me zavala said sandecker shot him a withering look thank you for giving us the benefit of your wide experience joe im sure you can include it in your memoirs hiram could you cut to the chase please max smiled hello admiral sandecker hello max hiram is correct when he says you look wonderful but i think we should end this portable max experiment in the fu ture we will visit you in the data center thanks for your understanding admiral what can i do for you please produce the data hiram requested the face instantly disappeared in its place was a map of the world maxs voice narrated this map shows the locations where there have been fish kills near aquaculture facilities i can give you specifics for each location dont bother for now please show us those aquaculture sites owned by oceanus some of the circles vanished but a substantial number remained now go to canada sandecker said the picture zoomed in on cape breton bingo paul trout said thats where gamay and i had our runin with oceanus austin said max could you draw a straight line from the oceanus site to the nearest lake in northern canada the map displayed a line that connected the coastal facility with the interior but the lake it showed was too small and too close to civiliza tion after several tries max connected the aquaculture operation to the only lake large and remote enough to fit nighthawks description we can run some satellite photos on this site but my instincts tell me this is the right place austin said thank you max you can shut down now sandecker said the screen went blank sandecker who was obviously pleased with himself turned to zavala and said now thats how you han dle a woman his face grew serious i think its time to get mov ing he said zavala raised his hand and cleared his throat this is pretty rugged country assuming we find these hombres with no trouble do we just drop in on them sandecker looked as if the question surprised him im open to suggestions ive got one call in the royal canadian mounties im sure you can do it without their help sandecker showed his even teeth in a crocodile smile you have carte blanche id rather have the mounties zavala said if theyre busy a contingent of special forces might do i dont blame joe for being doubtful austin said coming to his partners aid as the trouts and i know oceanus shoots first and asks questions later it would take too long to go through the red tape necessary to in volve the canadian military or police as for special forces we would need presidential authority to trespass on canadian turf i dont see that coming in that case id like to make a proposal austin said he related his conversation with aguirrez sandecker puffed thoughtfully on his cigar let me see youd like to use the resources of this basque who may or may not be a terrorist to carry out a numa mission in a foreign country sandecker said if we cant use the us marines or the mounties he might be all we have hmm sandecker said can he be trusted he can be trusted to do whatever he can to find his relics beyond that i cant say other than to remind you that he saved my life on two occasions sandecker tugged at his precisely trimmed beard the idea of using the basque appealed to the admirals unconventional side but he was reluctant to lose control of the situation on the other hand he had complete confidence in austin and his team use your best judgment sandecker said theres something else austin said he told them about the overnight closing of the museum exhibition and the accident in volving senator graham but i know graham well sandecker said gunn nodded and guess what his commerce committee has been involved in lately legislation trying to close loopholes that would allow biofish to be shipped into the us quite a coincidence isnt it austin said especially since he was returning from a party hosted by oceanus are you suggesting sandecker said that this exhibition was an elaborate cover for an assassination crew it fits with graham out of the way those loopholes may never be closed i agree there are certainly enough party hacks around to raise the possibility of bribes said sandecker who had a low opinion of congress austin said oceanus has cleared away a major obstacle i think theyre about to make their move sandecker rose from his seat and glanced around the table with his cold blue eyes then its high time we made ours he said when austin returned to his office a message was waiting for him from the captain of the numa research vessel william beebe work ing with the danes in the faroe islands call immediately the mes sage said and left a phone number i thought youd want to know the captain said when austin reached him theres been an accident out here a research vessel working with a danish scientist named jorgensen blew up some how they lost eight people including the professor austin had forgotten about jorgensens plans to continue his re search near the oceanus plant now he recalled warning the profes sor to be careful thank you captain he said any idea what caused the expio sion the lone survivor said something about a helicopter in the area before the explosion but she didnt make sense she was the one who suggested that we call you in fact seems she was on the boat as a guest of the professor name was pia something shes a friend of mine how is she few broken bones some burns but the doctors expect that shell pull through sounds like a tough lady she is could you give her a message of course tell her ill be over to see her as soon as shes feeling better will do austin thanked the captain and hung up he stared into space his jaw muscle working his bluegreen eyes at the topaz level on mohs scale of hardness he was thinking of jorgensens horsy smile and pias kindness barker or toonook or whatever his name was had made the mistake of his life by killing the professor and injuring pia he had made it personal the singleengine floatplane flew low looking like a toy against the vastness of the canadian wilderness therri weld sat next to the pilot in the front passenger seat where she had a good view of the ranks of sharp pointed treetops any one of which could have ripped the belly out of the fuselage the first part of the flight had been spent in whiteknuckled ter ror therri had not been reassured when she saw the pair of fuzzy dice hanging in the cockpit but as the flight proceeded without a hitch she had concluded that the pilot an enormous grizzled man whose name was bear actually seemed to know what he was doing dont get up here very often bear shouted over the roar of the engine too remote for most of the sportsmen who come up to go hunting and fishing their idea of roughing it is staying at a lodge with inside plumbing bear pointed through the windshield at the featureless terrain coming up on looking glass lake its really two lakes joined by a short connector locals call it the twins al though ones bigger than the other well drop down on the little guy in a few minutes all i see is trees and more trees said marcus ryan who sat be hind the pilot yeah bound to find trees in these parts bear said with a cheer ful grin he glanced over to see if therri appreciated the joke on ryan she smiled gamely but her heart wasnt in it she would have felt far more confident if ben nighthawk were with them her calls to his apartment had gone unanswered shed wanted to keep trying but marcus had been in a hurry to get rolling you can pull out if you want to ryan had said chuck and i can go it alone but weve got to move fast because the planes wait ing for us therri barely had time to pack before ryan picked her up before long they were piling into the sos executive jet with chuck mercer the former first mate of the sea sentinel with his ship on the bottom mercer was eager to see action therri would have been more enthusiastic if she didnt think ryan was making up his strategy as he went along thanks to the infor mation from ben ryan knew where to go ben had told him the name and location of the lake it was ben too who had given him bears name the bush pilot used to be a drug smuggler and was known to work with no questions asked if the money was right he hadnt even blinked when marcus had spun a cockandbull tale about doing a documentary film on native culture and wanting to observe bens village without being seen bear was usually discreet but he had become careless living in a community where everyone was aware of his past hed let a few words slip about his job for sos while he was fueling up the plane he could not have known that sharp ears were listening or that un friendly eyes were watching as his plane took off and headed into the interior the lake loomed up suddenly therri glimpsed water shimmer ing in the slanting rays of the late afternoon sun seconds later the plane dropped as if it had hit a downdraft she felt her heart in her mouth then the plane bottomed out and slid into a gradually angled trajectory the floats skimmed the lakes surface a short distance be fore the plane settled into the water and slowed bear taxied close to shore when the plane neared a sharply banked beach a few yards wide he climbed out of the cockpit onto a float and jumped feetfirst into water up to his waist he tied an an chor line onto a strut pulled the other end over his shoulder and towed the plane closer to shore he tied up to a stump then helped the others unload a large package and several smaller ones they untied the largest bundle and with the help of a co capsule quickly pumped up an inflatable boat about eight feet long bear watched with interest hands on hips as ryan tested a quiet batteryoperated outboard motor ill be back tomorrow he said youve got the radio if you need me watch your ass the plane taxied to one end of the lake took off and headed back the way it had come therri went over to where ryan and mercer were checking through the pack mercer unwrapped a block ofc explosives and examined the detonators he smiled and said just like the old days sure youre up for this chuck youre talking to the guy who sank an icelandic whaling ship practically singlehanded that was a few years ago were a lot older now mercer fingered a detonator doesnt take much energy to push a button he said i owe these bastards for our ship mercer had been steaming since hed learned that oceanuss ships were serviced at the same shetlands boatyard where the sea sentinel could have been sabotaged we cant forget josh either ryan said i havent forgotten josh but are you sure theres no other way therri said i wish there were ryan said weve got to play hardball im not arguing with the need to do something but the means what about bens people youre risking their lives we cant be diverted from our prime goal we know from our contacts on senator grahams staff that oceanus continued the trans gendered fish experiments that were halted in new zealand weve got to stop this abomination before it is unleashed abomination youre scaring me marcus youre talking like a biblical prophet ryans face flushed but he held his temper i have no intention of making bens people collateral damage oceanus will be too busy dealing with our little gifts to do anything in any case well call the authorities as soon as were finished here it would only take a few bursts from an automatic weapon to kill bens people why not call in outside help now because it would take time we dont have were talking search warrants and legal process the villagers could be dead by the time the mounties decide to investigate he paused remember i tried to bring numa in on this and austin refused therri bit her lower lip in frustration her loyalty toward ryan was intense but not uncritical dont turn your sights on kurt if it werent for him youd be eat ing sardines in a danish prison cell ryan beamed his lighthouse smile youre right im out of line but theres still time to call bear and have him take you out of here not on your life ryan mercer had finished organizing their backpacks he strapped on a pistol belt and handed one to ryan therri refused a weapon they piled their supplies into the inflatable shoved it off the beach and started the engine it ran with a low hum and pushed them through the water at a slow but respectable speed they hugged the shoreline even after they had passed through the channel into the larger lake ryan was using a topographic map with notations based on bens information he stopped the boat at one point and peered through his binoculars at the opposite side of the lake he could make out a pier and several boats but no structure matching nighthawks de scription thats funny i dont see any dome ben said it rose above the trees what should we do therri said well go to bens village and wait there then well head across the lake leave our calling cards where they will do the most good and set the timers for late morning when well be well on our way out of here they got underway again the sun was falling behind the trees when they saw the clearing and the dozen or so houses that made up bens village it was deathly quiet with only a faint soughing in the trees and the lap of the waves against shore breaking the silence they stopped about fifty yards offshore while ryan then the others checked out the village with lightgathering glasses seeing nothing they cruised straight on in beached the boat and came ashore ryan was careful insisting that they check out the houses and store the village was deserted as ben had described they had something to eat by the time they finished darkness was complete except for a blueblack sheen on the lake and pinpoints of light on the opposite shore they took turns standing watch while the others slept around midnight they were all awake and preparing to move out they slid the boat into the water and pushed off halfway across the lake ryan peered through his glasses and said jesus the sky across the lake was lit up he handed the binocs to therri but even with her naked eye she could see the dully lit greenishblue structure that mounded above the trees it seemed to have dropped from space ryan directed mercer to steer off to one side away from the pier they beached a few minutes later pulled the inflatable onshore and piled brush around it then they made their way along the beach to ward the pier when they were a few hundred feet away they cut in land and came upon the road that ben and josh green had used to get to the airship hangar the muddy ruts ben had described had since been graded and blacktopped they were looking for a particular type of building and found what they were looking for in a structure that hummed with the sound of pumps mercer made short work of the padlocks with a tiny cutting torch large glass tanks stretched from one side of the building to the other and the air inside was heavy with the smell offish and the hum of motors the room was in semidarkness but large pale shapes could be seen moving behind the glass mercer got right to work he placed packets of c in strategic places molding the puttylike explosive around pumps and electrical conduits where explosions would do the most damage what was left he placed on the outside of the tanks they worked fast arming the charges and setting the timers and were done within thirty minutes the only people they had seen were those moving in the distance but ryan wasnt going to press their luck they made their way back toward the lakeshore again with out encountering anyone ryan was beginning to feel uneasy but he pressed on if all went as planned bear would be picking them up just before the big bang unfortunately all did not go as planned their boat was missing to begin with thinking that they may have misjudged the distance in the dark ryan sent the others down the beach to look for the boat while he stood watch when five minutes had passed and they hadnt returned he struck out after them and he found therri and mercer standing side by side looking out toward the lake did you find it he said no answer they remained motionless when he moved in closer he saw why their wrists were bound behind their backs with wire and they had tape across their mouths before he could free his friends the bushes behind the beach erupted and they were sur rounded by a dozen burly figures one man took ryans gun away and another came closer and flicked on a flashlight its beam illuminating the mans hand dan gling in his fingers was one of the charges ryan had set in the fish house the man threw the explosives into the lake and put the beam on his own face so that ryan could be sure to see the pockmarked jackolantern features and the fierce grin he drew a whitebladed knife from his belt and put it under ryans chin so that the point dimpled his skin and drew a droplet of blood then he uttered something in a strange language and re turned the knife to its scabbard together they began to march back toward the airship hangar austin examined the satellite photograph through the magnifying glass and shook his head he slid the picture and magnifier across his desk to zavala after studying the photo for a moment zavala said i can see a lake with a clearing on one side and some houses could be nighthawks village theres a pier and some boats on the other side but no airship hangar maybe its hidden maybe were setting off on a fools mission old chum wouldnt be the first time look at it this way max said this is the place and id trust max with my life you may have to austin said he checked his watch our plane will be ready in a couple of hours wed better get packed i never packed from my last trip zavala said see you at the airport austin did a quick turnaround at his boathouse and was heading out the door when he saw the light blinking on his telephone an swering machine he debated whether to listen to the message but when he pushed the button he was glad he did ben nighthawk had called and left a phone number austin dropped his duffel bag and quickly punched out the num ber man am i glad to hear from you nighthawk said ive been waiting by the phone hoping youd call i tried to get in touch with you a couple of times sorry for being such a jerk that guy would have killed me if you hadnt stepped in i wandered around and hung out with some pals feeling sorry for myself when i got back to my apartment there was a message from therri she said that sos was going off on its own ryan talked her into it i guess damned fools theyll get themselves killed i feel the same way im worried about my family too weve got to stop them im willing to try but i need your help you ve got it how soon can you leave whenever you want me to how about now ill pick you up on the way to the airport ill be ready after zavala left the numa building he drove his corvette convertible to his home in arlington virginia while the upstairs was spotless as would be expected of someone who routinely dealt in microscopic tolerances zavalas basement looked like a cross be tween captain nemos workshop and a redneck gas station it was crammed with models of undersea craft metalcutting tools and piles of diagrams marked with greasy fingerprints the one exception to the jumble was a locked metal cabinet where zavala kept his collection of weaponry technically zavala was a marine engineer but his duties on the special assignments team sometimes required firepower unlike austin who favored a custommade bowen revolver zavala employed whatever weapon was handy usually with deadly efficiency he eyed the collection of firearms in the cabinetwondering what short of a neutron bomb would be effective against a ruthless multinational organization with its own private armyand reached for an ithaca model repeat ins shotgun the primary weapon used by the seals in vietnam he liked the idea that the shotgun could be fired almost like an automatic weapon zavala carefully packed the shotgun and an ample supply of am munition into a case and before long he was on his way to dulles air port he drove with the top down savoring the ride because he knew it would be his last in the vette until his assignment was over he pulled up to a hangar in an outoftheway corner of the airport where a crew of mechanics was doing lastminute checks on a numa executive jet he kissed the corvettes fender and said a sad goodbye then climbed aboard the plane zavala was going over his flight plan when austin arrived a short time later with ben nighthawk in tow austin introduced the young indian to zavala nighthawk glanced around as if he were looking for something dont worry austin said noting the expression of consternation on nighthawks face joe just looks like a bandit he really does know how to fly a plane thats right zavala said looking up from his clipboard ive passed a correspondence course all except for the part about the landing the last thing austin wanted was to have ben bolt from the plane in fright joe likes to kid around he said i wasnt worried about that itswell is this all there is i mean just zavalas lips turned up in a smile we hear a lot of that sort of thing he said recalling beckers skepticism when he and austin had arrived to rescue the danish sailors im starting to get an inferior ity complex this isnt a suicide squadron austin said well pick up some extra muscle on the way in the meantime make yourself comfort able theres coffee in that carafe ill assist joe in the cockpit they were quickly cleared for takeoff and the plane headed north at a cruising speed of five hundred miles an hour they were over the waters of the gulf of st lawrence in a little over three hours they touched down at a small coastal airport rudi gunn had checked earlier and found that there was a numa survey ship working in the gulf the way had been smooth through canadian customs and before long austin zavala and ben were climbing aboard the ship which had come into port by previous arrangement the navarra was waiting ten miles offshore as they approached the yacht zavala eyed the long sleek vessel with appreciation pretty he said and from her lines id say shes fast too but she doesnt look tough enough to take on oceanus wait austin said with a knowing smile the navarra sent over a launch to pick them up aguirrez was waiting on deck his black beret as usual perched at a jaunty angle on his head by his side were the two brawny men who had escorted austin after he was plucked from the waters outside the mermaids gate good to see you again mr austin aguirrez said pumping kurts hand glad you and your friends could make it aboard these are my two sons diego and pablo it was the first time austin had seen the two men smile and he noted the resemblance to their father he introduced zavala and nighthawk the yacht was already underway by that time and he and the others followed aguirrez to his grand salon aguirrez mo tioned for the men to take a seat and a steward appeared with hot drinks and sandwiches aguirrez asked them about their trip and waited patiently for them to finish their lunch before he picked up a remote control at a click of a button a section of wall slid up to re veal a giant screen another click and an aerial photograph filled the space the photograph showed forest and water nighthawk sucked in his breath thats my lake and my vil lage i used the coordinates mr austin gave me and fed them into a commercial satellite aguirrez said im puzzled however as you can see there is no sign of this airship building that you mentioned we had the same problem with the satellite photos we looked at austin said but our computer model indicates that this is the place nighthawk rose and walked over to the screen he pointed to a section of forest bordering the lake its here i fnow it is look you can see where the woods have been cleared and theres the pier his confusion was evident but theres nothing but trees here where the blimp hangar should be tell us again what you saw that night austin said the dome was huge but we didnt see it until the airship ap peared the surface was covered with panels panels zavala said yes what you see on a geodesic dome like the one they built for the olympics in montreal hundreds of sections zavala nodded i didnt think that adaptive camouflage technol ogy was that far advanced sounds more like invisibility were talking about austin said gesturing toward the screen not a bad guess adaptive camouflage is a new technique the surface that you want to hide is blanketed with flat panels which sense the scenery and changing light then what the sensors see is dis played on the panels if you were standing at ground level looking at this thing all you would see is trees so the dome would blend into the local forest someone obviously took satellite imaging into account it would be a simple matter to project treetops on the roof panels austin shook his head joe you never cease to amaze me with your supply of arcane knowledge i think i read about it in popular mechanics nonetheless you may have solved the mystery aguirrez said at night the panels mr zavala talked about could be programmed for the ambient darkness mr nighthawk saw more than was in tended when the dome opened for the zeppelin theres something else that might interest you i saved photos taken earlier aguirrez went back through the memory bank and projected another aerial photo this picture was taken of the area yesterday there in the corner you see the outline of a small plane ill zoom in on that sec tion the picture of a floatplane filled the entire screen four figures could be seen standing on the shore of the lake the plane disap peared a short time after the photo was taken but look here an other image appeared showing a small boat with three people in it one of them a woman was looking skyward as if she knew they were under surveillance from space the basques sharp ears picked up the sound of austin swearing under his breath aguirrez raised his bushy eyebrows i think i know who those people are austin said by way of ex planation and if im right it could complicate things how soon can we jump off were heading up the coast to a point that will enable you to go the shortest straightline distance two hours maybe in the mean time i can show you what i have to offer with his sons taking up the rear aguirrez escorted the others down a companionway to a large brightly lit belowdecks helicop ter hangar we have two helicopters he said the civilian one on the stern we use for getting about this seacobra is held in reserve should the occasion arise the spanish navy ordered a number of these aircraft through my connections i was able to sidetrack one of them it carries the standard armament aguirrez sounded like a car salesman touting the extras for a buick austin swept his eyes over the naval version of the army huey the rocket and minigun pods slung under the stubby wings the stan dard armament will do just fine very good aguirrez said my sons will accompany you and your friend in the eurocopter and the seacobra will go along with you in case you need backup he furrowed his brow im concerned that someone smart enough to use such clever camouflage would have the best detection technology you could be greeted by a wel coming party and even a heavily armed helicopter would be vul nerable i agree austin said thats why were going in by land well put down at an abandoned logging camp and ben will guide us through the forest to our target we think they will expect any in trusion to come across the lake as ben did before so well come in from behind well escape the same wayhopefully with bens fam ily and friends i like it simple in planning and execution what do you do when you get to your target aguirrez asked thats the hard part austin replied we dont have much other than bens account and the aerial photos well have to improvise but it wouldnt be the first time aguirrez didnt seem worried well then i suggest we get started he signaled diego who went over to a phone next to a battery of switches he spoke a few words then began to punch buttons there was the hum of motors an alarm horn sounded and doors in the ceiling slid slowly apart next the floor started to move upward and moments later they and the helicopter were lifted up to the deck where crewmen alerted by the call hurried in to prepare the seacobra for action the vessel that dr throckmorton had commandeered for his survey was a stubby converted sterntrawler used by the canadian fisheries service the onehundredfootlong cormorant was docked near where mike neals boat had been tied up on the trouts first visit to the harbor to quote the great yogi berra this is like deja vu all over again trout said as he and gamay walked up the gangplank onto the deck of the survey vessel she gazed out at the sleepy harbor strange being back here this place is so peaceful so is a graveyard paul said throckmorton bustled over and greeted them with his usual ef fusiveness the doctors trout what a pleasure it is to have you aboard im so glad you called i had no idea after our discussion in montreal that wed be seeing each other so soon neither did we gamay said your findings created quite a stir with the people at numa thanks for having us aboard on such short notice not at all not at all he lowered his voice i recruited a couple of my students to help out a young man and woman brilliant kids but im pleased to have adult scientific colleagues aboard if you know what i mean i see youre still wearing your cast hows the arm its fine paul said he glanced around i dont see dr barker on board he couldnt make it throckmorton said personal commit ment of some sort he may try to join us later i hope he shows up i could use his genetic expertise then the research hasnt been going well gamay said on the contrary its been going fine but im more of a mechanic in this field if i may use an analogy i can bolt the frame and chassis together but its frederick who designs the sports car even the most expensive sports car wouldnt run forever without the mechanic to make the engine go gamay said with a smile youre very kind but this is a complex matter and ive run into a few aspects that have me puzzled he frowned ive always found fishermen to be superb observers of whats going on at sea the local fishing fleet has moved on to more productive grounds as you know but i talked to a few oldtimers shore captains who watched the fish stocks vanish and be replaced by these socalled devilfish now the devilfish have dribbled down to nothing theyre dying and i dont know why too bad you havent been able to catch any oh i never said that come ill show you throckmorton led the way through the dry lab where the com puters and other electrical equipment were kept high and dry and into the wet lab basically a small space with sinks running water tanks and table space used for the damp pursuits such as carving up speci rnens for investigation he donned a pair of gloves and reached into an oversized cooler with a hand from the trouts he pulled out the frozen carcass of a salmon about four feet long and placed it on a table thats similar to the fish we caught paul said bending low to inspect the palewhite scales we would have liked to keep this specimen alive but it was im possible he tore the net apart and would have devoured the rest of the ship if he lived long enough now that youve seen one of these things up close what are your conclusions gamay said throckmorton took a deep breath and puffed out his plump cheeks its as i feared judging from his unusual physical size id say hes definitely a genetically modified salmon a labproduced mutant in other words its the same species as the one i showed you in my lab but your fish was smaller and more normallooking throckmorton nodded they were both programmed with growth genes id venture but where my experiment was kept under control there seems to have been no effort to restrain size with this fellow its almost as if someone wanted to see what would happen but size and ferociousness led to its downfall once these creatures destroyed and replaced the natural stocks they turned on each other they were too hungry to breed in other words thats possible or this design may simply have had a problem adapting to the wild in the same way a big tree would be uprooted in a storm while a straggly little scrub pine survives nature tends to cull out mutants that dont fit into the scheme of things theres another possibility gamay said i think dr barker said something about producing neutered biofish so they couldnt breed yes thats entirely possible but it would involve some sophisti cated bioengineering whats next for your survey paul said well see what we can catch over the next few days then ill bring this specimen and anything else i catch back to montreal where we can map the genes i may be able to match it up with some of the stuff i have in the computers maybe we can figure out who designed it is that possible oh sure a genetic program is almost as good as a signature i sent dr barker a message telling him what i found frederick is a whiz at this sort of thing you speak very highly of him paul said hes brilliant as i said before i only wish that he werent affili ated with a commercial venture speaking of commercial ventures we heard theres a fish processing plant of some sort up the coast could they have had any thing to do with this in what way i dont know pollution maybe like those twoheaded frogs they sometimes find in contaminated waters interesting premise but unlikely you might see some deformed fish or fish kills but this monster is no accident and we would have seen deformities in other species which doesnt seem to have been the case tell you what though well motor out and anchor for the night near the fish plant and make a few sets with the net in the morning how long can you stay on board as long as you can stand us paul said we dont want to im pose no imposition at all he put the salmon back into the cooler you may decide to cut your stay short after you see your cabin the cabin was slightly bigger than the two upanddown bunks it contained after throckmorton left them to get settled paul tried to ease his sixfooteight length into the lower bunk but his legs hung over the side ive been thinking about what dr throckmorton told us gamay said trying the mattress on top suppose you were dr barker and you were working for oceanus on this biofish thing would you want anyone testing genetic material that could be traced to your doorstep nope judging from our own experience oceanus is ruthless when it comes to snoops any suggestions sure we could suggest that throckmorton find another location to anchor for the night fake a toothache or make some other ex cuse you dont really want to do that do you as you recall i whined the whole trip up here because i couldnt go play with kurt and joe you dont have to remind me you sounded as if you hadnt been picked for the little league team dr throckmorton is a fine fellow but i wasnt prepared to baby sit him away from the action and now you think the action may have moved to our doorstep paul nodded and said got a loony gamay dug out a cana dian dollar coin with the picture of a loon on one side paul tossed it in the air and caught it on the back of his cast heads i lose you get to choose which watch you want okay you can take the first twohour shift starting as soon as the fest of the crew turns in fine with me he extracted himself from the bunk i wouldnt get much sleep in this torture rack he lifted his injured arm in the air maybe i can use this cast as a weapon no need gamay said with a smile she dug into her duffel bap and pulled out a holster that held a caliber target pistol i brought this along in case i wanted to brush up on my target shooting paul smiled as a girl his wife had been taught by her father to shoot skeet and she was an expert marksman he took the pistol and found that he could aim it if he propped up the cast with his other hand gamay looked at his shaky aim maybe we should both stand watch the ship dropped anchor about a mile from shore the silhouettes of rooflines and a communication tower marked the oceanus facil ity which was located on a rocky hill overlooking the water the trouts had dinner in the small galley with throckmorton his stu dents and some crew time went by quickly hastened by talk about throckmortons work and the trouts numa experiences around eleven they called it a night paul and gamay went to their cabin and waited until the ship was quiet then they crept up onto the deck and took a position on the side facing land the night was cool they stayed warm with the heavy sweaters under their windbreakers and blankets borrowed from their bunks the water was flat calm except for a lazy swell paul sat with his back to the cabin housing and gamay lay on the deck beside him the first two hours went quickly then gamay took over and paul stretched out on the deck it seemed he was asleep only a few minutes before gamay was shaking him by the shoulder he came awake quickly and said whats up i need your eyes ive been watching that dark smudge on the water i thought it might be a patch of floating seaweed but its come closer paul rubbed his eyes and followed the pointing finger at first he saw nothing but the blueblackness of the sea after a moment he saw a darker mass and it seemed to be moving in their direction there was something else the soft murmur of voices thats the first time i ever heard a patch of kelp talking how about firing a shot across their bow they crawled forward and gamay assumed a prone firing position with her elbows resting on the deck the pistol clasped in two hands paul fiddled with a flashlight but finally got it into position when gamay gave him the goahead he flicked the light on the powerful beam fell upon the swarthy faces of four men they were dressed in black and were sitting in two kayaks their wooden paddles frozen in midstroke their almond eyes blinked with surprise in the light crack the first shot shattered the paddle held by the lead man in one boat there was a second shot and a paddle in the second boat flew into pieces the men in the rear of the kayaks backpaddled furiously and the others dug their hands into the water to help they got the boats turned around and headed back toward land but gamay wasnt about to let them off so easily the boats were almost out of range of the light when she shot out the other two paddles good shootin annie oakley paul said good spottin deadeye dick that should keep them busy for a while the gunfire wasnt loud by itself but in the stillness of the night it must have sounded like cannon barrages because dr throck morton and some of the crew came on deck oh hullo he said when he saw the trouts we heard a noise my goodness he said spying the pistol in camays hand just thought id do some target practice they could hear voices out on the water one of the crew went to the ships rail and cocked his ear sounds as if someone needs help wed better get a boat over the side i wouldnt do that if i were you paul said in his usual soft spoken manner but with an unmistakable steeliness in his voice the folks out there are doing fine on their own throckmorton hesitated then said to the crewman its all right i want to talk to the trouts for a moment after the others had shuffled back to their cabins throckmorton said now if you wouldnt mind telling me my friends exactly what is going on gamay said to her husband ill go get some coffee it could be a long night minutes later she returned with three steaming mugs i found a bottle of whiskey and poured in a few shots she said i thought we might need it taking turns they laid out their suspicions of the oceanus plot backing them up with evidence gleaned from several sources these are grave charges throckmorton said do you have solid proof of this outrageous plan id say the proof is that thing in your lab cooler gamay said do you have any more questions yes throckmorton said after a moment do you have any more whiskey gamay had thoughtfully stuck the pint in her pocket after they refreshed his coffee and he had taken a sip throckmorton said fredericks affiliations have always bothered me but i had assumed optimistically i suppose that scientific reason would overrule his commercial interests in time let me ask you a question about the premise were operating under gamay said would it be possible to destroy the native fish populations and substitute these frankenfish entirely possible and if anyone could do it it would be dr barker this explains so much its still hard to believe dr barker is with this bunch but he has acted strangely he blinked like some one coming out of a dream those gunshots i heard someone tried to board our ship it would seem so gamay said perhaps it would be better if we moved on and informed the au thorities we dont know where that shore facility fits into the picture gamay said with a combination of feminine firmness and reassur ance kurt thinks it may be important and wants us to keep an eye on it until his mission is completed isnt that dangerous to the people on board this ship not necessarily paul said just as long as we keep watch id suggest that you have the captain get the ship ready for a quick de parture but i doubt our friends will come back now that weve spoiled the element of surprise all right throckmorton said he set his jaw in determination but is there anything else i can do yes paul said he took the whiskey from gamay and poured throckmorton another shot to calm the professors nerves you can wait the sos crew stumbled blindly through deep woods with the guards showing no mercy therri tried to get a better look at their tormentors but a guard jammed a gun into her back with such force that it broke the skin tears of pain ran down her cheeks she bit her lip stifling the urge to cry out the forest was dark except for lights glowing here and there through the trees then the trees thinned and they were standing in front of a building whose large door was illuminated by an outside floodlight they were shoved inside the building the guards cut the wire binding their wrists and the sliding door was slammed shut and locked behind them the air inside smelled of gasoline and there were oil stains on the floor evidence that the structure had been built as an oversized garage no vehicles were parked inside but the garage was far from empty more than three dozen peoplemen women and a few chil drenhuddled like frightened puppies against the far wall their misery was etched into their tired faces and there was no mistaking the terror in their eyes at the sudden appearance of strangers the two groups stared warily at each other after a moment a man who had been sitting crosslegged on the floor got to his feet and came over his face was as wrinkled as old leather and his long gray hair was tied in a ponytail he had dark circles under his eyes and his clothes were filthy yet he projected an aura of unmistakable dignity when he spoke therri realized why the man looked so familiar im jesse nighthawk he said extending his hand in greeting nighthawj she said you must be bens father his mouth dropped open you know my son yes i work with him in the sos office in washington the old man glanced past thems shoulder as if he were looking for someone ben was here i saw him run out of the woods he was with another man who was killed yes i know ben is fine i just saw him in washington he told us that you and the villagers were in trouble ryan stepped forward and said we came to get you and the oth ers out jesse nighthawk gazed at ryan as if he were dudley doright the cartoon mountie who always arrived to save the day shaking his head he said you seem to mean well but im sorry you came you have put yourself in great danger by coming here we were captured as soon as we landed therri said it was as if they knew we were coming they have watchers everywhere nighthawk said the evil one told me this the evil one youll meet him im afraid hes like a monster in a heat dream he killed bens cousin with a spear jesses eyes grew moist at the recollection weve been working day and night clearing the forest even the women and children his voice trailed off in weariness who are these people ryan said they call themselves kiolya i think theyre eskimos i dont know for sure they started building in the woods across the lake from our village we didnt much like it but were squatters on the land so we dont have any say in things then one day they came across the lake with guns and brought us here weve been cutting trees and dragging them off ever since you have any idea what this is all about before ryan could answer there was the sound of the door being unlatched six men came into the garage machine rifles draped in the crooks of their arms their dark faces were alike wide with high cheekbones and hard almondshaped eyes the cruelty sculpted into their impassive expressions paled next to that of the seventh man to enter he was built like a bull with a short thick neck his head sitting almost directly on powerful shoulders his yellowishred skin was pockmarked and his mouth was set in a leer vertical tattoo marks flanked his nose which was bruised and misshapen he was unarmed except for the knife hanging in a scabbard at his belt therri stared in disbelief at the man who had pursued austin on the dogsled there was no mistaking the ruined face and the body that looked as if it had been pumped up on steroids she knew ex actly who jesse meant when he talked about the evil one the man swept his eyes over the new prisoners sending chills along thems spine as his coalblack eyes lingered on her body jesse nighthawk instinctively stepped back with the other villagers a brutish grin crossed the mans face as he saw the fear he in spired he uttered a guttural command the guards shoved thern ryan and mercer out of the building and marched them through the woods therri was completely disoriented she had no idea where the lake was if by some miracle she had the chance to escape she wouldnt know which way to run her confusion was further compounded seconds later they were moving along a paved path toward a thick stand of fir trees that barred their way like a dark and impenetrable wall the fat trunks and thickly grown branches were a shadowy interplay of blacks and grays when they were yards away from the nearest trees a section of forest disappeared in its place was a rectangle of blinding white light therri shielded her eyes when they adjusted after a moment she saw people moving about as if she were looking through a door way into another dimension they were herded through the door into an enormous brightly lit space hundreds of feet across and vaulted by a high rounded ceil ing she looked behind her as the rectangle of forest vanished and she realized that they had stepped into a building masked by a clever camouflage while the structure itself was an architectural wonder what caught their breath was the huge silverywhite airship that took up a good portion of the space inside the dome they gazed up in astonishment at the torpedoshaped leviathan that was longer than two football fields its tail tapered down to a point that was surrounded by four triangular stabilizing fins giving it a streamlined appearance despite its enormous size four massive engines in protective nacelles hung from struts below the belly of the aircraft the airship rested on a complicated system of fixed and mov able gantries dozens of men in coveralls swarmed around and over the airship the air echoed with the sound of machinery and tools the guards nudged the prisoners forward under the rounded nose of the airship which loomed overhead as if it could crush them at any second therri had a fleeting image of what a bug must feel like just before a shoe comes down a long narrow control cabin ringed by big windows was set into the aircrafts belly a short distance back from the nose and they were ordered inside the roomy interior reminded therri of a ship com plete with its spoked wheel and binnacle a man stood inside giving orders to several others unlike the guards who all looked as if they had sprung from the same mold he was tall and his skin looked as if it had been bleached his head was shaved bald he turned at the arrival of the prisoners and looked at them through dark sunglasses then handed off the electronic clipboard he was holding well well what a pleasant surprise sos to the rescue he smiled but his voice had all the warmth of a wind blowing off a gla cier ryan responded as if he hadnt heard the taunt my name is mar cus ryan the director of sentinels of the sea this is them weld our legal counsel and chuck mercer sos operations director theres no need to go through the routine of name rank and se rial number i know perfectly well who you are the man said lets not waste time in the whitemans world i go by the name of fred erick barker im called toonook by my own people you and these others are eskimos ryan said ignorant people call us by that name but we are kiolya you dont fit the stereotype for an eskimo ive inherited the genes of a new england whaling captain what started as a humiliating liability has enabled me to pass myself off in the outside world without question to the benefit of the kiolya what is this thing ryan said glancing above his head beautiful isnt it the nietzsche was secretly built by the ger mans to go to the north pole they planned to use it for commercial flight it was all fitted out to take on passengers who would pay any thing to fly aboard a real polar explorer when it crashed my peo ple thought it was a gift from heaven in a way they were right ive spent millions in restoration we made improvements in the engines and their carrying capacity the gas bags were replaced with new ones that can hold millions of cubic feet of hydrogen i thought hydrogen went out with the hindenburg mercer said german airships safely traveled thousands of miles using hydro gen i chose it because of the weight of my cargo hydrogen has twice the lifting power of helium by the means of this simplest of atoms the people of the aurora borealis will achieve their rightful destiny youre talking in riddles ryan said not at all legend has it that the kiolya were born in the aurora which the inuit tribes fear as a source of bad luck unfortunately you and your friends will soon learn that this reputation is wellearned you intend to kill us dont you the kiolya dont keep prisoners beyond their usefulness what about the villagers as i said we dont keep prisoners since were doomed why not indulge our curiosity and tell us where this aviation antique fits in a cold smile crossed the pale lips this is where the hero plays on the villains vanity hoping for the cavalry to arrive dont waste your time you and your friends will live only as long as i need you arent you interested in learning what we know about your plans in answer barker said something in a strange language and the leader of the guards stepped forward and handed him one of the c explosive packets that mercer had carefully prepared did you in tend to do some mining ryan shot back hell no we planned to sink your operation like you did our ship blunt and to the point as usual mr ryan but i dont think youll get the chance to ignite your little july fourth display he said his words dripping with contempt he tossed the explosives to his hench man and exactly what do you know about our operation we know all about your experiments with biologically modified fish thats only part of my grand plan barker said let me explain what the future holds tonight this airship will rise into the sky and head east its holding tanks will be filled with genetically modified fish in several species it will spread my creations in the sea like a farmer planting seed within a few weeks and months the native species will be wiped out if this pilot project succeeds as i expect it will similar seedings will take place in all the worlds oceans in time most of the fish on the world market will be those produced through our patented gene banks we will have neartotal monopoly ryan laughed do you really think this crazy scheme will work theres nothing crazy about it every computer model points to a resounding success the natural fish stocks are doomed from over fishing and industrial pollution anyway im simply hastening the day when the oceans are turned into vast fish farms best of all throwing fish into the sea isnt even against the law killing people is against the law ryan said anger in his eyes you murdered my friend and colleague josh green therri was unable to contain herself any longer josh wasnt the only one you killed the television reporter aboard the sentinel your thugs shot one of your own men in copenhagen you murdered ben nighthawks cousin and tried to kill senator graham youre keep ing people as slaves the company lawyer has a tongue barkers jaw hardened and the civilized tone he had been using turned into a snarl its a pity you werent around to argue the case for the kiolya when they starved to death because the white men decimated the walrus or when the tribe was forced to leave its traditional hunting grounds spreading throughout canada moving into the cities far from their homeland none of that gives you the right to kill people or to mess up the oceans for your own good she said with unrestrained fury you can terrorize a bunch of poor indians and push us around but youre going to have to contend with numa im not going to lose any sleep over admiral sandeckers collec tion of oddballs and geeks would you lose sleep over kurt austin ryan said i know all about austin hes a dangerous manbut numa re gards sos as an outlaw organization no you and your friends here are all alone more alone than you have ever been in your life barkers tattooed henchman said something in the kiolya language umealiq reminds me that you wanted to see my pets with the guards taking up the rear barker led the way to a side door that opened to the outside moments later they were back at the building where sos had planted the explosive charges only this time the interior was brightly lit up barker paused in front of one of the tanks the fish inside was nearly ten feet long barker cocked his head like an artist studying his canvas i did most of my early work with salmon barker said it was comparatively easy to create giants like this although i actually came up with a fiftypound sardine that lived a few months he moved on to the next tank therri sucked in her breath at the sight of the creature inside it was a salmon half the size of the fish in the first tank but it had two identical heads on the same body this one didnt turn out the way i planned you must admit its in teresting though the fish in the next tank was even more deformed its body cov ered with round lumps that gave it a repulsive pebbled appearance in another tank was a fish with bulbous protruding eyes the same deformities were repeated with other species haddock and cod and herring these are hideous ryan said beauty is in the eye of the beholder barker stopped before a tank that held a silverywhite fish about five feet long this is an early prototype i developed before i found that aggression and size were getting out of control in my experiments i let some into the wild to see what happened unfortunately they started to devour each other after they wiped out the local species these arent experiments theyre monsters ryan said why do you let them live feeling sorry for a fish thats stretching it even for sos let me tell you about this fellow hes very handy we threw the body of the indian into the tank along with your friend and he stripped them down to the bone in no time we let the other indians watch and they havent given us an ounce of trouble since ryan lost his cool and launched himself at barker he had his hands around the mans throat when barkers henchman grabbed the rifle from one of the guards and slammed the butt into ryans head therri was showered with blood as ryan slumped to the floor therri felt the coldness in the pit of her stomach as she recog nized the source of the fear she had seen in jesse nighthawks eyes she heard barker say if mr ryan and his friends are so concerned about their finny friends maybe we can arrange dinner together later then the guards closed in the eurocopter carrying austin zavala ben nighthawk and the two basques lifted off the navarras heli copter pad and wheeled above the yacht in a big circle minutes later the seacobra joined the circling chopper flying side by side the choppers headed west toward the afternoon sun from his seat next to the pilot austin had a clear view of the sea cobras lethal silhouette pacing the eurocopter a few hundred feet away the combat helicopter carried enough weaponry to level a small city austin was under no illusions oceanus would be no pushover cruising at a speed of one hundred twentyfive knots the heli copters soon passed over a rocky shoreline and left the sea behind them they were traveling over a dense forest of fir trees keeping a tight formation hugging the treetops in the hope of avoiding detec tion austin checked the load in his bowen revolver then he sat back in his seat closed his eyes and worked through their plan in his head zavala sometimes jokingly accused austin of making things up as he went along there was some truth to the charge austin knew planning could only go so far having grown up on and around the water his views were colored by his nautical experiences he knew that a mission was like sailing a boat into foul weather when things went wrong they really went wrong a good sailor kept his lines clear and his bailing can handy he was a strong believer in the kiss principle keep it simple stupid since his primary goal was to get bens family and friends out safely the seacobra couldnt just swoop down and blast away at everything in sight austin knew there was no such thing as a surgi cal strike the choppers armament would have to be used sparingly a fact which neutered its fearsome capability he furrowed his brow at the wild card that fanatical idiot marcus ryan had dealt him austin didnt need his fondness for therri weld to cloud his judg ment the eurocopters engine changed pitch as the aircraft cut speed and came to a hover over the forest ben who was sitting behind austin with zavala and the aguirrez brothers was signaling the pilot to descend the pilot shook his head and insisted that there was no place to land pablo glanced out the window do you trust the indian austin checked the landing zone visibility was restricted and he could see nothing but dark greenery in the lowering sun they were now in ben nighthawks backyard this is his country not mine pablo nodded then barked in spanish at the pilot who muttered to himself and radioed the other helicopter of his plans to land the seacobra peeled off and flew a backandforth pattern over the woods using its infrared detectors to see if there were any warm bodies lurking in the vicinity detecting no sign of human life the seacobra gave the okay to land the eurocopter sank into the forest no one except ben would have been surprised to hear the rotors shred themselves in an unequal match with the sturdy tree trunks but the only sound was a crackle and snap of thin branches and the soft thump of the skids hitting the around bens sharp eyes had seen what the others had not that what appeared to be thick forest was in reality a cleared area overgrown with heavy underbrush the seacobra dropped down a short dis tance away austin let out the breath he had been holding and jumped from the chopper with zavala and the aguirrez brothers right behind him they ducked into a combat crouch with guns at the ready de spite the infrared sweep as the rotors spun to a stop a silence so com plete that it seemed to have substance settled on them ben climbed out of the chopper and glanced at the upheld machine rifles you wont find anyone here he said this place hasnt been used since i was a kid theres a river over there through the trees he pointed to some ramshackle buildings that were barely visible in the dusky light thats the bunkhouse and the sawmill its a bad luck place my father said they had lots of accidents they built a new camp downriver where they could float the logs to market quicker austin had more temporal things on his mind the lights fad ing wed better get moving they rounded up their rucksacks and broke into two groups the numa men nighthawk and the aguirrez brothers would be the assault group the muscular basques moved with an air of assurance that suggested they were no strangers to clandestine missions the two pilots who were also heavily armed would wait for a call to provide backup ben led the way into the forest and they went from dusk to darkness the second they were under the trees each man except the last in line carried a small halogen flashlight which they held beampointeddown as they followed ben who moved through the woods as silently and as swiftly as a woodland wraith they traveled between a walk and a trot for several miles making good time on the soft carpet of pine needles until ben finally called a halt they stood in the piney darkness panting with exertion sweat pouring down their faces ben cocked his ear listening after a moment he said were less than a mile away zavala slipped the shotgun off his shoulder time to make sure our powder is dry dont worry about the guards ben said theyre all on the lakeside nobody would expect us to come in this way why not zavala replied youll see make sure you dont get ahead of me nighthawk said and without another word he pushed on ten minutes later ben slowed his pace to a walk advising them to proceed with care he brought the group to an abrupt halt at the edge of a chasm austin flashed his light on the steep vertical walls then pointed it downward toward the sound of rushing water the beam exhausted itself before reaching the river far below i think i know why there are no guards on this side zavala said we took a wrong turn and ended up on the north rim of the grand canyon this is called dead mans leap ben said the people around here arent very original when it comes to naming things they make their point well enough austin said zavala looked to the right and the left can we detour around this little ditch wed have to travel another ten miles through thick forest ben said this is the narrowest point the lake is a half mile from here i remember an indiana jones movie where they crossed a chasm on an invisible bridge zavala said ask and you shall receive austin said as he removed his back pack he unsnapped the flap and pulled out a coil of nylon rope and a compact folding grapnel zavalas eyes widened you never cease to amaze me amigo here i was thinking i was well prepared because i brought a swiss army knife with the corkscrew ill bet you have a bottle of fine wine in your little baggie as well austin produced a pulley and rappelling harness before you nominate me for a boy scout merit badge i should confess that ben told me wed have to cross this moat before we scaled the castle walls austin warned everyone to give him room he stepped danger ously close to the rim whirled the grapnel over his head and let it fly the first try fell short and clanged against the chasm wall two other tosses landed on the other side but failed to hook on on the fourth throw the hooks wedged into a cleft between some rocks austin be layed the other end of the rope to a tree and tested his weight to see if the grapnel would hold then he attached the pulley and rap pelling harness to the rope took a deep breath and stepped out into space by the time he reached the other side he seemed to be moving at mach a clump of bushes cushioned his landing using a retrieval line zavala pulled the pulley back attached austins backpack and sent it over after the rest of their gear was transported the same way zavala and ben made the next crossing then the two basques followed they gathered up their packs and kept on moving through the woods until they began to see willothewisp lights sprinkled among the trees like the campfires of a gypsy encampment they could hear the muffled sounds of machinery ben brought them to a halt now you can worry about the guards he whispered zavala and the basques slipped their weapons off their shoulders and austin loosened the flap on his belt holster he had studied the satellite photos of the complex trying to glean the layout as best he could even without the dome ben had helped fill in the gaps the zeppelin dome lay a short distance from the lake surrounded by a network of paved walkways and roads that connected several smaller buildings hidden in the woods he asked ben to take him to where he saw the dome while the others waited the indian led the way through the woods to the edge of a tarmac path that was lit by lowintensity anklehigh lights seeing that the way was clear they quickly crossed the tarred path into another patch of woods at one point ben stopped then raised his hands like a sleepwalker and began to move toward the trees barring their way he stopped again and whispered for austin to do the same austin followed with arms outstretched until his hands were about to touch the shadowy tree trunks but instead of rough bark his palm encountered a smooth cold surface he put his ear against the exterior and heard a low humming he backed off and saw the tree trunks again adap tive camouflage has a great future he thought he and ben quickly retraced their path and rejoined the others austin suggested that they investigate the outbuildings they would regroup in fifteen minutes dont take any wooden eskimo pies zavala said as he slipped away into the darkness pablo hesitated what if were discovered if you can do so quietly neutralize anyone who sees you austin said if not and all hell breaks loose escape the way we came what about me ben asked youve done enough leading us here take a rest i cant rest until my family is safe austin didnt blame ben for wanting to find his family stay close behind me he drew his bowen from its holster and waited until the others had melted into the darkness then he motioned for ben to follow and they struck off along the pathway sacrificing the cover of the woods for speed they could hear activity from the direction of the lake but the way was clear and before long they came across a long low building it was unguarded shall we austin said to ben they stepped inside the build ing was only a storage warehouse they made a quick inspection and headed back to the rendezvous zavala showed up a few min utes later we checked out a warehouse austin said did you find any thing exciting i wish i hadnt zavala said im swearing off fish and chips forever i think i hit the frankenfish mother lode he described the strange deformed creatures that he had seen in the building hed investigated it took a lot to disrupt zavalas natu ral calm but from the tone of his voice he was clearly rattled by the mutant monsters in the fish tanks sounds like the things in your finny freak show constitute the prototype models austin said he stopped talking at a soft rustling in the woods it was only pablo returning he said that he had found what looked like an empty garage inside there were signs of human habitation scraps of food slop buckets and blankets that might have been used to sleep on he handed austin an object that made austins jaw go hard it was a childs doll they waited for diego to appear and when he did show up they saw why he was late he was bent low carrying a heavy burden across his shoulders he stood up and an unconscious guard crashed to the ground you said to neutralize anyone who got in the way but i thought this pig might be more useful alive where did you find him he was in a barracks for the guards maybe one or two hundred bunks this thing was taking a siesta bet its the last time he sleeps on the job austin said he got down on one knee and flashed his light in the guards face the high cheekbones and wide mouth were indistinguishable from the other guards he had seen except that he had a bruised forehead austin stood and unscrewed the top of a canteen he took a sip then poured water onto the guards face the heavy features stirred and the eyes fluttered open they widened when they saw the guns pointed at his head where are the prisoners austin said he held the doll out so the guard could see what he wanted the mans lips spread wide in a mirthless grin and the dark eyes seemed to glow like fanned coals he snarled something in an in comprehensible language diego added a little persuasion putting his boot on the mans crotch and placing the muzzle between the fierce eyes the grin vanished but it was clear to austin that the guard was bound by a fanaticism that would withstand all the threats and pain that could be brought to bear diego saw that he was getting nowhere and switched around putting his foot on the mans face and his gun jammed into the man s crotch the mans eyes widened and he mumbled something in his language speak english diego said and jammed the gun harder the guard caught his breath the lake he gasped in the lake diego smiled even a pig wants to keep his cojones he said he removed the gun turned it around and slammed the butt down there was a sickening hollow sound and the guards head lolled like that of the doll still clutched in austins hand austin flinched but he had no sympathy for the guard he was too busy pondering the frightful possibilities for the prisoners sweet dreams he said with a shrug lead the way pablo said since were slightly outnumbered this may be a good time to call in the reserves zavala said pablo undipped the radio from his belt and ordered the seaco bra pilot to hover a mile away austin tucked the doll inside his shirt then with the others following he hurried in the direction of the lake determined to return the doll to its rightful owner when the guards had burst into the garage prison brandishing truncheons marcus ryan was huddled with jesse nighthawk he had been probing the indians knowledge of the forest so that he could put together an escape plan ryans hopes were dashed as the guards at least two dozen of them clubbed the pris oners at random most of the indians were used to the sporadic beat ings aimed to discourage resistance and they cowered against the far wall but ryan was slow to move and blows rained down on his shoulders and head therri had been playing with a little girl named rachael when the door burst open and the makeshift prison was suddenly filled with shouts and swinging clubs rachael was about five years old the youngest child in the group and like many of the villagers she was part of bens extended family therri stepped between one of the at tackers and the little girl and braced herself for the blow to come the guard froze confused at the unexpected show of defiance then he laughed and lowered his upraised club he glared at therri with pitiless eyes for that you and the girl will go first he called out to one of his companions who grabbed therri by the hair she was pushed facedown onto the floor and a club was pressed across the back of her neck her hands were bound behind her back with wire that cut painfully into her wrists then she was pulled to her feet and saw marcus and chuck whose heads were bloodied from the club blows when all the prisoners had been trussed like hogs the guards herded them through the doorway and marched them through the woods they walked through the woods for several minutes until the dull sheen of the lake was visible through the trees although it seemed like several days only a few hours had passed since they had been captured they were shoved into a shed near the lake and left alone they stood in the darkened building the children whimpering the older people trying to comfort the younger ones with their stoic attitude the fear of the unknown was even more torturous than being beaten then there was a commotion at the door which opened to admit barker surrounded by a contingent of his inscrutable guards he had removed his sunglasses and therri saw the strangely pale eyes for the first time they were the color of a rattlesnake belly she thought some of the guards carried blazing torches and barkers eyes seemed to glitter in the flickering light his face was wreathed in a satanic smile good evening ladies and gentlemen he said with the geniality of a tour guide thank you for coming within a few minutes i will rise high above this place on the first phase of a journey into the fu ture i wish to thank you all for helping to get this project launched to those of you from sos i wish youd been in my hands earlier so that by the sweat of your labor you would come to appreciate the bril liance of this plan ryan had regained his composure cut the crap what do you in tend to do with us barker surveyed ryans bloodied face as if he were seeing it for the first time why mr ryan youre looking a little rumpled these days not your usual blowdried self you havent answered my question to the contrary i answered it when you were first brought to me i said you and your friends would remain alive as long as i found you useful he smiled again i no longer find you useful im having the air dome lit up for your entertainment it will be the last thing your dying brain will record the words chilled therri to the bone what about the children she said what about them barkers icy gaze swept the prisoners as ifj surveying cattle being led to slaughter do you think i care for any one of you young or old you are nothing more to me than snow flakes youll all be forgotten once the world learns that an insignif icant eskimo tribe controls a significant portion of the ocean sorry i cant stay our timetable is very precise he spun on his heel and disappeared into the night the prison ers were rounded up and herded outside and toward the lake mo ments later their steps echoed on the long wooden pier the dock was in darkness except for the lights on what looked like a barge only with a catamaran hull as they moved closer therri saw that a con veyor belt flush with the deck led from a bin in the bow to a wide chute at the stern end she surmised that the strange craft must be used as a moveable feeding station the feed went into the bin and was transported via the belt and dumped into the fish cages through the chute an awful thought came to her and she yelled a warning theyre going to drown us marcus and chuck had seen the barge as well and at her words they struggled against their captors all they got for their trouble were club blows that took the fight out of them rough hands grabbed therri and pushed her onto the barge she stumbled and crashed onto the deck she managed to twist her body so that she didnt come down face first on the hard surface and most of the shock was absorbed at great painful cost by her right arm her knee hurt like hell too she didnt have time to dwell on her injuries duct tape was slapped across her mouth so she couldnt cry out then her ankles were bound a heavy weight was tied onto her wrist bindings and she was dragged along to the end of the barge and stretched crosswise across the belt she felt another smaller body against hers she looked over and to her horror she saw that the next victim in line was rachael the lit tle girl she had befriended then came the sos men and the other prisoners the preparations for multiple murder went on until all the prisoners were laid across the belt like cordwood then the barges inboard motors rumbled into life the lines were cast off the pier and the barge began to move therri couldnt see where they were going but she managed to turn to face the child and tried to comfort the girl with her eyes although she was sure they were filled with terror in the distance she could see the light from the dome rising above the trees as barker had promised she vowed that if she ever got the chance she would kill him personally the motors went for only a short while then they cut out and there was the splash of an anchor in the water therri struggled against her bindings to no avail she tensed preparing for the worst it came a minute later when the motor that powered the conveyor belt started the belt began to move carrying her closer to the lip of the chute and to the cold dark water beyond austin had led his ragtag assault group through the woods skirting the darkened plaza using the dimly lit footpath visible through the trees as a rough guide he moved slowly and with great deliberation making sure his path was free of twigs and branches before he put his full weight on his advancing foot the slow pace was maddening but while they had seen no one since encountering the guard austin had the creepy feeling that they were not alone his instincts were vindicated when the airship dome lit up like a giant lightbulb and a low roar arose from the plaza austin and the others froze like living statues then a delayed re action set in and they hit the ground bellyfirst their weapons cocked and ready to repel an assault the hail of bullets they expected never came instead the roar grew in intensity and volume and flowed around them in a vast rushing river of sound the noise came from the mouths of hundreds ofkiolya men their broad upturned faces cast in bluish light zombie eyes transfixed on barker who stood on a raised dais in front of the dome then came the monotonous chorus of a dozen tomtoms ringinp in the plaza and the crowd began to chant toonook toonook toonook barker bathed in the adulation letting it wash over him drink ing it in as if it were an elixir before he raised his arms to the sky then the chanting and the drumbeat stopped as if a switch had been pulled barker began to speak in a strange tongue that had its origins beyond the far reaches of the aurora borealis he started speaking slowly his voice growing in power zavala crawled up beside austin whats going on looks like our friend is having a high school pep rally ugh those cheerleaders wouldnt win any beauty contests zavala said austin stared through the trees mesmerized by the barbaric spec tacle as ben had said the dome actually did resemble a huge igloo barker was doing them a favor by whipping his gang of cutthroats into a murderous frenzy with all its attention focused on their leader barkers private army would hardly notice a handful of intruders sneaking through the woods austin scrambled to his feet and sig naled to the others to do the same crouching low they made their way through the forest until at last they broke into the open at the edge of the lake the area around the dock seemed to be deserted austin assumed that all of barkers men had been summoned back to the big igloo for their leaders command performance he wasnt about to take any chances though the shed near the dock was large enough to har bor dozens of assassins he edged along one side of the building and peered around the corner the sheds twin doors facing the water were wide open as if the last person out had been in a hurry with zavala and the basques keeping watch austin stepped in side and flashed his light around the shed was empty except for some lines anchors buoys and other boating paraphernalia after a quick glance around he was about to leave when ben who had fol lowed him inside said wait the indian pointed to the concrete floor all austin saw were mounds of dirt tracked in by those using the building ben got down on one knee and with his finger traced the small footprint of a child austins eyes hardened and he strode back outside to find zavala and the aguirrez brothers staring at some lights that were moving in the lake austin thought he heard the sound of a motor he couldnt be sure because the sound of barkers voice was still being carried on the wind he reached into his pack and pulled out a pair of night vision goggles which he put to his eyes its some sort of boat squarebuilt with low sides he handed the goggles to ben who peered through the lenses and said thats the catamaran i saw the first time i was here i dont recall you mentioning it sorry there was so much happening that night when josh green and i brought my canoe in we saw it tied up to the dock didnt seem important at the time it could be very important tell me about it ben shrugged id say it was more than fifty feet long kind of a barge but with a catamaran hull a conveyor belt a couple of yards across ran down the center from a big bin at the bow back to the stern which slopes down we figured it was used to feed the fish feed the fish austin murmured you remember what i told you about the fish cages i saw austin wasnt thinking about fish in cages bens words had con jured up the mafia cliche associated with concrete overshoes and a trip to the bottom of the east river he cursed as he recalled the nasty habit that had got the kiolya in trouble with its neighbor tribes barker had cooked up a mass human sacrifice to go along with his sendoff austin trotted to the end of the dock he stopped and squinted through the nightvision goggles again with bens description run ning through his mind he had a better understanding of what he was seeing the lowslung craft was moving slowly and had almost reached the middle of the lake in the illumination cast by the run ning lights he could see people moving around the deck he couldnt tell what they were up to but he had a good idea pablo had followed him what is it he said looking out at the lights reflected in the water trouble austin replied call in the seacobra pablo undipped the radio from his belt and barked an order in spanish theyre on their way he said what do you want them to do when they get here tell them to thaw out that big igloo for starters pablo smiled and relayed the order austin called zavala over and they talked briefly while zavala set off along the pier austin got the others together i want you to head for bens village on the far side of the lake wait for us there if things get too hot after the fireworks start lose yourselves in the woods are those my people out there on the barge ben said anxiously i think so joe and i will take a closer look i want to go i know you do but were going to need your knowledge of the forest to get us out of here seeing the stubborn set to bens jaw he added the danger to your people becomes greater with every sec ond we spend talking the rumble of a motor came from where zavala had been at work on one of the boats tied up at the dock barkers men had taken no chances after bens last visit and there were no keys left in the igni tion but zavala could take a marine engine apart in his sleep mo ments later the husky power plant of a jet ski could be heard purring zavala came back to where the others were standing i knew my swiss army knife would come in handy he said austin glanced anxiously out into the lake then climbed down from the pier onto the jet ski zavala got on behind to ride shotgun literally austin pushed off from the pier and twisted the throttle and seconds later the jet ski was scudding across the lake at fifty miles per hour in pursuit of the distant lights austin was ambivalent about personal watercraft they were noisy polluters with no purpose beyond disturbing beachgoers wildlife and sailboats at the same time he had to admit riding a jet ski was like tearing around on a waterborne motorcycle within minutes he could see the outlines of the catamaran without the use of the night goggles the barge seemed to have stopped those aboard the craft heard the sound of the fastapproaching watercraft and saw the foamy rooster tail it was creating in its wake a spotlight blinked on temporarily blinded by the bright light austin ducked low over the handlebars knowing that his reaction came too late he had hoped to get close to the barge before being discovered even the shortest glimpse of his caucasian features and pale hair would have identified him as a stranger and by definition as the enemy he put the jet ski into a sharp turn that kicked up a wall of foam the light found them within seconds austin swerved in the opposite direction not knowing how long he could keep up the water acrobatics or even if the slalom turns would do any good he yelled over his shoulder can you douse that light keep this thing steady and i will zavala shouted back austin obliged by slowing the jet ski and putting it broadside to the catamaran he knew he was giving those on board an easy shot but felt he had to risk it zavala raised his shotgun to his shoulder and squeezed the trigger the gun boomed the light stayed on and the beam found them again ears still ringing from the first blast austin felt rather than heard the second shot the light blinked out the men on the boat broke out their flashlights soon thin beams probed the darkness and austin could hear the rattle and snap of smallarms fire by then he was outside the range of the lights keep ing the jet ski at a low speed so its wake wouldnt be so obvious they could hear the bullets ripping up nearby sections of water the cata maran had pulled anchor and was moving again austin was certain that the encounter had not delayed the evil task of those on board but only hastened it he suspected that if he tried to pull the boat over like a traffic cop he and zavala would end up with more holes than a sieve precious seconds went by as he scoured his brains he recalled what ben had said about the cata maran and an idea came to him he outlined his plan to zavala im starting to worry zavala said i dont blame you i know its risky you dont understand i like the plan thats what worries me ill make an appointment with a numa shrink when we get back see if you can soften up the opposition in the meantime zavala nodded and leveled his shotgun at a figure of a man who had the bad judgment to stand where he was silhouetted by the run ning lights the shotgun thundered and the man threw his arms up and disappeared from view like a duck in a shooting gallery austin throttled up and seconds later when a fusillade from the boat lacerated the surface of the lake he was well away from the spot the shotgun thundered and another body toppled over the men aboard the barge finally figured out that they were easy targets and doused the running lights it was exactly the reaction austin had counted on the catamaran was starting to pick up speed austin ran the jet ski parallel to the barge for a moment then circled around until he was a couple of hundred yards astern eyes riveted on the twin wakes ahead he accelerated the jet ski he aimed directly off to one side of the stern and cut power at the last second the front of the jet ski hit the catamarans stern with a loud and hollow thump then the watercraft made a horrible scraping noise as it slid up and onto the sloping deck a crewman who had heard the approaching watercraft stood in the stern with his machine pistol at the ready the jet skis rounded bow slammed into his legs there was the audible snap of bone and he was catapulted halfway down the length of the deck zavala had rolled off before the jet ski had come to a stop austin dismounted and yanked the bowen from its holster the jet ski had skidded so that it was sideways on the deck of fering them some protection austin drew a quick bead on a figure moving in the darkness and fired off a shot he missed but the muz zle flash illuminated a horrifying sight bodieshe couldnt tell if they were alive or dead in the darkwere lined up crosswise on the conveyor belt and were slowly moving toward the stern where they would slide down a chute into the lake he yelled at zavala to cover him the shotgun fired off three shots in rapid succession from the screams at the other end of the boat one or more rounds found their deadly mark austin bolstered his revolver launched himself at the nearest struggling form and pulled it off the belt another smaller body took its place on the nightmar ish assembly line austin pulled it aside out of harms way and saw that it was a child more bodies were coming at him he wondered how long he could pull them to safety but he was determined to try he grabbed another by the legs from the weight he guessed that it was a man and he grunted with exertion as he pulled him to safety he had his hands around the ankles of another when the belt stopped he stood up sweat poured down his face and he was breathing hard he felt a twinge of pain from his old chest wound he looked up and saw a figure holding a flashlight coming his way the bowen filled austins hand dont shoot amigo came the familiar voice of his partner austin lowered the bowen i thought you were covering me i was then there was nothing left to cover you from after i nailed a couple of guys the rest of them jumped ship i found the off switch on the belt controls the first body austin had pulled from an almost certain death was making muffled sounds behind the duct tape austin borrowed the flashlight and found himself looking into the unmistakable gentian eyes of therri weld he carefully stripped the duct tape from her mouth then freed her hands and feet she gave him a quick thanks then freed the little girl who had almost been her companion in death austin handed over the doll and the girl hugged it in a crush ing embrace working together they quickly freed the others ryan beamed his smile at austin and started to shower him with praise austin had had enough of the egotistic activist he was angry at ryan for get ting in the way of the rescue and for risking thems life a wrong look from ryan and he would have thrown him overboard just shut up for now he said ryan saw that austin was in a nononsense mood and he clamped his lips together the last prisoners were being freed when austin heard a boat motor he grabbed for his bowen and he and zavala crouched be hind the rail they heard the boat shut its motor down and bump against the hull austin stood and flicked on the light the bullseye fell on the anxious face of ben nighthawk come ahead austin yelled out everyones okay here a look of relief crossed bens face he and the aguirrez brothers climbed onto the catamaran pablo was bent over and seemed to be having some problems moving and the other men had to help him the basques sleeve was stained with blood above the elbow what happened austin said diego smiled and said while you were out here some of the guards saw us taking their boat and wanted us to pay rent we gave them what we had pablo was wounded but we killed the pigs he looked around the boat and saw at least three bodies i see you have been busy too busier than i would have liked austin glanced toward the dock where lights were moving about looks like you stirred up a hor nets nest a very big hornets nest pablo replied he looked up at the thut thut sound of a helicopter but we have stingers as well austin saw a flitting shadow against the blueblackness of the night sky the seacobra had arrived in the nick of time it flew like an arrow toward land as it drew near barkers complex it slowed and instead of unleashing the expected destruction on the igloo went into a circle it was searching for its target and not finding it the igloos camouflage had been turned on and the huge building blended in with the dark forest it was a fatal moment of indecision searchlights illuminated the helicopter like a german bomber in the london blitzkrieg seeing that they had been discovered the helicopter crew launched a mis sile at the plaza too late the missile smashed into the plaza and killed a handful of barkers men but at the same time a streak of light shot upward the heatseeking groundtoair missile couldnt miss at such close range it zeroed in on the helicopters exhaust there was a brilliant flash of hot yellow and red light and the chop per fell in fiery sizzling pieces into the lake it happened so fast that the people watching from the catamaran could hardly believe what they saw it was as if the cavalry had come to the rescue only to be wiped out in an indian ambush even austin who knew the tide of battle could turn in an instant was in a state of shock but he quickly got over it there was no time to waste barkers murderous myrmidons could be on them within minutes he called ben over and told him to ferry those on board to land where they could hide in the woods ryan came over and said look im sorry about all this but i do owe you again this ones on the house but the next time you get into trouble youre on your own maybe i can repay you by lending a hand maybe you can repay me by getting your butt out of here make sure therri and the others make it safely to shore and what are you going to do therri said she had come up behind ryan i intend to have a few words with dr barker or toonook she stared at him in disbelief now whos being reckless youre the one who scolded me for putting myself in needless danger he and his men will kill you youre not getting out of our dinner date that easily dinner how can you think about such a thing with all this in sanity going on youre crazy im quite sane but im determined to get through a romantic meal for two without interruption her face softened and a faint smile came to her lips id like that too so be careful he kissed her lightly on the mouth then he and zavala pushed the jet ski back into the water it had suffered a few dents and bul let holes during the rescue assault on the catamaran but the motor was in fine shape and zavala had no trouble getting it running again as austin pointed the watercraft back toward the vortex of violence he realized that he didnt know what he was going to do when he fi nally met up with dr barker but he was certain hed come up with something austin and zavala landed on the beach a few hundred yards from the dock and made their way back toward the plaza where barker had ad dressed his gang of thugs the plaza was empty many of the defend ers had scattered into the forest when the helicopter attacked austin and zavala made their way around a crater and several bodies with its electronic camouflage in use the dome itself was invisi ble but light streamed from a slim rectangular opening in the forest where the portal had been left open no one barred the way as austin and zavala stepped inside and got their first breathtaking glance of the huge silver torpedo that filled most of the hangar powerful flood lights reflected off the zeppelins shiny aluminum skin leaving the perimeter of the dome in darkness they slipped into the shadows and hid behind a scaffold on wheels where they had a good view of the scene the men scurrying around the zeppelin apparently making last minute preparations for takeoff lent scale to the gigantic aircraft launch crews strained at the anchor lines like contestants engaged in a tugofwar game high above the domes roof was slowly open ing and stars were visible through the gap austin ran his eyes along the zeppelins length coolly taking in every detail from the blunt nose to the tapering tail his gaze lingering for a second on the tri angular top fin and the word nietzsche the airship was a beautiful example of form following function but aesthetics were secondary in his mind the control cabin was only a few feet above the floor but it was surrounded by guards he surveyed the airship again and saw what he was looking for he pointed to the nearest engine nacelle and quickly outlined his idea to zavala who nodded and gave him the okay sign signifying he understood zavala radioed diego that they were boarding the airship the roof opening was almost big enough to let the airship through in another few seconds the launch crews would begin to let up the slack on the anchor lines the zeppelin rested on tapering supports that resembled old fashioned oil derricks other towers were arranged closer to the air craft with zavala close on his heels austin made his way from tower to tower finally reaching two scaffolds that supported the star board rear nacelle he glanced around the crews were still intent on keeping the zeppelin down as it strained against the anchor lines satisfied that they had not been seen he climbed to the top of the tower the eggshaped engine housing was about the size of an suv and attached to the fuselage by metal struts the spinning propeller was the height of two men austin grabbed onto a strut and pulled him self onto the top of the nacelle he could feel the vibration from the powerful engine through the soles of his boots as the propeller picked up speed it created a backwash and he had to hold on tightly to prevent being blown off he reached down to lend a hand to zavala who was still scrambling onto the engine housing when the launch crew slacked the lines and the zeppelin began to rise zavalas legs dangled as he tried to get a foot up on the rounded side of the nacelle holding on with one hand austin used the considerable strength in his shoulders to give zavala the lift he needed by then the zeppelin was halfway to the roof from their position atop the nacelle they were shielded from eyes below but the prop wash was picking up and it was becoming harder to hold on to the slick rounded surface austin looked up and saw a rectangular open ing where the struts disappeared into the fuselage he yelled at zavala but his words were blown away by the wind so he simply pointed zavala answered and although austin couldnt hear his partners reply he was sure joe was saying after you austin began to climb the strut had been made with ladder rungs to allow an engineer access to the engine pod for midair repairs with the prop turning and the zeppelin rising the journey of several feet was the ultimate challenge austins progress wasnt pretty but he made it through the rectangular opening in the zeppelins belly once out of the main force of the prop wash he hung on the lad der and looked back zavala was right behind him the zeppelin had risen through the top of the dome and the doors in the roof were closing the people in the dome looked to be the size of ants by the time zavala made it into the fuselage the dome was closed completely having made their decision to stow away he and zavala had no other choice they began to climb into the darkness the nietzsche was a miracle of aeronautical design twice as long as a booing jumbo jet it had been built in an age before computers and spaceage materials the nietzsche had been modeled after the graf zeppelin the footlong silver cigar built in by airship pioneer hugo eckener but innovations that would later be part of the hindenburg had also been incorporated into the design in the graf passenger quarters were behind the control room but the nietzsche had been designed with living space within the fuselage itself once inside the fuselage austin and zavala found themselves in a small room after their perilous climb from the nacelle hanging on the wall were machinists tools and spare parts and long black leather coats like those favored by aviators of a bygone era the room was unheated and the coats would come in handy for those who worked there austin tried a coat on and found that it fit you look like the red baron zavala said austin slipped a leather cap down on his head i prefer to think of myself as a master of disguise seeing the skepticism in his part ners face austin said maybe youve noticed that were somewhat different in appearance from the eskimo gentlemen weve seen on this little adventure if these ridiculous outfits give us a seconds edge they might be worth it the sacrifices i make for numa zavala said searching for a coat that fit him the rooms single door opened onto a long corridor the walls of the plushly carpeted passageway were decorated with fanciful scenes of men in top hats flying a variety of oddshaped hotair balloons and flying machines antique crystal lamps hung from the ceiling at the end of the corridor was a passenger area of comfortably appointed staterooms each with two berths and its own unique pattern of flow ery wallpaper a short walk led to an elegant dining salon there were about a dozen small rectangular tables each covered with a white tablecloth neatly creased napkins set in place two upholstered chairs with ma hogany arms and legs were pulled slightly back from each table as if guests were to arrive momentarily tall curtained windows would have given the diners a godseye view of the world below next to the dining room was a lounge complete with bar and bandstand and a dance floor of highly pol ished wood like the dining salon the lounge was decorated in art deco motif geometric patterns prevailed the wall behind the bar was an art gallery ofzeppelin photos the lounge was hushed except for the muted rumble of engines zavala looked around in wonder this is like being on an old ocean liner just pray that it isnt the titanic austin said austin led the way toward a room furnished with leather sofas and chairs his knowledge of german was limited but he guessed that the sign on the wall designated the area as the smoking room they left the room and followed another corridor that led to an expansive space that seemed to be a work area they could see a large functional table illuminated by halogen lamps computers and several chairs that were designed more for function than comfort part of the room was in shadow austin found a wall light switch and flicked it on the entire room was flooded with light and both men tensed when they discovered that they were not alone two figures stood against the far wall and zavala swore in spanish out of the corner of his eye austin saw the shotgun coming to bear wait he said zavala lowered the gun and smiled as he studied the figures he was looking at the mummified bodies of two men propped up on metal stands they stood in a natural position arms hanging down by their sides their skin was as dark as leather and stretched tightly against their skulls the eye sockets were empty but the faces were remarkably well preserved austin and zavala moved in for a closer look zavala said i dont think these guys are the blues brothers i dont think theyre brothers at all judging from their clothing id say they come from different eras one man was dressed in a heavy shirt and leggings of coarse ma terial his dark hair hung down to his shoulders the taller man had short blond hair and wore a proworld war ii leather coat not unlike the ones austin and zavala were wearing hanging above the mummies was a large raggededged piece of aluminum the word nietzsche was printed on it next to the mummies was a glass display case like those found in museums inside the case were a leica mm still camera and sev eral lenses a zeiss movie camera charts of the northern hemisphere and a leatherbound book austin opened the case and leafed through the pages of the book it was filled with entries in german stopping in he stuffed the book into his pocket he was examining a dis play of eskimo harpoons and knives when zavala called him over kurt youve got to see this zavala had wandered over to the long ebony chest that rested on a waisthigh platform on top of the chest was a horn that looked as if it had been made from an elephants tusk the instrument was studded with gems and banded in gold austin carefully removed the horn and handed it to zavala who marveled at the detail of the bat tle scenes carved into the ivory austin opened the chest and pushed back the lid lying on pur ple velvet inside the chest was a sword in its scabbard he lifted the leather scabbard from the chest and inspected the goldclad hilt and hand guard set into the heavy triangular pommel was a huge ruby the elaborate hand guard was etched with flowers he mused at the incongruity of the beautiful decoration on a weapon with such deadly potential he hefted the twoedged sword feeling the perfect balance then gingerly drew the weapon from the scabbard an electric thrill seemed to run through his arm could this be durendal the fabled weapon that roland swung against the saracens the blade was chipped here and there a picture flitted through his mind of roland banging the sword against a stone so that it wouldnt fall into the hands of the enemy zavala whistled that thing must be worth a fortune austin thought about all the time and money balthazar aguirrez had expended in his search for the object in his hand its worth a lot more than that he said he removed his coat and buckled the scabbard around his waist he took a few steps as an experiment and found that the scabbard slapped against his leg the thick leather belt hindered access to his revolver holster as well he tried another position slipping the scab bard belt over his shoulder so that the sword hung down by his left side then he got back into his coat planning to do some fencing zavala said maybe you must admit it beats your army knife my knife has a corkscrew zavala reminded him what about the overgrown bugle wed better put it back i dont want to advertise the fact that ive absconded with the toothpick under my coat they carefully replaced the horn the way it was found and moved to the other side of the room where a map of the world was spread out on the worktable austin bent over the map and saw that coastal areas on all the continents were blocked out in red pen noted next to each red section was a date and a listing of various species offish a large star marked the lake site where they had boarded the airship he drew his finger from the star along a pencil line due east into the north atlantic the notation above the line was that days date he straightened and said weve got to stop this ship before it gets to the atlantic this isnt a test run fine with me i might point out that this thing is almost a thou sand feet long and full of heavily armed thugs who might have other ideas we dont have to take over the whole ship just the control cabin why didnt you say so its as good as done think you can fly this old gasbag cant be that hard zavala said you hit the throttle and point the nose where you want to go despite the casual reply austin never doubted zavalas words his partner had hundreds of hours under his belt flying practically every aircraft built austin tried to picture where they were in the zeppelin he guessed that they were about midway along the length of the great airship if they kept moving forward and down they would come to the control cabin they left the room and its strange museum display and followed a maze of passageways totally unlike those they had encountered when they first came aboard their surroundings were newer and more functional they came to a set of stairs leading down austin thought they had come to the control cabin but he changed his mind when his nose picked up a whiff of brine and fish he was reminded uncomfortably of his first breath inside the oceanus fish nursery in the faroe islands he hesitated at the top of the stairs drew his bowen and slowly descended into the blackness below his ears picked up the sound of motors and bubbling aerators further convincing him that his fish nursery theory was correct he was about halfway down the stairs when the lights went on and he saw that he had more than biofish to contend with dr barker stood at the bottom of the stairs looking up at him a cheerful smile on his thin face his eyes were hidden behind dark sunglasses hello mr austin barker said weve been expecting you wont you join us any inclination to refuse barkers offer was tempered by the sight of the stonefaced guards who surrounded the man and the assault rifle muzzles pointed up the stairwell the touch of a finger on even a single trigger would be enough to reduce austin and zavala to their basic molecules even more persuasive was the expression on the face of barkers scarfaced henchman who had tried on several occa sions to kill austin his livercolored lips were stretched in a wide grin that told austin he was still the top target in the mans sights i would be a fool to refuse such a warm invitation austin said as he descended the rest of the way now drop your guns and kick them over barker said austin and zavala did as they were told the guards picked the weapons up one man came over and frisked zavala scarface stepped up to austin and ran his hands roughly down the front of the leather coat im going to enjoy watching you die he growled durendal seemed to glow red hot against austins ribs i know a dentist who could do wonders for your teeth he said scarface stopped his search and grabbed austins lapel in a chok ing hold only to back off at an order from barker thats no way to treat our guests barker said turning to joe he said youre mr zavala i presume zavalas mouth turned up slightly at the ends and the softness of his dark brown eyes couldnt disguise the contempt in his voice and youre dr barker the mad scientist i presume kurt has told me a lot about you all good im sure barker said he seemed amused as he glanced back to austin are you gentlemen on your way to a cos tume ball yes as a matter of fact if you dont mind well be on our way austin said dont run off so soon you just got here if you insist wed like to lower our hands if you dont mind go right ahead but dont give my men an excuse to kill you on the spot thanks for the warning austin glanced around how did you know we were aboard hidden surveillance cameras nothing so sophisticated in this old relic purely as a safety meas ure we installed sensors around the ship a light in the control cabin indicated a change in air temperature in the starboard engine maintenance room when we went to investigate we found the hatch open we thought it was an accident until we noticed that the coats were missing how careless of us its the kind of carelessness that can get you killed that was a dangerous way to come aboard if you wanted a tour we would have been glad to accommodate you maybe next time there wont be a next time barker stepped forward and re moved his sunglasses revealing the pale eyes austin had first seen at the smithsonian reception the irises were almost as white as the rest of his eyes and reminded austin of a venomous snake he had once seen you and numa have caused me a great deal of trouble barker said your troubles are just beginning austin said brave words for someone in your position but not unexpected umealiq was disappointed when you foiled his plans for you in washington umealiq said zavala who was hearing the name for the first time thats scarfaces real name austin said it supposedly means stone lance zavalas lips curled in a slight smile you find something humorous in the situation barker said thats funny zavala said i thought it was kiolyan for seal ma nure scarfaces hand went to the ivory knife at his belt and he took a step forward barker stopped him with an outstretched arm he gazed thoughtfully at the numa men what do you know about the kiolya i know that the inuit consider you to be the scum of the arctic austin said barkers bloodless face flushed scarlet the inuit are in no posi tion to judge they have let the world think that the people of the north are nothing but a bunch of blubberchewing caricatures who run around in furs and live in ice houses austin was pleased to see that he could get under barkers cold skin ive heard the kiolyan women smell like rancid whale blub ber he said zavala sensed the opening and joined in actually they smell worse he said thats why these goons prefer their own male com pany insult us all you want barker said your feeble repartee is the ranting of the doomed my men are a brotherhood like the warrior monks of the past austins mind was racing madly barker was right he and joe could summon up every insult possible but they were still two un armed men against several wellarmed guards he would have to try to change the equation it took some willpower to do so but he yawned and said what about that tour you promised how rude of me to forget barker led the way onto a raised catwalk running down the mid dle of the chamber the sound of bubbling water came from both sides but the source of the noise was hidden by darkness barker re placed the sunglasses on his head and gave an order to one of his men a second later the chamber was flooded in a blue light that came from fish tanks on both sides and a couple of feet below the catwalk the tanks were flush to the floor and were covered with sliding transparent plastic lids that allowed a view of the huge fish swim ming inside you look puzzled mr austin another miscalculation on my part i thought your fish were being held at your coastal operation where they would have access to salt water these are no ordinary fish barker said with pride in his voice they are designed to survive in salt or fresh water the seed fish are improvements on the models i developed with dr throckmorton they are slightly larger and more aggressive than ordinary fish per fect breeding machines the airship will fly within feet of the oceans surface and they will slide down special chutes built into the belly of the zeppelin he spread his arms the way he had done at his pep rally behold my creations soon these beautiful creatures will be swimming in the sea where your monsters will create incredible havoc austin said monsters i think not ive simply used my geneticengineering skills to produce a better commercial product theres nothing ille gal about it murder is illegal spare us your pitiful indignation there were many casualties before you came onto the scene there will be many more obstacles to be removed he crossed to the tanks on the other side of the fish hold these are my special pets i wanted to see how large and hun gry i could make an ordinary fish they are too aggressive for breed ing purposes they are separated by sluice gates now so they dont at tack each other at a word from barker a guard went over to a cooler and ex tracted a frozen cod around two feet long he slid back the plastic lid covering one of the tanks and tossed the carcass into the water within seconds the cod disappeared in a bloody froth ive made dinner reservations for you barker said no thanks weve already eaten austin said barker studied the faces of the two men but saw no sign of fear only defiance he frowned and said ill give you and your partner time to think about your fate to imagine what it feels like to be torn apart by razorsharp teeth and scattered over the ocean our men will come for you shortly after we stop at our facility on the coast to re fuel adieu gentlemen barkers men grabbed austin and zavala and hustled them down a corridor leading to a storage room they were shoved inside and the door was locked behind them austin tried the lock then found a seat on a pile of cardboard boxes you dont seem very worried about being fed to the fishes zavala said i have no intention of providing entertainment for that white eyed freak and his cretinous henchmen by the way i liked your comment about kiolyan women it went against my grain as you know i love women of any kind they have a lot to put up with with their menfolk running around killing and sacrificing people so mr houdini how do we escape this little mess i guess we bust our way out of here uhhuh and assuming we can get beyond that door what chance do the two of us have against a battalion of armed men there are three of us actually zavala looked around an invisible friend no doubt austin peeled out of his coat and drew the sword from its scab bard even in the faint light inside the storage room the blade seemed to glow this is my frienddurendal the catamaran came in like a marine landing craft and the twin hulls slid partway onto the shore with a shriek of fiber glass against gravel the boat had no sooner come to a grinding halt than the people on board started to pile off ben nighthawk was the first to hit the ground followed by the basques and the sos crew they helped the villagers climb down and the group headed inland only ben and diego stayed behind jesse nighthawk turned and saw his son lingering on the beach he shooed the other villagers into the woods and walked back to where ben was standing why arent you coming the old man said go on without me ben replied ive been talking to diego we have work to do what do you mean what sort of work ben looked across the lake revenge you cant go back jesse said its too dangerous diego who had been listening to the exchange said the heli copter pilots who were shot down were our friends their death can not go unanswered those people killed my cousin ben said they beat and tor tured my friends and family theyve raped our beautiful forest jesse couldnt see his sons face in the shadows but there was no mistaking the determination in bens voice very well he said sadly i will see the others to safety marcus ryan emerged from the woods trailed by chuck mercer and therri weld whats going on he said sensing the somber at mosphere ben and this man are going back jesse said i tried to stop them they want to get themselves killed ben put his hand on his fathers shoulder thats the last thing i want to do pop i cant speak for diego but at the very least i want to wipe that big fake igloo off the face of the earth thats a tall order for two men ryan said youll need help thanks mark i know you mean well but the others need you more than we do youre not the only one who has a score to settle ryan said his voice gained a steely edge barker killed joshua and he sank my ship now hes trying to kill the oceans i owe him bigtime that thing on the other side of the lake is no grass hut youre not going to blow it down with a huff and a puff we know that well figure it out you dont have time for trial and error i know how we can send that dome into the stratosphere ryan turned to mercer you re member what we talked about yeah i remember we said we could give barker a big hotfoot if we got the chance well ben how about it ryan said are we in its not my decision alone he turned to diego the basque said there are many of them and only a few of us pablo is out of action we would have to be very lucky merely to stay alive ben hesitated okay mark youre in ryans mouth widened in a triumphant grin well need some ex plosives our c was taken away when we were captured my brother and i have some hand grenades diego said reach ing over to tap his backpack three apiece enough in answer ryan glanced at mercer who said it could work if theyre positioned in the right place what can i do said therri who had been listening to the dis cussion bens people are in pretty tough shape ryan said theyll need your help especially the kids ill do my best therri said she kissed him and gave mercer and ben a peck on the cheek as well take care of yourselves as therri made her way back into the forest ben and the other men pushed the catamaran off the beach and climbed aboard the boats twin hulls and powerful motors gave it a respectable speed they scudded over the surface of the lake and soon reached the op posite shore pablo and diego rode shotgun in the bow as the boat coasted up to the pier they quickly tied up and headed inland mercer made a stop at the boat shed and emerged with two reels of threeeighths docking line some cord and a roll of duct tape walking single file they detoured around the plaza with ryan in the lead the group made its way undetected to the side of the dome ryan found what he was looking for a tall cylindrical fuel tank lo cated in a clearing surrounded by dense woods painted on the side was a warning that the tank contained highly flammable contents a steel pipe about six inches in diameter ran from the tank to the side of the building next to where the pipe entered the airship hangar was a locked door like the dome itself the door was made of a plas tic material and easily gave way to the strength and determination be hind diegos shoulders then he and the others stepped into a short passageway that ran parallel to the pipe for several yards the conduit disappeared through a wall next to another door this one unlocked ryan took the lead and opened the door a crack giving him a view of the inte rior of the airship hangar men milled around in the middle of the building where the airship had been tied down others were coiling lines or moving gantries and scaffolding a few guards were drift ing out the hangars main door ryan motioned for the others to stay put while he and mercer stepped into the hangar they crawled along the wall behind tall stacks of coiled hose until they came to where the pipe entered the building barker had gestured toward the hose when he had ex plained why he used hydrogen rather than helium to fill the airships gasbags a valve controlled by a large handturned wheel allowed the flow of gas into the hose ryan turned the wheel on the pipe until they could hear the hiss of gas escaping through the nozzle the escaping gas rose to the roof where it wouldnt be detected they hoped until it was too late with their work done they slipped out the door and followed the passageway into the open ben and diego had been equally busy following mercers instructions they had taped the hand grenades onto the tank short lengths of cord had been attached to the safetypin rings and ganged to the line from one of the spools ryan and mercer inspected the work found it satis factory then walked back to the lake uncoiling the line behind them they tried to run the line straight back to the lake keeping it clear of bushes and trees where it could snag when theyd emptied one twohundredfootlong spool they spliced the free end onto another spool they were still a dozen yards short of the lake when that spool gave out too mercer ducked into the boat shed and came out with several lengths and sizes of rope that they spliced together until the rope reached to the waters edge when all was ready diego headed back to the plaza and took a position be hind a thick tree with their work inside the hangar done kiolyan men were streaming out into the plaza some of them heading in the direction of their barracks the basque coldly took a bead on a guard and let off a short burst the man fell to the ground more guards came running from the direction of the barracks and began to fire indis criminately into the woods where they saw muzzle flashes but diego moved after each kill and the bullets went far wide of their targets when two more of their number were killed the men in the plaza ran for the door of the giant igloo diego had counted on exactly this reaction he had tried to pick off the men who were making a break for the woods the effect was to herd the guards into the protection of the structure he knew that given time they would emerge from other exits in the dome and fan out into the woods and try a flanking maneuver but as the last man disappeared into the airship hangar leaving the plaza deserted diego was already sprinting back to the beach waiting on shore where he and the others had been alerted by the sound of gunfire ryan saw diego running toward him and handed the end of the line to ben would you like to do the honors thanks ben said taking the line nothing would give me more pleasure ryan turned to the other men when ben yanks on that line dive into the water and keep your head under for as long as you can okay ben leter rip ben jerked hard on the line then dropped it and dove with the others into the lake they filled their lungs with air then ducked below the surface nothing happened ryan poked his head out and swore he sloshed out of the lake onto the beach picked up the loose end of the line and gave it a tug it tugged back as if caught on a branch ill check must be hung up on something he called out to the others and followed the line inland ryan was only partly right the line was snagged on someone not something a stray guard had seen diego bolt for the lake and had gone over to investigate he was holding the line in his hand when he saw ryan approach from the beach ryan was bent low his eyes following the line and he never saw the man level his gun the first sign that he was not alone was the impact of the bullet hitting him in the shoulder like a fiery hammer blow he dropped to his knees the guard never got off another shot diego who had been fol lowing ryans trail let off a burst that stitched its way across the guards chest the guard was thrown back by the impact but his fingers clutched the line in a death grip ryan watched through filmy eyes as the guard fell his weight pulling on the line an alarm sounded in his brain cutting through the pain and confusion and he tried to rise but his legs were made of rubber then he felt strong hands lifting him to his feet and guiding him back toward the lake they were almost at the waters edge when the lake lit up as if it had been sprayed with phosphorescent paint when the guard had toppled over the tug had been transmitted along the line to the grenade rings theyd popped out and the levers had gone flying igniting the fuse train six seconds later the grenades went off simultaneously a millisecond after that the hydrogen in the tank ignited the fiery gas rushed along the short length of the pipe and exited through the nozzle as if it were expelled from the busi ness end of a flamethrower the spurting flames touched off the in visible cloud of hydrogen hanging under the dome the airship hangar became a hell for the kiolyan guards satu rated with hydrogen the superheated air exploded inside the dome instantly incinerating flesh and bone the dome contained the heat for only a few seconds glowing white hot before the thick plastic cells that formed the walls evaporated but the delay before the final explosion of flames gave ryan and diego the time they needed they gained the waters edge and dove into the lake as the dome exploded and sent out sheets of flame that vaporized the surrounding forest and outbuildings blistering waves of heat rippled out in every di rection hampered by his wound ryan had only taken a quick gulp of air before plunging into the lake and his lungs were only partially filled he saw the water light up and heard a muffled roar and he stayed under for as long as he could before popping his head up when he surfaced thick smoke from the burning forest stung his eyes but he paid no attention to the pain he stared in awe at the mushroom cloud rising high in the sky from the field of orangeglowing embers that marked the place where he had last seen the dome it made the hindenburg explosion look like a candle flame like otters coming up for air ben mercer and diego stuck their heads out of the water and shared his wonder each of them had lost a friend or a relative to the schemes of barker and his kiolyan henchmen but there was no smugness or satisfaction at the de struction they had caused they knew that justice had been only partially served the mad geneticist had been hurt but not stopped by the flickering light of the burning trees they swam to the cata maran the three of them helping ryan through the water minutes later the boat was moving across the water leaving the smoldering funeral pyre in its wake austin sat on the box offish antibiotics holding the sword blade between his knees his head bent against the hilt a stranger would have seen this pose as one of dejection but zavala knew better austin would act when he was ready zavala was keeping himself occupied with a set of exercises that were part yoga part zen and part oldfashioned shadowboxing to loosen him up and focus his mind he finished demolishing an imag inary opponent with a left uppercut and a quick right cross brushed his palms together and said ive just knocked out rocky marciano sugar ray robinson and muhammad ali in quick succession austin looked up and said save some punches for barker and his pals were starting to descend austin had been gambling that barker was telling the truth when he said that he intended to feed them to his socalled pets and dump what was left into the atlantic ocean a murderer like barker would resort to any form of violence and duplicity to achieve his goals but his inflated vision of himself extended to his godlike pronounce ments of life and death if barker said he would kill them over the atlantic he meant it austin had been waiting for the refueling stop hoping the zep pelins crew would be distracted as the great airship came in for a landing the guards had taken the mens wristwatches and it was impossible to keep accurate track of the passage of time after see ing that they were cut off from sight and sound austin had stuck the sword point into the floor and put his ear against the hilt the sword picked up the engine vibrations like a stylus on a record player in the last few minutes the pitch had changed the engines had slowed he stood and walked over to the sturdy woodpaneled door they had put their shoulders against it earlier but all they had gotten for their trouble were bruises austin knocked softly on the door he wanted to be sure no guard was standing on the other side when there was no reply he gripped the sword hilt in two hands lifted the blade over his head and brought it down putting all the considerable strength in his thick arms behind the thrust the wood splintered but the blade didnt go through the door using the point he pried off a section as big as his hand then enlarged it working furiously he opened a hole big enough to slip his arm through the latch had been padlocked after several more minutes taking turns hacking at the wood with zavala they cut the latch off and pushed the door open seeing no guards they cautiously made their way back to the fish hold austin leaned over the gangway sorry to disappoint you boys he said to the milky shapes swim ming around in the tanks but we have other dinner plans they probably dont like mexican food anyhow zavala said check out the water level the surface of the water was at a slant indicating that the zeppe lin was inclined at a forward angle they were on their way down austin wanted to get into the control car but suspected it would be heavily defended they would have to be more creative again he looked for an answer in barkers psychotic personality in his ram bling discourse barker had revealed more than he should have hey joe austin said thoughtfully do you remember what our host said about the sluice gates they keep the more aggressive fish separated otherwise his lit tle pets would chew themselves to pieces he also said that the systems on this gasbag are hotwired ill bet that when the sluice gates are removed an alarm goes off how would you like to create a little chaos austin pulled up one of the gates the fish on either side of the gate had come to the top of the tank thinking that the presence of a human meant they were about to be fed when the gate was re moved they all froze for an instant then their fins became a blur there was a flash of silvery white and snapping jaws recalling the fate barker had planned for them austin and zavala watched the silent battle with a cold feeling in the pits of their stomachs within seconds the tanks were filled with blood and fish parts the creatures had ripped each other to shreds a red light on the wall had started to flash when the gate was re moved austin waited by the door while zavala lounged on the cat walk he almost shouted for joy when only one guard showed up the guard stopped short when he saw zavala and raised his rifle austin stepped up from behind and said hello when the guard turned austin jammed his elbow into the mans jaw the guard crumpled to the floor like a sack of blubber austin scooped up the rifle and tossed it to zavala then he found a switch that turned the alarm off with zavala rearmed and austin clenching his sword as if he were about to lay siege to a castle they left the fish hold and followed a short corridor that led to a set of stairs going down to the control cabin from their elevated vantage point they could see through the open door men were moving about the cabin or were at the controls but barker wasnt among them austin signaled for zavala to back away the control cabin could wait it made no sense to tangle with the claws and teeth of the monster called oceanus when it might be easier to cut off its head austin had a pretty good idea where he might find barker they hurried back through the fish hold and along a passageway until they came to the combination work area and museum where austin had found durendal austins guess as to barkers whereabouts was correct the scientist and his scarfaced henchman were bent over the chart table with his animal instincts scarface sensed their intrusion and raised his head he saw the two numa men and his face contorted in an expression of savage fury barker heard his henchman snarl and looked up after his initial surprise he broke out in a smile austin couldnt see the eyes behind the sunglasses but he could tell that they were fixed on the sword without a word barker went over and picked up the horn then looked inside the chest well well mr austin it seems that youre a thief as well as a stowaway he closed the lid and went to replace the horn on top but first he glanced over at scarface who replied with an almost imperceptible nod before austin could move barker threw the horn at zavalas head zavala ducked and the horn missed him by a few inches tak ing advantage of the distraction umealiq dropped down behind the desk with the agility of a cat he gained the protection of the heavy sofa he popped up like an ugly jackinthebox let off a wild shot from a handgun then disappeared through a doorway get him before he alerts the others austin shouted but zavala was already on his way austin and barker were left alone with the smile still pasted on his ghostly face barker said seems as if this is between you and me mr austin austin returned the smile if thats the case youre through brave words but consider your position umealiq will kill your partner and within moments armed men will come pouring through that door consider your position barker he raised the sword and ad vanced im about to cut your cold heart out and toss it to your mu tant monsters barker spun around like a ballet dancer snatched a harpoon off the wall of the eskimo display and with a flick of his wrist hurled it at austin with amazing accuracy austin stooped to avoid the mis sile the harpoon buried itself in the chest of one of the mummies the stand holding the mummified body in leather crashed over pulling down the section of airship skin with the word nietzsche on it barker snatched another harpoon off the wall and charged at austin with an ivory knife from the display in his other hand austin lopped off the harpoon point with a quick swing of the sword but the movement left him open he stepped backward to avoid the knife and stepped on the horn which was lying on the floor his ankle buckled and he fell barker yelled in triumph and lunged austin had landed with the sword under him and couldnt bring it to a defensive position the knife slashed down austin blocked barkers wrist with the edge of his hand he tried to grip it but his palm was sweaty he let go of the sword and brought his other hand around and used it to push the knife point away from his throat frustrated by austins superior strength barker jerked his hand back and brought it up to strike again austin rolled out of the way leaving the sword behind him they both scrambled to their feet at the same time when austin went to retrieve the sword the knife slashed the air a few inches from his chest barker kicked the sword out of reach then advanced on austin he stepped back and felt the edge of the desk behind him he could go no farther barker was so close austin could see his face reflected in the sunglasses barker smiled and raised his knife to strike zavala had bounded through the doorway and stopped short he expected to find himself in another corridor instead he was in a small chamber not much bigger than a telephone booth with ladder rungs running up one wall a single wall lamp lit the cramped space under the lamp was a flashlight rack one of the lights was missing he grabbed one of the remaining flashlights and pointed it up he thought he saw a flicker of movement in its beam then nothing but darkness he slung the rifle over his shoulder tucked the light in his belt and began to climb the shaft opened onto a passageway con structed in a triangle of interlocking girders probably part of a keel that kept the airship rigid and allowed access to its innards the keel intersected another passageway zavala held his breath and heard a slight ting that could have been made by a boot or shoe slapping against metal he stepped into the new passageway and found that it curved up against the inside of the zeppelins skin the white fabric of the inflated gas bags was pressed tightly against the framework on the other side he guessed that he was inside a ring that worked with the keels to give the airship further support his theory proved out as the passageway began to curve back on itself so that he was climbing directly over the huge bags zavala was in good shape but he was panting heavily when at the top of the zep pelin he came to another triangular passageway running lengthwise from the front to the back of the airship the choice was easier this time he pointed his light along the transverse support he could see movement and hear heavy footsteps echoing in the distance zavala dashed along the keel knowing he had to stop scarface be fore he made it to the control car and raised the alarm he came to another juncture where the transverse corridor intersected a sup porting ring there was no sign or sound of scarface to reveal where he had gone zavalas mind assembled a picture of the inside of the great airship if he were looking at a clock the corridor he was in would be in the noon position the transverse passageway he had seen earlier was at eight oclock to keep the rings rigid there must be a third horizontal passageway at four oclock maybe he could cut scarface off at the pass he descended the ring half climbing half falling he almost shouted in exultation when he came upon the third transverse pas sageway he ran down the corridor pausing at each ring to listen he was guessing that scarface would make his way as far forward as he could before descending to the control car using another ring at the third juncture of a keel and a ring zavala heard a tingting as someone climbed down the metal ladder he waited patiently until he could hear heavy breathing he flicked on the light the beam caught scarface clinging to the ladder like a large ugly spider scarface saw that hed been intercepted and began to climb up the ladder hold it right there zavala ordered he brought the shotgun to his shoulder umealiq halted and looked down at zavala with an ugly leer on his face fool he shouted go ahead and fire youll be signing your death warrant if you miss me and hit a hydrogen bag the air ship will go up in flames and you and your partner will die zavalas lips twitched at the ends as an engineer he was well acquainted with the properties of various elements he knew that hy drogen was volatile but unless he was using a tracer bullet combustion was unlikely thats where youre wrong he said id just end up punching a hole in the gas bag the evil smile vanished umealiq bent off the ladder and pointed his gun at zavala the shotgun boomed once the heavy shell hit umealiq squarely in his broad chest and knocked him off the ladder zavala stepped back to avoid the body that crashed to his feet as his life ebbed umealiqs face was twisted in disbelief thats something else you were wrong about zavala said i dont miss while zavala was chasing scarface austin had been fighting for his life again he had thrown his left hand up so that the edge of it caught barkers wrist and stopped the descending knife inches from his neck with his right hand he reached up to grab barker by the throat but the other man jerked back austins groping fingers yanked off the sunglasses he found himself staring into barkers palegray snakeeyes austin froze for a second and lost his grip on the wrist barker jerked his arm back prepared to make another thrust austin reached back onto the desk his fingers in a desperate search for a paperweight or something else he could use to brain barker with he felt a searing sensation his hand had touched one of the halogen lamps that illuminated the map he grabbed the lamp brought it around and shoved it in barkers face hoping to burn him barker blocked the lamp but he couldnt stop the light it was as if austin had thrown acid into barkers lightsensitive eyes he screamed and threw his hand in front of his eyes to shield them he stumbled back scream ing in the kiolyan language austin watched dumbfounded at the damage he had wrought with a single lightbulb barker groped his way out of the room austin picked up the sword and went after him in his haste to catch barker before he could get back to the control car austin was less careful than he should have been and barker was waiting for him in the fish hold he ambushed austin from just inside the door and his slashing knife caught the rib cage on the side opposite from his existing wound austin dropped the sword and tumbled off the gangway onto the plastic lids that covered the fish tanks he felt a warm dampness soaking his shirt he heard a nasty laugh from barker who stood on the gangway visible in the blue glow from the tanks he was looking up and down and austin realized with relief that he was still blind austin tried to pull himself along the top of the tanks the creatures under the plastic stirred in the water as they saw him moving and smelled the blood barker jerked his head in austins direction thats right mr austin i still cant see but my acute sense of hearing gives me a different kind of sight in the land of the blind the man with the best hearing is king barker was trying to goad austin into a fatal response austin was losing blood and didnt know how long he could stay conscious zavala could be dead he was on his own there was only one chance he slid back the lid of the tank next to him groaning to cover the noise barkers head stopped like a radar antenna with a fix on its target he smiled his pale eyes staring directly at austin barker smiled are you hurt mr austin he took a few steps toward austin on the catwalk austin groaned again and slid back the top of the tank another few inches barker stepped off the catwalk and walked slowly along the tops of the fish tanks austin glanced at the opening the gap was still less than a foot he groaned again and brought it back another few inches barker stopped and listened as if he suspected something screw you barker austin said im opening the sluice gates barkers face fell and he let out a feral snarl and charged forward he never heard austin pull the lid back another footand then he had stepped into the tank he sank out of sight then his head bobbed back up to the surface his face turned into a mask of fear as he re alized where he was and he clung to the edge of the tank and tried to pull himself out the mutant fish in the tank had been startled by the intrusion but now it was nosing around barkers legs it was being excited as well by blood from austins wound that had seeped down into the water austin rose to his feet and coolly pulled up the adjoining sluice gates barker was halfway out of the tank when the fish from the other tanks found him his face turned even whiter and then he slipped back into the tank there was a flurry and commotion and his body disappeared in bloody foam austin turned off the alarm switch and staggered back to barkers quarters where he had found a medicine cabinet with a firstaid kit using tape and bandages he stanched the bleeding then he re trieved the sword and was about to follow zavala to see if he could help him when his partner stepped through the door wheres barker zavala said we had a disagreement and he went to pieces austin s lips tight ened in a mirthless smile ill tell you later what about scarface fatal gas attack he glanced around we might want to get off this thing i was just starting to enjoy the ride but i see your point they hurried forward to the control car there were only three men in the cabin one man stood in front of a spoked wheel at the forward end of the car another manned a similar wheel on the port side a third who seemed to be in command was directing them he went for a pistol in his belt when he saw austin and zavala enter the cabin austin was in no mood for fooling around he stuck the swords razorsharp blade under the commanders adams apple and said where are the others fear replaced the hatred in the mans dark eyes theyre manning mooring lines for the landing while zavala kept him covered austin lowered the sword and went over to one of the gondola windows lines dangled from a dozen points along the length of the great zeppelin the zeppelins lights illuminated the upturned faces of the men who waited below to grab the lines and pull the airship down to a mooring tower he turned and ordered the commander to take his men and leave the control car then he locked the door behind them what do you think he said to zavala can you fly this an tique zavala nodded its like a big ship the wheel up front is the rud der control the one on the side controls the elevators id better take that it might require a gentle hand austin stepped over to the rudder wheel the zeppelin was angled forward giving him a clear view of the scene below some of the mooring lines were in the hands of the ground crew he took a deep breath and turned to zavala lets fly zavala turned the elevator wheel but the zeppelin refused to rise austin cranked the engine controls over to half speed ahead the air ship began to move forward but the mooring lines were holding it down we need more lift zavala said what if we dump some weight that might work austin scanned the control panel until he found what he was look ing for hold on he said he punched the button there was a gushing noise as the fish tanks emptied hundreds of wriggling fish and thousands of gallons of water poured out of the chutes under the airship and rained down on the men below the ground crew scattered releasing the moor ing lines those men who didnt let go found themselves lifted in the air when the airship rose suddenly with the loss of ballast then they too dropped off the zeppelin moved forward and up until it was in the clear austin found that the rudder controls as zavala said were not un like those used to steer a ship there was a delay before the great mass above their heads responded to the turn of the wheel austin steered the zeppelin out to sea in the golden sparkle cast by the dawning sun he could see the silhouette of a boat a few miles offshore then he was distracted by a loud banging on the controlcabin door he yelled over his shoulder i think weve worn out our wel come joe i wasnt aware wed ever had a welcome but i wont argue with you austin steered toward the boat and when they were closer he brought the engine speed down to slow zavala turned the elevator wheel so that the zeppelin would move up then they climbed through the windows and grabbed a couple of mooring lines austin had some trouble holding on because of his latest wound but he was able to wrap his legs around the rope and control his descent fairly well they started to rappel to the sea as the zeppelin began to regain altitude paul had been standing watch a few minutes earlier when he heard the unmistakable sound of big engines something was going on in the air over the oceanus facility a minute before beams of light had stabbed the sky he saw a huge shadow then lights were bounc ing off the metallic skin of the airship the airship turned seaward gradually moving lower as it approached the boat he awakened gamay and asked her to alert the rest of the crew he was afraid oceanus might have called in aerial support the sleepyeyed captain was on deck a moment later whats going on he said paul pointed at the approaching zeppelin which glowed as if it were on fire from the golden rays of the new sun wed better get moving i dont know whether thats a friend or enemy the captain was fully awake now he ran for the bridge professor throckmorton was on deck as well dear god the professor said thats the biggest thing ive ever seen the engines growled and the boat began to move they watched nervously as the airship cut the distance between them it was mov ing erratically left and right then its nose would go high and low but one thing was clear it was coming right at them it was so low now that the lines dangling from below touched the waves gamay had been focused on the control cabin she saw heads ap pear in the windows then two men climbed out and slid down the ropes she pointed them out to paul and a broad grin crossed his face the captain had returned to the deck paul told him to bring the boat to a stop but theyll catch us exactly right captain exactly right mumbling to himself the captain raced back to the bridge paul and gamay grabbed some crew members and readied the vessels inflatable outboard boat the engines cut to an idle and the boat plowed to a halt as the zeppelins gigantic silhouette filled the sky as the airship came abeam the figures hanging from the lines dropped into the sea with two great splashes the inflatable came alongside the heads bobbing in the waves paul and gamay pulled zavala and austin aboard nice of you to drop in paul said nice of you to pick us up austin said even as he grinned with pleasure austin was keeping an eye on the zeppelin to his relief after the airship leveled out it steered on a course away from the ship barkers men must have broken back into the control car they would have made short work of the boat and everyone on it with their automatic weapons but the kiolya were headless now without toonook their great leader within minutes friendly hands were helping austin and the oth ers back onto the research vessel austin and zavala were taken below and provided with dry clothes gamay did a professional job patching up austins latest wound with bandages the injury might require a few stitches but it looked worse than it was on the plus side austin consoled himself he would have matching scars on ei ther side of his rib cage he and zavala were sitting in the galley with the trouts enjoying strong coffee and the warmth from the stove when the cook a newfoundlander asked if they wanted breakfast austin realized they hadnt eaten since the jerky they had had the previous day from the look in zavalas eyes he was equally hungry anything you can rustle up austin said just make sure theres a lot of it i can give you fish cakes and eggs the cook said fish cakes zavala said sure its a newfie specialty austin and zavala exchanged glances no thanks they said bear came through as promised therri had called the bush pilot on the radio told him she needed to evacuate nearly fifty people and pleaded for his help ask ing no questions bear had rallied every bush pilot within a hundred mile radius floatplanes streamed in from every direction to airlift the passengers from the shore of the lake the sick and elderly went on first then the young therri stood on the beach feeling a mix ture of relief and sadness and waved goodbye to her new friend rachael ryans bloody badge of courage qualified him for a ride on one of the first planes out with his shoulder wound patched up to stem the bleeding and prevent infection he and the others were taken to a small but wellequipped provincial hospital the aguirrez brothers arranged their own transportation calling in the eurocopter to fly them back to the yacht with the news of their loss before they left ben and some of the younger men in the tribe went back across the lake to see what was left of barkers complex on their return they reported that nothing remained when therri asked about the fate of the monster fish she had seen ben simply smiled and said barbecued therri ben and mercer were among the last to leave this time the fuzzy dice in bears cockpit were reassuring as the floatplane wheeled over the vast forest she looked down at the huge blackened area around the devastated site of barkers incredible building looks like we had a little forest fire down there bear yelled over the drone of the engine you folks know anything about that someone must have been careless with a match mercer said seeing the skeptical expression in bears eyes mercer grinned and said when we get back ill tell you the whole story over a beer it actually took quite a few beers austin and zavala in the meantime enjoyed their reunion with the trouts and the leisurely cruise back to port on throckmortons re search vessel throckmorton was still in a state of shock at the reve lation of barkers mad scheme and he promised to testify before senator grahams congressional committee once he had filled in parliament about the dangers of genetically modified fish back in washington austin met with sandecker to fill him in on the mission the admiral listened to the story of barkers demise with rapt attention but he saved most of his fascination for duren dal he held the sword gingerly in his hands unlike many men of the sea sandecker was not superstitious so austin hiked an eyebrow when the admiral gazed at the shimmer ing blade and murmured this weapon is haunted kurt it seems to have a life of its own i had the same feeling austin said when i first picked it up an electric current seemed to flow from the hilt into my arm sandecker blinked as if he were coming out of a spell and slid the sword back into its scabbard superstitious rubbish of course of course what do you suggest we do with it theres no question in my mind we return it to its last rightful owner roland is dead and if the mummy i saw is diegos he wont be putting any claims on durendal any time soon let me think about it do you mind if i borrow the sword in the meantime not at all although i could use it to cut through the mounds of paperwork sandecker lit his cigar and tossed the match into his fireplace flashing his familiar crocodile grin he said ive always found fire to be much more effective in dealing with the effluent of our federal bureaucracy sandeckers summons came a couple of days later the admirals voice crackled over the phone kurt if you have a minute could you please come up to my office round up joe too there are some peo ple here who want to see you austin tracked down zavala in the deepsubmergence design lab and gave him sandeckers message they arrived outside the admi rals office at the same time the receptionist smiled and waved them through sandecker greeted them at the door and ushered them into the nerve center ofnuma kurt joe good of you to come he said effusively taking them by the arm austin smiled at sandeckers disingenuous welcome one had lit tie choice when sandecker called those who arrived late or not at all suffered the full weight of the admirals wrath standing behind sandecker were balthazar aguirrez and his two sons balthazar roared with pleasure when he saw austin he pumped austins hand and then zavalas in his lobster grip i asked mr aguirrez and his sons to stop by so we could thank them for helping us in canada sandecker said ive been telling them about your mission we couldnt have done it without your help austin said sorry for the loss of your pilots and helicopter and for pablos injury aguirrez waved his hand in dismissal thank you my friend the helicopter was only a machine and can easily be replaced as you can see my sons wound is healing nicely the death of the pilots was a shame but like all the men on my boat they were highly paid mer cenaries and well aware of the dangers of their chosen profession nonetheless a tragic loss agreed im pleased with the success of your mission but do you have any news of the sword and the horn it seems your relics had a long and arduous journey sandecker said with the help of the log kurt discovered in barkers macabre museum weve been able to piece the story together your ancestor diego sailed across the atlantic from the faroe islands but he never reached land he and his crew died most likely from disease the ship drifted into the polar ice the zeppelin discovered the caravel hundreds of years later after a secret flight to the north pole and removed the body of your ancestor mechanical problems forced the airship down on the ice the kiolya found it and re moved the bodies of diego and the zeppelins captain heinrich braun kurt has told me this story aguirrez said impatiently but what of the relics sandecker said gentlemen im being rude please sit down i think its time for some brandy the admiral waved his guests to the comfortable leather chairs in front of his massive desk and went over to a bar hidden behind a wall panel he brought back a bottle of b and b and poured each man a snifter of brandy he stuck his nose in the widemouthed glass closed his eyes and took a deep breath then he unlocked his hu midor and produced a handful of his specially rolled cigars he passed the cigars around and patted the breast pocket of his navy blazer i seem to have lost my cigar clipper you gentlemen dont hap pen to have a knife never mind he reached into the chair well of his desk pulled out a scabbard and laid it on the desk perhaps this will do balthazars dark eyes widened in disbelief he rose from his chair and reached out for the scabbard cradling it with both hands as if it were made of glass with shaking fingers he slid the sword from the scabbard and held it high above his head as if he were rallying charlemagnes legions to battle his lips formed a single whispered word durendal the horn will arrive in a few days along with the remains of your ancestor sandecker said i thought you might be able to put these priceless relics together with their rightful owner balthazar slid the sword back into the scabbard and passed it on to his sons the rightful owners are the basque people i will use the sword and horn of roland to ensure that the basques finally attain their sov ereignty he smiled but in a peaceful manner the glee at the success of his theatrical gesture was evident in sandeckers clear blue eyes he raised his glass high lets drink to that he said ryan called austin later that day and said he was back in washing ton he asked austin to meet him at the usual place austin arrived at roosevelt island a few minutes early and was waiting in front of the statue when he saw ryan coming his way austin noticed that ryan was still pale and gaunt from his wound there was something else the arrogant tilt of the chin and the boyish knowitall grin that had flawed ryans good looks and irritated austin were gone ryan seemed more serious and mature he smiled and extended his hand thanks for coming kurt how do you feel like ive been used for target practice i wish i could say you get used to it austin said recalling the bullet and knife scars that marked his own body knowing that you drove a spike into barkers plans must help ease the pain congrat ulations couldnt have done it without the help of ben and chuck and diego aguirrez dont be modest youre the one whos being modest i heard about your adventures aboard the zeppelin i hope this isnt turning into a mutual admiration society austin said i wouldnt want to ruin a wonderful relationship ryan laughed i asked you here so i could apologize i know ive been more than a little overbearing and selfrighteous happens to the best of us theres something else i tried to use therri to leverage your help i know i also know that therri is too independentminded to be used i had to apologize anyhow before i leave you sound as if youre heading off into the sunset like shane no im not quite ready for that im off to bali in a few days to see if sos can stop the illegal trade in sea turtles then ive got to help with a sea lion rescue in south africa and see what we can do about poaching in the galapagos marine reserve in be tween ill be raising funds to replace the sentinel an ambitious schedule good luck ill need it ryan checked his watch sorry to run but ive got to line up the troops they walked back to the parking lot where they shook hands once more i understand youre seeing therri later this week were having dinner as soon as we crawl out from our office work i promise not to interrupt you the way i did back in copen hagen dont worry austin said he glanced at the sky a mysterious smile on his lips where im taking therri for dinner this time no one will interrupt us may i pour you more champagne mademoiselle the waiter said thank you therri said with a smile id like that the waiter refilled the fine crystal champagne glass and gave the bottle of moot a professional twist then with a click of his heels he walked back to his station ready to be summoned with the slightest hike of an eyebrow he was impeccably dressed his black hair was slicked back with shiny pomade and a pencilthin mustache adorned his upper lip he possessed the perfect attitude a bored detachment combined with undivided attention hes wonderful therri whispered where did you get him straight from the orient express austin said seeing the doubt in therris face he added i confess i borrowed him from numa food services he worked as a mattre d at la tour dargent in paris before sandecker hired him away to organize the numa dining room hes done an outstanding job organizing our dinner she said they were sitting at a table for two the tablecloth was white starched linen the dishes and silverware were art deco dress was formal therri wore a knockout strapless black evening dress and austin had replaced the tux hed ruined in the washington dogsled race she nodded in the direction of a string quartet that was play ing mozart in the background i suppose the musicians are from the national symphony orchestra austins mouth widened in a sheepish grin theyre friends from the numa engineering division who get together on weekends quite good arent they yes and so was dinner i dont know who your chef was but she paused catching the look in austins eye dont tell me the chef was numa too no hes a friend of mine st julien perlmutter he insisted on cooking for us tonight ill introduce you later she sipped her champagne and her mood grew somber im sorry but i cant help thinking from time to time of dr barker and the monstrous creatures he created it seems like a nightmare i wish it were a bad dream barker and his pals were very real so were his frankenfish what a strange terrible man he was i suppose well never know how someone so brilliant could become so evil all the more amazing when you consider that his ancestor from all accounts was a decent human being the original frederick barker saw that the eskimos were starving and tried to stop his fel low whaling captains from killing walrus his genes must have been twisted during their passage from gen eration to generation she said add a little god syndrome into the genetic stew and you get a mad scientist who fancies himself the personification of an evil spirit its ironic isnt it she said after a moments thought barker was a product of genes gone wrong it was precisely the process he used in his laboratory to create monsters from normally docile fish i shudder every time i think of those poor deformed creatures an anxious look came to her eyes this is the end of that insane re search isnt it austin nodded barker was a true genius he wrote nothing down he kept the notes for his genetic tinkering stored in his head that knowledge died with him still it wouldnt prevent someone else equally as brilliant from duplicating his work no but the loopholes in the law will soon be closed biofish will not be allowed into the us the europeans are equally determined that frankenfish and chips will never be on their menu without a market theres no incentive what about the others in the kiolya tribe arrested dead or on the run without barker to whip them into a murderous frenzy id say its the end of that bunch as a threat barkers holdings are up for grabs the wolves are tearing his giant corporation to pieces now let me ask you a question whats the fu ture hold for you and sos were parting ways ive decided that commando raids arent my style ive been offered a staff position as environmental counsel with senator graham glad to hear youll be around the waiter carried a black telephone over to the table mr zavala would like to talk to you he said joes voice came on the line sorry to interrupt dinner i thought you should know that were going to start to make the approach soon thanks for the headsup how long do we have enough for one very long dance austin smiled and hung up that was joe calling from the con trol car well be landing soon therri stared out the large observation window at the tapestry of lights far below its beautiful ill never forget this night but please tell me how you wrangled the use of the zeppelin for a dinner date i had to pull a few strings the germans are anxious to reclaim the first airship to have landed on the north pole when i heard the zeppelin was being flown from canada to washington i offered the services of an experienced pilot and in return reserved the din ing room for a few hours it seemed the only way we could have din ner undisturbed he looked at his watch the pilot says we have time for one dance id love to they rose from the table and austin offered his arm and they strolled into the dimly lit lounge austin turned on a record player and the mellow tunes of the glenn miller band flowed from the speaker thought we should have a little period music therri was staring out the observation window at the lights of the great east coast megalopolis she turned and said thank you for an exceptional evening its not over yet after we land we can have a nightcap at my place who knows where the evening will lead oh i know exactly where it will lead she said with a dreamy smile he took her in his arms inhaling the scent of her perfume and high above the earth they danced among the stars the end
